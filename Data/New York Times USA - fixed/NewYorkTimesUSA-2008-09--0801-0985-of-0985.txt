HEADLINE: Court Considers New Trial for Former Chief of Qwest

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court heard oral arguments on Thursday about whether Joseph P. Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International, should receive a new trial in an insider-trading case. 
 The hearing before the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit was the latest chapter in a meandering legal tale that has already featured a conviction of Mr. Nacchio on 19 counts of insider trading after a monthlong trial in 2007. 
 Prosecutors contended that Mr. Nacchio had concealed the mounting financial troubles of Qwest, a telephone service provider in 14 Western and Midwestern states, while simultaneously selling millions of dollars in stock. Mr. Nacchio said he had sold the stock only because the options were scheduled to expire. 
 This year, a panel of three appeals court judges ruled 2 to 1 that Mr. Nacchio deserved a new trial on the grounds that the judge in the case, Edward W. Nottingham, had improperly excluded an expert defense witness. That ruling prompted federal prosecutors to request that the entire 10th Circuit appeals court hear the case, which resulted in the hearing on Thursday. 
 Given 15 minutes each to present their arguments, lawyers for Mr. Nacchio and the government debated Judge Nottingham's decision to exclude the witness, Daniel Fischel, a corporate finance expert, who was expected to testify that Mr. Nacchio's pattern of stock sales had not appeared to rely on insider information obtained as Qwest's chief executive. 
 Maureen Mahoney, a lawyer for Mr. Nacchio, argued that Judge Nottingham should not have excluded Mr. Fischel's testimony. The judge had held that the defense never sufficiently disclosed Mr. Fischel's methodology and that his testimony could hold sway over the jury. Moreover, Ms. Mahoney said the defense had been surprised by Judge Nottingham's barring of the witness and had lacked the time to seek a hearing on the matter. 
 Edwin S. Kneedler, deputy solicitor general for the Justice Department, countered that it was up to defense lawyers to request a hearing after Judge Nottingham issued his ruling if indeed they thought Mr. Fischel was so critical to Mr. Nacchio's case. 
 The nine judges in attendance -- three recused themselves because of conflicts -- fired a near constant broadside of questions at both sides, with special emphasis on Ms. Mahoney.
 Some judges appeared to feel strongly that it had been incumbent upon Mr. Nacchio's lawyers to compel Judge Nottingham to allow Mr. Fischel to testify. 
 ''Your whole framework is that the court had an obligation to do something, when it was you and Mr. Nacchio who had an obligation to get the witness to the stand,'' said Judge Jerome A. Holmes, addressing Ms. Mahoney.
 Ms. Mahoney continued to argue that amid the frantic nature of the trial, during which many motions were filed and countless deadlines imposed, there was no time to request a hearing on Mr. Fischel's testimony, to which Judge Mary Beck Briscoe quipped, referring to Mr. Nacchio: ''Ask for a continuance. He's a frequent flier. He can come back.'' 
 Other judges, however, clearly sided with Ms. Mahoney and wondered aloud whether Judge Nottingham's decision to exclude Mr. Fischel's testimony was too severe. 
 ''Isn't the sanction over the top?'' questioned Chief Justice Robert H. Henry. ''Why is total exclusion what we should do here?'' 
 Judge Michael W. McConnell added: ''This suggests to me that the district judge has such a low opinion of economic expertise that he doesn't think there should be such expertise at a trial like this.'' 
 After less than an hour, the appeals court went into recess. 
 Mr. Nacchio, who was sentenced by Judge Nottingham to six years in prison and ordered to pay a fine of $19 million and forfeit $52 million in stock sales, remains free on bail. He did not attend the hearing.

 ANN ARBOR FILM FESTIVAL PROGRAM (Wednesday) The Ann Arbor Film Festival is one of the oldest and most prestigious showcases for avant-garde work in the known world. This year's touring edition includes new work by Michael Langan, Daniel Robin, Osbert Parker, Richie Sherman, Ben Peters, Catherine Chalmers, Georg Koszulinski, Devin Bell, Leighton Pierce, Jean Gabriel Periot, Josh Raskin and May Lin Au Yung. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Dave Kehr) 
 NATHANIEL DORSKY -- SELECTED FILMS (Thursday) One of our leading avant-garde filmmakers, Mr. Dorsky will be present for three retrospective screenings of his intensely observed, Buddhist-influenced work, beginning on Thursday with three early films: ''Ingreen'' (1964), ''Pneuma'' (1977-83) and ''Triste'' (1974-1996). Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $8. (Kehr) 
 'FROWNLAND' (Thursday) Ronald Bronstein's critically admired study in outer-borough anguish, about a door-to-door coupon peddler (Dore Mann) leading a lonely, desperate existence in a Brooklyn tenement, returns for a special screening in the director's presence. ''An up-close, painfully intimate portrait of a hapless, manipulative schlub,'' wrote Manohla Dargis in The New York Times. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)
 'ALEXANDER NEVSKY' (Friday through Thursday) Sergei Eisenstein saved himself from Stalinist charges of formalism and temporarily returned to the good graces of Uncle Joe (who awarded him with the Order of Lenin) through this stirring historical epic about the 13th-century Russian prince who defeated the nefarious Teutonic armies -- thinly disguised stand-ins for Hitler and his surging war machine. Working in close collaboration with the composer Sergei Prokofiev, Eisenstein created a brilliantly manipulative spectacle that sweeps the viewer up with its rhythmic intensity and geometrically composed images. The celebrated ''Battle on the Ice'' sequence has left a lasting influence, from ''The Seven Samurai'' to ''Star Wars.'' Presented in a new 35-millimeter print. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $11. (Kehr)
 PAUL SCHRADER'S PERSONAL CHOICE (Sunday) A continuing series at Symphony Space pairs films from the provocative oeuvre of the writer-director Paul Schrader with some of Mr. Schrader's favorite films. This Sunday brings two movies about father-daughter relations: Yasujiro Ozu's sublime ''Autumn Afternoon'' (1962), in which a widower (Chishu Ryu) tries to encourage his adult daughter to find a life of her own, and Mr. Schrader's 1979 ''Hardcore,'' about a Midwestern businessman (George C. Scott) who goes in search of his runaway daughter in the X-rated underground of Los Angeles. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $11. (Kehr)
 MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'APPALOOSA' (R, 1:47) Ed Harris, who directed, stars with Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger and Jeremy Irons in this sly, relaxed western, which is less concerned with gunfighting and law and order than with jealousy, friendship and the perils of frontier romance. It's a somber shoot-em-up with the mischievous soul of a sex comedy. (A. O. Scott) 
 'BABYLON A.D.' (PG-13, 1:30) Mathieu Kassovitz, the director of this futuristic action movie, has described it as ''pure violence and stupidity,'' but that makes it sound better than it is. (Scott)
 'BANGKOK DANGEROUS' (R, 1:40) Knotting his brow and collecting a paycheck, Nicolas Cage stars as Joe, an ambivalent assassin moping around Thailand, in this boring, shoddy, racist thriller. Directed in dull, murky spasms by Danny and Oxide Pang, the movie is a remake of their own 1999 picture of the same title. (Nathan Lee)
 'BATTLE IN SEATTLE' (R, 1:38) A visceral fictional account of the 1999 demonstrations in Seattle against the World Trade Organization, ''Battle in Seattle'' repeatedly plunges you into the melee of peaceful protest gone awry. But its characters are rhetorical mouthpieces, and its subplots manipulative. (Stephen Holden)
 'BURN AFTER READING' (R, 1:36) A predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen with a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8. With George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. (Manohla Dargis) 
 'THE DARK KNIGHT' (PG-13, 2:32) Pitched at the divide between poetry and entertainment, Christopher Nolan's follow-up to ''Batman Begins'' goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind. With Christian Bale as the big bat and a spellbinding Heath Ledger as the smiler with the knives. (Dargis)
 'DEATH RACE' (R, 1:29) Finally, neo-grindhouse done right. Weapon-toting, obscenity-spewing criminals chase one another around a greasy junkyard in a monster car race to the flamboyantly nasty death. Co-starring Joan Allen! (Lee)
 'DISASTER MOVIE' (PG-13, 1:30) The latest disposable parody of disposable Hollywood movies has a shelf life of about five minutes, tops, which may be slightly longer than it took to come up with most of its gags. (Lee)
 'THE DUCHESS' (PG-13, 1:45) An overstuffed, underbaked portrait of the cosseted, tightly corseted late-18th-century life of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire. Saul Dibbs directs, Keira Knightley stars, and Ralph Fiennes acts. (Dargis)
 'ELEGY' (R, 1:48) Ben Kingsley and a radiant Penelope Cruz star in Isabel Coixet's polite take on Philip Roth's insistently impolite short novel ''The Dying Animal.'' (Dargis)
 'ELITE SQUAD' (No rating, 1:55, in Portuguese) A relentlessly ugly, unpleasant, often incoherent assault on the senses from Brazil about cops and thugs that wants to have its grinding violence and sanctimony too. The director is the promising Jose Padilha, bellyflopping into fiction after the powerful documentary ''Bus 174.'' (Dargis)
 'FLOW' (No rating, 1:24) Irena Salina's astonishingly wide-ranging documentary dives into our planet's most essential resource to find pollution, scarcity, human suffering and corporate profit. From the dubious quality of America's drinking water to worldwide battles against privatization, the movie is a galvanizing examination of the tug of war between public health and private interests. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'FLY ME TO THE MOON' (G, 1:30) Three flies stow away on Apollo 11 in this animated feature created start to finish expressly for 3-D. But not, alas, for pleasure or art. (Lee)
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. (Holden)
 'GHOST TOWN' (PG-13, 1:43) A misanthropic dentist (Ricky Gervais), a roguish ghost (Tea Leoni) and a zany Egyptologist (Greg Kinnear): as this unlikely threesome scamper around Manhattan in this fluffy latter-day hybrid of ''Topper'' and ''Blithe Spirit,'' they resurrect the spirits of classic '30s screwball characters in Woody Allen territory. (Holden)
 'A GIRL CUT IN TWO' (No rating, 1:50, in French) A rich, textured divertissement from Claude Chabrol, a sinister master of the art, who here returns to elegant, tight form with a beautifully directed story of a woman (Ludivine Sagnier) preyed upon by different men (Francois Berleand, Benoit Magimel) and her own warring desires. (Dargis)
 'GREETINGS FROM THE SHORE' (R, 1:56) Some of the actors, notably Paul Sorvino, are better than others in this delicate summer-at-the-beach tale set in New Jersey. A teenager named Jenny (Kim Shaw) gets a job teaching English to some mysterious foreigners who work at a yacht club. Love is in the air, and a high-stakes poker game is in the offing. Mr. Sorvino is admirable as a fisherman who befriends Jenny, but some other supporting roles are rendered as thudding cliches. (Neil Genzlinger)
 'HAMLET 2' (R, 1:32) This comedy about a high school drama teacher in Tucson belongs to the school of free-for-all satiric farce whose creators ball up wads of ideas, apply chewing gum and hurl them against the wall to see what sticks. Enough of the jokes cling to make the movie intermittently funny. (Holden)
 'HOUNDDOG' (R, 1:33) Set in rural Alabama in the 1950s, this overripe tale of innocence lost follows an Elvis-loving preteen (Dakota Fanning) as she dodges an abusive daddy (David Morse) and a narrative that's all symbol and no substance. Notwithstanding the scandalized sound bites that accompanied its unveiling at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, this sluggish dawdle from shack to swimmin' hole never comes close to being salacious. It's much too busy promoting the curative role of the blues and the strictly supportive role of African-Americans. (Catsoulis) 
 'THE HOUSE BUNNY' (PG-13, 1:37) Anna Faris proves herself a fake bimbo par excellence in this breezy, ditzy comedy about a Playboy bunny who goes back to school. (Nathan Lee)
 'IGOR' (PG, 1:26) An animated twist on the Frankenstein story that never sparks to life, ''Igor'' inhabits a cloud-covered kingdom where evil scientists are rewarded for diabolical inventions. John Cusack competently voices the hunchbacked servant who assembles a female monster, but kiddies will be undiverted by the humdrum animation and a palette that mirrors the film's moral and meteorological gloom. (Catsoulis)
 'I SERVED THE KING OF ENGLAND' (R, 1:58, in Czech) There is hardly a moment in this picaresque slapstick epic, directed by Jiri Menzel (''Closely Watched Trains'') and set mainly in 1930s and '40s Czechoslovakia that you are not aware that its absurdist view of the human condition was shaped by traumatic 20th-century events. (Holden)
 'LAKEVIEW TERRACE' (PG-13, 1:46) In this silly exercise in mock provocation, Samuel L. Jackson plays a Los Angeles police officer who terrorizes his new neighbors, a perfectly nice interracial couple played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. (Scott) 
 'LOINS OF PUNJAB PRESENTS' (No rating, 1:28) This winning, witty musical comedy about an ''American Idol''-style competition with Bollywood songs and South Asian immigrant contestants joins showtime antics to sociocultural commentary without reducing its characters to cartoons. (Lee) 
 'MAMMA MIA!' (PG-13, 1:48) Adapted from the stage musical and featuring a cast of super troupers belting out Abba hits, this movie is hard not to enjoy, which doesn't mean it's any good. (Scott) 
 'THE MAN FROM LONDON' (No rating, 2:12, in French and English) Bela Tarr, the celebrated Hungarian master of lugubrious, ostentatiously gorgeous allegories, brings his heavy hand and virtuoso eye to this adaptation of a Georges Simenon novel. (Lee) 
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MIRRORS' (R, 1:51) This minor chiller from Alexandre Aja features Kiefer Sutherland as an alcoholic ex-cop guarding the ruins of a burned-out department store whose spooky mirrors manipulate his reflection -- rather horribly, as it turns out. Though he offers several cringeworthy set pieces, Mr. Aja blows his entire Windex budget on an overcomplicated second half of amplified effects and diminishing returns. (Catsoulis) 
 'MY BEST FRIEND'S GIRL' (R, 1:43) Kate Hudson's latest star vehicle is an uncharacteristically racy comedy in which she breaks it off with a legal associate (Jason Biggs). He then turns to his exceedingly crude roommate (Dane Cook), who makes extra cash taking girls on the worst dates of their lives to prompt them to race back to their exes. Guess whom she ends up falling for? (Laura Kern)
 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' (R, 1:51) In the tradition of Cheech & Chong, Abbott and Costello, Hope and Crosby, Ricky and Lucy, Martin and Lewis, Rowan and Martin, Spicoli and Hand, Riggs and Murtaugh, dumb and dumber, right brain and left, peanut butter and jelly, bong hit and roach clip comes a stoner comedy that partakes of a gentle indie vibe before hitting the hard stuff. David Gordon Green directs; Seth Rogen and James Franco star. (Dargis)
 'THE POOL' (No rating, 1:35, in English and Hindi) This calm, neo-realist film, directed and photographed by the documentarian Chris Smith, blurs the line between fiction and reality as it observes the struggles of an 18-year-old waif in contemporary Goa whose dreams of a better life are symbolized by a rich man's swimming pool. (Holden)
 'RIGHTEOUS KILL' (R, 1:40) Robert De Niro and Al Pacino go macho-a-macho in a thrill-free B-movie thriller (more like C-minus) that probably sounded like a grand idea when their handlers whispered it in their ears. Jon Avnet directed. (Dargis) 
 'A SECRET' (No rating, 1:45, in French) Claude Miller's adaptation of Philippe Grimbert's autobiographical novel is a subtle and moving exploration of intimacy and desire in a French Jewish family before and after World War II. (Scott)
 'STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS' (PG, 1:35) As a mechanical thrill ride, this digitally animated ''Star Wars'' saga is more or less as satisfying its blockbuster predecessors. As a movie, it completes the franchise's slow divorce from photography-based cinema as well as any relationship to credible human feeling. (Lee)
 'TELL NO ONE' (No rating, 2:05, in French) In the shortcut language of a movie pitch, Guillaume Canet's delicious contemporary thriller is ''Vertigo'' meets ''The Fugitive'' by way of ''The Big Sleep.'' This French adaptation of Harlan Coben's 2001 best seller (same name) is the kind of conspiracy-minded mystery almost no one seems capable of creating anymore, except David Lynch in his surreal way. Beautifully written and acted, it is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost. (Holden)
 'A THOUSAND YEARS OF GOOD PRAYERS' (No rating, 1:23, in Mandarin, English and Farsi) This modest, middlebrow drama from the director Wayne Wang is a pleasantly unrushed study of the ties that bind a Chinese father to his American daughter, and the spaces -- emotional and cultural -- that keep them apart. (Lee)
 'TOWELHEAD' (R, 1:56) This provocative satire of a culture that is paradoxically hypersexual and puritanical is set during the first gulf war in a spanking-new upscale housing development on the outskirts of Houston. In its preoccupations, this crude but scathing portrait of suburban life might be described as ''Son of 'American Beauty.' '' (Holden)
 'TRAITOR' (PG-13, 1:50) Don Cheadle plays Samir Horn, a half-Sudanese, half-American soldier in the war on terror. Which side is he on? The answer turns out to be both obvious and a little preposterous, but Mr. Cheadle's performance is a fine study in ambiguity and doubt, and the director, Jeffrey Nachmanoff, sustains a mood of anxiety that makes the picture absorbing even when it's not quite believable. (Scott) 
 'TRANSSIBERIAN' (R, 1:50) This handsomely remodeled variation on a cherished genre you might call the mystery-train movie skillfully manipulates familiar tropes: innocents abroad; ominous, glowering foreigners; conspiracy and duplicity; erotic intrigue. Until it fizzles in an anticlimactic train crash, it is extremely entertaining. (Holden)
 'TROPIC THUNDER' (R, 1:47) A flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry, directed by Ben Stiller, who stars alongside Robert Downey Jr. (in blackface) and Jack Black (in itty- bitty bikini underwear). (Dargis)
 'TROUBLE THE WATER' (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis) 
 'TYLER PERRY'S THE FAMILY THAT PREYS' (PG-13, 1:51) The suds that cascade through Tyler Perry melodrama more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like ''Dallas,'' ''Dynasty'' and their offspring. (Holden)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
 'VIRTUAL JFK: VIETNAM IF KENNEDY HAD LIVED' (No rating, 1:20) The title of Koji Masutani's speculative, provocative, finally unpersuasive historical gloss pretty much says it all, though the documentary itself says not nearly enough. (Dargis)
 'THE WACKNESS' (R, 1:35) A young man's coming-of-age as per the dictionary in Manhattan in the summer of 1994. Some nice oddball touches -- notably Ben Kingsley playing a pothead psychiatrist -- but nothing terribly original. (Scott) 
 'WALL-E' (G, 1:37) The latest Pixar movie is many things: a silent comedy, a robot love story, a cautionary science fiction parable. Also a masterpiece. (Scott)
 'THE WOMEN' (PG-13, 1:54) ''What is this, some '30s movie?'' a character asks in this misbegotten remake of George Cukor's feline look at female friendship and rivalry. If only. (Scott)

HEADLINE: As Stocks Rally, Credit Markets Appear Frozen

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Barboza contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Washington dickered, Wall Street waited.
Nervous investors stayed on the sidelines on Thursday, awaiting signs of progress on the government's bailout. While stocks rose, the anxiety gripping the credit markets barely abated.
Banks continued to hoard cash, clogging crucial financial arteries that deliver money to businesses and consumers for car loans, credit cards and payroll payments.
Investors appeared to be taking a defensive posture as they waited for lawmakers in Washington to determine the final structure of the government's plan. Interest rates on short-term loans jumped back toward the record levels seen at the end of last week, although the yields on Treasury bills slightly rose. 
''These moves are having extraordinary negative impacts on the brick-and-mortar level of the U.S. economy,'' said T. J. Marta, a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada. ''We're not talking about highfalutin, fat-cat Wall Streeters. This is whether or not your local hospital gets the new wing put on.''
While swings in the stock market can affect Americans' investments and mutual funds, the credit market is considered the front line of the day-to-day functioning of the economy. Businesses depend on short-term loans to pay for basic costs like electric utilities and employee salaries.
''This is the engine room of the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Marta said. ''It's not very sexy, it's kind of esoteric, nobody ever pays attention to it, but that's what's breaking.''
On Thursday, this was the type of critical short-term financing -- including markets for commercial paper, municipal bonds and overnight bank loans -- that was gumming up.
Banks, apparently stocking up amid the worst financial crisis in decades, were reluctant to lend cash, sending interest rates soaring.
The three-month Libor rate, a benchmark gauge that measures how much banks charge one another for overnight loans, jumped the most in one day in nearly a decade, reaching 3.77 percent.
The TED spread, which tracks the difference between how much banks pay for a three-month loan versus the Treasury, has tripled this month, and widened again on Thursday to a near-record high.
''There continues to be extraordinary hoarding of cash,'' Mr. Marta said. ''There are still a lot of things broken in the markets.''
Investors did seem slightly more confident about moving their money out of ultra-safe short-term Treasury notes; for days, they had been willing to accept minuscule returns in exchange for a safer bet than stocks or corporate bonds.
On Thursday, the yield on the two-year Treasury note rose to 2.19 percent, up 0.22 percent. The yield on the one-month Treasury bill rose to 0.1 percent, although this remained near last week's lows. Fear was much less pronounced in the stock market, where investors seemed to place their bets with an eye toward the imminent passage of the bailout plan.
The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average, which measures stock prices of 30 companies, rose nearly 200 points to close at 11,022.06. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.4 percent.
Shares of Goldman Sachs gained 1.9 percent; Morgan Stanley was up 9.3 percent. The cost to insure both companies' debt declined, although the cost for Morgan Stanley remained near the highs of last week.
The stock market made gains despite three grim government reports on the economy. Orders for big-ticket manufactured goods fell 4.5 percent in August, a sign that businesses were reluctant to make major investments, and the Labor Department said the number of new applications for jobless benefits rose by 32,000 last week to a seven-year high.
Sales of new homes fell again last month, even as prices continued to decline. Sales were off 11.5 percent from July, and median prices were 6.2 percent lower than a year ago.
Stocks also shook off a pessimistic report from the General Electric Corporation, which said on Thursday morning that it expected to earn less money this year than it had originally forecast. The company also froze its dividend payments and suspended a stock repurchasing program.
Markets in Europe ended higher after a quiet start. The FTSE 100 in London and the DAX index in Frankfurt each gained 2 percent; the CAC 40 in Paris ended 2.7 percent higher.
Following are the results of Thursday's auction of 34-day cash management bills and five-year notes:

PERSON: Joseph Shenker 

HEADLINE: Joseph Shenker, 68, a Pacesetter at CUNY

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Joseph Shenker, who as the first president of La Guardia Community College in New York was a leader in having students combine on-the-job experience with their studies, died on Saturday in Manhattan. He was 68. For the last 13 years he was provost of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University and lived near the campus in Brookville, N.Y. 
 The cause was complications of pulmonary fibrosis, said his wife, Susan Smyth Shenker.
 At the age of 29, Dr. Shenker became the youngest president of a college in the City University of New York system, and one of the youngest in the nation, when he was appointed interim president of Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn in 1969.
 The next year, The New York Times described how he had tried to enter a building at Kingsborough where students were registering for a new term but was stopped by a security guard who thought he was a student trying to cut in line. It took a few phone calls to verify that the young man with sideburns was, in fact, the college's acting president.
 Within a year, Dr. Shenker was named president of La Guardia, a newly created two-year college in an old factory in Long Island City, Queens. Under his guidance, La Guardia became the only college in the city to require its full-time students to hold jobs that blended with courses in their fields of interest. The policy, which gave students college credit for the jobs, is still in effect. 
 In his 18 years at La Guardia, Dr. Shenker saw the school's enrollment grow to 16,000 full- and part-time students from 500; started a program for deaf adults; and opened an on-campus high school for students identified as potential dropouts. 
 From 1988 until 1995, Dr. Shenker was president of the Bank Street College of Education in New York. In 1995, he became provost of C. W. Post. In his 13 years there, undergraduate enrollment rose to 5,400 from 4,450, spurred in part by an infusion of foreign students. Dr. Shenker oversaw more than $84 million in construction on campus.
 Born in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1939, Joseph Shenker was the only child of George and Isabel Schwartz Shenker. His father, an immigrant from Russia, owned a shoulder-pad factory; his mother was a bookkeeper.
 After graduating from Hunter College in 1962 with a bachelor's degree in psychology, Dr. Shenker received his master's degree in economics there in 1963. He received his doctorate in higher education administration from Columbia in 1969. By then he was an assistant to Albert H. Bowker, the chancellor of the City University at the time.
 Besides his wife, Dr. Shenker is survived by four children, Deborah Singer, Karyn, Sarah and Jordan; and three grandchildren. His first marriage, to Adrienne Greene, ended in divorce. 
 Last month, La Guardia renamed its main campus building Joseph Shenker Hall.

 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it. History, not buzz, is the subject, and a fascinating history it is, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America, to a video of Joseph Beuys sweeping the streets of Berlin clean of trash and ideology in the 1970s, to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. 
 (Holland Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PHOTOGRAPHY ON PHOTOGRAPHY: REFLECTIONS ON THE MEDIUM SINCE 1960,' through Oct. 19. This second installation in the Met's new modern photography galleries is much better than the first, largely because of its variety of works (by artists male and female, young and old, American and European, famous and fledgling). Thomas Ruff and Hiroshi Sugimoto are here, but so are Janice Guy, an artist turned dealer who is benefiting from a sudden interest in her early self-portraits, and Mark Wyse, a young photographer who is also active as a curator. The show is also an excellent epilogue to the historical survey ''Framing a Century: Master Photographers 1840-1940,'' just across the hall in the Howard Gilman Gallery. If ''Framing a Century'' presents a hallowed history of photography, ''Photography on Photography'' gleefully violates that sanctity. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Roberta Smith)THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KEHINDE WILEY, THE WORLD STAGE: AFRICA, LAGOS-DAKAR,' through Oct. 26. In 10 recent works Kehinde Wiley shifts the focus of his big, flashy pictures of young African-American men recast as the kings, dandies, and saints of European painting to young African men in the poses of African sculpture. The show (which really belongs in a commercial gallery) reveals a young artist who, despite several years of hotness, is only now beginning to make paintings that don't feel mostly like campy, gaudy illustrations. The compositions are calmer, the details less fussy, and the figures are painted with a new solidity and emotional directness. It makes a big difference. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PAUL MCCARTHY: CENTRAL SYMMETRICAL ROTATION MOVEMENT: THREE INSTALLATIONS, TWO FILMS,' through Oct. 12. Mr. McCarthy's fans are in for a shock. They will find almost nothing of what this Los Angeles master of transgressive provocation is famous for in this smart, tightly focused exhibition of works dating from 1966 to the present. No psychotic clowning, no pornographic vaudeville. Instead they will discover Mr. McCarthy's art stripped to its bare, abstract yet still metaphorically resonant essentials. The main attractions are two scarily mechanized rooms and a walk-in enclosure dizzyingly animated by feedback loops from four rotating video cameras. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Ken Johnson)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 JOHN ALTOON Mr. Altoon (1925-1969), who made his name in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and '60s and suffered a fatal heart attack shortly thereafter, is the latest West Coast artist to be exhumed by the contemporary market. In this exhibition of paintings and works on paper, organized by Klaus Kertess, Mr. Altoon's well-chronicled personal demons -- thrill seeking, womanizing, depression, paranoia -- are on full display. His drawings, in ink, watercolor, graphite and pastel on board, show men, women and animals engaged in explicitly violent and sexual interactions. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Rosenberg)
 Galleries: SoHo
 KATHLEEN HENDERSON: 'WHAT IF I COULD DRAW A BIRD THAT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD?' This beautiful and chilling show of oil stick drawings is like a fairy tale version of Abu Ghraib as drawn by Ben Shahn. Torture is in progress; Hitler tries his wings; men with bags for heads hunt animals but may be animals themselves; a fat bird flies by, trailing the words, ''If I could draw a bird that could change the world? In a good way, I mean. In a good way.'' The Drawing Center, the Drawing Room, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Oct. 9. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 VIK MUNIZ: 'VERSO' The old paintings leaning face-first against the gallery walls -- including Seurat's ''Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte'' and Picasso's ''Desmoiselles D'Avignon'' -- are, in fact, replicas created by Mr. Muniz with the assistance of craftsmen who faithfully reproduced the back sides of the originals. To meditate on these trompe l'oeil sculptures is to wonder about our habits of seeing and believing. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com, through Oct. 11. (Johnson)
 XU ZHEN, FOLKERT DE JONG, MARTHA COLBURN Three good solo shows in one. The Chinese conceptual artist Xu Zhen recreates the interior of a convenience store in Shanghai, his hometown, using tightly packed shelves of empty containers with bright labels. Folkert de Jong's tableau of monstrous figures sculptured in candy-colored insulation foam calls on Goya, puppetry and World War I history to depict an execution in progress. Martha Colburn's ''Myth Labs,'' a stop-motion animation handmade from drawings and pop-culture collage, spins out a vivid stream-of-consciousness narrative about the effects of drug addiction and bad religion on the American frontier. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Oct. 4. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Other
 'CRESWELL CRAGS' In this ecumenical group show of 10 mostly young, mostly promising artists, statements rarely overlap, but they do touch. Between Michael Bauer's elegant, genielike abstract painting and Alex Hubbard's hat-trick video abstraction, links are formed by the morphing geometries of Mark Barrow's painting and Frank Haines's sculpture; the opposing uses of representation deployed by Rashid Johnson and Alan Reid; the angular profiles and doublings of Erin Shirreff, J. Parker Valentine and Josh Faught; and Zak Prekop's supposed embrace of the all-white monochrome. Materials vary similarly. A quiet optimism that is nothing to sniff at accrues. Lisa Cooley, 34 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 680-0564, lisa-cooley.com, through Oct. 5. (Smith)
 'MONSTERS' Selected by the artist Robert Longo, this diverse exhibition of 13 artists (all male) who were once his studio assistants reflects a healthy indifference to imitating or being imitated. Of particular interest are Nathan Spondike's luminous abstractions; Brock Enright's garrulous installation; Owen McAuley's small urban nocturnes; Colin Hunt's even smaller Surrealistic canvases; Garrick Imatani's photographs of off-the-grid dwellings; and Eric Schnell's patchwork of pale drawings, held together by clay. The most Longo-esque artist, William Latta, still manages to look like, well, his own man. Rental Gallery, 120 East Broadway, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 608-6002, rental-gallery.com, through Oct. 5.(Smith)
 'OUT NOW!' The artist Anton Vidokle organized this exhibition to protest both the war in Iraq and the tepid response of American art institutions to that war. The work is tightly installed, text-intensive and hot with information. Among the contributors are the Irish journalist Patrick Cockburn; the peace activist Kathy Kelly; the writer Jalal Toufic; the artists Natasha Sadr Haghighian, Trevor Paglen and Martha Rosler; and the artist collective Friends of William Blake. E-Flux, 41 Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com, through Nov 8. (Cotter) 
 AGATHE SNOW: 'JUST SAY YES' Agathe Snow's talents as a mixed-media bricoleur are shown to incoherent effect in an installation of eight hanging sculptures based on Leonardo da Vinci's fables. Although each effort has points of interest in the use of materials, the body language or emotional resonance, the effect of extremely messy pinatas prevails over all. In the courtyard behind the gallery, the Swiss artist Roman Signer gets by without blowing anything up. James Fuentes LLC, 35 St. James Place, Chinatown, (212) 577-1201, jamesfuentes.com, through Oct. 12. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LOUISE BOURGEOIS' This retrospective of the French-born New York artist, who is now 96, has been seen in Paris and London and looks great in the Guggenheim's big spiral: clean but organic and unclassically classical. The installation is chronological, from early found-wood abstract pieces to recent soft sculptures in fabric, but there is nothing linear about Ms. Bourgeois's thinking: images come and go and reappear, like motives in a dream, and they're intense like a dream. After her long career, the art world tends to take Ms. Bourgeois for granted. That's a mistake. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 DEMETRIUS OLIVER: 'OBSERVATORY' In a compelling first New York solo, this young artist fills the gallery with fish-eye-style photographs that suggest telescopic views of theater interiors; astronomical bodies lined up in strict formation; and Emerson's ''transparent eyeball,'' seeing unity in all things. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter) 
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'THAT WAS THEN ... THIS IS NOW' An ambitious but muddled effort to extend the activist spirit of the Vietnam War protest days into the Iraq war era, this exhibition presents a mix of politically motivated artworks dating from the 1960s to the present by more than 60 artists. Outstanding pieces include Chris Burden's ''Reason for the Neutron Bomb,'' a 1979 installation of 50,000 nickels with a wooden matchstick attached to each; and a beautiful, digitally animated video from 2002 by Jeremy Blake that meditates on the mysterious house built in San Jose, Calif., by Sarah Winchester, heiress to the Winchester rifle fortune. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday.

HEADLINE: New Home Sales at 17-Year Low in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
New home sales tumbled in August to the slowest pace in 17 years, while the average sales price fell by the largest amount on record, demonstrating the depth of the problem that Washington is trying to solve. 
 The Commerce Department said Thursday that new homes sales fell by 11.5 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 460,000 units, the slowest sales pace since January 1991.
 It was a much bigger sales decline than the small 1 percent drop that economists had been expecting. The average price of a new home sold in August dropped by a record amount of 11.8 percent to $263,900, compared to the July average of $299,100. The median price was also down, falling 5.5 percent to $221,900.
 The big drop in new home sales followed news Wednesday that sales of existing homes were down 2.2 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.91 million units. Both segments of the market remain under pressure from the steepest housing downturn in decades.
 That housing slump has contributed to a record surge in mortgage defaults, leading to billions of dollars in losses by financial firms and spawning a severe credit crisis that is threatening to send the country into a steep recession.
 In a nationally televised speech Wednesday night, President Bush said the credit crisis could trigger a ''long and painful recession'' unless Congress acts quickly to pass a $700 billion bailout plan for the nation's financial system. Negotiations on that plan were continuing Thursday with expectations that an agreement would be reached soon.
 Besides the weak housing report, the government said Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits shot up last week to the highest level in seven years. Orders to factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell by a much-bigger-amount than expected amount of 4.5 percent in August. Both indicate the rising pressures facing the economy.
 The report on new home sales showed that business was off in every region of the country except the Midwest, which posted a 7.2 percent increase. Sales plunged by 36.1 percent in the West and were down 31.9 percent in the Northeast. Sales fell a more modest 2.1 percent in the South.

HEADLINE: Boeing Negotiations 'at a Standstill'

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Caroline Brothers contributed reporting from Toulouse, France.

 BODY:
Machinists at the Boeing Company will become eligible on Saturday to collect their first strike pay in a walkout that shows no sign of ending soon.
 There have been no negotiations between the aircraft manufacturer and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers since the strike began on Sept. 6.
 About 27,000 union members walked off the job in a dispute over job security, pay and benefits. It is the second strike by machinists in two sets of contract talks, and is costing the company about $100 million a day in lost revenue. 
 Boeing's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said this week that the discussions remained ''at a standstill.''
 ''We're unable to find the common ground we need to have the discussion we need to have to solve the problem,'' he said after an appearance in Boston, according to Reuters.
 Both sides have said they are willing to return to discussions, but neither the company nor the union has been willing to budge from the positions they took before the walkout.
 Boeing, which offered workers an 11 percent pay increase over three years, wants to retain flexibility to send work to outside companies and to use nonunion workers in certain capacities inside its plants.
 The machinists, meanwhile, want a 13 percent pay increase and have demanded that Boeing bring back more of the workers who lost their jobs at the beginning of the decade, when half its orders were canceled by airlines after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
 Boeing, whose machinist jobs dipped below 19,000, recalled machinists as its order books filled up. The union wants the company to hire 5,000 to 6,000 more machinists.
 Under union rules, striking machinists become eligible for $150 a week in strike pay once the walkout enters its third week. In addition to the checks, the union has been holding fund-raising barbecues, meant to bolster morale and help workers who have begun to file unemployment claims. 
 The union, which struck Boeing for 24 days in 2005, has a $140 million strike fund, which could last for up to six months. 
 The average Boeing machinist earns about $56,000 a year and receives an additional $10,200 a year in overtime, according to the company. When the value of health care and benefits are included, Boeing's annual compensation for each machinist is about $91,500.
 In its most recent e-mail message to members on Thursday, the union stressed the machinists were not alone in facing down the company. ''Our fight is similar to ones facing other aerospace workers throughout the world,'' the e-mail message read.
 The message included a link to a video showing a union leader at Airbus, Boeing's European competitor, expressing solidarity with the striking machinists. Airbus workers have staged their own series of strikes this year, snarling production at the company, which, like Boeing, is aiming to cut costs.
 Last Friday, as many as 300 workers from one small union walked off the job for two hours in Toulouse, France, to protest a restructuring that will eliminate 10,000 jobs across the company. 
 Work on Airbus assembly lines was disrupted three times in as many weeks in February and March last year, as more than 33,000 demonstrators protested job cuts.
 Boeing and Airbus have been scurrying to build planes as they face volatile oil prices, slowing economies and a potential shakeout among Wall Street companies that finance aviation sales. 
 Both have several years' worth of orders for their planes, but each company has experienced delays in building important new aircraft. 
 In Boeing's case, the strike may threaten the first test flight later this year of the Boeing 787, a long-range aircraft for which the company has received nearly 900 orders. 
 Nicknamed the Dreamliner, the plane is more than a year behind schedule. All Nippon Airways, the plane's first customer, said Thursday that it would receive its first 787 next August. It originally expected the plane last May.
 Airbus, meanwhile, has suffered from production interruptions on its giant plane, the A380. The strike in Toulouse threatened to interrupt a hand-off ceremony last Friday.
 European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent of Airbus, also said Thursday that it had indefinitely postponed the first flight of its A400M military transport plane because of a problem with its engines.

 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter) 
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it. History, not buzz, is the subject, and a fascinating history it is, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America, to a video of Joseph Beuys sweeping the streets of Berlin clean of trash and ideology in the 1970s, to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4.

(Karen Rosenberg)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,' through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter-as-poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi's still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components -- bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases -- they are emotionally audacious. This isn't because of what they say outright, but because of what they don't say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE MET: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general.

 THE MET: 'PHOTOGRAPHY ON PHOTOGRAPHY: REFLECTIONS ON THE MEDIUM SINCE 1960,' through Oct. 19. This second installation in the Met's new modern photography galleries is much better than the first, largely because of its variety of works (by artists male and female, young and old, American and European, famous and fledgling). Thomas Ruff and Hiroshi Sugimoto are here, but so are Janice Guy, an artist turned dealer who is benefiting from a sudden interest in her early self-portraits, and Mark Wyse, a young photographer who is also active as a curator. The show is also an excellent epilogue to the historical survey ''Framing a Century: Master Photographers 1840-1940,'' just across the hall in the Howard Gilman Gallery. If ''Framing a Century'' presents a hallowed history of photography, ''Photography on Photography'' gleefully violates that sanctity. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'KIRCHNER AND THE BERLIN STREET,' through Nov. 10. Focusing on seven paintings produced between 1913 and 1915 by the German Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), this exhibition delivers a terrific visual wallop at the start and then continues to reverberate. Vigorously realized in jagged brush strokes of lurid pinks, greens and yellows and shades of charcoal black, the paintings depict stylishly dressed female streetwalkers and furtive, darkly cloaked men on the nocturnal, vertiginously tilted streets of an infernal city on the brink of a world-destroying war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) (Rosenberg)MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIPE, GLASS, BOTTLE OF RUM: THE ART OF APPROPRIATION,' through Nov. 10. More than 100 works, mostly from the museum's drawing collection, represent many different ways of importing nontraditional images, materials, forms and techniques into the realm of art. The exhibition ranges from early Cubist collages by Picasso, Braques and Gris that have newsprint and faux-wood grain paper in them to the suave, agit-prop montages of Barbara Kruger printed on matchbooks and a shopping bag. Other artists include John Baldessari, Hannah Hoch, Sigmar Polke, Sherrie Levine and Richard Prince. (See above.) (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) (Roberta Smith)MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WUNDERKAMMER: A CENTURY OF CURIOSITIES,' through Nov. 10. This exhibition of mostly prints and illustrated books gives too much space to artists in the Modern's pantheon or to predictable midmarket bench warmers. But it is inspired by a very un-Modern idea: the Renaissance wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, a free-form collection of all things rare and marvelous, natural and man-made. Sensitively installed and rife with images of living, often grotesque creatures, it has the buzz of an aberrant ark and enough fresh material to sustain interest. The addition of a few objects from the museum's design collection is especially smart and effective; ignoring MoMA's departmental divisions is a good thing. (See above.) (Smith)
 NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'AFTER NATURE,' through Oct. 5. This strange, lugubrious, wildly uneven dream of an exhibition exudes a distinctly European mood of ruminative pessimism, relieved intermittently by moments of black humor and otherworldly fantasy. Meditating on a spiritual landscape of death and destruction, it lurches from transcendentally thrilling to portentous to kitschy. The best moment is on the fourth floor, where the elevator doors open on the stunning, tragicomic spectacle of Zoe Leonard's dead tree held up by cables and stanchions and Maurizio Cattelan's full-size horse hanging high in the air, with its head seemingly buried in the wall. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
 SCHOMBURG CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN BLACK CULTURE: 'AARON DOUGLAS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN MODERNIST,' through Nov. 30. In 1920s New York a great flowering of black culture emerged that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. No visual artist expressed that movement's euphoric sense of possibility with greater verve than the subject of this valuable exhibition, the painter, illustrator and muralist Aaron Douglas. His major works feature semitransparent silhouettes of black people in heroic poses overlaid by concentric, circular bands of light. Rendered in muted, luminous colors, they project visionary romanticism in a suave, Art Deco-like style. 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200, nypl.org/research/sc. (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'NEW INTUITIONS: LESLIE HEWITT, TANEA RICHARDSON AND SAYA WOOLFALK,' through Oct. 26. The contrasting artistic sensibilities of the latest participants in the Studio Museum's artists-in-residence program maintain its impressive record. Leslie Hewitt, the most accomplished, extends the image-text combination of Conceptual Art in photographs and sculpture. Tanea Richardson, less mature but in some ways more complete, gives found fabrics and abstract form a special vehemence. Saya Woolfalk, a whiz in several mediums (starting with sewing), contributes a video, ''Ethnography of No Place,'' that drags a bit, but is a tour de force of performance, animation, born-again Pattern and Decoration, soft sculpture and anthropological satire. In each case race and ethnicity are among many other issues tackled. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KEHINDE WILEY, THE WORLD STAGE: AFRICA, LAGOS-DAKAR,' through Oct. 26. In 10 recent works Kehinde Wiley shifts the focus of his big, flashy pictures of young African-American men recast as the kings, dandies, and saints of European painting to young African men in the poses of African sculpture. The show (which really belongs in a commercial gallery) reveals a young artist who, despite several years of hotness, is only now beginning to make paintings that don't feel mostly like campy, gaudy illustrations. The compositions are calmer, the details less fussy, and the figures are painted with a new solidity and emotional directness. It makes a big difference. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'PAUL MCCARTHY: CENTRAL SYMMETRICAL ROTATION MOVEMENT: THREE INSTALLATIONS, TWO FILMS,' through Oct. 12. Mr. McCarthy's fans are in for a shock. They will find almost nothing of what this Los Angeles master of transgressive provocation is famous for in this smart, tightly focused exhibition of works dating from 1966 to the present. No psychotic clowning, no pornographic vaudeville. Instead they will discover Mr. McCarthy's art stripped to its bare, abstract yet still metaphorically resonant essentials. The main attractions are two scarily mechanized rooms and a walk-in enclosure dizzyingly animated by feedback loops from four rotating video cameras. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Johnson)
 Galleries: 57th Street
 JOHN ALTOON Mr. Altoon (1925-1969), who made his name in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and '60s and suffered a fatal heart attack shortly thereafter, is the latest West Coast artist to be exhumed by the contemporary market. In this exhibition of paintings and works on paper, organized by Klaus Kertess, Mr. Altoon's well-chronicled personal demons -- thrill seeking, womanizing, depression, paranoia -- are on full display. His drawings, in ink, watercolor, graphite and pastel on board, show men, women and animals engaged in explicitly violent and sexual interactions. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Rosenberg)
 JOHN ASHBERY: 'COLLAGES: THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WANTED' The poet John Ashbery has been making small-scale collages from his college years to the present, and now, at 81, he is having his first gallery solo. The two earliest collages date from around 1948; most are from the 1970s, when he worked in after-dinner cut-and-paste sessions with the artist Joe Brainard. The resulting work, at once prosaic and personal, carries some of the free-associative strangeness and wit associated with Mr. Ashbery's poetry. Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050, tibordenagy.com, through Oct. 4. (Cotter)
 Galleries: SoHo
 KATHLEEN HENDERSON: 'WHAT IF I COULD DRAW A BIRD THAT COULD CHANGE THE WORLD?' This beautiful and chilling show of oil stick drawings is like a fairy tale version of Abu Ghraib as drawn by Ben Shahn. Torture is in progress; Hitler tries his wings; men with bags for heads hunt animals but may be animals themselves; a fat bird flies by, trailing the words, ''If I could draw a bird that could change the world? In a good way, I mean. In a good way.'' The Drawing Center, the Drawing Room, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Oct. 9. (Cotter)
 RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA: 'DEMONSTRATION DRAWINGS' Rirkrit Tiravanija's ambitious show is made up of some 200 small, highly detailed graphite drawings of political protests from around the world. Most of the images were derived from newspaper photographs and have the on-the-spot look of reportage. None of the drawings, though, are actually by Mr. Tiravanija's hand; he commissioned them from young artists in Thailand, some of whom are his students. Drawing, the sine qua non of ''real'' art, meets the real world, and paradoxes unroll. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Nov. 6. (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JERONIMO ELESPE This artist, based in Madrid, makes portraits, landscapes and interior scenes with an eye to the great Spanish painters. Gray, found in the backgrounds of paintings by Goya and Velazquez, is the dominant color and mood. Mannered portraiture remains Mr. Elespe's great strength, but several landscapes are noteworthy for their highly worked surfaces and nocturnal palette. The heavily impastoed ''Lower Garden'' (2006-7) and the nearly iridescent ''Untitled (Garden)'' (2005) have a cumulative beauty, a result of small adjustments made over many months. John Connelly Presents, 625 West 27th Street, (212) 337-9563, johnconnellypresents.com, through Oct. 11. (Rosenberg)
 THILO HEINZMANN: 'AN EMPTY STOMACH IS THE DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND' In his New York solo debut, another young German painter with an antipathy for conventional paint and canvas uses badger pelts, dry pigment, molten tin and chunks of Styrofoam -- all under Plexiglas box-frames that add a clinical air. Absent are his darker, more evocative works, made with unwound cassette tape. The overall effect is smart, shallow and a little deja vu, as in Anselm Reyle. Bortolami, 510 West 25th Street, (212) 727-2050, bortolamigallery.com, through Oct. 4. (Smith)
 VIK MUNIZ: 'VERSO' The old paintings leaning face-first against the gallery walls -- including Seurat's ''Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte'' and Picasso's ''Desmoiselles D'Avignon'' -- are, in fact, replicas created by Mr. Muniz with the assistance of craftsmen who faithfully reproduced the back sides of the originals. To meditate on these trompe l'oeil sculptures is to wonder about our habits of seeing and believing. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com, through Oct. 11. (Johnson)
 ANDRES SERRANO Each of the 18 monumental photographs in this show -- whose title cannot be printed here -- pictures a heroically enlarged heap of excrement against a celestial background of glowing color. Attraction-repulsion is the main effect. You can talk about equating feces and money, but Freudian analysis seems beside the point when it comes to such blatantly attention-seeking work. Yvon Lambert, 550 West 21st Street, (212) 242-3611, yvon-lambert.com, through Oct. 4. (Johnson)
 KEITH TYSON: 'FRACTAL DICE' As if to answer critics who have questioned the integrity of his wildly diversifying, technically showboating approach to sculpture, the British artist Keith Tyson offers an impressive, surprisingly unified set of works. They consist of Playskool-colored plastic boxes assembled into complex configurations of cubes, blocks and beams, whose colors and shapes were determined according to a simple, gamelike system of rules and rolls of a die. PaceWildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com, through Oct. 4. (Johnson)
 XU ZHEN, FOLKERT DE JONG, MARTHA COLBURN Three good solo shows in one. The Chinese conceptual artist Xu Zhen recreates the interior of a convenience store in Shanghai, his hometown, using tightly packed shelves of empty containers with bright labels. Folkert de Jong's tableau of monstrous figures sculptured in candy-colored insulation foam calls on Goya, puppetry and World War I history to depict an execution in progress. Martha Colburn's ''Myth Labs,'' a stop-motion animation handmade from drawings and pop-culture collage, spins out a vivid stream-of-consciousness narrative about the effects of drug addiction and bad religion on the American frontier. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Oct. 4. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Other
 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: A WORLD ELSEWHERE' A gallery chain based in London and owned by an auction house opens in New York in an overdone, chopped-up space with a shapeless, absurdly unnecessary exhibition of paintings and sculptures by those mythic market stalwarts, the leaders of the New York School. Under crowded (auction-house-like) conditions await exceptional works by Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, David Smith and more, often lent by museums. That nothing is for sale is meant to impress, but it doesn't do much to reduce the aura of commercial savvy, or the sense that a history recounted often and better elsewhere is being told yet again for all the wrong reasons. Haunch of Venison, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, near 49th Street, (212) 636-2034, haunchofvenison.com, through Nov. 12. (Smith)
 'CRESWELL CRAGS' In this ecumenical group show of 10 mostly young, mostly promising artists, statements rarely overlap, but they do touch. Between Michael Bauer's elegant, genielike abstract painting and Alex Hubbard's hat-trick video abstraction, links are formed by the morphing geometries of Mark Barrow's painting and Frank Haines's sculpture; the opposing uses of representation deployed by Rashid Johnson and Alan Reid; the angular profiles and doublings of Erin Shirreff, J. Parker Valentine and Josh Faught; and Zak Prekop's supposed embrace of the all-white monochrome. Materials vary similarly. A quiet optimism that is nothing to sniff at accrues. Lisa Cooley, 34 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 680-0564, lisa-cooley.com, through Oct. 5. (Smith)
 'IMPLANT' Organized by a curator at the Horticultural Society of New York, ''Implant'' takes inspiration from Michael Pollan's 2001 book, ''The Botany of Desire,'' which suggests that plants are using us for evolutionary purposes just as much as we are using them. Musicians entertain the foliage in Peter Coffin's greenhouse; a tree in a digital animation by Hiraki Sawa trots on human legs through a Daliesque landscape. Roughly 100 works by 45 contemporary artists add to our sense of a gradual shift in the artist-plant relationship, from sublime awe in the face of nature to something more reciprocal. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets; (212) 713-2885, hsny.org, through Oct. 31. (Rosenberg)
 'MONSTERS' Selected by the artist Robert Longo, this diverse exhibition of 13 artists (all male) who were once his studio assistants reflects a healthy indifference to imitating or being imitated. Of particular interest are Nathan Spondike's luminous abstractions; Brock Enright's garrulous installation; Owen McAuley's small urban nocturnes; Colin Hunt's even smaller Surrealistic canvases; Garrick Imatani's photographs of off-the-grid dwellings; and Eric Schnell's patchwork of pale drawings, held together by clay. The most Longo-esque artist, William Latta, still manages to look like, well, his own man. Rental Gallery, 120 East Broadway, at Allen Street, Lower East Side, (212) 608-6002, rental-gallery.com, through Oct. 5.(Smith)
 'OUT NOW!' The artist Anton Vidokle organized this exhibition to protest both the war in Iraq and the tepid response of American art institutions to that war. The work is tightly installed, text-intensive and hot with information. Among the contributors are the Irish journalist Patrick Cockburn; the peace activist Kathy Kelly; the writer Jalal Toufic; the artists Natasha Sadr Haghighian, Trevor Paglen and Martha Rosler; and the artist collective Friends of William Blake. E-Flux, 41 Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com, through Nov 8. (Cotter) 
 'SCRAWL' Some people become writers when they become crazed enough by the state of things, and collectors when they become crazy enough about a certain kind of artifact. The two extremes converge in ''Scrawl,'' an exhibition organized by Harley Spiller from his collection (one of 80) of homemade stickers, broadsides and other communiques culled from the streets of New York over the past 23 years. Among the 40 people represented here, handwriting, pen and paper vary; trigger points include the government, corporations, politicians and people unlike themselves. But their objections offer energetic evidence that the death of the author is greatly exaggerated. Apex Art, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org, through Oct. 11. (Smith)
 AGATHE SNOW: 'JUST SAY YES' Agathe Snow's talents as a mixed-media bricoleur are shown to incoherent effect in an installation of eight hanging sculptures based on Leonardo da Vinci's fables. Although each effort has points of interest in the use of materials, the body language or emotional resonance, the effect of extremely messy pinatas prevails over all. In the courtyard behind the gallery, the Swiss artist Roman Signer gets by without blowing anything up. James Fuentes LLC, 35 St. James Place, Chinatown, (212) 577-1201, jamesfuentes.com, through Oct. 12. (Smith)
 Public Art
 'THE NEW YORK CITY WATERFALLS'Walt Whitman would be pleased. The four waterfalls that the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has temporarily insinuated along Whitman's beloved East River (one on Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, a fourth on Governors Island) tweak the ecstatic experience of city life that is especially palpable at water's edge. Forming a mammoth yet oddly discreet work of shoreline land art, they are spectacular only in the cumulative sense, although the top level of Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport is a great place from which to pick out all four. Their scaffoldings and standard New York apartment riser pipes make them, strictly speaking, fountains. But they are also mirages that add uncanny signs of a primordial Eden that never was. Faking natural history with basic plumbing, they form little rips in the urban fabric through which you glimpse hints of a lost paradise, and sharpen your sense of Whitman's, the one you are already in. Pier 35 in Lower Manhattan, the eastern foot of the Brooklyn Bridge; between Piers 4 and 5 near the Brooklyn Heights Promenade; north shore of Governors Island; nycwaterfalls.org, through Oct. 13. (Smith) 
 Out of Town
 GUILD HALL MUSEUM: 'LARRY RIVERS: MAJOR EARLY WORKS,' through Oct. 19. Tracking Larry Rivers's rapid evolution from figurative realism at the start of his career in the early 1950s to Pop-style history painting in the mid-'60s, this show reveals a terrifically fertile, energetic and daring talent discovering itself and lunging into the future. His 1955 painting of his corpulent mother-in-law, Berdie Burger -- who appears in the painting twice, both times nude -- is one of the great miracles of 20th-century American art. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, Long Island, (631) 324-0806, guildhall.org. 
 (Johnson)
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'R. CRUMB'S UNDERGROUND,' through Dec. 7. The former underground comic artist R. Crumb has created some of the most memorable characters in cartoon history, including the irascible guru Mr. Natural; the suave, shamelessly randy Fritz the Cat; the angry Amazon Devil Girl; and R. Crumb himself, a figure comparable to the autobiographical alter-egos of Woody Allen and Philip Roth. He has been a fearlessly irreverent satirist and an intrepid explorer of his own twisted psyche. And he is excruciatingly funny. This enthralling show presents more than 100 works from all phases of his five-decade career. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia; (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'LOUISE BOURGEOIS' This retrospective of the French-born New York artist, who is now 96, has been seen in Paris and London and looks great in the Guggenheim's big spiral: clean but organic and unclassically classical. The installation is chronological, from early found-wood abstract pieces to recent soft sculptures in fabric, but there is nothing linear about Ms. Bourgeois's thinking: images come and go and reappear, like motives in a dream, and they're intense like a dream. After her long career, the art world tends to take Ms. Bourgeois for granted. That's a mistake. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org; closes on Sunday. (Cotter)
 DEMETRIUS OLIVER: 'OBSERVATORY' In a compelling first New York solo, this young artist fills the gallery with fish-eye-style photographs that suggest telescopic views of theater interiors; astronomical bodies lined up in strict formation; and Emerson's ''transparent eyeball,'' seeing unity in all things. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460, damelioterras.com; closes on Saturday. (Cotter) 
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'THAT WAS THEN ... THIS IS NOW' An ambitious but muddled effort to extend the activist spirit of the Vietnam War protest days into the Iraq war era, this exhibition presents a mix of politically motivated artworks dating from the 1960s to the present by more than 60 artists. Outstanding pieces include Chris Burden's ''Reason for the Neutron Bomb,'' a 1979 installation of 50,000 nickels with a wooden matchstick attached to each; and a beautiful, digitally animated video from 2002 by Jeremy Blake that meditates on the mysterious house built in San Jose, Calif., by Sarah Winchester, heiress to the Winchester rifle fortune. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org; closes on Monday.

HEADLINE: What the World Wants to Know

BYLINE: By ASIF ALI ZARDARI, MICHELLE BACHELET, BERNARD-HENRI LEVY, HU SHULI, RORY STEWART, LILIA SHEVTSOVA, ENRIQUE KRAUZE, YOICHI FUNABASHI, PAUL MARTIN, VICENTE FOX, RAMACHANDRA GUHA and IVAN KRASTEV

 BODY:
Well, there's supposed to be a presidential debate tonight in Oxford, Miss. And it's supposed to be about foreign policy. With that in mind, the Op-Ed editors asked leaders and writers from around the world to pose questions they'd like to hear John McCain and Barack Obama answer.
 How would you work with America's allies in the Muslim world to turn around the widely held misperception there, as evidenced in opinion polls, that the global war against terrorism is actually a war against Islam?
 ASIF ALI ZARDARI, the president of Pakistan 
 Many developing countries -- mine included -- have made sacrifices to carry out tough economic reforms and have sought ''trade and not aid.'' To succeed, we need to compete on a level playing field with more developed economies. Is the United States ready to shoulder some of the burden by advocating the elimination or tempering of protectionism and subsidies? The United Nations by itself, with its faults and many achievements, does not lead. Nation-states do. American commitment and leadership is a must for effective multilateral cooperation. Will you demonstrate a renewed commitment to multilateralism and the rule of international law? Will you negotiate actively to agree on a post-Kyoto treaty on global warming and seek to join the United Nations Human Rights Council? Lastly, what would you do to regain the trust of your allies who would like to see the United States engaging in respectful dialogue and leading the way in the fight not merely against terrorism -- which must be done -- but also against world hunger, poverty, inequality and disease?
 MICHELLE BACHELET, the president of Chile
 American foreign policy is now inextricably tied to the financial situation in the United States and to the image this crisis gives the country in the eyes of the world. How, for example, will this financial tsunami change your Iraq policy and its timetable? How will you manage both the horribly high cost of rescuing the banking system and the no less exorbitant cost of the American military presence in Baghdad? What will you say to all those countries the United States has so long lectured on the right way to govern their economies and that now see that America has refused its own medicine? The rest of the world is absorbing America's deficits. How do you plan to convince them to continue doing so as though nothing has happened? Has the place of America in the world changed in your view? Can its role be the same? Will the America you are going to lead still be the great power it was before last week?
 BERNARD-HENRI LEVY, the author of ''Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism''
 Do you view China simply as an emerging great power, or as an emerging great power with a conflicting ideology? And how will this perception shape your China policy?
 HU SHULI, the editor of the Chinese business magazine Caijing
 Why do you think that terrorism is the No. 1 strategic threat to the United States? How does it compare to the threat from an economic meltdown, from an environmental catastrophe, or from another nation? Should the United States continue to put hundreds of times more effort and investment into Afghanistan than into Pakistan, Egypt or Iran? China is now too wealthy and powerful to be intimidated by the United States. What are America's interests in the Asia-Pacific region? How should you protect them?
 RORY STEWART, the author of ''The Places in Between,'' a former British foreign service officer, and the chief executive of Turquoise Mountain, a foundation in Afghanistan
 When their presidencies began, both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were enthusiastic toward Russia, but by the end relations were decidedly cooler. What measures can you propose that would ensure that your presidency ends more constructively? How can the United States encourage transformation in the new independent states, especially Ukraine and Georgia, without further alienating Russia?
 LILIA SHEVTSOVA, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Moscow
 Do you think the American embargo of Cuba is a mistake? Does the ascension of Raul Castro, Fidel Castro's brother, represent an opportunity to open relations with that country? Wouldn't better relations with Cuba help neutralize Hugo Chavez, whose anti-Americanism is finding support in Latin America?
 ENRIQUE KRAUZE, the editor of the magazine Letras Libres and the author of ''Mexico: Biography of Power''
 How do you plan to formulate American policy with respect to the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran? In particular, what steps would you take to deal with North Korea's nuclear threat if its regime collapses? In what specific ways would you try to lower the United States' carbon dioxide emissions to achieve the goals each of you have outlined in your campaigns?
 YOICHI FUNABASHI, the editor of the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun
 The Group of 8 was set up as a steering committee of the world's most powerful economies. Do you believe that to make globalization work, such a steering committee is required? If so, do you believe that the group in its current configuration, without the presence of the major emerging economies, fits the bill? Deforestation, which causes at least 20 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions each year, is a leading cause of climate change. The world needs to protect its rain forests -- for example in the Congo and Amazon basins -- but not at the expense of the desperately poor people who live in them. Do you believe that any plan to combat climate change must include measures to compensate the people of the world's tropical rainforests, to make these forests more valuable standing rather than cut down?
 PAUL MARTIN, the prime minister of Canada from 2003 to 2006
 Free trade and immigration have made the United States the world's richest nation. But many of your country's friends worry that you may react to the current financial crisis, and to a rise in protectionist sentiment and immigrant-bashing, by turning inward. As president, would you work to allow freer movement of guest workers and trade in our hemisphere? Would you support the continuation and expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement? Mexico is a thriving democracy that buys more goods and products from the United States than do the four leading economies of Europe combined, while President Felipe Calderon leads an all-out war on narco-traffickers to make our country safer. Given this progress, do you support the $1.4 billion package to fight narco-terrorism that Presidents Bush and Calderon proposed last year? Shouldn't we mutually strengthen our countries, rather than feuding about issues that divide us, like immigration?
 VICENTE FOX, the president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006 
 How would you work to restructure the United Nations to make it more representative as well as more effective? Clearly, the makeup of the Security Council is anachronistic. Would you support the expansion of its permanent membership to include (among other countries) Brazil, India, Japan and South Africa?
 RAMACHANDRA GUHA, the author of ''India After Gandhi''
 It is important to know not only what the next president will do, but also why he will do it. I am somewhat puzzled by the absence of ''why'' questions in the presidential campaign. Why, for example, do you, Mr. McCain, advocate the expulsion of Russia from the Group of 8? Do you believe that this will change Moscow's behavior? Or do you believe that undemocratic states should not be members of the group? Also, why do both of you support Georgia's and Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization? Do you believe this policy would expand the West's sphere of influence? Are you convinced that it would be good for the alliance, or do you think NATO has lost its centrality in American foreign policy? Is it possible that each of you advocates the same policy for very different reasons?
 IVAN KRASTEV, the editor of the Bulgarian edition of Foreign Policy magazine

HEADLINE: Safeguarding a Japanese Master's Place in Film

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
For many critics and cinephiles who came of age in the 1960s and '70s, Nagisa Oshima, now 76, has long held the mantle of Japan's greatest living filmmaker. Younger viewers, for the most part, have had to take them at their word since his films are scarcely available on home video and rarely revived for repertory screenings. 
 With this once-towering figure almost in eclipse, it is hard to overstate the significance of ''In the Realm of Oshima,'' his first major retrospective in the United States in more than 20 years. The series, which runs from Saturday through Oct. 14 as part of the New York Film Festival, includes all 23 of his fiction features. Its title alludes to ''In the Realm of the Senses,'' a 1976 hard-core provocation and the one Oshima film whose notoriety survives. 
 The retrospective, which will travel to about a dozen other North American cities, is a labor of love for its curator, James Quandt of the Cinematheque Ontario, who has worked on it for 10 years, tracking down obscure print sources and negotiating a tangle of rights problems. In the context of an amnesiac film culture, it is also a heroic intervention, a bid to safeguard a master's place in the canon. 
 Richard Pena, the program director at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which organized the show jointly with the Cinematheque Ontario, said he realized that a retrospective was long overdue when he taught a seminar at Columbia University a few years ago on ''Cruel Story of Youth,'' Mr. Oshima's breakthrough second feature, from 1960, and found that none of his students had heard of the filmmaker. 
 He added that Mr. Oshima's reputation had suffered from the increasing timidity of art-house tastes: ''For a while there was a kind of hostility to the radical experiments in form that Oshima came to incarnate.'' 
 If Mr. Oshima's legacy now seems a bit murky, it is partly because he was, by design, a tough filmmaker to pin down. Several thematic threads run through his movies -- sex, crime, an alertness to the social and political dimensions of his characters' transgressions -- but there is no stylistic signature. Mr. Oshima swerved between extremes, reshaping familiar genres (family epics, youth films) and inventing new ones (freely mixing modes like documentary realism and avant-garde surrealism), always searching for radical forms to match radical content. 
 Born into a family with samurai ancestry and socialist leanings, Mr. Oshima studied law at Kyoto University, where he became active in the left-wing student movement. His youthful ideals extended into his film career, and his interest in cinema as a revolutionary tool -- along with his gift for acid polemics and his pop touch with political material -- earned him repeated comparisons to another '60s titan, Jean-Luc Godard. (Tired of being called Japan's answer to Mr. Godard, Mr. Oshima suggested that Mr. Godard be considered the Oshima of France.) 
 Like all iconoclasts, Mr. Oshima has a patricidal aspect to his career. ''My hatred for Japanese cinema includes absolutely all of it,'' he declared. When he made a television documentary on Japanese cinema in 1995, he included only one clip each from older masters like Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi. (Four of his own films made it in.) Where others saw refinement, Mr. Oshima saw meek politesse and ossified ideals of beauty. This is a filmmaker who once wrote an essay titled ''Banish Green'' and excised the color from his movies because he thought it too soothing. 
 It was not just Japanese aesthetics but a whole system of Japanese thought that Mr. Oshima sought to probe and overthrow. He picked at the scabby flipside of his country's postwar economic miracle, exposing the tyranny of tradition and the failure of dogma, scotching the sentimental myths of the land of the rising sun. His third feature, ''The Sun's Burial'' (1960), includes numerous shots of the sun, its glow turned seemingly radioactive, setting over an infernal Osaka slum.
 Mr. Oshima threw in his lot with the underclass. His protagonists tend to be rebels, outcasts and criminals. Many of his plots pivot on scams, executed with either casual or desperate cruelty and typically doomed to backfire. 
 At the peak of his powers, Mr. Oshima had a particular talent for transmuting tabloid scenarios into excoriating social parables. Many of his greatest films are inspired by true stories, including ''Violence at Noon'' (1966), a fractured portrait of a serial rapist and the two women who love him; ''Death by Hanging'' (1968), a Brechtian screed against capital punishment and Japanese xenophobia; and ''Boy'' (1969), a coming-of-age tale about a family that forces its eldest son to fake traffic injuries.
 Mr. Quandt believes that these movies, which he called ''total eviscerations of Japan Inc.,'' are ripe for reappraisal. ''The line on Oshima is that the films are highly cerebral or conceptual,'' he said. ''That's true to a degree, but I also find the films incredibly moving. Unlike almost anything in contemporary cinema, they feel like they're ripped out of his being.''
 In the second, more leisurely half of Mr. Oshima's career (he has made only five fiction features in the last 35 years, after racking up 18 between 1959 and 1972), he has developed a parallel persona as a talk show host. He ventured out of Japan for the prisoner-of-war melodrama ''Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence'' (1983), starring David Bowie and Ryuichi Sakamoto, and ''Max Mon Amour'' (1986), a sex farce that pairs Charlotte Rampling with a chimpanzee. After suffering a stroke in the mid-'90s, he recovered for one presumably final subversion, the gay samurai drama ''Taboo'' (2000). 
 There was an obvious correspondence between the political weather and Mr. Oshima's productivity. He released three films in 1960, amid escalating protests over the renewal of Japan's security treaty with the United States, and matched that number in 1968, a year of global revolt. His '60s bookends -- ''Night and Fog in Japan'' (1960), a flashback-filled account of the vicious in-fighting between two generations of student radicals, and ''The Man Who Left His Will on Film'' (1970), a playful yet infinitely sad epitaph for the very idea of political filmmaking -- are among the most clear-eyed documents of that mythologized decade. 
 To call these films products of their times does nothing to diminish their freshness. It is precisely because Mr. Oshima was so furiously engaged with his moment that his movies still have so much to say to ours.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds McCain Edge On Security

BYLINE: By DALIA SUSSMAN

 BODY:
Heading into the first scheduled presidential debate, Senator John McCain is seen by voters as more capable on national security and more knowledgeable about foreign policy, the focus of the debate, than is Senator Barack Obama, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 But discussion at the debate is sure to turn to the pressing problems posed by the faltering economy and on that score, Mr. Obama outpaces Mr. McCain. 
 By a margin of 23 points, voters were more likely to say Mr. McCain was very knowledgeable about world affairs than they were about Mr. Obama, and 21 points more apt to say it was very likely Mr. McCain would be an effective commander in chief. Voters were also much more likely to express confidence in Mr. McCain's ability to protect the country from a terrorist attack.
 Mr. Obama, though, has made some gains in recent weeks on other foreign policy measures. He now runs closer to Mr. McCain in trust over how he would handle foreign policy issues in general, after trailing by 11 points in August. Most voters polled said they thought Mr. McCain would continue President Bush's foreign policies -- a score on which Mr. Bush is broadly unpopular. 
 Mr. Obama also runs close with Mr. McCain in confidence levels about how he would handle the war in Iraq. And he is still viewed as the candidate more likely to improve the image of the United States abroad, something that voters polled said was important for the next president to do. 
 Both candidates will have some work to do at the debate -- scheduled for Friday, though questions remain about whether it will take place then -- to ease voters' concerns about how they would approach an international problem. Neither candidate garners confidence from a majority of voters in his ability to handle an international crisis.
 Most voters in the poll said they were more concerned that Mr. McCain would be too quick to take military action and that he would not spend enough time on diplomacy. The reverse was the case for Mr. Obama.
 The nationwide Times/CBS News poll was conducted by telephone from Sunday through Wednesday among 936 adults, including 844 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.
 The poll offers some clues about what Americans want in the foreign policy and national security arena, and those views appear often in keeping with those of Mr. Obama. The findings suggest that he does not necessarily face a public that is at odds with his positions, but rather one that has yet to be fully convinced of his ability. 
 Nearly three in four respondents said it was a good idea for the president to meet with leaders of unfriendly countries and more than 6 in 10 called Iran a threat that could be contained with diplomacy.

HEADLINE: McCain Leaps Into a Thicket

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and ELISABETH BUMILLER; Megan Thee contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator John McCain had intended to ride back into Washington on Thursday as a leader who had put aside presidential politics to help broker a solution to the financial crisis. Instead he found himself in the midst of a remarkable partisan showdown, lacking a clear public message for how to bring it to an end.
 At the bipartisan White House meeting that Mr. McCain had called for a day earlier, he sat silently for more than 40 minutes, more observer than leader, and then offered only a vague sense of where he stood, said people in the meeting. 
 In subsequent television interviews, Mr. McCain suggested that he saw the bipartisan plan that came apart at the White House meeting as the proper basis for an eventual agreement, but he did not tip his hand as to whether he would give any support to the alternative put on the table by angry House Republicans, with whom he had met before going to the White House. 
 He said he was hopeful that a deal could be struck quickly and that he could then show up for his scheduled debate on Friday night against his Democratic rival in the presidential race, Senator Barack Obama. But there was no evidence that he was playing a major role in the frantic efforts on Capitol Hill to put a deal back together again.
 On the second floor of the Capitol on Thursday night, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr. McCain's closest confidants, complained to a throng of reporters that Democrats were using Mr. McCain as a scapegoat for the failure of the rescue package. But Mr. Graham was met with a barrage of questions on why Mr. McCain never explicitly said he favored the bailout proposal. 
 The situation was evolving so rapidly that it was all but impossible to judge the political implications; with the government under intense pressure to avoid another breach in confidence in the global financial markets, it was possible that a deal could be struck without further reshaping the campaign and that Mr. McCain could still be able to claim a role in a positive outcome.
 Still, as a matter of political appearances, the day's events succeeded most of all in raising questions about precisely why Mr. McCain had called for postponing the first debate and returned to Washington to focus on the bailout plan, and what his own views were about what should be done. Those political appearances are a key consideration for Mr. McCain less than six weeks from Election Day and at a time when some polls suggest he is losing ground against Mr. Obama, especially on handling the economy. 
 The substance of the financial crisis aside, it was already proving a tough stretch for Mr. McCain. Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, his running mate, struggled through questions about her foreign policy credentials during an interview with CBS News. Mr. McCain was lampooned on television by David Letterman. 
 Mr. Obama might not have fared much better. He had come to Washington only reluctantly, opening himself to criticism by Republicans that he was putting his election bid ahead of the need to resolve the Wall Street crisis, and prompting concern among Democrats that his reaction to the events was simply too measured, considering the stakes. 
 Still, by nightfall, the day provided the younger and less experienced Mr. Obama an opportunity to, in effect, shift roles with Mr. McCain. For a moment, at least, it was Mr. Obama presenting himself as the old hand at consensus building, and as the real face of bipartisan politics.
 ''What I've found, and I think it was confirmed today, is that when you inject presidential politics into delicate negotiations, it's not necessarily as helpful as it needs to be,'' Mr. Obama told reporters Thursday evening. ''Just because there is a lot of glare of the spotlight, there's the potential for posturing or suspicions.''
 ''When you're not worrying about who's getting credit, or who's getting blamed, then things tend to move forward a little more constructively,'' he said.
 At the very least, Mr. McCain's actions have shaken up the campaign and the negotiations over the bailout package. It has put him at center stage, permitted him to present himself as putting his country ahead of his campaign -- a recurring theme of his candidacy -- and put him on deck to, if not help orchestrate a deal, at least be associated with one. 
 But Mr. McCain is certainly seeing the risks of making such a direct intervention. He now finds himself in the middle of an ideological war that pits conservative Republicans, loath to spending so much taxpayer money on Wall Street, against the Bush White House, which, with the support of Democrats and a sizable number of Republicans, sees a bailout package as essential to averting a potential economic disaster. 
 While there is no doubt a middle ground, at the moment Mr. McCain finds himself between conservatives that he needs to keep on his side for the election, a group that while long wary of him had rallied to his side after his choice of Ms. Palin as his running mate, or being identified with the failure to complete a plan.
 Mr. McCain's actions have put into doubt what was shaping up as a critical moment in the campaign: the first presidential debate, scheduled for Friday night in Mississippi. In suspending his campaign, Mr. McCain declared that he would not attend the debate unless a deal was worked out. That threat drew considerable criticism on Thursday, from Mr. Obama's camp, as well as newspaper editorial boards. And as the day went on, Mr. McCain dropped a hint that the ultimatum was not as ironclad as he once said it was.
 The debate on Friday night would appear to play to Mr. McCain's strengths: Its subject, by the agreement of the two campaigns and the debate commission, is supposed to be national security and foreign affairs. But the debate's moderator, Jim Lehrer, said Thursday that he did not feel constrained to stick to those two topics, considering what has been going on in the country the past two weeks. 
 ''I am not restrained from asking questions about the financial crisis,'' Mr. Lehrer said in an e-mail message. ''Stay tuned!''
 One way or another, it could be in Mr. McCain's interest to get this issue behind him. A New York Times/CBS News poll released Thursday found new evidence that the deteriorating economic environment was helping Mr. Obama. Voters who said the economy was the key issue for them were far more likely to support Mr. Obama. And 64 percent of voters expressed confidence in Mr. Obama's ability to make the right decision on the economy, compared with 55 percent who said they were confident in Mr. McCain's ability, according to the poll.
 In a finding suggesting the difficult terrain Mr. McCain needs to navigate as Congress considers the Wall Street bailout 52 percent of respondents said Mr. McCain care more about protecting the interests of large corporations, compared with 32 percent who said that he cared most about protecting the interests of ordinary people. By contrast, 16 percent of respondents said that Mr. Obama was more concerned with protecting the interests of large corporations, compared with 70 percent said he was more concerned about ordinary people.
 The survey found that Mr. Obama was supported by 47 percent of registered voters, compared with 42 percent for Mr. McCain; essentially the same as a Times/CBS News poll found last week, when Mr. Obama had 48 percent compared with 43 percent for Mr. McCain. The poll, of 936 adults, of whom 844 are registered voters, was taken from Sunday through Wednesday.
 Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama both left the tense hourlong session at the White House through side doors, to avoidwaiting reporters. Mr. McCain did a round of interviews timed on the network evening news, using the opportunity to say again and again that he understood the severity of the crisis and believed it would be resolved.
 ''Again, I hate to be so repetitious -- I am confident we'll reach an agreement,'' he told ABC News. ''We have to.''

HEADLINE: Day of Chaos Grips Washington; Fate of Bailout Plan Unresolved

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN, CARL HULSE and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Elisabeth Bumiller contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
This article was reported byDavid M. Herszenhorn, Carl Hulse and Sheryl Gay Stolberg and written by Ms. Stolberg.
 The day began with an agreement that Washington hoped would end the financial crisis that has gripped the nation. It dissolved into a verbal brawl in the Cabinet Room of the White House, urgent warnings from the president and pleas from a Treasury secretary who knelt before the House speaker and appealed for her support. 
 ''If money isn't loosened up, this sucker could go down,'' President Bush declared Thursday as he watched the $700 billion bailout package fall apart before his eyes, according to one person in the room.
 It was an implosion that spilled out from behind closed doors into public view in a way rarely seen in Washington. 
 By 10:30 p.m., after another round of talks, Congressional negotiators gave up for the night and said they would try again on Friday. Left uncertain was the fate of the bailout, which the White House says is urgently needed to fix broken financial and credit markets, as well as whether the first presidential debate would go forward as planned Friday night in Mississippi.
 When Congressional leaders and Senators John McCain and Barack Obama, the two major party presidential candidates, trooped to the White House on Thursday afternoon, most signs pointed toward a bipartisan agreement on a grand compromise that could be accepted by all sides and signed into law by the weekend. It was intended to pump billions of dollars into the financial system, restoring liquidity and keeping credit flowing to businesses and consumers. 
 ''We're in a serious economic crisis,'' Mr. Bush told reporters as the meeting began shortly before 4 p.m. in the Cabinet Room, adding, ''My hope is we can reach an agreement very shortly.''
 But once the doors closed, the smooth-talking House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, surprised many in the room by declaring that his caucus could not support the plan to allow the government to buy distressed mortgage assets from ailing financial companies.
 Mr. Boehner pressed an alternative that involved a smaller role for the government, and Mr. McCain, whose support of the deal is critical if fellow Republicans are to sign on, declined to take a stand. 
 The talks broke up in angry recriminations, according to accounts provided by a participant and others who were briefed on the session, and were followed by dueling news conferences and interviews rife with partisan finger-pointing.
 In the Roosevelt Room after the session, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., literally bent down on one knee as he pleaded with Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, not to ''blow it up'' by withdrawing her party's support for the package over what Ms. Pelosi derided as a Republican betrayal.
 ''I didn't know you were Catholic,'' Ms. Pelosi said, a wry reference to Mr. Paulson's kneeling, according to someone who observed the exchange. She went on: ''It's not me blowing this up, it's the Republicans.''
 Mr. Paulson sighed. ''I know. I know.''
 It was the very outcome the White House had said it intended to avoid, with partisan presidential politics appearing to trample what had been exceedingly delicate Congressional negotiations.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate banking committee, denounced the session as ''a rescue plan for John McCain,'' and proclaimed it a waste of precious hours that could have been spent negotiating.
 But a top aide to Mr. Boehner said it was Democrats who had done the political posturing. The aide, Kevin Smith, said Republicans revolted, in part, because they were chafing at what they saw as an attempt by Democrats to jam through an agreement on the bailout early Thursday and deny Mr. McCain an opportunity to participate in the agreement.
 The day seemed to hold promise as it began. On Wednesday night, Mr. Bush had delivered a prime-time televised address to the nation, warning that ''our country could experience a long and painful recession'' if lawmakers did not act quickly to pass a huge Wall Street bailout plan.
 After spending Thursday morning behind closed doors, senior lawmakers from both parties emerged shortly before 1 p.m. in the ornate painted corridors on the first floor of the Capitol to herald their agreement on the broad outlines of a deal. 
 They said the legislation, which would authorize unprecedented government intervention to buy distressed debt from private firms, would include limits on pay packages for executives of some firms that seek assistance and a mechanism for the government to take an equity stake in some of the firms, so taxpayers have a chance to profit if the bailout plan works.
 ''I now expect we will indeed have a plan that can pass the House, pass the Senate, be signed by the president, and bring a sense of certainty to this crisis that is still roiling in the markets,'' said Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, a member of the banking committee.
 He made a point of describing that meeting as free of political maneuvering. ''It was one of the most productive sessions in that regard that I have participated in since I have been in the Senate,'' Mr. Bennett said.
 But a few blocks away, a senior House Republican lawmaker was at a luncheon with reporters, saying his caucus would never go along with the deal. This Republican said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the chief deputy whip, was circulating an alternative course that would rely on government-backed insurance, not taxpayer-financed purchase of mortgage assets.
 He said the recalcitrant Republicans were calculating that Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, would not want to leave her caucus politically exposed in an election season by passing a bailout bill without rank-and-file Republican support.
 ''You can have all the meetings you want,'' this Republican said, referring to the White House session with Mr. Bush, the presidential candidates and Congressional leaders, still hours away. ''It comes to the floor and the votes aren't there. It won't pass.''
 House Republicans have spent days expressing their unease about a huge government intervention, which they regard as a step down the path to socialism.
 Mr. Smith, the aide to Mr. Boehner, said the leader had directed a group of Republicans a few days ago to see whether they could come up with alternatives that relied less on tax funds in providing the rescue package; that led to Mr. Cantor's mortgage-insurance approach. He said Mr. Boehner thought Mr. Cantor's idea should be taken into consideration in the talks.
 At 4 p.m., Mr. Bush convened his meeting at the White House; Mr. McCain had already met with House Republicans to hear their concerns. He later said on ABC that he had known going into the White House that ''there never was a deal,'' but he kept that sentiment to himself.
 The meeting opened with Mr. Paulson, the chief architect of the bailout plan, ''giving a status report on the condition of the market,'' Tony Fratto, Mr. Bush's deputy press secretary, said. Mr. Fratto said Mr. Paulson warned in particular of the tightening of credit markets overnight, adding, ''that is something very much on his mind.''
 Mr. McCain was at one end of the long conference table, Mr. Obama at the other, with the president and senior Congressional leaders between them. Participants said Mr. Obama peppered Mr. Paulson with questions, while Mr. McCain said little. Outside the West Wing, a huge crowd of reporters gathered in the driveway, anxiously awaiting an appearance by either presidential candidate, with expectations running high. 
 Instead, the first politician to emerge was Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, waving a sheet of paper that he said detailed his own concerns. ''The agreement,'' Mr. Shelby declared, ''is obviously no agreement.''
 The House Republicans' revolt shocked Democrats; the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said later that he was under the impression that Mr. Boehner had been a strong advocate for moving forward with the Paulson plan.
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, who attended the White House meeting, was shocked as well. ''We were ready to make a deal,'' Mr. Frank said later.
 At 8 p.m., an exasperated Mr. Frank, the lead Democratic negotiator, walked back to the Rules Committee room on the second floor of the Senate side of the Capitol, with a pack of reporters on his heels. He was headed for another late-night meeting with Mr. Paulson and many other lawmakers to see whether they could restart the negotiations -- and ward off a Friday morning bloodbath in the markets.
 Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she was open to considering ideas proposed by the House Republicans. And Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama both said they held out hope that a deal could be reached soon.
 At the White House, Mr. Bush was holding fast to the approach that Mr. Paulson has championed.
 ''In case there's any confusion,'' Mr. Fratto, the deputy press secretary, wrote in an e-mail message. ''The president supports the core of Secretary Paulson's plan.''

HEADLINE: What About the Rest of Us?

 BODY:
Lawmakers were still wrangling Thursday night about the Bush administration's $700 billion bailout of the financial system. Political theater was mainly responsible for the delay, but it will be worth the wait if lawmakers take the time to make sure that the plan includes real relief for homeowners and not only for Wall Street. 
 The problems in the financial system have their roots in the housing bust, as do the problems of America's homeowners. Millions face foreclosure, and millions more are watching their equity being wiped out as foreclosures provoke price declines. 
 The problems became even more evident Thursday night with the federal seizure and sale of Washington Mutual to JPMorgan Chase.
 It's unacceptable that lawmakers have yet to come out squarely in favor of bold homeowner relief in the bailout bill. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the biggest advocate of bailing out Wall Street, is also a big roadblock to helping hard-pressed borrowers. He wants to keep relying on the mortgage industry to voluntarily rework troubled loans, even though that approach has failed to stem the foreclosure tide -- and does a disservice to the taxpayers whose money he would put at risk in the bailout. 
 Many of the assets that Mr. Paulson wants to buy with the $700 billion have gone sour because they are tied to mortgages that have defaulted or are at risk of default. Unless homeowners get some help -- and its a pittance compared to what Mr. Paulson wants to give to bankers -- the downward spiral of defaults, foreclosures and tumbling home prices will continue, which could push down the value of those assets even further.
 We could make a strong moral argument that the government has a greater responsibility to help homeowners than it does to bail out Wall Street. But we don't have to. Basic economics argues for a robust plan to stanch foreclosures and thereby protect the taxpayers' $700 billion investment. 
 Mr. Paulson has long opposed what is probably the best way to help Americans stay in their homes: allowing a bankruptcy court to reduce the size of bankrupt borrowers' mortgages. Unfortunately, but predictably, drafts of the bailout plan circulated late Thursday do not mention that relief.
 It is simply outrageous that every type of secured debt -- except the mortgage on a primary home -- can be reworked in bankruptcy court. The law was designed to protect lenders, who have obviously and disastrously abused that protection. There would be no favors dispensed in bankruptcy proceedings. Lenders would have to accept less of a payback and borrowers would have to submit to the oversight of the bankruptcy court for years.
 But the bankruptcy process would mean many fewer foreclosures. And that would halt the downward slide in home prices, reduce the number of vacant homes -- and the blight that comes with them -- and help preserve equity for all homeowners. It would cost the taxpayer nothing. 
 Arguments against bankruptcy relief for mortgages have all been raised and refuted in Congressional hearings and debates over the past year. 
 There should be no more balking. Any bailout bill must allow struggling homeowners to modify their mortgages in bankruptcy court. Mr. Paulson should drop his opposition now. If he won't, Congress should insist on the bailout for homeowners. Americans' $700 billion investment needs to be protected.

HEADLINE: In a Time Of Crisis, Is Obama Too Cool?

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: DUNEDIN, Fla. 

 BODY:
Where many politicians would have aspired to show anger, Senator Barack Obama spoke in a soft, even tone as he reached the crescendo of his speech Wednesday about government mismanagement of the economy.
 ''At this defining moment, we have the chance to finally stand up and say, enough is enough,'' Mr. Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, told a ballpark packed with 11,000 people here.
 Two hours later, after Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, said he would temporarily stop campaigning because of the economic crisis, Mr. Obama looked downright unflappable at a news conference. Referring to this week of economic peril -- and tweaking his Republican rival -- Mr. Obama said flatly, ''Presidents are going to have to deal with more than one thing at a time.'' 
 However forceful and passionate Mr. Obama can be, his speeches and public appearances this week have underscored how he is sometimes out of sync with the visceral anger of Americans who are losing their jobs and homes. He often talks about growing up on food stamps and about having paid off his student loans only recently, yet his tone and volume, body language, facial expressions and words convey a certain distance from the ache that many voters feel.
 ''People want presidents who lead and relate to them -- they don't want presidents who analyze and seem above it all,'' said G. Terry Madonna, a pollster and director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. ''Obama still comes across as dispassionate to the point of coolness. He is so comfortable in his own skin, he can be hard to connect with for people who are struggling.''
 Discussing the Iraq war earlier in the campaign, Mr. Obama did not need to come across as livid because many voters saw him as right: he was the only top-tier presidential candidate who opposed the war from the start. Now the economy is the issue of the day, and Mr. Obama has largely been delivering Mr. Fix-It speeches and pointed critiques.
 ''For the candidates, it's show, not tell,'' said Ruth Sherman, a political communications consultant. ''Saying you understand is not enough, you have to be able to show it. Obama's dispassionate approach on the economic crisis fails him on this front because his delivery contradicts his words.''
 Whereas former Vice President Al Gore and Senator John Kerry struck populist tones during their presidential bids, Mr. Obama is having none of it. For better or worse, his performance in this time of financial peril goes to the heart of who he is. Mr. Obama may have looked subdued as he arrived at the White House on Thursday for a meeting on the economy, but he also stayed calm and ultimately prevailed at a similarly urgent point in his primary campaign against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose turn toward populism helped her win the Ohio and Pennsylvania primaries.
 ''I think it would be more popular in the short term politically to be more populist on the bailout and Wall Street,'' said Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, a Democrat, ''but people know in their gut that a populist approach won't solve the problem.'' 
 Indeed, Mr. McCain has come under criticism from some voters -- and from conservatives in his own party, like George F. Will -- for railing against Wall Street and proposing to fire people and enact economic policies that conflict with his record.
 For Mr. Obama, the financial crisis poses different risks. He wants to appear fired up over the economy, but he has written before about wanting to avoid appearing like a stereotypical angry black man. Unlike Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and other black leaders whose fulminations could scare white voters, Mr. Obama is not from and of New York, Detroit, or the segregated South; he grew up in Hawaii and Indonesia. To some degree Mr. Obama faces the opposite challenge from fiery black leaders who came before him: Is he too cool for a crisis like this one? 
 ''He may not be everything to everybody on the bailout, and he may not be a barnstorming speaker on this issue, but he is speaking credibly and seriously and honestly,'' said Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, who joined Mr. Obama at a rally on the economy in Green Bay on Monday. ''People don't want theatrics here, they want steadiness.''
 If voters in Michigan and Ohio do not demand stemwinding speeches from Mr. Obama, they may be left wondering where the passion is in his signature line, delivered at a fund-raiser in Chicago on Monday night: ''We don't get too high when we're high, we don't get too low when we're low, we just try to do the job.''
 Reba Younce, who attended Mr. Obama's rally here on Wednesday, came away with just that impression of him. A 61-year-old independent voter and a former deputy in law enforcement, Ms. Younce said she would vote for Mr. Obama, in part because of his temperament.
 ''His way of approaching things may not work for everyone who's angry nowadays, but I sense some anger just below the surface,'' Ms. Younce said. ''Though if things keep getting worse, he may need to turn it up a little, to show passion some more.''

HEADLINE: Bailout Plan Stalls After Day of Talks; Paulson Heads Back to Capitol Hill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The status of a rescue plan for the nation's financial system was in doubt on Thursday, at least for the moment, as lawmakers emerged from a meeting with President Bush to say that negotiations had a ways to go.
 The Treasury secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. quickly returned to Capitol Hill to try to revive the proposal. 
 One critical snag seems to be opposition to the $700 billion plan by conservative House Republicans.
 ''My hope is that we can get a deal,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, hours after House and Senate negotiators had announced that an accord was at hand. President Bush had hoped that an agreement could be announced after the late-afternoon meeting.
 Mr. Dodd, looking tired and annoyed, complained that the late complications were making the episode sound more like ''a rescue plan for John McCain,'' the Republican presidential candidate, than one for the financial system.
 It does no good, Mr. Dodd said, ''to be distracted for two or three hours by political theater.''
 The senator was apparently alluding to a growing revolt by conservative Republicans, and the fact that Mr. McCain had not yet endorsed the plan, whose concept runs contrary to the policy positions he has taken.
 Mr. McCain and his Democratic opponent, Senator Barack Obama, left the White House by a side entrance without commenting. The initial silence of the presidential candidates reinforced the impression that thorny issues still need to be addressed.
 Shortly afterward, Mr. Obama said in an interview on CNN that he was confident that a deal would be reached ''eventually,'' but he said, ''I think there's still some work that needs to be done.''
 Mr. McCain said he, too, was optimistic, at least in the long run. ''I am confident that we will reach an agreement that gets a majority of my colleagues on my side of the aisle as well as a majority on the other side,'' he said on CBS.
 The impression that much remains to be done was reinforced by Mr. Dodd's comments. After saying he still hoped for a deal, the senator said it was important to take ''whatever time it takes'' to arrive at a good arrangement, since the effects will be felt for ''years and years to come.''
 It has become abundantly clear, that members of Congress are hearing from their constituents, many of whom are furious about the proposed rescue.
 Democrats said that Senate and House Democrats and Senate Republicans and the White House were ready to hammer out a deal, but that House Republicans balked.
 ''We were ready to make a deal,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who attended the meeting and was standing next to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as Mr. Paulson Jr. asked for more time. 
 ''The House Republicans now tell us we're not for this, we have got something else,'' Mr. Frank said. 
 He complained that the new House Republican counter-proposal included ideas about private mortgage insurance and a cut in the capital gains tax that Mr. Paulson had already testified would not work.
 Mr. Frank blamed a ''troika'' of conservative House Republicans -- Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, and Eric Cantor of Virginia -- for pushing the alternative proposal.
 Earlier Thursday, House and Senate negotiators said they had reached a deal on a rescue, authorizing unprecedented government intervention to buy distressed debt in a move to prevent what President Bush warned could be a widespread economic collapse.
 Republicans and Democrats said that the legislation would include limits on the pay packages for executives of some firms that seek assistance and a mechanism for the government to take an equity stake in some of the firms, so taxpayers have a chance to profit if the bailout plan works.
 The announcement that lawmakers had reached an accord came on a day of high political theater at the Capitol and at the White House -- in a drama whose ending may be quite unpredictable, it seemed after the late-afternoon White House meeting broke up.
 ''We're in a serious economic crisis,'' Mr. Bush told reporters as the meeting began, shortly before 4 p.m. in the Cabinet Room of the White House, adding, ''This meeting is an attempt to move the process forward. My hope is we can reach an agreement very shortly.''
 Mr. McCain was seated at one end of a long conference table, Mr. Obama at the other, with the president and congressional leaders between them. Neither spoke, though Mr. McCain smiled broadly as reporters shouted questions that went unanswered by Mr. Bush.
 The president, in a prime-time televised speech on Wednesday night, appealed to the nation -- and to reluctant lawmakers -- to support the plan.
 After the address, the drafting effort continued through the night on both sides of Capitol Hill -- with pizza on the House side, and Thai food in the Senate. (Negotiations between the House and the Senate can be nearly as complicated as negotiations between Democrats and Republicans.)
 But even as Congressional leaders shook hands on an agreement, House Republicans warned that opposition was building.
 Conservative Republicans, in particular, have said that such a huge government intervention violated their free market principles.
 A senior Republican lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to undermine the party leadership, said there was a ''violent reaction'' among House Republicans to the Paulson plan. He said backers of the alternative, one of several that have been proposed in the House, are calculating that they can force the negotiators to accept it as part of a larger deal.

HEADLINE: Credit Enters A Lockdown

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
The words coming out of Washington this week about the American financial system have been frightening. But many have raised the possibility that the Bush administration is fear-mongering to gin up support for its $700 billion bailout proposal.
 In many corporate offices, in company cafeterias and around dining room tables, however, the reality of tight credit already is limiting daily economic activity.
 ''Loans are basically frozen due to the credit crisis,'' said Vicki Sanger, who is now leaning on personal credit cards bearing double-digit interest rates to finance the building of roads and sidewalks for her residential real estate development in Fruita, Colo. ''The banks just are not lending.''
 With the economy already suffering the strains of plunging housing prices, growing joblessness and the new-found austerity of debt-saturated consumers, many experts fear the fraying of the financial system could pin the nation in distress for years. 
 Without a mechanism to shed the bad loans on their books, financial institutions may continue to hoard their dollars and starve the economy of capital. Americans would be deprived of financing to buy houses, send children to college and start businesses. That would slow economic activity further, souring more loans, and making banks tighter still. In short, a downward spiral.
 Fear of this outcome has become self-fulfilling, prompting a stampede toward safer investments. Investors continued to pile into Treasury bills on Thursday despite rates of interest near zero, making less capital available for businesses and consumers. Stock markets rallied exuberantly for much of Thursday as a bailout deal appeared in hand. Then the deal stalled, leaving the markets vulnerable to a pullback. 
 ''Without trust and confidence, business can't go on, and we can easily fall into a deeper recession and eventually a depression,'' said Andrew Lo, a finance professor at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. ''It would be disastrous to have no plan.''
 The Bush administration has hit this message relentlessly. On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. warned of a potential financial seizure without a swift bailout. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke -- an academic authority on the Great Depression -- used words generally eschewed by people whose utterances move markets, speaking of a ''grave threat.'' 
 In a prime-time television address Wednesday night, President Bush, who has described the strains on the economy as ''adjustments,'' put it this way: ''Our entire economy is in danger.''
 The considerable pushback to the bailout reflects discomfort with the people sounding the alarm. Mr. Paulson, a creature of Wall Street, asked Congress for extraordinary powers to take bad loans off the hands of major financial institutions with a proposal that ran all of three pages. Subprime mortgages have been issued with more paperwork than Mr. Paulson filled out in asking for $700 billion. 
 ''The situation is like that movie trailer where a guy with a deep, scary voice says, 'In a world where credit markets are frozen, where banks refuse to lend to each other at any price, only one man, with one plan can save us,' '' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
 And yet, the more he looked at the data, the more Mr. Bernstein became convinced the financial system really does require some sort of bailout. ''Things are scary,'' he said.
 For nonfinancial firms during the first three months of the year, the outstanding balance of so-called commercial paper -- short-term IOUs that businesses rely upon to finance their daily operations -- was growing by more than 10 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Moody'sEconomy.com. From April to June, the balance plunged by more than 9 percent compared with the previous year.
 This week, the rate charged by banks for short-term loans to other banks swelled to three percentage points above the most conservative of investments, Treasury bills, with the gap nearly tripling since the beginning of this month. In other words, banks are charging more for even minimal risk, making credit tight.
 Suddenly, people who have spent their careers arguing that government is in the way of progress -- that its role must be pared to allow market forces to flourish -- are calling for the biggest government bailout in American history.
 ''We are in a very serious place,'' said William W. Beach, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. ''There is risk of contagion to the entire economy.''
 Even before the stunning events of recent weeks -- as the government took over the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers disintegrated into bankruptcy, and American International Group was saved by an $85 billion government bailout -- credit was tight, sowing fears that the economy would suffer.
 The demise of those prominent institutions and anxiety over what could happen next has amplified worries considerably.
 ''The problem is so big that if somebody doesn't step in, it will cause a panic,'' said Michael Moebs, an economist and chief executive of Moebs Services, an independent research company in Lake Bluff, Ill. ''Things could worsen to the point that we could see double-digit unemployment.''
 This week, Mr. Moebs said he heard from two clients, one a bank and the other a credit union in a small city in the Midwest, now in serious trouble: Both are heavily invested in Lehman, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 ''One is going to lose about 80 percent of their capital if they can't cash those in, and the other is going to lose about half,'' Mr. Moebs said.
 The credit union is located in a city in which the auto industry is a major employer -- an industry now laying off workers. Yet as people try to refinance mortgages to hang on to homes and extend credit cards to pay for gas for their job searches, the local credit union is saying no.
 ''They have become very restrictive on who they are lending to,'' Mr. Moebs said. ''They can't afford a loss. Their risk quotient is next to zero. You have a financial institution that really can't help out the local people who are having financial difficulties.''
 Along the Gulf of Mexico, in Cape Coral, Fla., Michael Pfaff, a mortgage broker, has become accustomed to constant telephone calls from local real estate agents begging for help to save deals in danger of collapsing for lack of finance.
 ''The underwriters are terrified and they're dragging their feet, and making more excuses not to close loans,'' Mr. Pfaff said. ''Basically, they just don't want the deals.''
 Three years ago, when Cape Coral was among the fastest-appreciating real estate markets in the nation, Mr. Pfaff specialized in financing luxury homes with seven-figure price tags. ''Now I'm doing a $32,000 loan on a mobile home,'' he said.
 Finance is still there for people with unblemished credit, he said. Mr. Pfaff recently closed a deal for a couple in Indiana that bought a second house in Cape Coral, a waterfront duplex for $300,000. Their credit score was nearly impeccable, and they had a 20 percent down payment, plus income of nearly $8,000 a month.
 For people like that, conditions have actually improved since the government took over the mortgage giants. A month ago, Mr. Pfaff could secure 30-year fixed rate mortgages for about 7 percent. On Thursday, he was quoting 6 percent.
 But those with less-than-ideal creditare increasingly shut out of the market, Mr. Pfaff said, and there are an awful lot of those people. So-called hard money loans, for those with problematic credit but large down payments, were easy to arrange as recently as last month.
 ''That money has just dried up,'' Mr. Pfaff said. ''I'm afraid. I'm 54 years old, and I've seen a lot of hyperventilating in my life, but I absolutely believe that this is a very serious issue.''

Two Proposals to Guide the Financial Rescue: Early Thursday afternoon, Democratic and Republican members of the Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee told reporters that they had reached an agreement on basic principles of the financial rescue plan, as outlined below:
 But John A. Boehner of Ohio, House Republican leader, cautioned later that although he was ''encouraged by the bipartisan progress,'' ''House Republicans have not agreed to any plan at this point.'' Mr. Boehner's working group produced the following recommendations. Chart details Taxpayer information. (pg. A22)

 DESPITE CHALLENGES, GENERALS 
 Maintain Grip on Myanmar
 The domination by the ruling generals in Myanmar, formerly Burma, has been tested repeatedly over the past two decades -- by monks last September; by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy leader under house arrest; and by a powerful cyclone this year that brought the generals into confrontation with an outside world confounded by their resistance to accepting help. Through it all, they appear to be at the apex of their power. PAGE A6
 WHAT'S IN A STREET NAME? PRIDE
 A proposal to change the name of Big Communist Street in Moscow to Solzhenitsyn Street, in honor of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, has run into difficulties. Not surprisingly, the Communist Party (yes, it still exists) is opposed. And the squabble has spurred a new round of discussion about Moscow's toponymy -- the city still has a number of things named after Lenin, lesser Communist figures and dates connected to the revolution.

 PRESIDENT FOR A WHILE, AT LEAST
 South Africa got a new president, Kgalema Motlanthe, 59, a former trade unionist once imprisoned during the apartheid era on charges of terrorism, who was overwhelmingly elected by Parliament. Whether Mr. Motlanthe lasts beyond an election next year depends on whether Jacob Zuma, his party's leader, who would presumably take over, can continue to skirt the corruption charges that have long followed him.

 AN IRANIAN TAKE ON CONFLICTS
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, in New York for the annual General Assembly at the United Nations, said in an interview that NATO forces had not paid enough attention to humanitarian problems in Afghanistan, that Iraqi forces should gain more responsibility for security in Iraq and that he was ''unhappy'' with the situation in Georgia.

 CHINA PUTS CRAFT INTO SPACE
 China launched a spacecraft carrying three astronauts into space on the country's third manned space mission in the past five years. The three-day mission is expected to include the country's first attempt at a spacewalk, which would make China only the third nation to accomplish the feat, after Russia and the United States. The Chinese hope to establish a space station by 2020 and eventually put a man on the moon. PAGE A15

 MINISTERS TO ENDORSE CANDIDATES,
 In Protest of Federal Tax Law
 Defying a federal tax law they consider unjust, 33 ministers across the country will take to their pulpits this Sunday and publicly endorse a candidate for president. They hope to provoke a legal challenge to a law that bars religious organizations and other nonprofit groups that accept tax-deductible contributions from involvement in partisan political campaigns.

 OBAMA, TOO COOL AS A CUCUMBER?
 Senator Barack Obama spoke in an even, soft tone during his speech about government mismanagement of the economy. ''At this defining moment, we have the chance to finally stand up and say, enough is enough,'' Mr. Obama said at a ballpark with thousands of people in Florida. However forceful and passionate Mr. Obama can be, his speeches and public appearances this week have underscored how he is sometimes out of sync with the visceral anger of Americans who are losing their jobs and homes, Patrick Healy writes.

 CATTLE ROUNDUP AFTER HURRICANE
 Two weeks after Hurricane Ike blew through Southeast Texas, cowboys on horseback and in helicopters are still trying to round up thousands of displaced cattle. In LaBelle, an agricultural community about 10 miles from the gulf coast, dead cows can be seen rotting in the forks of trees, and lone calves wander looking for their mothers amid overturned tractors and grain silos crushed like tin cans.

 CRIME LAB IN DETROIT IS SHUT DOWN
 The Police Department in Detroit shut down its crime laboratory after an audit uncovered serious errors in numerous cases. The audit said sloppy work had probably resulted in wrongful convictions, and officials expect a wave of appeals in cases that the laboratory processed. The closing of the crime lab came less than a week after the interim mayor, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., took office after Kwame M. Kilpatrick's resignation. PAGE A16

 Port Authority officials say they have developed a proposal to complete the Sept. 11 memorial at ground zero in time for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack -- a goal that the authority had until recently said was impossible -- and to simplify the nearby transit hub, which they say would resolve two of the most complex issues plaguing the rebuilding effort.

 YANKEES HOPE TO GIVE MUSSINA
 His First 20-Victory Season
 There are no playoffs to look forward to, but the Yankees do have some unfinished business left in the season. For starters, there is getting a 20th victory for Mike Mussina, who is scheduled to pitch against the Red Sox on Sunday. Manager Joe Girardi wants the whole bullpen available, a bullpen that has been a highlight for the Yankees in an otherwise disappointing year. PAGE C16 
 PUTTING A FACE ON FAILURE
 There were a multitude of reasons why the Mets lost to the Cubs, 9-6, in 10 innings on Tuesday night and tumbled to a tie with the Brewers for the wild card lead. But among the notable failures was the ninth-inning strikeout of David Wright, who, despite a .300 average, 33 homers and 123 runs batted in, has not been as effective in the situations that matter the most.

 YANKEES NEED METS
 The Dodgers with Manny are in; the Red Sox without Manny are in; the always Mannyless Rays are in with a bullet, so to speak. But the Yankees, as has been well documented, are not in the playoffs. And Harvey Araton writes that now only the Mets -- by falling short in their own playoffs quest for the second year in a row -- can spare Hank Steinbrenner an October emotional meltdown.

 BUSINESS
 G.E., CITING FINANCE MARKETS,
 Sharply Cuts Profit Projections
 General Electric sharply reduced its profit projections for the current quarter and the year, citing the ''unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets.'' The move raised concerns that the impact of Wall Street's turmoil will be severe on business profits and the wider economy. G.E. pinned the blame for the shortfall on its finance arm, G.E. Capital.

 BUSINESS DEFAULTS FEARED
 The Pilgrim's Pride Corporation's warning on Wednesday that it would run afoul of certain agreements with its lenders underscored the tightening bind that many companies, even those far from Wall Street, find themselves in as the financial crisis worsens. Beyond Pilgrim's Pride, analysts and industry experts worry that a host of companies are facing increasing pressure on their debt. And a deluge of defaults, which many have forecast over the last year, may finally arrive. PAGE C1
 G.M. PLANS MORE GAS SIPPERS
 General Motors said it intended to double its production of gas-sipping, four-cylinder engines by 2011 by investing $370 million in a plant that would open in 2010 and make 1.4-liter engines for two compact cars scheduled to go on sale late that year. The popularity of four-cylinder engines surged this year as gas prices climbed, and in May, four-cylinder models outsold those equipped with a V-6 for the first time. PAGE C4
 MICROLENDERS AGREE ON CODE
 Microlenders in Mexico, spurred by a dispute over the actions a year ago of one of their own, have announced a code of conduct intended to protect clients from abusive practices. The code requires microfinance institutions to avoid reckless lending that can lead to overindebtedness, and also to use transparent and fair pricing along with collection practices that are not abusive.

 NO MOVEMENT IN BOEING STRIKE
 The strike by machinists against Boeing shows no sign of ending soon. There have been no negotiations between the company and the union representing the workers since the strike began on Sept. 6. Both sides have said they would be willing to return to discussions, but neither the company nor the union has been willing to budge from the positions they took before the walkout. PAGE C4
 EUROPE PROPOSES EMISSIONS LIMITS
 European Union lawmakers proposed tougher-than-expected emissions goals for carmakers, which would penalize makers of larger and heavier vehicles, like Daimler and Porsche. Automakers have waged a lobbying effort to win more time to adapt and are united in their criticism. PAGE C7

 THROUGH HEIMLICH MANEUVERS
 Comes the Truth to Oneself
 If it is Chuck Palahniuk, it has to be riddled with men with breasts and sex addicts who believe themselves to be cloned from divine foreskin. No, you read that right. In the film ''Choke,'' it's through the looking glass for viewers, though it's more like a kaleidoscope this time. And the rabbit might be more inclined to fake a choking accident so he can pay some medical bills. Page B17 
 THE LAZIEST LADIES' MAN YET
 Temptation makes the lust grow to staggering proportions. When last we left David Duchovny's Hank Moody, the indolent, oversexed protagonist of Showtime's ''Californication,'' he had just reunited with his ex-girlfriend Karen (Natascha McElhone). Thus endeth the philandering. In theory. But so begins the raw material for a second season, Ginia Bellafante writes. Page B20 
 SURPRISES WITH THE RIFFS AND LICKS
 The rock concert is often fueled by the illusion that the band is there just for you. They are here to entertain you. As Weezer performed at Madison Square Garden, that illusion was cracked, if not shattered. The lead singer led other musicians onstage, allowed other band members to sing lead and all in all behaved as if this was his own large-scale focus group. And he seemed happy with the result. The audience too, as it happened, Ben Ratliff writes. Page B4 
 PRANK CALL TAKES SINISTER TURN
 They are watching you. And calling you on the phone. In typical technophobe fashion, you have no idea who they are, but they're making things explode. In ''Eagle Eye,'' a disembodied voice leads two ordinary people on a not-so-merry chase through a convoluted movie. There's a top-secret weapon, and some typical espionage stuff, but that's cool. Everybody's confused, A. O. Scott writes. Page B15

 Building on the success of the so-called Chinatown buses that began a dozen years ago, companies are increasingly offering express bus service on I-95 between Boston and Washington. And though the actual travel time is longer than by plane or (usually) train, it's hard to beat the price: $25 or less, and sometimes much less. PAGE D1

 WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US?
 Lawmakers were still wrangling Thursday night about the Bush administration's $700 billion bailout of the financial system.

HEADLINE: Criticizing Capitalism From the Pulpit

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Whatever happened to ''God helps those who help themselves?''
 Even religious leaders have joined the chorus of Europeans criticizing unbridled, American-style capitalism, which Continental politicians have cited as a root cause of the global financial crisis.
 The archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, wrote this week in The Spectator, a British magazine, that placing too much trust in the market had become a kind of ''idolatry.'' At the same time, he reminded readers of Karl Marx's criticism of laissez-faire capitalism, noting, ''He was right about that, if about little else.'' 
 Mr. Williams, the spiritual leader of the Anglican church, called for increased regulation of financial markets, praising regulators' moves to curb short-selling in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and sharp declines in the share prices of other financial institutions. 
 ''Governments should not lose their nerve as they look to identify a few more targets,'' he added.
 In the trans-Atlantic sniping over the causes and solutions to the credit crunch, Mr. Williams's scolding tone has been echoed by some European politicians.
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, blamed a reckless pursuit of short-term profit and outsize bonuses in ''Anglo-American'' financial centers -- as well as a lack of backbone among policy makers unwilling to stand up to this greed.
 Addressing the Bundestag Thursday, he said, the long-term consequences would be punitive for American prestige.
 ''The U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system,'' Mr. Steinbruck said. ''The world financial system will become multipolar.''
 Mr. Steinbruck reaffirmed the German government's opposition to a costly bailout of the financial system. The Bush administration has called on other countries to join in its proposed $700 billion cleanup of troubled bank assets. 
 Mr. Steinbruck, like Mr. Williams, also urged policy makers to enhance financial oversight. 
 The Wall Street crisis, with its complex arcana -- collateralized debt obligations and the like -- might seem like unusual waters for a religious leader to wade into, but Mr. Williams has not shied away from making headlines on sensitive subjects. He caused gasps in Britain earlier this year, for instance, when he said there might be a role for Islamic Shariah law in settling disputes within the British Muslim community.
 Another British clergyman, John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, was even less circumspect than Mr. Williams in criticizing hedge funds that had sold short the shares of a British bank, HBOS, forcing it in an emergency sale to a rival, Lloyds TSB. 
 They were ''clearly bank robbers and asset strippers,'' he said in a speech Wednesday evening.
 Mr. Williams did not specifically blame the United States for the crisis -- British investors profited as much as American high-rollers from the boom, and the bust has hit London almost as hard as New York -- but Mr. Steinbruck did. 
 ''The United States is the source and the obvious focus of the crisis,'' he said, adding that it had spread from America to Europe like a ''toxic oil slick.'' Mr. Steinbruck said he saw no reason for Germany or other European countries to take part in a bailout.
 He argued that the German financial system had weathered the storm better in part because it was anchored by universal banks like Deutsche Bank, with operations that span consumer lending and investment banking. The last two big independent investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have moved toward such a model since the crisis deepened.
 Mr. Steinbruck said European banks would now play a greater role in the world financial system.

HEADLINE: BlackBerry Maker Reports Profit Is Up, but Shares Fall

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Research In Motion posted a 72 percent increase in quarterly profit Thursday but warned that income in the current quarter would be lower than analysts had expected because of higher costs related to its newest BlackBerry smartphones. 
 The results and the forecast, released after the close of market trading, set off a decline of 19 percent in the company's share price in after-hours trading. 
 Research in Motion blamed increased expenses related to its latest handsets like the BlackBerry Bold, a high-end model aimed at the company's mainstay base of corporate users.
 The company also revealed a gross-margin forecast that was softer than many had expected. 
 Peter Misek, a Canaccord Adams analyst, called the results ''a surprise, and not a positive one.'' 
 The company also said its enterprise business, mainly corporate customers, was still robust despite economic uncertainty in the United States.
 Even so, Research in Motion's shares sold off immediately after it released its results, dropping to below $79, down 19 percent from their close at $97.53 on the Nasdaq. 
 Research in Motion said it earned $495.5 million, or 86 cents a share, in its most recent quarter, up from $287.7 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Sales in the period, which ended Aug. 30 and was the second quarter of the company's fiscal year, rose to $2.58 billion, from $1.37 billion.
 The results were in line with the company's June forecast and just shy of analysts' expectations.
 The chief executive, James L. Balsillie, told analysts in a conference call that the company's newest, feature-rich handsets had higher costs associated with them, which in turn affects margins.
 ''This is particularly the case with Bold and other unannounced 3G product platforms,'' he said.
 It is also difficult for R.I.M. to pass the higher costs on to consumers and still keep next-generation BlackBerry prices at attractive levels, Mr. Balsillie added.
 Research in Motion, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, has recently introduced BlackBerry models aimed at the broader consumer market, including a flip-phone BlackBerry Pearl. It is also preparing a touch-screen version of its smartphone to compete more directly with Apple's iPhone.

HEADLINE: Where Are the Grown-Ups?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Many people on both the right and the left are outraged at the idea of using taxpayer money to bail out America's financial system. They're right to be outraged, but doing nothing isn't a serious option. Right now, players throughout the system are refusing to lend and hoarding cash -- and this collapse of credit reminds many economists of the run on the banks that brought on the Great Depression.
 It's true that we don't know for sure that the parallel is a fair one. Maybe we can let Wall Street implode and Main Street would escape largely unscathed. But that's not a chance we want to take. 
 So the grown-up thing is to do something to rescue the financial system. The big question is, are there any grown-ups around -- and will they be able to take charge? 
 Earlier this week, Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, tried to convince Congress that he was the grown-up in the room, come to protect us from danger. And he demanded total authority over the rescue: $700 billion to be used at his discretion, with immunity for future review.
 Congress balked. No government official should be entrusted with that kind of monarchical privilege, least of all an official belonging to the administration that misled America into war. Furthermore, Mr. Paulson's track record is anything but reassuring: he was way behind the curve in appreciating the depth of the nation's financial woes, and it's partly his fault that we've reached the current moment of meltdown.
 Besides, Mr. Paulson never offered a convincing explanation of how his plan was supposed to work -- and the judgment of many economists was, in fact, that it wouldn't work unless it amounted to a huge welfare program for the financial industry.
 But if Mr. Paulson isn't the grown-up we need, are Congressional leaders ready and able to fill the role?
 Well, the bipartisan ''agreement on principles'' released on Thursday looks a lot better than the original Paulson plan. In fact, it puts Mr. Paulson himself under much-needed adult supervision, calling for an oversight board ''with cease and desist authority.'' It also limits Mr. Paulson's allowance: he only (only!) gets to use $250 billion right away. 
 Meanwhile, the agreement calls for limits on executive pay at firms that get federal money. Most important, it ''requires that any transaction include equity sharing.''
 Why is that so important? The fundamental problem with our financial system is that the fallout from the housing bust has left financial institutions with too little capital. When he finally deigned to offer an explanation of his plan, Mr. Paulson argued that he could solve this problem through ''price discovery'' -- that once taxpayer funds had created a market for mortgage-related toxic waste, everyone would realize that the toxic waste is actually worth much more than it currently sells for, solving the capital problem. Never say never, I guess -- but you don't want to bet $700 billion on wishful thinking.
 The odds are, instead, that the U.S. government will end up having to do what governments always do in financial crises: use taxpayers' money to pump capital into the financial system. Under the original Paulson plan, the Treasury would probably have done this by buying toxic waste for much more than it was worth -- and gotten nothing in return. What taxpayers should get is what people who provide capital are entitled to: a share in ownership. And that's what the equity sharing is about. 
 The Congressional plan, then, looks a lot better -- a lot more adult -- than the Paulson plan did. That said, it's very short on detail, and the details are crucial. What prices will taxpayers pay to take over some of that toxic waste? How much equity will they get in return? Those numbers will make all the difference.
 And in any case, it seems that we don't have a deal.
 This has to be a bipartisan plan, and not just at the leadership level. Democrats won't pass the plan without votes from rank-and-file Republicans -- and as of Thursday night, those rank-and-file Republicans were balking.
 Furthermore, one non-rank-and-file Republican, Senator John McCain, is apparently playing spoiler. Earlier this week, while refusing to say whether he supported the Paulson plan, he claimed not to have had a chance to read it; the plan is all of three pages long. Then he inserted himself into the delicate negotiations over the Congressional plan, insisting on a White House meeting at which he reportedly said little -- but during which consensus collapsed.
 The bottom line, then, is that there do seem to be some adults in Congress, ready to do something to help us get through this crisis. But the adults are not yet in charge.

HEADLINE: U.N. Receives New Pledges Of Aid Totaling $16 Billion

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, announced on Thursday that the organization had received an additional $16 billion in pledges to fight a host of global ills like hunger and malaria, calling it an important signal that the world financial crisis would not impair aid efforts. 
 ''That expression of the global commitment is all the more remarkable because it comes against the background of a global crisis,'' Mr. Ban said at a news conference. 
 But his optimism was not shared universally, with some other senior officials suggesting that the ripple effects from the credit crisis would eventually force governments to cut back the amount of money they actually donate.
 The new pledges emerged from a special series of meetings attended by 96 heads of state or heads of government, which were held on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly, all focused on a series of eight development goals. They included $4.5 billion for education, $3 billion to combat malaria and $1.75 billion in aid to prevent starvation in the Horn of Africa. 
 Some of the bigger donations came from oil powers. Norway pledged $1 billion over 10 years to reduce child and infant mortality, while Saudi Arabia committed $500 million toward enrolling an additional 24 million children in primary school by 2010. 
 China offered to provide a battery of programs to improve agricultural yields, health care and education, as well as to promote clean energy in Africa. On the extended list of new pledges released by the United Nations, the only donation listed from the United States was $61 million over five years to help African farmers get better seeds. 
 A spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations said it was checking the figure, which was released late on Thursday. 
 Gordon Brown, the British prime minister who shared the podium with Mr. Ban at the news conference, said an economic crisis was precisely the wrong time to reduce development aid. Given the rising cost of food, fertilizer and fuel, for example, it was more important than ever to help African farmers improve their yields, he said. 
 But other officials said people expecting the latest commitments to be met were kidding themselves because the financial crisis was likely to cause Western governments to cut their budgets. ''Promising to get people more money for development?'' Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, said during a breakfast with reporters on Thursday. ''This is not true. We are lying.''
 The Group of 8 industrialized nations pledged in 2005 to donate more than $25 billion to Africa by 2010, but figures released by the United Nations this month showed that only $4 billion had actually been provided.
 Mr. Kouchner said the only likely way to increase aid was to get more donations from the private sector, which has been particularly effective in improving health care worldwide. Indeed, Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, also shared the spotlight with Mr. Ban and Mr. Brown at a series of events around the United Nations on Thursday. 
 Among the donations announced on Thursday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation made among the largest commitments from a nongovernmental entity. It pledged $168.7 million for fighting malaria and joined with the Howard G. Buffett Foundation in a $76 million pledge to help poor farmers win competitive prices for their crops.
 Critics of the Millennium Development Goals, as the eight targets are known, said they put too much emphasis on raising new money and not enough on improving the efficiency with which it is delivered.

HEADLINE: Iran's Leader Criticizes U.S. Policies Around World

BYLINE: By NEIL MACFARQUHAR; Azadeh Ensha contributed reporting.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, reviewing the various conflicts smoldering in his neighborhood, said Thursday that NATO forces paid insufficient attention to humanitarian problems in Afghanistan, that Iraqi forces should be given more responsibility for security and that he was ''unhappy'' with the situation in Georgia. 
 He agreed that Iraq was notably less violent than in the past, but attributed that not to American military strategy but instead to handoffs to the Iraqi military. ''In every sector where security has been handed over to the Iraqi government, things are calmer and managed better,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad, in New York for the annual opening of the General Assembly at the United Nations, said in an interview with The New York Times. He said this gradual transfer of power was one of the few areas in which Tehran agreed with American policy. 
 Seated before an Iranian flag in a small conference room in a Midtown hotel, the president held forth at length on American policy and history. The subtext running through many of his remarks was that he understood the hearts of the American people, who would express their natural affinity with the Islamic Republic if only Washington did not get in the way. 
 Growing world problems like war and poverty are the result of American mismanagement of global affairs, he said at one point.
 ''We don't want all this, we like to have friendships,'' he said. ''I really don't think that the American people like what they see either. If American people had the chance to truly express themselves they would definitely express opposition to how the world has been run.''
 He was distinctly less forthcoming about domestic problems in Iran. At one point when he started to grow testy while being pressed about economic problems under his administration, an aide sitting at his elbow advised him in Persian to stay calm while answering. 
 On Afghanistan, Mr. Ahmadinejad said he thought that the United States and NATO forces there were putting too much emphasis on a military solution in a country that they did not really understand. 
 ''They simply think that all problems can be fixed with military might and bombs and guns,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said. ''In Afghanistan, with the level of human calamity, a humanitarian approach must be adopted. Otherwise, extremism will be on the rise again, and next time NATO won't be able to stop it.''
 Iran had its own problems with the former Taliban government, which was especially abusive toward the Shiite minority in Afghanistan, and Iran cooperated with the United States in speeding its overthrow. At the time, it was seen as a possible route for detente between Washington and Tehran, whose ties soured with the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
 But that cooperation basically stopped in January 2002, when President Bush named Iran as one of three nations in an ''axis of evil,'' along with Iraq and North Korea. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad said Iran would be much more guarded about similar help in the future. ''We helped in Afghanistan; the result of that assistance was Mr. Bush directly threatening us with a military attack,'' the president said. ''For six years he has been engaged in similar talk against us. Next time around, we need to take more measured steps, more firm steps.''
 In speaking with a small group of reporters, editors and columnists from The Times for nearly an hour, Mr. Ahmadinejad echoed some of the themes he has voiced in other public statements during his visit this year. This included suggesting that the next American president should mend relations with Iran and pursue a less interventionist foreign policy. 
 Relations with the United States have long bedeviled the Islamic Republic. Confronting Washington is a cornerstone of the 1979 revolution for its hard-core supporters, but there is some sense in Iran that the public longs to shake off the country's pariah status in the West. Mr. Ahmadinejad appeared to be trying to satisfy both constituencies by saying that the door was open but that the Iranian government was in no rush to walk through it. 
 As in most interviews, while Mr. Ahmadinejad was free with advice about what the United States should do, he was reluctant to answer questions about domestic matters in Iran. He often tried to deflect them by pointing out that the United States had problems of its own, like the proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. 
 When he suggested that the United States fix its problems rather than meddle in other countries, he was asked whether many Iranians felt the same way about the Iranian government's financing groups like Hezbollah and Hamas rather than focusing on the country's domestic economic problems. 
 ''Iranians know best how to fix their problems,'' he said. 
 The president, elected in 2005 on a platform of improving the financial lot of average Iranians, did concede that Iran faced economic difficulties that he planned to address before seeking re-election next June. 
 He said that his government was trying to curb inflation -- which outside analysts put around 25 percent -- and he asserted that unemployment figures were improving. Officially, unemployment is around 11 percent, but some estimates put it as high as 40 percent among Iranians under 30. ''Of course, because of the high population growth in Iran, at a certain juncture of time, employment generation became a challenge,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said.
 Despite being one of the world's largest oil producers, Iran imports some 40 percent of its gasoline needs; an aborted attempt to lift heavy subsidies in 2007 led to riots. Mr. Ahmadinejad said that gasoline consumption in Iran was especially high because it was so cheap, but that his government planned to build seven new refineries to meet that demand. 
 He appeared confident that he would overcome the problems with a new economic policy, although he did not volunteer any details. ''Let's wait a few months and see how people will vote in the elections,'' he said. 
 On other issues, he blamed the United States and its allies for this summer's war in Georgia, saying they pushed Georgia's government to provoke Russia. But he said he did not support the Russian attack. ''We are unhappy with what happened there,'' he said. 
 He gave no ground on the continuing conflict over Iran's nuclear program, repeating that the United States could not tell Iran to stop enriching uranium and that Iran had no intention of developing nuclear weapons. He dismissed criticism of Iran's human rights record on issues like executing juvenile prisoners or jailing political prisoners, although he conceded that drug smuggling cases were an exception to the law stipulating that no one under 18 faced capital punishment. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad invariably courts controversy and the spotlight every year by predicting the demise of Israel from the podium of the General Assembly, although this year he ratcheted down his threats a notch by suggesting it would collapse of its own perfidy rather than be wiped out. He was once again widely criticized for suggesting that Jews -- he used the word Zionists -- controlled the political and economic policies of the West. 
 Asked why he had such an issue with the Jews, Mr. Ahmadinejad denied that his hostility was influenced by religion, and noted that Iran allowed its Jewish population to have a representative in Parliament. 
 ''The question is really over Zionism; Zionism is not Judaism, it is a political party,'' he said, responsible for ''crimes,'' death and destruction in the Middle East. 
 At a separate breakfast meeting with another group of journalists, including one from The New York Times, Mr. Ahmadinejad was asked how his words about the end of the American empire and the demise of Israel squared with his expressed desire for better relations. 
 He compared his statements to a traffic sign warning motorists of a cliff ahead, again suggesting he understood best the interests of all concerned. ''We are informing them,'' he said. ''It's really helping them.''

HEADLINE: As Washington Tackles the Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Regarding President Bush's speech to the nation about the financial crisis (front page, Sept. 25):
 During his tenure, President Bush has had two opportunities to exert moral authority: immediately after 9/11 and on Wednesday night. He failed both times.
 After 9/11, he urged the American people to carry on, to go shopping. He could have leveled with us, that we must break our dependency on oil (foreign and domestic), and urged Congress to increase both the gas tax and fuel economy standards. But he didn't. 
 On Wednesday night we got a primer on the credit crisis and his administration's proposed cure. He could have leveled with us, that every American who has taken on excessive debt is also culpable and has contributed to this crisis. But he didn't.
 A president can exert his moral authority in many ways, including his judicious use of the bully pulpit.
 But he hasn't. Paul Bartlett St. Paul, Sept. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 President Bush's speech to the nation Wednesday night included an accessible, sober explanation of how the country's financial sector arrived at its current state. It was the concise explanation that the public needed to hear before judging the proposed bailout.
 Of course, there is a problem. When few trust your judgment, few will accept your counsel in a time of crisis. That is the dilemma facing our president.
 Still, our duty as citizens is to support the best course of action and not to instinctively oppose a bill because of its executive sponsor. 
 There are many legitimate critiques of the administration's proposal. Simply that George Bush supports it is not one of them.
 Ken Fowler New York, Sept. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Fear once again reverberated through President Bush's address, with not a single word of acknowledgment of the failure of the government to stem the crisis.
 We rushed into a war with no assessment of risks, and we are now asked to bail out the banks with $700 billion as the starting price.
 As a free marketer, I would trust the market rather than the administration to resolve the crisis, and it would determine the price of instruments faster than a prolonged and painful government-engineered scheme. 
 Vembar K. Ranganathan Irvington, N.Y., Sept. 25, 2008
 The writer is a financial consultant in risk management.
 To the Editor:
 It took the great financial and political minds that control the American economy five years to create the current financial chaos. What makes them think that they can, in five days, program a solution to correct the problems they themselves created? 
 Bruce Atlas Whitestone, Queens, Sept. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Absence of Leadership'' (editorial, Sept. 25):
 We were told so many years ago that we needed to elect someone who would run government like a business. George W. Bush, our first M.B.A. president, was elected.
 Well, I am not so sure that ''running government like a business'' is going to be a mantra we hear much in the future. We've seen what ''business'' has done to our financial markets, our real estate market, our automotive industry, and so on. 
 By running our government like a business, the Bush administration, with our first M.B.A. president and C.E.O. vice president, has leveraged our government to the breaking point (see how our deficit has mushroomed under these ''business leaders'') and made decisions that have diminished not only our moral standing in the world but our financial standing as well.
 We can't afford to run our government like business; I suggest that we run it like a government, with elected officials consulting experts on issues, not lobbyists.
 Eric B. Maron Lafayette, La., Sept. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Rescue Plan's Basic Mystery: What's All This Stuff Worth?'' (front page, Sept. 25):
 This country has a long tradition of tapping its brain trust to solve complex problems. Think of the Manhattan Project for the atomic bomb or the Apollo program for our conquest of the moon.
 We harbor the world's best investment talent in Warren E. Buffett. Why not appoint him as a high-level adviser to solve the enigma of how much to pay for, and how to structure, the bailout plan? 
 Mr. Buffett has the right mind-set with his margin-of-safety approach. Is it worth 60 cents on the dollar or 20? Never mind: just pay way less than your estimate, and you're assured of an adequate return. 
 Shareholders, executives and boards of directors who oversaw the debacle would be punished, and taxpayers would come out ahead. 
 What will it take for us to act boldly and get this problem behind us?
 Marcelo P. Lima Miami, Sept. 25, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Investment banks are failing; many other banks are ailing and worse, not lending; the financial system is tottering. You, though, sally forth with another salvo against private equity, chastising the Fed for a sensible and measured proposal to stimulate private equity investment in the banking system (''An Inadequate Case for the Bailout,'' editorial, Sept. 24). 
 The Fed's action can provide stability, encourage long-term growth, stimulate lending to Main Street, and protect taxpayers. Contrary to your claim, banks drawing private equity capital will be subject to exactly the same level of federal regulation as any other bank.
 With $450 billion of equity to deploy, private equity is one of the only financial sectors that remain strong. Stifling its potential to strengthen American banks would be dangerously counterproductive.

HEADLINE: Sarkozy Stresses Global Financial Overhaul

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France tried to reassure citizens on Thursday that their savings and the nation's economy were safe. While the global financial crisis will have serious consequences for the French economy, he said, bank deposits will be guaranteed and individual taxes will not be raised.
 Mr. Sarkozy promised that the government would move ahead with its reforms, especially in shrinking the bloated state sector, and he called for an overhaul of the world's financial system, arguing that an era of unregulated markets was over. 
 ''A certain idea of globalization is dying with the end of a financial capitalism that had imposed its logic on the whole economy and contributed to perverting it,'' he said. 
 ''The idea of the all-powerful market that could not be contradicted by any rules, by any political intervention'' was ''a crazy idea,'' he said. ''The idea that the market is always right is a crazy idea.''
 Mr. Sarkozy spoke to a rally of 4,000 supporters in the southern city of Toulon, but his speech, described by his office as a major address on the economy, was televised nationwide.
 ''The crisis isn't over, and the consequences will be serious,'' he said. 
 ''Like everywhere else in the world, the French are scared. Scared for their savings, scared for their jobs, scared for their purchasing power.''
 The main threat to the economy, he said, is fear, and it can be conquered only by telling the truth. He called again for a conference of world leaders before year-end to address the underlying reasons for the crisis. 
 ''We've just passed two fingers from catastrophe,'' he said. ''Self-regulation, to fix all problems, is over. Laissez-faire is over.''
 Mr. Sarkozy emphasized that he was deeply engaged in trying to manage the crisis and would pursue his main economic reforms. Those include a shrinking of the large state sector, eliminating 30,600 jobs next year and streamlining local government, and allowing more workers, despite the 35-hour week, to get overtime pay without significantly higher taxes.
 But his speech, while long on rhetoric about the abuses of capitalism, was short on specifics, especially on regulating and improving the global system.
 The French are already anxious about their purchasing power falling behind inflation and are convinced that America's economic problems will worsen their own financial status.
 Already, forecasts for French economic growth for next year have been cut in half to about 1 percent, and slower growth will inevitably mean lower tax revenue and a higher budget deficit.
 In the budget he is scheduled to deliver on Friday, Mr. Sarkozy is expected to announce a freeze on government spending and a retreat from promises to balance the budget by 2012 -- a target that was already two years behind a European Union goal for member countries.
 The public deficit is expected to reach 2.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, and economists worry that without harsher spending cuts, France will exceed the 3 percent limit of the European Union next year. But the high deficit leaves Mr. Sarkozy little maneuvering room to avert a slowdown, especially since the European Central Bank, which controls the euro currency, sees its main mission as controlling inflation.
 French business confidence fell in September to its lowest level since mid-2003, according to Insee, the statistics office.
 On Thursday, Laurence Parisot, head of the main French business lobby, Medef, said that ''the financial crisis, which came from the Unites States, is something extremely serious -- it is a Sept. 11 of finance.''
 This financial crisis ''could provoke a very dangerous economic crisis,'' he said, risking a serious recession.
 Still, France has so far been reasonably well insulated from the American crisis, in large part because French banks are still heavily retail, mortgages normally require significant down payments and French regulations do not allow subprime mortgages. 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about calls for an overhaul of the global financial system by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France referred incorrectly to the head of the French business lobby Medef. Laurence Parisot is a woman.

HEADLINE: Taking On the Mortgage Giants

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator John McCain is correct: He warned two years ago that Congress should rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage finance companies, before their financial risk-taking threatened the economy, and Senator Barack Obama did not. But Mr. McCain overstates the role he has played, interviews and Senate records suggest.
Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, and his campaign have cited his co-sponsorship in 2006 of a Senate bill that would have strengthened government regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee, was ''silent,'' Mr. McCain tells campaign audiences, and he blames Mr. Obama's ties to Fannie Mae executives, particularly former chairmen James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines. Mr. Johnson has been a senior Obama adviser, but both Mr. Obama and Mr. Raines say they met once, for just minutes. 
The McCain camp has hammered this attack against Mr. Obama in recent days, to counter news media reports of his own campaign advisers' ties as lobbyists and consultants for the companies. Freddie Mac paid $15,000 a month to a firm co-owned by Mr. McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, from 2005 through August, just before the government seized the mortgage company.
''Two years ago, I warned the American people about the lack of oversight, transparency, backroom dealings and financial recklessness at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae,'' Mr. McCain said on Tuesday in Michigan. ''Those warnings went unheeded, and more than anything directly contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis which has created the perfect economic storm.''
Last week in Iowa, he told supporters: ''When I pushed legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Senator Obama was silent. He didn't lift a finger to avert this crisis.''
Mr. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, has echoed him. Asked by Katie Couric of CBS on Wednesday night for examples other than in 2006 when Mr. McCain was ''leading the charge for more oversight,'' Ms. Palin called that year's example ''paramount.''
The 2006 legislation that the McCain campaign cites was introduced more than a year earlier, in January 2005, by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, and co-sponsored the same day by two Republican colleagues, John E. Sununu of New Hampshire and Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina.
Mr. McCain added his name as a co-sponsor 16 months later, on May 25, 2006, and made a short speech in the Senate that day to note it. He did so the same week a regulatory agency filed a report charging that Fannie Mae had inflated its earnings, winning big bonuses for its executives.
''If Congress does not act,'' Mr. McCain said in the Senate, ''American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.''
Republicans and Democrats in the Senate familiar with the legislation and lobbyists for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac say that speech was the only action by Mr. McCain they recall on the issue. Mr. McCain ''never took on the role that some other Republicans did'' to try to limit the companies, said a former Freddie Mac executive who later lobbied for the company until its failure.
''I remember working against a number of amendments, and they were always introduced by Hagel and Sununu,'' said the former executive. ''John McCain was never anywhere to be found.''
Senators Hagel, Sununu and Dole were all on the Banking Committee at the time. Mr. McCain never was.
In response, the McCain campaign noted -- as it has on occasion before -- that Mr. McCain was a critic of the two companies even before 2006, when he was chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while shareholder-owned and long profitable, had government charters making them responsible for keeping cash flowing to banks for mortgage loans. That gave them an implied taxpayer backing should they fail. That government guarantee allowed the companies to borrow money at below-market rates, which they did to buy up the risky mortgage-backed securities that, along with their debt, brought them down.
A campaign spokesman said that in about 2003, Mr. McCain directed the Commerce Committee staff to plan a hearing on the compensation of the companies' executives. The staff did some work, but no hearing was held.
The McCain campaign also noted that in 2003 Mr. McCain was one of only five senators, all Republicans, who sponsored a bill to strengthen regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Neither the 2003 nor the 2006 versions came to a Senate vote. Democrats on the Banking Committee opposed them. Like Mr. McCain, Mr. Obama was not on the committee. In 2006, Senate Democrats proposed an alternative, but the White House opposed it as too weak and the legislation died.

HEADLINE: Financial Chill May Hit Developing Countries

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As Europe and Asia play down the need for an American-style bailout for their banks, the crisis may threaten a different class of countries: those in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa that depend on foreign capital and shoulder American-style trade deficits.
 Alarmed by the threat, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, is calling for a multilateral consultation -- involving the United States, Europe, China and other financial powers -- to develop a coordinated response to the crisis. 
 ''We're facing a systemic crisis, and it needs a systemic response,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said in an interview on Wednesday. ''The I.M.F. is the right place to organize a global response to weaknesses in the global financial system.''
 His initiative is an attempt to thrust the fund back into the thick of world events -- a role it played in previous financial crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America, but has not played in the current turmoil.
 Whether or not he succeeds, economists agree that Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, has identified a risk. The crisis, by squeezing the flow of capital, threatens countries from the Baltic to Africa that depend on foreign money to finance their deficits.
 ''There are a number of countries where you can get quite worried if capital flows stop,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''When you look at their high current-account deficits, Central and Eastern Europe seem particularly vulnerable.''
 A second category of countries are those who export oil or other commodities, and are vulnerable to a decline in prices -- something that economists said would happen if the crisis hobbled growth. Oil plunged last week as Wall Street teetered, but it bounced back as hope rose for a bailout.
 ''If the world economy does experience something like a global recession next year, those countries will be at risk,'' said Michael Mussa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 There are more than 20 countries with current-account deficits that exceed 5 percent of their economic output, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, putting them in what the fund considers the endangered category.
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn declined to name names, but outside economists listed Bulgaria, Estonia, Romania and Turkey as among the red flags in Europe. In Africa, they said, South Africa and Nigeria were worrisome; and in Latin America, Venezuela and Ecuador.
 The list, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, does not include the four largest emerging-market countries -- China, Russia, Brazil and India -- which are running healthy trade surpluses or have hundreds of billions in foreign exchange reserves, though Russia is vulnerable to a drop in oil prices.
 Western Europe, economists say, is unlikely to be seriously affected, despite having banks that hold mortgage-related assets. This has made European officials reluctant to heed the Treasury Department's call for them to undertake their own efforts to bolster the financial system.
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has resisted efforts by Congress to make foreign banks ineligible for the plan. But administration officials said they planned to set priorities on which ones to help, based on whether their governments were willing to help with the cleanup process.
 Two of the most threatened countries lie on Europe's eastern frontier: Bulgaria and Romania, which have racked up high current account deficits and are running overheated economies.
 ''These countries have been growing too fast or borrowing too much,'' said Peter Akos Bod, a former president of the Hungarian central bank. ''Should there be a sudden stop in capital, they would be in deep trouble.''
 Latin America is a perennial source of worry, given its history of troubled fiscal policy. For the moment, several countries, notably Venezuela, are benefiting from the soaring price of oil. 
 But if oil and other commodities were to decline, said John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who specializes in the region, ''South America would be less comfortably placed.''
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he recognized that the monetary fund would be largely a bystander in this crisis, given that the problems began in the United States and remain largely a domestic banking issue.
 But he said the fund could play a role in giving advice. Among its suggestions: rather than buy distressed mortgage-related securities from banks, the Treasury should swap them for bonds, which Mr. Strauss-Kahn said would be cheaper and leave some of the risk with the banks.
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he also planned to confront one of the most politically charged issues at the fund: strengthening its pressure on China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to rise. 
 Critics in the Bush administration and Congress say the fund has not pushed China hard enough on its currency. Mr. Strauss-Kahn acknowledged the difficulty of being tougher, given the politics of the fund.
 The fund's last multilateral consultation, to discuss global imbalances, was held in 2006. It included China, Japan, the European Union, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Mr. Strauss-Kahn did not say which countries would be invited to take part this time, though other officials said it would probably include those countries and emerging markets like Brazil and Russia.

HEADLINE: China Sends Three Into Space in the Nation's Third Manned Mission in Five Years

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
The Chinese Shenzhou VII spacecraft blasted off at 9:07 p.m. Thursday, carrying three Chinese astronauts into space on this country's third manned space mission in five years.
 The three-day mission is expected to include the country's first attempt at a spacewalk.
 The Chinese government has spent billions of dollars in recent years building up a space program that it hopes will help China establish a space station by 2020 and eventually will put a man on the moon, accomplishments that would certainly bring the country international prestige. 
 The launching of Shenzhou VII from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Gansu Province, which is in western China, was shown live on state television. 
 At a ceremony before the launching, President Hu Jintao praised the space project's effort. ''You will definitely accomplish this glorious and sacred mission,'' he told the astronauts before the launching. ''The motherland and the people are looking forward to your triumphant return.''
 China sent into space three experienced fighter pilots, all of them 42-year-old men. One is expected to walk in space for 30 minutes on Friday or Saturday, according to the state media.
 The three taikonauts -- the Chinese term for astronauts -- plan to run tests in space and launch a small satellite monitoring station. They are carrying traditional Chinese medicine on board, in case of sickness, and their diet includes shredded pork sauteed with garlic and grilled beef with spicy sauce.
 One astronaut is wearing what the state-run news media has dubbed ''the most complicated, advanced and expensive suit in the world,'' a $4.4 million space suit designed and produced in China. The spacecraft was launched by what the Chinese space agency calls the Long March II-F carrier rocket, which took the spacecraft into a low orbit, about 210 miles above Earth. The mission, which is being covered extensively in the Chinese media, is another milestone for a country that got a late start in space exploration but is now aggressively launching commercial satellites, putting humans in space and even shooting down aging satellites.
 ''They have joined a very exclusive club; only the U.S. and Russians are members,'' said Roger D. Launius, a senior curator and expert on space history at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, referring generally to China's space program. ''It's a great start, even though it's nowhere near what the Russians and the U.S. have accomplished with space flight.''
 Russia and the United States conducted their first spacewalks in 1965, and in 1969 the United States became the first country to put a person on the moon. 
 But Michael D. Griffin, the administrator of NASA, has repeatedly warned that despite the head start by other nations, the Chinese program is moving swiftly and could overtake American efforts to return to the moon by 2020. In testimony to the Senate last year, Mr. Griffin said it was likely that ''China will be able to put people on the Moon before we will be able to get back.'' He added: ''I admire what they have done, but I am concerned that it will leave the United States in its wake.''
 The Chinese government also hopes the national space program will aid the nation economically by helping to create technological breakthroughs that may someday be applied to computers or other digital equipment.
 India and Japan are now aggressively developing their own space programs, creating some competition in Asia for space flight, and the Europeans have joined forces to explore space.
 But China says its space program is speeding along, often with Chinese technology, helping establish the country as a technological power and bringing another dose of pride to the nation after the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer.
 Because spaceflight requires large booster rockets and other sophisticated technology that often has military applications, national space programs are often veiled in secrecy, and cooperation among nations is complicated.
 Indeed, on Wednesday, the F.B.I. arrested a Chinese-born physicist in Newport News, Va., on charges of illegally exporting space launching technical data and services to China beginning in January 2003. The physicist, Shu Quan-Sheng, 68, was born in China but was a naturalized American citizen. He has a doctorate in physics.
 Mr. Shu was also accused of offering bribes to Chinese government officials in exchange for a business contract, according to an F.B.I. statement.

HEADLINE: Germans Receive Bush Speech Coldly

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Trans- Atlantic sniping over the global financial crisis intensified Thursday after President Bush cited an influx of foreign money into the United States as one of the root causes of the tight credit market. 
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, countered in a speech in Berlin that the conditions that gave rise to the current turmoil in the markets were allowed to develop because of a reckless pursuit of short-term profit and huge bonuses in ''Anglo-Saxon'' financial centers -- along with a lack of political backbone to stand up to what he characterized as bankers' greed. 
 ''Investment bankers and politicians in New York, Washington and London were not willing to give these up,'' he said. ''The financial market crisis is above all an American problem.'' 
 The long-term consequences, Mr. Steinbruck added, could be serious for the United States. ''The U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system,'' he told the Bundestag. ''The world financial system will become multipolar.'' 
 In its tone and emphasis, Mr. Steinbruck's diagnosis differed markedly from that offered on Wednesday night by President Bush in a prime-time speech. Mr. Bush cited ''serious negative consequences'' from a credit bubble that was inflated for more than a decade when ''a massive amount of money flowed into the United States from investors abroad.'' The inflow of foreign money, he said, was driven by the attractiveness and security of American financial markets. 
 Economists say the appetite for spending by the American consumer has made foreign investment necessary to finance the deficit in the current account for the United States. 
 The comments on both sides of the Atlantic seemed to be intended to underline contrasting positions on the response to the financial crisis. 
 Mr. Bush used his televised address to try to rally support for a $700 billion rescue aimed at getting banks to start lending again. His administration has urged European and Asian policy makers to follow with similar measures, a call that leaders elsewhere have generally rebuffed. 
 Mr. Steinbruck reaffirmed Berlin's opposition to any large-scale bailout of the financial system in Germany and across Europe, saying any intervention should be aimed at a deal with specific problems. Germany has stepped in to help certain banks affected by the credit crisis, like IKB Deutsche Industriebank. 
 He said the German financial system had weathered the storm better in part because it was anchored by universal banks like Deutsche Bank, with operations that include everything from consumer lending to investment banking. 
 On Wall Street, the last two big independent investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, have taken steps to move toward such a model as the crisis deepened with the collapse of one of their smaller rivals, Lehman Brothers. 
 Mr. Steinbruck said that as a result of the crisis, European banks would play a greater role in the world financial system, along with sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East. He also called for greater regulation of the financial system, as President Nicolas Sarkozy of France did earlier this week.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton's Return Poses a Test of Party Loyalty

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
In a week when a great financial crisis came to a head and the presidential campaign reached a kind of warp-speed intensity, the man who seemed most likely to be there when you turned on a television was not the president or the treasury secretary or the candidates. It was Bill Clinton.
 As usual, he had a lot to say. What was unusual was the stir he made for things he did not say. 
 Mr. Clinton made appearances on morning news shows and late-night talk shows, many or all of them scheduled to coincide with the three-day annual meeting in New York of the Clinton Global Initiative. 
 His passion about the philanthropic conference was clear.
 But perhaps because of the contrast with that passion, Mr. Clinton's answers to questions about the presidential race between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain seemed to some Obama supporters like the damning faint praise of a Democratic holdout.
 The question arose Thursday, when both candidates appeared at Mr. Clinton's conference -- Mr. McCain in person, Mr. Obama via satellite. Was this a metaphor for Mr. Clinton's relationship with each one, or just a scheduling conflict? 
 Mr. Clinton has repeatedly described Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, as honest and trustworthy, though the Obama campaign has argued that Mr. McCain's campaign rhetoric indicates otherwise. Mr. Clinton has missed few opportunities, while allowing that he disagrees politically with Mr. McCain, of Arizona, to say how much he likes the senator and to praise him for his support of Mr. Clinton's efforts as president to normalize relations with Vietnam and intervene in Bosnia.
 Mr. Clinton also went out of his way to praise Mr. McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska. ''I come from Arkansas,'' he told reporters, ''I get why she's hot out there.''
 As comfortable as Mr. Clinton is in saying, ''I like John McCain,'' and ''I like Sarah Palin,'' no one seems to have heard him say the same for Mr. Obama. Instead, when speaking of Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee, Mr. Clinton has assumed a professorial stance that sometimes drifts toward emotional aloofness and disregard. 
 ''Is it me, or he didn't want to say the name 'Barack Obama'?'' the comedian Chris Rock asked with barely contained anger when he appeared Monday night on ''Late Show With David Letterman'' immediately after Mr. Letterman's 15-minute interview with Mr. Clinton. 
 Answering Mr. Letterman's questions, Mr. Clinton gave a dispassionate discourse on the cultural and political dynamics of the race, which, he said, would ultimately play in Mr. Obama's favor. Mr. Clinton mentioned his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had lost the Democratic primary to Mr. Obama, far more often than he mentioned the party's standard-bearer. And in predicting victory for Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton suggested that it would happen because people were hurting economically. He did not say that Mr. Obama's victory would be because voters especially wanted Mr. Obama to be president.
 ''People will wind up liking both of them,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''People will go in that polling booth and say: 'You know, I really admire Senator McCain. He gave about all you could give to this country without getting killed for it. But I've got to have a change, and I'm going the other way.' ''
 By ''the other way,'' he apparently meant Mr. Obama. 
 Recently, Mr. Clinton said he planned to campaign for Mr. Obama in Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has been campaigning for her former rival, and has urged her former donors to contribute to his campaign.
 It has been widely reported that there is no love lost between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama. But Mr. Clinton's plans for campaigning, and his rousing endorsement speech at the Democratic convention last month -- after the long and bitter contest between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton -- are formidable acts of party loyalty and personal discipline.
 And on Thursday, as if to make up for what has been perceived as his week of political neutrality, Mr. Clinton introduced Mr. Obama's speech at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting with an extended accolade. He described Mr. Obama as thoughtful, incisive and committed to the goals of bringing peace and prosperity to his country and the world.
 It was a ringing statement of respect, if still not quite the easy affection Mr. Clinton expresses when speaking of Mr. McCain.
 The night after his appearance on Mr. Letterman's show, Mr. Clinton was on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' where Mr. Stewart defended him against the charge of aloofness and suggested that the only way to satisfy some Obama supporters would be ''to get a tattoo or some type of permanent bumper sticker'' placed on his person.
 Without smiling, Mr. Clinton said: ''The purpose of this election is not for people to pass emotional hurdle tests. This is not a Rorschach test. This is about winning an election that can change the future of the country.''
 On ''Larry King Live'' the next night, Mr. Clinton said that while John McCain was a friend -- one who had ''stood up to his party'' to help normalize relations with Vietnam, ''stood up to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia,'' and was a national hero -- Mr. Obama's political views ''are much closer to what Hillary and I want.''

HEADLINE: Norway Finds Virtue (and Value) in Transparency

BYLINE: By GREGORY ROTH

 BODY:
FED by its vast North Sea oil riches, Norway's 10-year-old sovereign wealth fund, called the Pension Fund, has grown to more than $400 billion under management. It ranks as the world's second-largest sovereign fund behind the $875 billion Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. 
 The Pension Fund is managed by the Central Bank of Norway, and only 4 percent a year goes into the country's budget. Yngve Slyngstad (pronounced ING-vay SLING-stad), who became the fund's chief executive in January, has witnessed firsthand how the market's latest convulsions affect a fund of this magnitude. 
 Apart from its sheer size, the fund is most widely known for transparency and shareholder activism, which set it apart from its sovereign fund peers in the Middle East and East Asia. The interview was conducted two weeks ago. Mr. Slyngstad responded to a follow-up question on Friday via e-mail. That exchange is first, followed by excerpts from the interview.
 Q. Are there lessons the United States could learn from Scandinavian countries, which dealt with their own banking and financial crisis in the early 1990s?
 A. To some extent, the United States may be confronted with a choice between a short, very painful experience as in the Scandinavian crisis, or a very long period of setbacks as in the Japanese experience of the 1990s.
 Q. What has been your biggest surprise as chief executive of the Pension Fund?
 A. We did not prepare for an oil price above $100. The forecast we had was way below that, so of course this massive cash flow has been a surprise. We went into this year with an estimated cash flow of $1 billion a week, but it's been way higher than that.
 Q.Are you hearing from people who worry that the oil bounty may slow down now that oil has dropped sharply from its peak?
 A. It comes down to deep cultural roots where we have a propensity to put things aside -- maybe because of the cold winters, you have to save until the next summer. 
 Q. Do you view the crisis in the financial markets as an opportunity?
 A. We certainly see this crisis as an opportunity for the fund. A volatile market is something that we, in one sense, appreciate because volatility, in itself, should give you higher risk premiums in the assets you're buying.
 Q. Over the first six months of 2008, the fund reduced its holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt by almost a third. Does this reflect a loss of confidence in the debt of these two lending giants, which are now backed explicitly by the United States government?
 A. It doesn't reflect a lack of confidence in these institutions or the U.S. system. I think you rather have to say that there are other investment opportunities in the United States that may look equally attractive or more attractive for the moment.
 Q.The International Monetary Fund just met in Chile to hammer out basic principles for sovereign wealth funds. Some of the larger Middle East funds seemed eager to preserve their traditional secrecy, saying that doing otherwise would hurt them relative to hedge funds. But you continue to emphasize openness and transparency. Does it help you or hurt you from an investing standpoint?
 A. From our perspective, the positives are greater than the negatives. Part of that is a reflection of how transparent we need to be toward the Norwegian public, which is the ultimate owner of the fund. But another thing this kind of disclosure gives is an enormous performance pressure. If you disclose it in detail, there's nowhere to hide. The results are visible to everyone. 
 Q.Norway has also stood apart from other wealth funds in Singapore, China and the United Arab Emirates, which have taken large, direct equity stakes in companies -- notably in the financial sector in the United States. Why has Norway stayed away?
 A. Well, we have created a separate unit that has the mandate to go in and do these types of investments. The environment has not gotten necessarily better for financial institutions during this year, so we have been very cautious. 
 Q.Explain to me why the Pension Fund does not invest in Norway.
 A. The whole point of the oil gushing up from the sea is to never have it hit the shores. Because if it hits the shores, it fuels up the domestic economy. When we look at history, most countries that have got this sudden windfall from natural resources, like the Spaniards in South America, they generally tend to blow up in one way or another.
 Q.The Pension Fund has become famous for banning companies, like Wal-Mart, Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold and Northrop Grumman, that don't meet its standards for worker rights, the environment or weapons technology. Do you discuss with those companies what has to be done for the fund to change its mind?
 A. First, there is a role division between us and the Ministry of Finance. We do not exclude companies. The ministry is solely responsible for that. We do corporate governance, we engage with companies, we discuss shareholder rights, but we don't exclude companies. We see exclusion as a defeat for our corporate governance efforts. So when a company is excluded, our work therefore ceases.
 Q.With a population of 4.7 million people, is there a point at which a pot of money like Norway has needs a bigger purpose?
 A. I think it has a bigger purpose, and the bigger purpose is future generations. People haven't said this is for future Norwegian generations or future world generations. It's not unthinkable that the next generation will be more idealistic and want to spend this money on causes outside of Norway. We hope that our work on corporate governance, as well as child labor, also will benefit future generations outside of Norway.

HEADLINE: A Neighborhood Is Reborn After a Killing on Prince Avenue

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MAAG

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
Daniel Lewis loved three things in this world: his family, his lawn and his block. He died defending them all in his quiet way, tending to his front yard and waving to people as they drove by.
 With poverty and chaos closing in around him, Mr. Lewis offered both a welcome and a warning with his wave.
 ''Everybody knew you don't mess around on Prince Avenue because he was always there, watching,'' said Charles Lewis, 48, Mr. Lewis's son. ''Huh-uh. Wrong street.'' 
 Mr. Lewis, 75, was killed June 27 as he sat in his wheelchair surrounded by his great-grandchildren, who were playing in his yard. But in the death of its guardian, Prince Avenue found two dozen more.
 The killing, which occurred when a passenger in a passing car fired at someone driving in the opposite direction, inspired the neighbors to organize.
 The new neighborhood group, which has no name yet, held its third meeting last month in a neighbor's driveway. Twenty-five people sat on folding chairs, eating pasta salad. 
 ''We have nice people living on this street,'' said Dennis Harris, 50, a Prince Avenue homeowner for 21 years. ''We don't have to live like this.''
 Finally everybody divided into committees. One group is developing a phone tree. Another is organizing a block watch. 
 ''This crime incensed the community,'' said Cmdr. Roy Rich of the Fourth Police District. A suspect, Eric Carson, 28, has been charged with multiple counts including aggravated murder, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Cuyahoga County.
 Mr. Lewis's death stung not just because he was an innocent victim, but also because he was the defender of a middle-class way of life that is now nearly extinct on the east side of Cleveland, recently named the country's second-poorest city, after Detroit, by the Census Bureau. 
 Among people who grew up in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood, Mr. Lewis's block of Prince Avenue is alternatively called Prince Heights or Upper Prince or simply ''the suburbs.'' Surrounded by empty factories and rows of shabby duplexes, it is the only block for miles where the yards are manicured, the houses well kept, and neighbors know one another by name. 
 ''We are an island,'' said Debra Lewis-Curlee, 56, Mr. Lewis's daughter. 
 Mr. Lewis was that island's sentinel. He bought a little white house on Prince Avenue in 1974. 
 ''It was paradise,'' said his widow, Magnolia Lewis.
 Starting out as a school custodian, Mr. Lewis worked three jobs, eventually retiring as a supervisor for the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority. If he was home, Mr. Lewis was usually outside, trimming his flowers and keeping an eye on things. 
 ''Dad taught us that being middle-class isn't about economics,'' Ms. Lewis-Curlee said. ''It's a mindset. You work hard. You take care of your house and your neighborhood and the people around you.''
 Mr. Lewis made sure his block stayed nice by encouraging family members to move to the street whenever a house went up for sale. Ms. Lewis-Curlee, now executive director of a neighborhood improvement group, left a nearby suburb to buy a house on Prince Avenue. Charles Lewis moved into the family home. Last winter, Ms. Lewis-Curlee's daughter bought a house on the block. 
 ''I like it here,'' said the daughter, Bahiya Lewis, 29, ''because I can go away for two weeks and know that my neighbors are keeping my house safe.'' 
 Mr. Lewis founded a block club. Its stated purpose was to watch over the street, but really it was just an excuse for men on Prince Avenue to gather and watch Cleveland Indians games on television.
 ''We never needed to do anything special to keep the place nice,'' Charles Lewis said. ''People just did it on their own.''
 The surrounding neighborhood changed in the 1990s, Charles Lewis said. Drug dealers began congregating on nearby corners, and young men shot guns and firecrackers. Every year, their shouts and pops grew closer.
 ''Just this summer, this corner here got crazy,'' said Ella Mae Settles, 73, who owns a beauty salon on the corner. ''They shot out all the streetlights. I'm walking on eggshells and wondering how far these kids will go.''
 Finally, lawlessness crept onto Prince Avenue itself. Children from other streets ran down the block with firecrackers, Mrs. Lewis said. Teenagers squatted on the sidewalk to shoot dice and gamble. The family at the far end of the block moved out, and now the house is boarded up.
 Even after two hip surgeries and a stroke, Mr. Lewis returned to his yard. He growled from his wheelchair, telling children to stay off his lawn and pick up their gum wrappers. Two weeks before her husband died, Mrs. Lewis attended a neighborhood meeting. She told her city councilman, Robert J. White, that with all the rowdy young people on the corner, somebody might get hurt.
 ''Daniel Lewis and his family never abandoned the neighborhood for greener pastures just because things got tough,'' said Blaine A. Griffin, executive director of the Cleveland Community Relations Board, which addresses neighborhood quality-of-life issues.
 After Mr. Lewis's death, some neighbors wanted to place teddy bears at the crime scene. His widow refused. They would organize instead, she said.
 ''We're a little different,'' said Mrs. Lewis, 74. ''You can't hang on this block. This here is my block.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. CONCEDES OVERSIGHT FLAWS FUELED COLLAPSE

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a longtime proponent of deregulation, acknowledged on Friday that failures in a voluntary supervision program for Wall Street's largest investment banks had contributed to the global financial crisis, and he abruptly shut the program down. 
 The S.E.C.'s oversight responsibilities will largely shift to the Federal Reserve, though the commission will continue to oversee the brokerage units of investment banks. 
 Also Friday, the S.E.C.'s inspector general released a report strongly criticizing the agency's performance in monitoring Bear Stearns before it collapsed in March. Christopher Cox, the commission chairman, said he agreed that the oversight program was ''fundamentally flawed from the beginning.''
 ''The last six months have made it abundantly clear that voluntary regulation does not work,'' he said in a statement. The program ''was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, because investment banks could opt in or out of supervision voluntarily. The fact that investment bank holding companies could withdraw from this voluntary supervision at their discretion diminished the perceived mandate'' of the program, and ''weakened its effectiveness,'' he added.
 Mr. Cox and other regulators, including Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, have acknowledged general regulatory failures over the last year. Mr. Cox's statement on Friday, however, went beyond that by blaming a specific program for the financial crisis -- and then ending it. 
 On one level, the commission's decision to end the regulatory program was somewhat academic, because the five biggest independent Wall Street firms have all disappeared. 
 The Fed and Treasury Department forced Bear Stearns into a merger with JPMorgan Chase in March. And in the last month, Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs changed their corporate structures to become bank holding companies, which the Federal Reserve regulates. 
 But the retreat on investment bank supervision is a heavy blow to a once-proud agency whose influence over Wall Street has steadily eroded as the financial crisis has exploded over the last year. 
 Because it is a relatively small agency, the S.E.C. tries to extend its reach over the vast financial services industry by relying heavily on self-regulation by stock exchanges, mutual funds, brokerage firms and publicly traded corporations.
 The program Mr. Cox abolished was unanimously approved in 2004 by the commission under his predecessor, William H. Donaldson. Known by the clumsy title of ''consolidated supervised entities,'' the program allowed the S.E.C. to monitor the parent companies of major Wall Street firms, even though technically the agency had authority over only the firms' brokerage firm components.
 The commission created the program after heavy lobbying for the plan from all five big investment banks. At the time, Mr. Paulson was the head of Goldman Sachs. He left two years later to become the Treasury secretary and has been the architect of the administration's bailout plan.
 The investment banks favored the S.E.C. as their umbrella regulator because that let them avoid regulation of their fast-growing European operations by the European Union. 
 Facing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Mr. Cox has begun in recent weeks to call for greater government involvement in the markets. He has imposed restraints on short-sellers, market speculators who borrow stock and then sell it in the hope that it will decline. On Tuesday, he asked Congress for the first time to regulate the market for credit-default swaps, financial instruments that insure the holder against losses from declines in bonds and other types of securities. 
 The commission will continue to be the primary regulator of the companies' broker-dealer units, and it will work with the Fed to supervise holding companies even though the Fed is expected to take the lead role. 
 The Fed had already begun regulating Wall Street firms that borrowed money under a new Fed lending program, and the S.E.C. had entered into an agreement under which its examiners worked jointly with Fed examiners, an arrangement that is expected to continue. 
 The S.E.C. will still have primary responsibility for regulating securities brokers and dealers.
 The announcement was the latest illustration of how the market turmoil was rapidly changing the regulatory landscape. In the coming months, Congress will consider overhauls to the regulatory structure, but the markets and the regulators are already transforming it in response to events.
 Still, the inspector general's report made a series of recommendations for the commission and the Federal Reserve that could ultimately reshape how the nation's largest financial institutions are regulated. The report recommended, for instance, that the commission and the Fed consider tighter limits on borrowing by the companies to reduce their heavy debt loads and risky investing practices.
 The report found that the S.E.C. division that oversees trading and markets had failed to update the rules of the program and was ''not fulfilling its obligations.'' It said that nearly one-third of the firms under supervision had failed to file the required documents. And it found that the division had not adequately reviewed many of the filings made by other firms.
 The division's ''failure to carry out the purpose and goals of the broker-dealer risk assessment program hinders the commission's ability to foresee or respond to weaknesses in the financial markets,'' the report said.
 The S.E.C. approved the consolidated supervised entities program in 2004 after several important developments in Congress and in Europe. 
 In 1999, the lawmakers adopted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which broke down the Depression-era restrictions between investment banks and commercial banks. As part of a political compromise, the law gave the commission the authority to regulate the securities and brokerage operations of the investment banks, but not their holding companies.
 In 2002, the European Union threatened to impose its own rules on the foreign subsidiaries of the American investment banks. But there was a loophole: if the American companies were subject to the same kind of oversight as their European counterparts, then they would not be subject to the European rules. The loophole would require the commission to figure out a way to supervise the holding companies of the investment banks.
 In 2004, at the urging of the investment banks, the commission adopted a voluntary program. In exchange for the relaxation of capital requirements by the commission, the banks agreed to submit to supervision of their holding companies by the agency.

HEADLINE: Save Pensions

BYLINE: By TERESA GHILARDUCCI. 
Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, is the author of ''When I'm 64: The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them.''

 BODY:
THE meltdown in the financial industry isn't merely a housing story populated by panicked home owners. Near retirees' and retirees' lives have been turned upside down, too, as their risky 401(k) savings accounts erode. 
It's too bad that, in their plan to bail out investment firms, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, do not address the problems of older workers and retirees. The Treasury-Federal Reserve proposal should give not only investment banks but also retirees and those close to retirement the option to clear the junk -- bad mortgage-based securities and their derivatives -- out of their 401(k) accounts and invest in government-guaranteed bonds.
Then, once the current losses are stemmed, the federal government should protect Americans from further risks to the savings they set aside for their old age by creating a more secure system of investments for retirement accounts.
For the past 20 years, traditional pension plans, which paid benefits based on an employee's years of service and pay, have been gradually replaced by individual accounts loaded with stocks and more exotic holdings, which provide benefits based on fluctuations in the financial markets. Today, only 18 percent of the work force, at most, including government workers and most private unionized workers, still have old-fashioned ''defined benefit'' plans.
This transformation has largely been the result of government policies that have encouraged, through tax breaks, the creation of 401(k)-type plans and promoted an approach to investing that favors risky stocks and bonds held in high-fee commercial accounts.
As the financial market implodes, the risks of this approach are becoming all too clear.
Policymakers in Washington should help Americans replace their risky accounts with new pensions more like the old kind with defined, predictable benefits. How would they do this? By setting up government-managed retirement accounts for every worker who does not already have an old-fashioned pension. Here's how it would work: Each person would contribute 5 percent of his or her pay. And the government would provide an annual deposit of, say, $600, and also guarantee a 3 percent return, added to the inflation rate. (In a year with 4 percent inflation, for example, the guarantee would be 7 percent.) The account would begin to pay out in fixed intervals when a worker began to collect Social Security benefits.
The government would pool the proceeds from all the accounts into a sovereign wealth fund, and get its 3 percent rate of return (probably more) by investing in a diversified portfolio of both safe and risky assets. The government is large enough to handle this risk.
By getting rid of tax breaks for those 401(k)'s (most of which are set up for wage earners in the top 20 percent), the federal government could save at least $80 billion. That would easily cover the $600 contributions to pension accounts.
Such accounts would help the people who need help the most -- the 50 percent of American workers with no pensions or even a 401(k) or similar plan. All workers need and deserve access to secure pension savings, protected from unforeseen ups and downs in the American economy and colossal messes in financial markets.

HEADLINE: Wachovia, Looking for Help, Turns to Citigroup

BYLINE: By BEN WHITE and ERIC DASH; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As concern spread Friday that more banks might run into trouble even with a $700 billion rescue for the financial system, Wachovia, one of those hardest hit by the housing crisis, became the latest to reach for a lifeline. 
 Weighed down by a huge portfolio of troubled mortgage loans, the nation's fourth-largest bank by assets entered into preliminary deal talks with Citigroup, and extended feelers to Wells Fargo and Banco Santander of Spain, people briefed on the matter said. The talks are early, and no deal may emerge from them. But it appeared Wachovia was seeking potential alternatives should the bailout plan being debated in Washington not pass quickly, or fail to provide enough help. 
 Wachovia has a $120 billion portfolio of mortgages loaded with adjustable interest-rate loans that allow borrowers to skip part of their monthly payments, much of which it inherited from its ill-timed acquisition of Golden West, the big California lender, at the end of the housing boom in 2006. 
 In July, the bank hired Robert K. Steel, 56, a former vice chairman at Goldman Sachs, from the Treasury Department, where he worked with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., trying to resolve the mortgage market crisis. Mr. Steel vowed to keep Wachovia independent and sought to raise $5 billion in capital over the next year by selling noncore assets. 
 But the bank's shares, which are down nearly 80 percent in the last year, plunged 27 percent Friday, to $10, as investors wondered about its health after the government's seizure of Washington Mutual on Thursday. 
 ''Wachovia has a real problem,'' said Len Blum of the investment bank Westwood Capital. ''Option ARMs are probably the worst mortgage products out there and Wachovia has a lot more of them than it has in tangible equity.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Wachovia, Christie Phillips-Brown, said: ''We are aggressively addressing our challenges and are working to strategically strengthen and manage capital and liquidity in this challenging environment.'' The bank, she added, expects ''that the Treasury plan under consideration by Congress is a constructive and important step toward restoring confidence and stability in our financial system.''
 The discussions involving Wachovia and other banks came as Congress sought to break an impasse over the rescue plan proposed by Mr. Paulson, which would buy soured assets from troubled banks to prevent further failures. But no matter what a final package contains, analysts say it is unclear how much it would help a number of regional and community banks stretched by falling home prices. 
 ''The Treasury Department plan will not prevent more bank failures,'' said Chip MacDonald, a lawyer who advises banks at the law firm Jones Day. ''The plan proposes to make purchases based on market prices, which are likely to be at a loss to the sellers. Such losses will deplete the sellers' capital, which only strongly capitalized institutions can absorb without raising additional capital or a merging with a stronger bank.''
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deemed 117 banks ''troubled'' at the end of June, up from 90 in the first quarter. Sheila C. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, said Thursday that more failures are likely, although they would constitute only a handful of the nation's 8,400 banks. 
 Many small and midsize banks do not have much exposure to the assets that are hardest to sell. ''The sludge is primarily in the structured products, exotic residential mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. 
 Those securities have tended to be held by big banks and Wall Street firms. Small and midsize banks, by contrast, have built up big positions of corporate and commercial real estate loans for which there is a market, albeit a depressed one. Unless the government offers higher prices, it is unclear how many of them would use the fund.
 What the bailout might do, however, is relieve pressure on the government's insurance fund, which guarantees deposits of up to $100,000 per account holder if a bank fails. As of the end of June, the F.D.I.C. fund stood at about $45.2 billion after suffering a nearly $9 billion loss from IndyMac Bank's sudden collapse.
 ''It's not exactly a panacea,'' said Mr. MacDonald. ''For stronger banks, the plan will help them reduce risk, attract new capital or merger partners. For failing banks, it will help the F.D.I.C. resolve them at a lower cost to its deposit fund.'' Instead, the Treasury Department coffers would directly absorb more of the losses.
 Those concerns were reflected in the stock market Friday, where investors pushed down financial shares as conditions for banks continued to worsen. In addition to mortgage defaults, losses tied to auto loans, credit cards and commercial real estate are increasing along with unemployment. Analysts now project that several hundred banks could fail over the next three years, far more than the roughly 150 or so that they estimated this summer.
 Smaller regional banks with troubled loan portfolios came under particular assault. Shares in National City, based in Cleveland, sank 25.7 percent to $3.71 even as the bank sought to assure investors that it remained well-capitalized and had not had an outflow of customer deposits, as Washington Mutual did.
 Thomas A. Richlovsky, National City's chief financial officer, said in an interview that investors had the impression his bank was a savings and loan institution regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, as Washington Mutual was. ''That is like saying Tina Fey is Sarah Palin,'' he said. ''We are not a thrift, we are not a mortgage company, we are a bank. National City has no option-ARM mortgages on its books but is selling off a portfolio of troubled home equity, subprime mortgage and other bad loans.'' 
 Downey Financial Corporation, a $13 billion savings and loan saddled with option-ARM mortgages, slid 48 percent to $2.03 Friday. Earlier this month, the Office of Thrift Supervision told Downey to provide a detailed plan to reduce its assets and strengthen management.
 Shares in Morgan Stanley, which suspended merger talks with Wachovia last week after the investment bank changed into a bank holding company, also dropped 8.7 percent to $24.75, after investors began to doubt that the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial group of Japan would follow through on a commitment to pump around $8 billion in fresh capital into the bank.
 In a memo to employees Friday, John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, said that the Mitsubishi deal was moving ahead ''as anticipated'' and that the two banks were exploring different ways in which they could collaborate.

PERSON: Don Ultang 

HEADLINE: Don Ultang, Pioneer in Aerial Photography, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Don Ultang, an early specialist in aerial photography who won the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for photography for documenting an egregious and possibly racially motivated assault on the field during a college football game, died Sept. 18 in Johnston, Iowa, where he lived. He was 91.
His daughter Joanne Ultang confirmed his death. 
On Oct. 20, 1951, Mr. Ultang and another photographer, John Robinson, were dispatched by The Des Moines Register to Stillwater, Okla., to cover a football game between Drake University, which is in Des Moines, and Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State).
Drake's star, Johnny Bright, was being spoken of as a Heisman Trophy contender. He had twice led the nation in total offense, and two years earlier, when he first played against A&M, he was reported to have been the first black player to appear on Lewis Field in Stillwater.
In the first quarter, an A&M lineman, Milbanks Smith, delivered several vicious hits to Bright, one of which was a forearm to the face as Bright stood in repose after handing the ball off to another runner; it broke his jaw. Mr. Ultang and Mr. Robinson, working in the press box, produced a series of six photos that depicted an obviously unsportsmanlike blow.
Published the next day and taking up an entire page of The Register, the photos had an immediate impact. Drake withdrew from the Missouri Valley Conference, and the incident hastened the requirement that college football players wear mouthpieces and helmets with face masks. Mr. Ultang, who had shot with a still camera, and Mr. Robinson, who had a sequence camera, shared the Pulitzer Prize.
(In a 1999 interview for an oral history project conducted by the University of Iowa journalism school, Mr. Ultang said his photograph of the play was identical to the final shot of Mr. Robinson's sequence. Mr. Robinson died in 1972.)
It was not uncommon for teams to go hard after the opposition's star player, and Mr. Smith always denied that the assault was racially motivated. In any event, the injury effectively ended Mr. Bright's college career, though he went on to play in the Canadian Football League and was inducted into its Hall of Fame. He died in 1983.
Donald Theodore Ultang was born on March 23, 1917, in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and grew up in Cedar Rapids. After graduating from the University of Iowa in 1939 with a degree in economics and an interest in photography, he was hired by The Register and shortly thereafter decided to learn to fly, signing up for a government-financed civilian pilot program. He joined the Navy during World War II and served as a stateside flight instructor.
As he told the story, on his return, he persuaded The Register to buy a plane for editorial use, like aerial photography. As the only pilot on the staff, he took pictures while flying the plane. He would let go of the controls briefly to shoot a flood, a train wreck or simply a segment of the vast Midwestern panorama with a heavy Speed Graphix camera, before circling around for another take, often just a few hundred feet above the ground.
''Low and slow is what kills pilots,'' Mr. Ultang explained in the oral history project. ''I had to be low to get the job done, and I simply kept about 20 miles per hour extra air speed.''
Many of Mr. Ultang's pictures were collected in ''Holding the Moment: Mid-America at Mid-Century'' (Iowa State Press, 1991).
''What I had to learn to do as I flew toward a subject was to time the moment when I started to bank,'' he said, ''so when I got into the full 45- or 50-degree bank, the subject was out in front of me. It gave me an unobstructed view of about five seconds.''
In addition to Joanne Ultang, who lives in Chicago, Mr. Ultang, who was widowed twice, is survived by two other daughters, Linda Powers and Ellen Caroline Ull; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
Mr. Ultang had flown to the game in Stillwater on that day in 1951, but to return to Des Moines and develop the pictures in time for the daily deadline, he and Mr. Robinson stayed only through the first quarter. By then, Johnny Bright was on the sidelines with a broken jaw.
''If all this had happened in the second quarter, we wouldn't have even been there,'' Mr. Ultang said.
Correction: October 4, 2008, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary last Saturday about Don Ultang, who shared the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for photography with a colleague for documenting what was possibly a racially motivated assault during a college football game between Oklahoma A&M and Drake University, misstated the given name of the A&M player involved in the attack on a black player for Drake. He was Wilbanks Smith, not Milbanks. The error also appeared in a caption for a sequence of pictures documenting the incident.

HEADLINE: Modern Market Thinking Has Devalued a Deadly Sin

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Greed, to put it mildly, is no longer good.
 Today, Gordon Gekko could not get away with the paean to greed that he delivered in the 1987 movie ''Wall Street.'' Not after Alan Greenspan denounced ''infectious greed'' before Congress in 2002. Not when every third book about finance and corporate power has the word ''greed'' in the title. Not when the presidential nominee of the traditionally pro-business party is blaming Wall Street's greed for the current financial crisis. 
 Denouncing greed, however, appears easier than defining it. 
 Over the last three decades, the average compensation for chief executives of major American corporations has gone from 35 times the average pay of American workers to 275 times. That increase, it is suggested, or at least implied, constitutes greed. 
 But what if the increase had ''only'' been to 100 times? Would that have signaled greed? What about 50 times? And why wasn't 35 times itself a sign of greed? 
 If the economy were humming along rather than melting down or freezing up, would soaring executive salaries qualify as greed? Or would such a suggestion be itself condemned as class warfare? 
 Greed is a notion, in fact, that comes positively bristling with religious and moral assumptions that modern culture does not quite know how to handle. Greed, a k a avarice, has long been ranked among Christianity's seven deadly sins. In some accounts, it is the deadliest, the ''root of all evils,'' according to St. Paul. Similar judgments can be found in the other great religious traditions. 
 But in the 17th and 18th centuries, European thinkers in search of political stability and order looked beyond the religious strictures that had manifestly failed to repress unruly rulers' passions for power, pleasure and possessions.
 Perhaps, it was argued, these passions could serve as checks on one another -- and soon passions were being viewed, well, dispassionately. That is, they were re-envisioned as more rational ''interests.'' 
 Finally, pursuit of commerce and economic interests were generally supposed to tame and channel the wasteful pursuit of glory and domination that had bred wars and royal display. 
 It was a remarkable mutation, described brilliantly by Albert O. Hirschman in ''The Passions and the Interests'' (Princeton, 1977): Greed disappeared and was reborn, domesticated, as self-interest.
 Greed did not really disappear, of course; it just became the province of moralists and novelists, like Carlyle and Dickens, and of preachers and politicians to this day. Those who dealt with economics, practically or theoretically, have preferred another concept.
 Don't look for ''greed'' in the indexes of most economic textbooks. When it does crop up in economics literature, the point is often to disabuse readers of their lingering sentimentality and soft-headedness. 
 Last fall, a year after the death of Milton Friedman, a short clip from a 1979 television interview that the Nobel Prize-winning economist gave to Phil Donahue surfaced and was gleefully featured on the Web sites of libertarians and defenders of free enterprise. 
 ''When you see around the globe the maldistribution of wealth, the desperate plight of millions of people in underdeveloped countries, when you see so few haves and so many have-nots, when you see the greed and the concentration of power,'' Mr. Donahue agonized, ''don't you ever have a moment of doubt about capitalism? And whether greed's a good idea to run on?''
 Mr. Friedman, a practiced debater, brushed past the question about ever suffering a moment of doubt about capitalism and went right to the matter of greed. 
 ''Well, first of all, tell me, is there some society that doesn't run on greed?'' he said. ''Do you think Russia doesn't run on greed? Do you think China doesn't run on greed? What is greed? Of course, none of us is greedy; it's only the other fellow who's greedy.'' 
 ''This is a world run on individuals pursuing their separate interests,'' he continued. ''The great achievements of civilizations have not come from government bureaus,'' he said, proceeding to a defensible if wildly oversimplified case for free enterprise as the only way ''so far discovered of improving the lot of ordinary people.'' 
 Doing his best to bounce back, Mr. Donahue protested that free enterprise ''seems to reward not virtue so much as the ability to manipulate the system.'' 
 ''And what does reward virtue?'' Mr. Friedman parried. ''Do you think the Communist commissar rewards virtue? Do you think a Hitler rewards virtue?'' And so on.
 This may not have been Mr. Friedman at his most brilliant or thoughtful, but he certainly carried the skirmish from behind this phalanx of straw men. More important, his impatience with Mr. Donahue's resort to the vocabulary of greed and virtue was not idiosyncratic; it was reflective of modern economic thinking. He did not deny their existence, simply their relevance and their moral resonance.
 Despite all the current talk of greed, then, one wonders whether it is not a kind of specter, flitting in and out of sight, momentarily frightening and yet finally bereft of the religious and moral conviction that might give it body and weight in the nation's deliberations. 
 In ''Wall Street,'' Gordon Gekko may have sounded a bit like Milton Friedman when he said that greed ''works'' and ''clarifies'' and ''has marked the upward surge of mankind.'' 
 But he did not actually say, ''Greed is good.'' What he said in the movie was ''greed, for lack of a better word, is good.'' 
 Economics has given us a lot of better words, from self-interest to incentive to profit. They do not mean the same thing as greed, but they have displaced it, obscured it -- and certainly demoted it from being a deadly sin.

HEADLINE: A Pigeon and a Stock Trader Are Stranded on an Island, See ...

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
On Wall Street, a black day is almost always followed by black humor.
 Over the last two weeks, in trading floor jokes, finance blogs, videos circulated on YouTube and doctored photos sent by e-mail between traders, Wall Street's tradition of gallows humor has been alive and well. 
 Here is one example making the rounds: ''What's the difference between a Lehman trader and a pigeon? A pigeon can still make a deposit on a Ferrari.'' 
 A 45-slide presentation of stick figures explaining the subprime mortgage, which first circulated earlier this year, has found renewed life on the Web, as has a video of the British comedians John Bird and John Fortune explaining subprime mortgages that has been a hit on YouTube.
 On Friday morning, after Russia lifted its ban on shorting stocks, traders were remarking, ''it's official, Russia is now a freer market than America,'' according to one hedge fund executive, who, like other traders interviewed for this article, declined to be identified because he did not want to be seen as making light of a serious situation.
 ''The problem is that it is not an isolated incident,'' said another trader at a hedge fund. ''You can't joke about Lehman or Morgan because you might be next.''
 The professionals are also in on the joke.
 On Thursday night, as the nation's financial system teetered, the comic Colin Quinn took the stage at the Comedy Cellar, a comedy club in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood, and riffed on Wall Street greed.
 ''These guys make Andrew Carnegie look like Bono,'' said Mr. Quinn, whose routine is often tied to news and politics, recounting his jokes in an interview the next morning. ''They make Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette look like Brangelina.''
 While the Wall Street crisis may not have infected the entire economy yet, it has certainly infected many of the nation's comics. 
 ''It's slowly creeping up as a topic,'' said J. R. Ravitz, the booker at Comic Strip Live, a comedy club on Manhattan's Upper East Side, of the Wall Street crisis. ''As this mess unravels, it's increasingly becoming a part of the jokes.''
 The crisis has provided adequate fodder for laughs -- even if few of the joke tellers actually understand the intricacies of high finance. ''Of course I'm doing it,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''It's what we do, baby.'' But, he added, ''it's hard to understand it. You need a reality show.''
 Earlier this year, Warren E. Buffett, who controls Berkshire Hathaway and is America's best-known investor, played a video of the John Bird and John Fortune skit at his annual shareholder gathering. The skit features a fictional investment banker named George Parr explaining the mortgage crisis as bankers packaging ''dodgy debts'' and then selling them off as ''structured investment vehicles.''
 Some stand-up comedians report that audiences, perhaps because they have not yet personally been affected by the crisis, are not rolling over in laughter at the finance jokes.
 ''Last weekend I was at Gotham Comedy Club and I was joking about it, and what struck me was that no one seemed upset about it,'' said Barry Weintraub, a stand-up comedian known for his riffs on news and politics. ''It's an interesting topic because they are telling us the sky is falling. But I don't know anyone whose head the sky is falling on.''
 But what about the jokes, Mr. Weintraub?
 ''The downside is that the government is bailing us out. But the upside is you can write one check for your insurance, for your broker and your mortgage, and you can write it out to George Bush.''
 Even CNBC is in on the act. On Friday morning, Rick Santelli, an on-air editor who reports from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, unleashed a zinger. Or not. ''The joke today -- McDonalds' default swaps are now cheaper than America's default swaps. Our drive-up window gives away more than cheeseburgers on the government balance sheet.''
 Cafepress, an e-commerce firm that allows users to design images and write phrases, then have them stamped on products like T-shirts, coffee mugs, stickers and buttons, has reported a boom in the sale of bailout-related merchandise.
 Some favorite phrases at Cafepress: ''Laymenoff Brothers''; ''Lehman stockholder: will work for food''; ''venti bailout, no froth''; and ''Merrill Lynched me.'' 
 ''Until recent weeks, most of the activity was political,'' said Amy Maniatis, vice president for marketing at Cafepress. ''With the bailout talk, within the last week we've seen a huge surge in uploads in socialist references, like, 'People's Republic of Wall Street,' with Paulson at the center.''
 There is one surprising beneficiary of the Wall Street humor: Sarah Palin, who lately seems to be the butt of fewer jokes as comedians turn elsewhere for material.
 ''It's stole the thunder from her, no question,'' said Chris Mazzilli, a co-owner of the Gotham Comedy Club. ''You can't not talk about it, especially in this city.'' 
 Mr. Mazzilli's partner in the comedy club, incidentally, is a banker at Merrill Lynch. He still has his day job. 
 You can't make this stuff up.

HEADLINE: Out of the Shadows and Into the Harsh Light

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE credit default swaps market -- a market that for years was kept out of view and away from any regulation -- has suddenly turned into a political hot potato in Washington.
 The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said this week that regulation was needed immediately, while the secretary of the Treasury said efforts were already under way to get things under control, and urged caution.
 Such swaps, which enable lenders to a company to purchase what amounts to insurance that will protect them if the company defaults on its debts, have grown exponentially in recent years, with the nominal amount of debt guaranteed rising to more than $62 trillion at the end of last year from $631 billion in mid-2001. 
 The sudden interest in the market stems from two separate but related developments. The collapse of a major firm in the market could set off a chain of problems, a fact that has scared the Treasury Department this year. 
 In addition, speculators who think a financial firm will fail can buy credit-default swaps. They will profit if they are right. But even if the firm is not in trouble, an increase in the price of those swaps may scare other investors, and send the company's stock down. That prospect has alarmed the S.E.C. As the political debate was growing, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade group, reported that the amount of outstanding credit-default swaps declined in the first half of 2008, something that had never happened before.
 The 12 percent decline, to $54.6 trillion, still left the market vastly larger than the total amount of debt that can be insured. The huge total reflects the way the market is structured, as well as the fact that someone does not need to actually be owed money by a company to be able to buy a credit-default swap. In that case, the buyer is betting that the company will go broke.
 Within that huge market, many contracts offset one another -- assuming that all parties honor their commitments. But if one major firm goes broke, the effect could snowball as others are unable to meet their commitments. 
 In regulated futures markets, contracts are centrally cleared. If you buy an oil futures contract on Monday, and sell it on Wednesday, you have made your profit (or taken your loss) and you no longer have any stake in whether oil prices rise or fall. But if you buy a credit-default swap on Monday from one firm, and sell an identical swap on Wednesday to another firm, you still face the potential of risk if the party that sold the swap to you is unable to pay when a default occurs, perhaps years later. 
 ''One of the major reasons that the government helped out in the Bear Stearns situation,'' Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. testified at a Senate hearing this week, ''was to avoid throwing it into bankruptcy with all the credit-default swaps.''
 Mr. Paulson said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was working to develop protocols for that market to deal with a failure of a big player, and indicated that he did not see a need for legislation.
 But Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, said Congress should act. ''Neither the S.E.C. nor any regulator has authority over the C.D.S. market, even to require minimum disclosure to the market,'' he testified. ''The market is ripe for fraud and manipulation,'' he added.
 The S.E.C. is investigating possible fraud, although no charges have been brought, and is looking for cases where someone may have purchased credit-default swaps to drive up their price and persuade others that a company was in trouble.
 The swaps market has been exempt from regulation since it began to grow, thanks to legislation the industry sought. The industry argued that regulation would drive business overseas, and that no regulation was needed because ordinary investors did not trade in the market.
 In announcing the decline in the amount of swaps outstanding, Robert Pickel, the chief executive of the trade group, said it reflected industry efforts ''to reduce risk by tearing up economically offsetting transactions, and demonstrates the industry's ongoing commitment to reduce risk and enhance operational efficiency.''
 The accompanying charts show the growth of the amount of credit-default swaps outstanding, and show how those totals compare with the total amount of outstanding loans from banks and others to corporations and foreign governments. Even with the decline, the swaps volume is more than three times the debt total.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Climbs Back From Early Losses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and CARTER DOUGHERTY

 BODY:
Will Washington's impasse become Wall Street's woe?
 Stocks ended mostly higher on Friday as the Dow broke through into positive territory late in the afternoon, even as a deal on the government's financial bailout package remained elusive. 
 Investors were hoping that lawmakers would put the pieces back together over the weekend to prevent the banking system from grinding down. But analysts warned that the markets could be under tremendous pressure on Monday if Congress and the White House failed to reach agreement by then.
 The Dow Jones industrials finished up 121 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at 11,143.13, after recovering from a 150-point dip at the open. The Dow was boosted by late-in-the-day gains among some financial stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-index, a broader measure of the market, did not perform as well, rising 0.3 percent. 
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 0.2 percent. 
 The seizure of Washington Mutual on Thursday night, which marked the biggest bank failure in American history, appeared to spook investors away from other retail banks that have been perceived as troubled. Shares of the Wachovia Corporation lost 38 percent and National City fell 26 percent.
 The declines on Wall Street followed moves by the world's central banks to add more liquidity to parched short-term money markets, which helped prevent a steeper fall in stock markets on Friday.
 But problems lingered in the short-term financing markets, with a benchmark rate for overnight lending between banks remaining near its highest level since 1999. 
 President Bush and Congressional leaders made appearances this morning to urge a quick passage of the bailout plan. It remained unclear, however, how far any agreement would go toward resolving the stress that has stopped up credit lines across the globe this week.
 Even if the government is able to buy bad assets, ''by no means will banks start making a bunch of loans,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research firm in Greenwich, Conn. The bailout plan, he said, ''might save us from a much deeper downturn. I think that's really all you can expect from it.''
 Still, Mr. Darda warned of the ''massive stress'' in the credit markets, which businesses depend on for day-to-day costs like utilities and payroll. While credit is not as tight as last week, banks are still hoarding cash and refusing to lend, cutting off critical arteries of the financial system.
 ''If we get nothing out of Washington, or it's botched, then you're looking at a much more serious downturn,'' Mr. Darda said. 
 To help ease the immense pressures on credit markets, global central banks expanded a program on Friday that lends dollars in major financial centers. 
 In a crucial change, they began to lend new dollar-denominated funds for a full week, rather than the usual overnight term. 
 Banks borrowed $35 billion from the European Central Bank, $30 billion from the Bank of England and $9 billion from the Swiss National Bank.
 Overnight, the Federal Reserve increased by $13 billion, to $277 billion, a currency swap facility that allows other central banks to lend dollars.
 Despite the effort, indexes in Frankfurt, London and Paris were all closed down on Friday. The FTSE 100 in London and Frankfurt's DAX lost about 2 percent; the CAC 40 in Paris fell 1.5 percent. The negative sentiment was eased somewhat by the widespread assumption among investors that the collapse of negotiations over the United States rescue plan was a delay, rather than a failure.
 Nonetheless, the financial world found itself once again contemplating both the limits of central banks to break an acute crisis mentality in the absence of a political solution, and the economic consequences of no bailout at all.
 ''The psychology is that the markets have priced in this plan,'' said a senior executive at a major European financial services company, who did not wish to be named because of the sensitivity in the market to the negotiations. ''If that were not to happen I think it would be the beginning of a very serious downturn.''
 In Asia, Japan's Nikkei index lost 0.9 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell by 1.3 percent.
 The three-month Euribor rate, a gauge of bank lending in the 15 countries that use the euro, jumped to 5.142 percent, its highest level since early 1995. The six-month Euribor rate, a barometer that straddles the end of the year, when demand for cash is high, dipped slightly after reaching record highs last week.
 ''We'll move forward,'' the head of money-market operations at a major European bank said. ''I would not say things are getting better.''
 Indeed, with credit markets stretched so thin, borrowers and lenders found themselves disregarding the normal information provided by prices because it has become clear that they do not convey the gravity of the situation.
 ''Liquidity in the money markets in maturities over a week is desperately scarce,'' Tim Bond, head of global asset allocation at Barclays Capital in London, told Bloomberg News. ''A near-term solution to the crisis is urgent. Unchecked, the current crisis would turn into a self-reinforcing vortex of defaults, bank-capital contraction and deep recession within a matter of weeks.''
 ''We are at such a point of absent liquidity that prices are beginning to fail in their usefulness as a signal,'' Claudio Piron, a strategist at JPMorgan Chase in Singapore, told Reuters. ''This in itself is disturbing.''
 After a White House negotiating session on Thursday evening that dissolved into partisan rancor, analysts were contemplating the notion that even central banks require a measure of political support to unleash their financial firepower over time. 
 Only last week, the Fed had to turn to the United States Treasury for $100 billion in government debt that the central bank then began infusing into the tight credit markets.
 ''Central banks still responding to developments as they crop up,'' said Julian Callow, the chief Europe economist at Barclays Capital. ''The question that will be asked is exactly how far this process can go. It's not inexhaustible.''
 Friday's slide began in Asia. However, China's stock market gained slightly on news that the government would ease requirements for purchasing shares with credit.
 ''The assumption is that the bailout will take longer than expected, which is negative,'' said Tsuyoshi Shimizu, a senior fund manager at Mizuho Asset Management, told Bloomberg News. ''As with Washington Mutual, the longer it takes to pass something, the more victims we're going to see.''
 Investors in Europe shared the sentiment, with major indexes in Britain, France and Germany all off. Eyes around Europe were glued to news tickers, anxious for any news about whether American officials had reached a deal on the bailout overnight.
 ''It's going back and forth for a couple of days now and that's clearly a set-back,'' said Steffen Neumann, a strategist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in Mainz, told Bloomberg News. ''It's now an issue of political close combat in the U.S. and investors continue to stand back and wait for the outcome.''

HEADLINE: Estimate of 2nd-Quarter Growth Lowered

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew less vigorously than previously thought during the second quarter and the snowballing financial crisis damped a rebound in consumer sentiment this month. 
 The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, the measure of total goods and services output, expanded at a 2.8 percent rate from April through June, rather than the 3.3 percent rate it estimated a month ago.
 The Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers said its consumer sentiment index reading slipped to 70.3, from 73.1 in early September, its worst slide within a single month since August 2005, when Hurricane Katrina caused widespread dislocation.
 ''The financial crisis has people worried,'' said Carl Lantz, a United States interest rate strategist at Credit Suisse in New York.
 ''The third and fourth quarter are shaping up to be pretty weak in G.D.P. terms, especially on the consumer side,'' Mr. Lantz said, noting that access to credit is limited and incomes are falling.
 The consumer sentiment index was still the highest since February.
 Growth in consumer spending was weaker than first estimated, pulling down the estimate of overall growth, while businesses made bigger cuts in investments, a sign confidence was sagging even before financial market turmoil deepened.
 Investors paid scant attention to the day's economic data, though, with the negotiations on a financial system bailout and the seizure of Washington Mutual, the biggest bank closure in United States history, roiling global markets.

HEADLINE: Help Housing

BYLINE: By CHRIS MAYER. 
Chris Mayer is a professor of real estate and the senior vice dean of Columbia Business School.

 BODY:
A T the heart of the financial crisis is an unprecedented decline in house prices. Yet the government response so far has been to try to prop up insolvent financial institutions while doing nothing about the underlying housing problem. The proposed Wall Street bailout would not stop the next wave of defaults, which are coming from the rapidly rising delinquencies in near-prime mortgages. 
The government needs to directly stabilize the housing market. This is equivalent to treating the infection with antibiotics, instead of applying a cold compress for the fever. Both the fever and the infection need treating.
The first step should be to reduce mortgage interest rates. In a normal mortgage market, rates are about 1.6 percentage points above the interest rate for 10-year Treasury notes. Recently, the difference has been closer to 2.5 percentage points.
The government is in a great position to cut rates by about a point: Through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration, it now controls nearly 90 percent of all mortgage originations. These lower rates would apply to most home buyers who take out a loan under $729,750 for a house that they will live in.
Along with lower rates, the government should provide temporary down-payment assistance for buyers. The government could, for example, match the amount of money that buyers use for a down payment, up to $15,000. Because the government now controls the bulk of all mortgage financing, this money could be provided directly at closing. Homeowners who refinance their current mortgages could also receive assistance, allowing them to avoid foreclosure.
Programs like these would draw buyers into the housing market and reduce the backlog of unsold and vacant homes. Investors and speculators would be ineligible and would face the full cost of their mistakes.
By stabilizing house prices, these programs would benefit the bulk of Americans, who own a home but did not get involved in the subprime mortgage market. Price stability would more directly achieve the goals of the Wall Street bailout: increase the value of mortgage-backed securities (by increasing the value of the underlying houses) while injecting government capital into the financial system.
Some in Congress have suggested allowing homeowners to go to bankruptcy court to lower their mortgage payments. But this would only make credit more expensive by reducing the willingness of companies to lend money. It would also worsen the current problems by letting bankruptcy judges reduce mortgage balances -- imposing even greater losses on the owners of the mortgages, whose problems are at the heart of the financial crisis. Such a program would also be limited to only the most indebted and, in some cases, financially irresponsible homeowners.
Some might argue that propping up house prices is what got us into this mess. But with the recent decline in house prices, my calculations suggest that the cost of owning a home today, relative to renting, is about 10 percent lower than its average over the past 20 years.
The credit crisis will not be over until house prices stop falling. Direct assistance for home buyers and homeowners is the best, and the fairest, way to make that happen.

HEADLINE: The Measures of a Student's Potential

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''College Panel Urges Shift Away From SATs'' (news article, Sept. 22):
While I and many other school leaders have railed against the SATs for many years, the report by a commission of deans of admission of leading colleges hints at an even more debilitating test scheme.
Members of the commission, and many other leaders in higher education, declare a preference for subject tests, like those administered by the College Board, or other discipline-specific tests. 
The report suggests that such an approach would ''encourage high schools to broaden and improve curricula.'' As Gov. Sarah Palin said (or didn't say), ''Thanks, but no thanks'' for this bridge to nowhere.
Let us not subdue the frenzy to ''game'' one test and set up a frenzy to ''game'' multiple achievement tests. I can think of few developments as dangerous as a system of standardized achievement tests that drive high school curriculums and leach originality, creativity and individuality out of our schools.
We at the Calhoun School have abolished Advanced Placement courses in order to keep our school sane and because we don't want our students to be in this crazy chase.
If a system of standardized achievement tests is the proposed alternative, give me SAT test prep any day.
Steve Nelson Head, The Calhoun School New York, Sept.

To the Editor:
Who benefits when the SATs and ACTs are made optional? It appears that the high schools, colleges and the students benefit.
But in the long run, do they benefit? How can we tell if the students can read, write and do mathematics across all high schools? We need independent standardized tests.
Michael Bogner Manasquan, N.J., Sept.
22, 2008
To the Editor:
The recognition by college admissions counselors that the SAT is ineffective as a predictor of academic performance in college is long overdue.
There's enough information (grades, achievement test scores, class rank, interviews) for counselors to determine a student's acceptability at their college. Achievement tests that measure a student's knowledge in specific subjects are by far better predictors of academic ability.
It is good that college administrators have banded together to oppose the SAT, which is subtly imposed upon them by the powerful Educational Testing Service.
If colleges are unable to eliminate the use of the SAT, then perhaps it is time for Congress to investigate the misuse of these tests and the power ETS exerts on the colleges.
Max Tuchman Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Sept.
22, 2008
The writer taught high school mathematics for 30 years and was president for 23 years of a tutoring service that prepared students for the SAT.
To the Editor:
Recommending that colleges rely more on high school achievement and curriculums in place of standardized tests such as the SAT is misguided on two fronts: high school grades, like those in universities, are also subject to ''grade inflation''; and the extensive diversity in curriculums would require college admissions committees to make their decisions based on comparing apples and oranges.
Standardized test scores may not be perfect, but they are better than anything else on offer.
It is important to recognize that not every high school senior belongs at Harvard!
Ira Sohn Upper Montclair, N.J., Sept.
22, 2008
The writer is a professor of economics and finance, Montclair State University.
To the Editor:
I nodded while I read about the rejection of SAT and ACT scores by a commission of college admissions officials until I came to the part where ''a new achievement test'' was suggested to replace the SAT.
Any test, even one with the lofty goal of improving curriculum, means that schools and students will be focused on an exam, given on one day, for which someone will eventually develop an expensive test prep class.
As we move forward in education, we have to find new ways to help children and young adults think and create.
Who knows what students may need to accomplish in the future? Habits of mind, love of learning and maturity drive student success.
Kira Wizner New York, Sept.
22, 2008
The writer is a former New York City public school teacher.
To the Editor:
When my daughter was going through the college application process several years ago, we toured a top-tier college that had made the SAT and ACT optional as part of its application process.
When I asked an admissions counselor privately if standardized testing was truly ''optional,'' she told my daughter and me that strong SAT or ACT results would actually help my daughter's chances of admission, and to submit her test scores in order to strengthen her application.
While I applaud colleges and universities that make college entrance exams truly optional (and therefore are forced to look at a student's entire resume), the plan is only lip service unless the schools that take this road are firmly committed to reshaping the entire higher education application process.
Karen Peterson Oakland, Calif., Sept.
22, 2008
To the Editor:
To reduce the preoccupation with the SAT, the College Board should begin by taking one simple step: limit students to taking the test once in a 12-month period. This would increase equity, since many less advantaged students now take the test only once while more affluent students prep for and take the exam multiple times.
This step would show that the College Board, a nonprofit organization, placed public welfare ahead of its own revenue generation.

HEADLINE: Coping (or Not) With Injuries In Training For Marathon

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
It's the fall marathon season, as runners around the world know all too well, and as the training miles pile up, countless runners are feeling unexpected aches and pains -- and desperation. Will they recover in time to continue training and run 26.2 miles? Should they try to run through the pain to stay on schedule? Or would it be better to just give up on the marathon? 
 Well, injured runners, I feel your pain. I am one of you, the anxious masses of aspiring marathoners who are finding out that the journey to the start line may be more painful than the run to the finish. 
 I am entered in the New York City Marathon, scheduled for Nov. 2, and in my moments of pain and panic I knew I would never be ready. But I tried just about any remedy that might relieve the pain in my right forefoot, which has been screaming with each step since Sept. 8.
 I wanted to run through it, but even though I can tolerate pain, this was something else. Excruciating.
 What to do? Giving up on the marathon was never an appealing option. So I entered the world of injured but determined runners. 
 My marathon plans began in July 2007, when I found a distance running coach, Tom Fleming, who won the New York City Marathon twice, in 1973 and 1975. And I found friends to run with. 
 A year ago, I ran in a half-marathon in Philadelphia and loved it. As soon as registration for the New York marathon opened, I signed up. So did my son and so did my friend and running partner, Jennifer Davis, who has run more than two dozen marathons and races beyond 26.2 miles, including a 100-mile race last winter, which she won. She entered the New York race so we could run together, and she said she would keep me on pace.
 Her commitment only added to the desperation factor when I was injured and could not run.
 So I sent an e-mail message to Chris Martin, a triathlete who lives in Lawrenceville, N.J. Earlier this year, he sustained a stress fracture in his shin and could not run for three months. Three months later, he had a personal best in an Ironman triathlon.
 How did he do it? Pool running, he said, which maintained the running ''feel,'' along with intense workouts on an elliptical cross-trainer to maintain cardiovascular fitness. In pool running, the athlete wears a flotation belt to remain upright and runs for an hour or more in the deep end of a pool.
 He cautioned that ''it is really easy to slack and barely get a decent workout.'' He wore a heart-rate monitor in the pool to measure his effort, recognizing that heart rates are about 15 percent lower in the water. That is because the heart does not have to work as hard against gravity to pump blood. And he typically ran for at least an hour at a time.
 Martin, though, is not entirely won over. ''The bottom line is that the water running and training on the elliptical running machines were stopgap measures to limit the damage to my running fitness,'' he wrote.
 Dr. Alan Garber, a professor of medicine and economics at Stanford University, tried a similar routine. His injury was torn ligaments in his ankle, sustained when he stumbled on a tree root while running down a steep hill.
 Garber entertained himself in the pool by listening to music and recorded books on his iPod, including the entire unabridged version of ''War and Peace.'' When he got back on the road, he said, he could run, but his quadriceps were weak when he ran downhill. Still, he prevailed, running the Big Sur International Marathon just four months after his injury. 
 ''My time (3:26) was only one minute slower than the year before,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. 
 So I joined a gym (my third) solely for its pool. Jen belongs to that gym, too. She and I began pool running, jumping into the pool with our running clothes and shoes on just after doing the elliptical. 
 ''I'm determined to get you ready for that marathon,'' Jen said.
 She proposed a trifecta -- as soon as I can run, I'll go as far as I can with her, then we will hop on the ellipticals and work out long enough to attain two and a half hours of training. Then we will plunge into the pool and run there. 
 But after two weeks my foot was getting worse. I rode 100 kilometers (or about 62 miles) on my road bike Sunday. On Monday, I could walk only on the side of my foot. On Monday night, I could walk only on my heel.
 On Tuesday, I gave up and saw an orthopedist, Dr. John Kennedy at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. 
 He gave me the bad news. The bike ride was really bad for the injury. And the injury, he says, is a serious stress fracture, a hairline crack in a metatarsal bone of my foot. Even under the best scenario, I'm out for at least a few more weeks -- the only exercise allowed is swimming, not even pool running, not even the elliptical.
 In the meantime, I've deployed yet another weapon in my fight against marathon-training pain: a portable ultrasound machine that is supposed to speed bone healing by 40 percent. 
 Even if that works, the New York marathon is no longer within reach. 
 But there is a marathon in Jacksonville, Fla., at the end of December. Jen said she would run it with me.

HEADLINE: WaMu Tarnishes Star Equity Firm

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
David Bonderman's reversal of fortune is hardly one of the most dramatic on Wall Street, but it is one of the most startling. 
 When Mr. Bonderman, co-founder of the giant private equity firm TPG, engineered the firm's $7 billion capital infusion to Washington Mutual, many of the bank's shareholders protested what they thought was a sweetheart deal. 
 WaMu, as the bank is known, was drowning in mortgage-related losses, and in exchange for throwing the bank a lifeline, TPG and a group of institutional investors received about half the company -- at a 25 percent discount. 
 Mr. Bonderman, a legend in the world of private equity, received a seat on Washington Mutual's board. 
 But when WaMu collapsed on Thursday in the biggest bank failure in United States history, Mr. Bonderman's reputation was suddenly at risk of becoming a devalued asset.
 ''He should have known better,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, a provider of ratings and analytic tools. ''There is a certain bias people his age and stature have. He has hit home runs for years and he thought there would be a bounce.'' 
 Mr. Whalen said Mr. Bonderman and his colleagues would not have invested in Washington Mutual at all had they done their due diligence. 
 ''It was clear that WaMu's losses were going to consume the bank's capital and the confidence of investors. You could see it coming for quite some time,'' he said.
 Mr. Bonderman declined to comment for this article. 
 When the government seized Washington Mutual and sold large pieces to JPMorgan Chase, investors were wiped out, including TPG, which lost its entire investment of $1.35 billion, along with the other investors who joined the fund and put up an additional $5.65 billion last April in a futile attempt to save the bank. 
 But a person knowledgeable about TPG's funds, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about them, said that TPG's losses are spread across three of its funds, including $475 million from its newest $20 billion fund, TPG Partners VI. All told, TPG oversees $55 billion.
 Of course, a lot of smart people made what have turned out to be losing bets on American banks: Asian and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have invested and lost billions. 
 Colin C. Blaydon, director of the center for private equity and entrepreneurship at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, defended Mr. Bonderman. ''A lot has to do with hindsight about a set of circumstances that were totally unforeseeable,'' he said.
 To be sure, Mr. Bonderman, who hired the Rolling Stones to celebrate his 60th birthday at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas six years ago, is still a multibillionaire. He has a legacy of successful deals, including bringing Continental Airlines out of bankruptcy and buying J. Crew and Ducati, the Italian motorcycle manufacturer, and ultimately taking them public. 
 Still, detractors say even with the sweeteners, the Washington Mutual deal was ill-starred from the start. 
 Most important, they note, Washington Mutual specialized in option adjustable-rate mortgages -- mortgages that let borrowers defer payments on interest and principal. Such loans are risky for the lender because borrowers often buy homes that are more expensive than they can afford under conventional loans. 
 ''We felt that WaMu's balance sheet was toxic a year ago,'' said Donn Vickrey, co-founder of Gradient Analytics, an independent research firm that specializes in earnings quality and balance sheets. 
 He added: ''In September 2007, we identified WaMu as the largest risk large capitalization bank. We focused on them because if you read their statements, without reading the footnotes, you thought things were fine. But they were not writing off anywhere near a sufficient amount of their bad loans per quarter.'' 
 Mr. Vickrey noted that in September 2006, the bank's reserves stood at $1.6 billion, with its nonperforming assets at $2.4 billion. ''A year later, they had increased their reserves to only $1.9 billion, when nonperforming assets had soared to $5.5 billion,'' he said. ''And you knew the number would get worse because their loans were getting worse.'' 
 He said income, assets and equity were all overstated. ''I don't understand why it took so long for people to realize that this was the beginning of a trend that would continue for some time.'' 
 One answer may be that Mr. Bonderman had bought ailing banks in the past with great success. 
 In 1988, for instance, the Robert M. Bass Group, with which Mr. Bonderman was involved at the time, bought the troubled American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., an insolvent savings bank. Eight years later the bank was sold to Washington Mutual at a lucrative price for the sellers. Mr. Bonderman joined the board of Washington Mutual; he was a director until 2002.
 Over the decades, his success ranged across a wide swath of the business world. Indeed, the bulk of his money was invested outside the financial sector. But now some industry observers say that diversity may have been a liability.
 ''A lot of private equity firms look at the financial sector the way they look at other business -- industrials for example -- the solution is to inject a lot of capital,'' said Jason Arnold, who follows banking for RBC Capital. ''But with financial entities, they use a lot of leverage so that if you give them new capital, it may seem as if that is enough, but if the losses rise, the equity requirements to meet those losses rise exponentially.''
 Like many people on Wall Street, Mr. Bonderman may have failed to realize how bad times had become in the banking sector, in particular. 
 ''He thought that this would be like American Savings, but the difference here is that we were on the downside of the cycle, instead of the upside,'' Mr. Whalen said. 
 The precipitous decline in housing prices against a backdrop of a credit crisis only accelerated that decline, putting enormous pressure on a bank that had taken on far too much risk. And TPG, normally so prescient about economic trends when times were better, did not see it coming.

HEADLINE: The Financial Adviser as Hand-Holder

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
How have you changed your thinking about money in recent weeks? Post your comment at nytimes.com/yourmoney or write to rlieber@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Good financial advisers have the examination skills of an ace psychologist. But some of them actually were psychologists before they switched to helping people manage their money for a living. And as you might imagine, they've been awfully busy in recent days.
After all, uncertainty breeds anxiety. This week alone, we witnessed the market plunge on Monday, a tussle over the scope of the federal bailout that grew on Tuesday and the unfamiliar sight Wednesday night of watching our normally cocksure president pleading for support on national television.
By Thursday, Washington Mutual was dead and gone and on Friday, the politicians in Washington still hadn't settled their differences over the bailout. We can only hope that the package will allow the federal government to quickly clear bad debt from companies' books and grease the wheels of the economy. But who knows how long it might take or if it will even work?
All of these uncertainties weigh heavily on our minds. So this week, I turned to financial planners and investment advisers who got their start as psychologists or studied the field as graduate students, plus a few ringers who are adept observers of minds and money, even though they have formal training only in the latter. 
I asked them this: At this troubling moment, what's the best way to reorient how we think about money, before we make any rash decisions about what to do with whatever we have left?
Start, just for a minute, by giving yourself over to the worse case. The visceral fear here is of dying in the poorhouse, as Richard Schroeder, a certified financial planner with Schroeder, Braxton & Vogt in Amherst, N.Y., put it. And his answer to clients who articulate that nightmare is this: the markets will eventually recover.
So let's reel ourselves back from the edge of oblivion. Most of us can take some comfort in the fact that we have time on our sides. Managing our money is a process that unfolds over decades, not days. It's easy to forget that, when one company after another is falling victim, week after week, and we can track their disintegration on an hourly basis.
''The individual needs to go back to that personal road map,'' said Sharon Rich, a financial planner with a doctorate from Harvard who studied women, psychology and education. ''Where are you right now, where do you want to be and how do you get from here to there?''
And then apply that to an investment portfolio. ''I think reminding people in this environment of why we've chosen the investment strategy that we have is a good thing for those who are a little bit antsy,'' said Constance Barber, a certified financial planner with Barber Financial in Natick, Mass., who got her start as a school psychologist. ''We've usually not set this up because it's money that you'll need tomorrow.''
Even if we don't need the money right now, it doesn't feel good to look at a retirement portfolio and find that it's down 15 percent from its peak a year ago.
''People rely on selective memory when they're only looking at losses from the high point that the portfolio reached,'' said Victoria Collins, who has a Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of California, Berkeley and has worked as a certified financial planner for more than two decades.
This was a point echoed by many people I spoke with this week. On one hand, it's certainly depressing to be down to $340,000 from $400,000, for instance. The basic math doesn't help the mood either, given that after a decline of 15 percent, a portfolio needs to gain 17.6 percent just to get back to $400,000 again. ''This is real money in people's lives,'' said Ms. Rich, who runs Womoney, a financial planning firm in Belmont, Mass. She noted that some people added up how many years it took them to save the money that just disappeared.
We can mimic that mindset if we choose, or we can consider what our balance was, say, a decade ago. Chances are we've made a lot of progress since then, if we've been saving all along. ''There are clients who will say, 'Yes, it's down, but look where I started,' '' said Ms. Barber, the former school psychologist. '' 'I'm hanging in there, and we've come a long way, baby, and it's O.K. for now.' ''
Next, put down the retirement account statement and consider the credit and debit card bills and the checkbook. Ms. Rich put some clients with job security anxieties through this exercise this week. It isn't a budgeting drill exactly. ''The question is how the way I'm spending reflects my values and what I think is important in the world,'' she said.
For those of us who pay someone to clean our house, she said, perhaps having a clean house isn't really that important when we reconsider. Or if we think it's crucial for our children to experience nature, perhaps a series of day trips can have the same effect as going to the Grand Canyon.
School costs are an issue here too, Ms. Rich said, and she noted that such reconsideration may mean spending more, not less, on certain items.
One tricky part about the last several weeks is confronting all the headlines declaring this the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. ''Most of the individuals that I find who need more handholding are the ones who've had some connection with the Great Depression,'' says Ms. Collins, the Berkeley Ph.D., who is now an executive vice president and principal with Keller Group Investment Management in Irvine, Calif.
These people tend to be retirees, who may have had parents who told them stories about living through the 1930s or are old enough to remember it themselves. If they have little or no earning capacity now, they feel especially helpless when they see parts of their portfolios disappearing.
''I try to remind them that even they don't need all of that portfolio today,'' she said. ''You're only withdrawing a certain amount.''
Ms. Rich suggested that people reach out to someone else to discuss their situation if they don't have a hybrid financial adviser-shrink to counsel them through the crisis. It could be a peer, a family member, a member of the clergy or staff at a senior center.
Even that support network may not be enough to bring the most anxiety-prone among us back from the edge. ''For those who cling to doomsday scenarios we can also say, 'So what?' '' Mr. Schroeder, the financial planner in Amherst, N.Y., said in an e-mail message. ''If the markets go to zero, if the whole system crashes, there is no safe haven, so it doesn't matter whether you buy Treasuries. The currency will be worthless and there will be chaos in the streets. Your only alternative is to stock up on guns, ammunition and goods that are easily tradable and will become valuable, such as sewing needles, good Scotch, etc.''
Now, forget about hoarding sewing supplies and remember that things are much more likely to get better than they are to get that bad.

HEADLINE: Swapping Land for a Road to Somewhere Divides Alaskans

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY and FELICITY BARRINGER; William Yardley reported from Anchorage, and Felicity Barringer from San Francisco.

 BODY:
ANCHORAGE -- Among the many bills Congress is considering before it recesses for the November elections is a proposed land swap between the State of Alaska and the federal government that would allow a gravel road to be built through a remote national wildlife refuge.
Environmental groups are lined up against the proposal, saying a road would threaten the pristine wilderness area. Building it would require cutting an approximately 200-acre strip through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge on the Alaska Peninsula, a resting place for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds and other animals. 
Alaska officials, led by Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, say the road is needed to connect one tiny outpost, King Cove, to another, Cold Bay, so that the 800 residents of King Cove have reliable access, particularly in emergencies, to the all-weather airport across the water in Cold Bay.
The issue before Congress is whether to allow Alaska to swap about 43,000 acres of state land for the 200 or so acres in the Izembek refuge needed for the road, which would be a single lane and, though the exact route has not been determined, would require an estimated 17 miles of construction, at $1 million to $2 million per mile.
Though the proposed land swap has been a source of debate for years, some opponents are drawing new attention to it as an example of Congressional excess. They have compared it to the controversial Bridge to Nowhere in Ketchikan, Alaska, which was ultimately abandoned but has proved a thorn for the governor, Sarah Palin, in her campaign as the Republican nominee for vice president. Ms. Palin supports the land exchange and the proposed road through Izembek.
A road ''is going to fragment and irreparably harm one of the most pristine and valuable wilderness and wetland areas in the Northern Hemisphere,'' said Nicole Whittington-Evans, the associate director of the Wilderness Society's Alaska office.
But supporters of the project say opponents are misrepresenting it. They point out that the basics of the proposed land swap have not been significantly altered since well before Ms. Palin took office, in December 2006. Furthermore, while the measure before Congress would give the Department of the Interior the authority to approve the project, no money would be set aside under the current bill and several caveats could delay or stop the project outright.
''There is no earmark request here,'' said Ms. Murkowski, the bill's sponsor in the Senate (Representative Don Young, a Republican and the state's lone Congressional representative, sponsored it in the House). ''There is none pending. There hasn't been any that was asked for.''
Ms. Murkowski said Democrats had demanded significant changes, including measures to require more environmental study and to give the interior secretary discretion to determine whether the project was in the ''public interest.''
Opponents, however, say the bill as they interpret it essentially directs the secretary to find that the proposal is in the public interest. If that were to happen, the road could be financed by the state using money from the federal Highway Trust Fund, instead of an earmark, according to state transportation officials and Ms. Murkowski's office. The road is not currently in the state transportation financing plan.
Versions of the bill have cleared key committees in the House and Senate and await floor votes. However, given the economic bailout plans Congress is considering, the prospect of a measure passing this year ''looks grim,'' said Bill Wicker, a spokesman for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
If the road is not approved this year, it will not be the first time. In 1998, the Clinton administration opposed the road, being pushed by the Alaska delegation, and instead brokered a $37 million deal to provide a hovercraft across Cold Bay to improve transportation for medical evacuations; the plan also upgraded a medical center in King Cove. But the hovercraft just started operating last year, and residents say weather and high costs make its use unpredictable. The local government also says it costs about $100,000 a month to operate. Opponents of the road, however, say it, too, may be unusable in foul weather and they note that the hovercraft has conducted medical evacuations since it came into use. Residents say the road is a matter of public and economic health.
''They say those people over there will be killing all the ducks and ruining the environment and decimating the country,'' said Mayor Stanley Mack of the Aleutians East Borough, much of whose population is Native Aleut and Yupik. ''Where do you get off saying that? We've been out here for 4,000 years, protecting the country.''
The Izembek National Wildlife Refuge has long been overshadowed by its northern cousin, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the fight over building the gravel road has lacked the political tension of the fight over drilling for oil. But environmental groups have also long felt that building a road, on an isthmus between two wildlife-rich lagoons in the refuge, would threaten the welfare of a dwindling caribou herd and hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, including Pacific black brant and the threatened Steller's eider.
The 43,000 acres of state land, plus 18,000 more that a local village corporation run by Alaska Natives has offered as part of the swap, cannot compensate, they say. ''We're talking about quality versus quantity,'' Ms. Whittington-Evans said of the Wilderness Society.
Critics also note that the designated landing area for the hovercraft in King Cove was placed more than 15 miles away from town, and that the road there follows a course that could easily be extended to Cold Bay.
One local official confirmed that the hovercraft access road had been intentionally built with the goal of one day extending it through the refuge.
''Yes, this community isn't backing down from building this road,'' said the official, Robert S. Juettner, the administrator for the Aleutians East Borough. ''And one day it will succeed.''

HEADLINE: Beyond Ideology, a Collision of Generations

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
One candidate cited Churchill and Eisenhower, and described George Shultz, who served in Ronald Reagan's cabinet, as a ''great secretary of state.''
The other promised anxious voters a federal budget that could be examined on a ''Google for government.''
The first presidential debate was more than a clash of ideology or temperaments. Barack Obama and John McCain did not even wrestle over the $700 billion economic bailout. Theirs was a generational collision, and at times it looked almost like a dramatic rendition of Freudian family tension: an older patriarch frustrated and even cranky when challenged by a would-be successor to the family business who thinks he can run it better. 
Neither of the candidates took full advantage of the debate rules that allowed them to confront each other directly, and that reticence suggested the stiff politesse of two relatives determined not to ruin Thanksgiving dinner.
Mr. McCain, 72, repeatedly argued that Mr. Obama, who is 47, was not ready for the job: ''I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand'' and ''What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand'' and ''Senator Obama still doesn't understand.''
He deplored his opponent's ''naivete,'' though he stumbled slightly on the pronunciation of the Iranian president's name, and twice repeated that he had not been elected Miss Congeniality of the Senate -- some viewers might have wondered if he had forgotten that he had already used that metaphor. When Mr. Obama was speaking, Mr. McCain was at times fidgety, grinning awkwardly and shifting from foot to foot.
Mr. Obama was calm, still, poised and more businesslike than personable. He was trying to be like John F. Kennedy talking about the space race, but he often sounded like a technocrat.
He wore a dark suit and a flag lapel pin, and chose to focus on appearing steady and serious-minded and so ready to be president that he at one point sounded as if he already were: ''I reserve the right as president of the United States to -- to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe.''
Mr. McCain felt secure enough not to wear a flag pin on his lapel, and comfortable enough to make jokes. ''I'm not going to set the White House visitors' schedule before I'm president of the United States,'' he said. ''I don't even have a seal yet.''
Over all, Mr. McCain was more charming and more colloquial, but his speaking style was at times choppy. He described North Korea as the most ''repressive and brutal regime probably on earth,'' adding: ''The average South Korean is three inches taller than the average North Korean. A huge gulag.''
Denouncing government spending, he tossed in an example. ''You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana,'' he said. ''I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue,'' he joked, but so rapidly that some viewers might have been confused, or wondered if the candidate was.
His references to past cabinet members like Mr. Shultz and his 35-year friendship with Henry A. Kissinger reminded audiences of his experience, but also of his many, many years in Washington at a time when the nation's lawmakers are held in the lowest of esteem.
And when he disagreed with Mr. Obama, he had a scolding tone. He seemed almost piqued that he had to share the stage with a man who had been in the Senate only four years.
''There are some advantages to experience, and I honestly don't believe Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience, and has made the wrong judgment in a number of areas,'' Mr. McCain said.
At least once, Mr. Obama shook off his detachment and threw Mr. McCain's experience back at him.
''At the time when the war started,'' he said, ''you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shia and Sunni, and you were wrong.''
Particularly after so fractured and fractious a week, with two candidates in separate worlds, catapulting poison-tipped sound bites at each other across a vast, clamorous media no man's land, it was almost startling to see them in the same room, on the same stage, behind matching lecterns, talking to each other, and past each other, for 90 minutes.
Mr. Obama was not particularly warm or amusing; at times he was stiff and almost pedantic. But all he had to do was look presidential, and that was not such a stretch. Mr. McCain had the harder task of persuading leery voters that he can lead the future because he is so much part of the past.
He tried to remind viewers of his greater experience and heroic combat career, while also casting himself as a maverick outsider ready to storm the barricades. Mr. McCain wanted to be the true revolutionary in the room, but his is the Reagan revolution, and for a lot of people right now, it doesn't look like morning in America.
Correction: October 1, 2008, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The TV Watch column in some editions on Saturday, about the first presidential debate, described a comment by Senator Barack Obama imprecisely. Although Mr. Obama tried throughout the debate to portray Senator John McCain as a man of the last century, he did not directly accuse him of having a ''20th-century mindset.'' (Mr. Obama used those words to criticize the Bush administration's policy toward Pakistan, and he attacked Mr. McCain for supporting that policy.)

HEADLINE: In Viewing the Debate, New Yorkers Tip Their Hands

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS. 
Daryl Khan, Daniel E. Slotnik and Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New Yorkers preoccupied by the nation's financial crisis gathered in public places Friday night to watch the presidential debate on foreign policy, though many hoped to hear about issues closer to home.
 But while the first third of the debate between Senator John McCain, the Republic nominee, and Senator Barack Obama, his Democratic counterpart, was a discussion of the economy, much of the rest of the evening naturally focused not on hometown companies that have collapsed in recent months -- like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers -- but on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and tensions with Iran, Russia and North Korea.
 Mike Kelly, a 25-year-old business student, said he remained undecided after watching the debate with friends at a bar on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side. ''The war in Iraq is clearly important and must be ended, and we all agree on that,'' he said, ''but I found myself getting distracted at times because they were talking about things that seemed of secondary importance to me, especially given how the economy is disproportionately affecting people in the city. 
 ''Iran, Al Qaeda, Hamas. Got it. O.K. What about jobs? And is my money safe in the bank?''
 A few miles south, at the Downtown Community Television Center, more than 200 people stood shoulder-to-shoulder and spilled onto the sidewalk for the center's debate-viewing party. Comedians performed beforehand, including Joe Quint, the author of the book ''72 Things Younger Than John McCain.''
 As was true at other public gatherings in heavily Democratic New York City on Friday night, Senator Obama's points were often greeted with applause, while Senator McCain's were typically met with jeers.
 The center was hot and sticky as a crowd of people in their 20s drank Budweiser out of cans and Brooklyn beer out of bottles. In the back of the room, bloggers typed away on laptops, updating Web sites and Facebook pages.
 ''It's been a rough week emotionally,'' said Kaiser Sandwipi, 39, who lives in Park Slope and works in the financial services industry. ''We need to hear some details about the financial plan. There has to be some kind of accountability.''
 At the Apollo Theater in Harlem, a racially diverse crowd watched the hour-and-a-half debate on a giant screen that had been set up on the venue's famous stage.
 The group cheered when Mr. Obama said that everyone deserved access to a college education, and again when he criticized Mr. McCain's support of the war in Iraq. They booed lustily when Mr. McCain referred to his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.
 Billy Hemmans, 54, a building manager from Harlem, was wearing a black-and-gold Obama T-shirt and a wristwatch that featured Mr. Obama's face. ''It's going to be a landslide,'' he said about the November election.
 ''It's going to be worse than when Boston beat L.A. in the Finals,'' he added, referring to the N.B.A. championship series this year.
 At a Republican gathering in Midtown Manhattan, 75 people crowded into a wood-paneled room at Public House, staring intently at one of two large flat-screen televisions showing the debate as they sipped beer and drank cocktails. Each time the door was opened, pop music could be heard coming from a party elsewhere in the building.
 When Mr. McCain said that ''our best days are ahead of us,'' the gathering let out a sustained cheer. Among the crowd were several women who wore buttons supporting Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 And a few people snuck out of the room at regular intervals to find a television tuned to another ongoing drama -- the Mets, who are in a tight race for a wild card spot, and their game against the Florida Marlins. (The Mets lost.) 
 ''I've got two horses in the race tonight,'' said Brett Joshpe, 28, who helped organize the viewing party. Mr. Joshpe said he was trying to re-energize the city's Republicans, who have fared poorly in local elections and are outnumbered by a large margin in the city.
 ''I'm trying to rebuild the brand,'' he said, ''because the brand has been damaged in recent years.''
 Owen Heslin, vice president of the New York Young Republicans Club, liked what he saw: ''I think McCain owns him tonight -- I really do -- and I hate McCain. He answered the questions well, and he threw in a few zingers.''

HEADLINE: A Balancing Act as McCain Faces a Divided Party and a Skeptical Public

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain spent just 90 minutes in the Capitol on Friday morning. But while he was there, he issued words of support but also a gentle warning to House Republicans who the day before had upended a $700 billion plan that the White House says is necessary to avert economic disaster.
 ''You're trying to protect the taxpayer, hats off to you,'' Mr. McCain told the House Republicans, as recounted by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close adviser, who attended the meeting. ''Let's try to do something that would make the bill better. 
 ''But remember, this is an incredibly difficult time that we're in,'' Mr. McCain then added, according to Mr. Graham. ''Don't go too far.'' 
 The double-edged message reflects the delicate balancing act that Mr. McCain appears to be attempting as he addresses a Wall Street bailout package that has aroused deep divisions within his party and fierce public skepticism. After casting himself as a leader who could broker an end to the financial crisis, Mr. McCain faced intense questions on Friday about what, if anything, he had done to move the negotiations forward, having returned to Washington only to see a tentative deal collapse.
 Mr. McCain did not explicitly side with the House Republicans who derailed the deal on Thursday. But neither did he discourage them, nor put forth his own bailout plan, nor endorse the White House proposal to have the government buy up distressed mortgage assets from faltering Wall Street firms. But by keeping his views to himself, Mr. McCain kept the House revolt alive, a move that infuriated the White House and Congressional Democrats, but one that did bring him accolades from House Republicans, who say Mr. McCain at least helped get their voices heard.
 ''This was an intentional strategy,'' said another close adviser, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. ''This was his plan, that he wanted to be a bridge builder here and not to come in and dictate a solution of the way to solve this. There was some cheap criticism of him for not speaking more at the White House, or offering a specific proposal, but that is exactly what he wanted to do.''
 Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, who had been negotiating for the House Republicans but was not authorized to make a deal, said that he called Mr. McCain this week to complain that the White House and Congressional Democrats were cutting House Republicans out of the deal. He said Mr. McCain asked if he could be helpful, and he told Mr. McCain that he could.
 ''His greatest contribution,'' Mr. Bachus said, ''was returning to Washington and standing up for Republicans who were refusing to be stampeded.''
 Mr. McCain's advisers cast his role on Friday as a supportive, essential presence to Republicans who were enraged by what they considered their harsh treatment at the White House on Thursday afternoon, and the dismissive attitude of their Republican colleagues in the Senate. They also tried to push back against a narrative that emerged Thursday, which portrayed Mr. McCain as injecting partisan politics into delicate dealmaking, and replace it with the image of a presidential candidate who stopped a bad deal from going through.
 ''Basically, what he saw happening is that the Senate kind of wrote off the House in terms of being able to make them a partner, and that was a mistake,'' Mr. Graham said. ''The most constructive thing I think John did to get this thing on track is that he went over to the House twice and said: 'Guys, I've heard your concerns and you know what? I think a lot of them are legitimate.' ''
 But many House Republicans remain deeply skeptical of Mr. McCain, and it is not clear whether he would have had the clout to change any minds in the Republican caucus. One of Mr. McCain's own advisers said Friday that the financial crisis found the senator working with people who were ''not historically his closest friends on Capitol Hill.''
 Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, said that ''if McCain came out and said, 'Here's a deal that I like,' that would be significant.'' But when asked if lawmakers would back a deal just because it had Mr. McCain's support, Mr. Kingston said: ''Not so much. This becomes a vote of conscience. It's a vote of principle.''
 As described by Mr. McCain's advisers, the senator began Friday with phone calls to the Senate leadership, the House leadership, individual Republicans and members of the Bush administration. When he arrived on Capitol Hill a little before 9 a.m., he headed to the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader. With Mr. McCain were his chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, and Mr. Graham.
 After some 30 minutes, the group went to the office of the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, where Mr. McCain told the Republicans opposed to the White House plan that it was important to have a negotiator with real clout representing their interests. Mr. McCain did not mention any names, but later, Mr. Boehner named Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House whip, as a new chief negotiator.
 ''He was very emphatic about the need for us to pass legislation and to act,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the chief deputy whip, who attended the meeting and has been circulating an alternative proposal that would rely on government-backed mortgage insurance. ''Frankly, people are very turned off by the $700 billion number, but they do know that we've got to do something. So I think the senator is just trying to understand where members are, and to help the process.''
 Mr. McCain then returned to his own office where, advisers said, he made the decision, between 10 and 10:30 a.m., to fly to Mississippi and participate in the debate against his Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama. The advisers said Mr. McCain had decided that enough progress had been made, for now.
 But back at the Capitol, some Republicans were hard-pressed to say what, precisely, Mr. McCain had accomplished during his 24-hour stay. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is working with Mr. Cantor on the alternative bailout plan, said that he found Mr. McCain did more listening than talking when he met with him on Thursday.
 ''He was in the information-gathering stage,'' Mr. Ryan said. Asked what role Mr. McCain was continuing to play, Mr. Ryan looked puzzled. ''I think he's debating,'' the congressman said. ''Didn't he go down to Mississippi?''

HEADLINE: House Backs Stimulus Bill, But It Stalls In the Senate

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House on Friday passed a bill intended to revive the economy with $61 billion of federal spending, but the Senate blocked consideration of a similar bill, and President Bush issued veto threats against both.
 The economic recovery package, approved in the House by a vote of 264 to 158, has little chance of becoming law on its own. But it could become a bargaining chip in negotiations between Congress and the White House over Mr. Bush's $700 billion proposal to shore up the nation's financial system.
 Moreover, Democrats said the legislation served a political purpose, giving them an opportunity, they said, to put Republicans on record against helping people who are struggling in a sluggish economy. 
 Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the bill ''would make life a little less miserable for people who have been hit hard by the economic chaos that's swept over the country.''
 Another Democrat, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, noted that the measure provided money to extend unemployment benefits. ''If we don't act,'' Mr. Levin said, ''more than a million people will exhaust their unemployment benefits before the end of the year.''
 But Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said the bill would do little to stimulate the economy. ''It's meant to stimulate the electoral prospects of a couple of hundred members of Congress,'' Mr. Flake said.
 By a vote of 257 to 166, the House on Friday also passed a separate bill providing tax breaks to encourage the development and use of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. The Senate has included similar incentives in a different bill that would also make other changes in the tax code.
 It was not immediately clear whether the clean-energy proposals would become law. Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, a champion of alternative fuels, said haggling between the Senate and the House had ''already delayed millions of dollars of investment in clean-energy technology.''
 The Senate's bill, which it passed this week, would extend the tax credit for investments in solar energy for eight years, through 2016. 
 A new study by the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said the tax credit would increase domestic investment in the solar industry by $232 billion by 2016 and generate 440,000 jobs, many in manufacturing, construction and engineering.
 As for the economic stimulus legislation, House and Senate versions alike would not only extend unemployment benefits but also increase food stamp allotments and provide more federal money to states to finance health insurance for low-income people on Medicaid. Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said the measure would ''help avert cuts to state Medicaid programs,'' so states could meet the medical needs of people who had lost jobs and health benefits provided by employers.
 In addition to those provisions, the legislation would provide money for highways, bridges, airports, mass transit, school repairs, water projects and other public works.
 In February, Mr. Bush signed a bipartisan bill to revive the economy by sending rebate checks to millions of taxpayers. But Democrats said more was needed because the economy in many parts of the country was still anemic.
 On Friday, the Senate voted 52 to 42 for a motion to consider its version of the stimulus bill, which would cost $56 billion. Supporters needed 60 votes.
 In threatening a veto, the White House said the bills ''will not provide short-term stimulus or long-term growth for the economy.'' Instead, the White House said, the bills ''would simply increase government spending, including self-perpetuating entitlement spending, by tens of billions of dollars.''
 Representative Jerry Lewis of California, the senior Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said Democrats had not proposed any way to pay for their stimulus bill, and he expressed dismay at the sudden growth in federal commitments.
 ''In recent days,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''government has taken steps to bail out the auto industry, to the tune of $25 billion. It has proposed a bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to the tune of another $25 billion. It has committed as much as $70 billion to rescue the A.I.G. insurance company. In the last few weeks, this Congress hasn't found a cause that doesn't need a handout or a bailout. Where does the spending end?''
 Representative Flake said, ''This is the most expensive week in the history of the Republic.''

HEADLINE: House Republicans Support a Plan That Would Insure Troubled Mortgages

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After temporarily derailing the Bush administration's $700 billion proposal to bail out the financial system on Thursday, House Republicans pared back their goals on Friday and demanded that the plan rely at least partly on an industry-financed insurance program for troubled mortgages.
 Issuing a vague declaration of ''economic rescue principles'' to limit the use of taxpayer money, the Republican lawmakers focused primarily on the insurance program. 
 The proposal would have banks and investment firms that own mortgages and mortgage-backed securities pay premiums for insurance that would guarantee them against losses if the mortgages default.
 Supporters of the plan said it would restore confidence in mortgage-backed securities without putting taxpayer money at risk. ''Instead of making the taxpayers pay, the securities holders would pay,'' said Representative Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who helped create the plan.
 That would be sharply different from the plan developed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., which would have the government buy up to $700 billion worth of currently unsalable mortgage-backed securities.
 Treasury officials have argued that their plan would address the heart of the financial crisis, which is that banks and investment firms are holding vast quantities of securities that have little or no market value. By having the government buy up and hold those securities until the panic dies down, Mr. Paulson has been hoping to free the balance sheets of financial institutions, allow them to raise fresh capital from investors and start making loans again.
 But Republican lawmakers said on Friday that they were not trying to scrap Mr. Paulson's plan entirely. Instead, they said, they would simply try to insert an insurance program into the overall package.
 ''We don't want to undermine the negotiations,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We want to honor the spirit of the negotiations.''
 That was a retreat from Thursday, when John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, told President Bush and Democratic Congressional leaders that most House Republicans would oppose the administration's plan. 
 The idea of the insurance plan, championed by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, was to reduce uncertainty and restore confidence without actually using taxpayer money.
 The federal government would guarantee the underlying mortgages in a mortgage-backed security, much as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have done for years and as the Federal Housing Administration does, as well.
 In theory, the cost of that insurance would be borne by the companies that hold the mortgages or mortgage-backed securities.
 Treasury officials had already told Republican lawmakers they had considered an insurance approach, but rejected it. The problem, from Mr. Paulson's standpoint, was that insuring against mortgage defaults would do little to increase liquidity, or the amount of money available for making loans. By contrast, the Treasury plan would inject hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh, although borrowed, money into the marketplace.
 But the insurance plan could pose other risks to taxpayers. The government would be insuring the riskiest and most default-prone mortgages made during the housing bubble, including loans that required no down payment and no income verification by the borrowers.
 The allure of insuring mortgages, rather than buying them as Mr. Paulson would, is that the government would not have to put up any taxpayer money. But because the government would be guaranteeing nearly all mortgages in the country, since it already owns Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, taxpayers could face big losses if losses from defaults turn out to be higher than expected.
 Many House Republicans, including Mr. Ryan, had come up with a far more detailed rival plan earlier in the week that included Republican policy evergreens like new tax breaks and more flexible regulation as well as the insurance idea.
 Some lawmakers wanted to at least temporarily eliminate taxes on capital gains and dividends, though senior Republicans knew they had no chance of getting that past Democratic leaders.
 Members of the Republican Study Group, a group of conservative House Republicans, proposed lifting the mortgage market by letting companies reap retroactive tax rebates from their current losses. A company would be able to apply its losses this year against its profits from any of the last five years and get a rebate for taxes it had already paid.
 But with lawmakers hoping to wrap up their work by Monday, Republicans dropped the idea as impractical because it would take too long for the Joint Committee on Taxation to estimate the measure's cost.
 On the regulatory front, some House Republicans championed the idea of relaxing what are known as mark-to-market rules that require investment firms to revise the value of their securities in line with changes in market prices of those securities.
 Over the last year, Wall Street's biggest investment banks have been forced to take huge write-downs on mortgage-related holdings, not because the securities were actually losing money but because the securities had become almost impossible to sell in the open market. For many securities, especially the arcane derivative securities known as ''collateralized debt obligations,'' there are virtually no buyers and no market prices.
 ''If you don't have to sell the securities today, you shouldn't have to mark it at today's value,'' said Peter Ferrara, a senior researcher at the Institute for Policy Innovation, a research group in Virginia with ties to many Republican lawmakers. 
 But Mr. Ryan said the issue was complicated. While critics of the current rules complained that they artificially understated a company's financial position, other experts argue just as vehemently that marking to market is a crucial way of preventing companies from covering up bad investments.

HEADLINE: The First Debate

 BODY:
The first presidential debate could not have come at a better time. We were afraid that the serious question of picking a new president in a time of peril, at home and abroad, was going to disappear in a fog of sophomoric attack ads, substance-free shouting about change and patriotism, and unrelenting political posturing.
 The debate was generally a relief from the campaign's nastiness. Both John McCain and Barack Obama worked to strike a more civil and substantive tone. And Americans could see some differences between the candidates on correcting the regulatory disasters that led to the Wall Street crisis, on how to address the country's grim fiscal problems and on national security. There were also differences in the candidate's themselves. Mr. McCain fumbled his way through the economic portion of the debate, while Mr. Obama seemed clear and confident. Mr. McCain was more fluent on foreign affairs, and scored points by repeatedly calling Mr. Obama naive and inexperienced. 
 But Mr. McCain's talk of experience too often made him sound like a tinny echo of the 20th century. At one point, he talked about how Ronald Reagan's ''S.D.I.'' helped end the cold war. We suspect that few people under the age of 50 caught the reference. If he was reaching for Reagan's affable style, he missed by a mile, clenching his teeth and sounding crotchety where Reagan was sunny and avuncular.
 Mr. Obama has improved as a debater but needs to work on his counterpunch. Still, when Mr. McCain suggested that Mr. Obama was imprudent for talking publicly about attacking Al Qaeda sites in Pakistan, Mr. Obama deftly parried by reminding voters that his rival once jokingly sang a song about bombing Iran. 
 Mr. McCain came to the debate after one of the more ludicrous performances by a presidential candidate. With the markets teetering and Washington desperately trying to find a bipartisan solution, Mr. McCain tried to make the biggest question of the week whether he was actually going to show up for Friday's debate. 
 Mr. Obama dominated the economic portion of the debate, arguing that the Wall Street disaster was the fault of the Bush administration's anti-regulation, pro-corporate culture. He called for a major overhaul of the financial regulatory system. Mr. McCain stuck to his talking points, railing against greed and corruption. He showed little sign that he understood the fundamental failures in government illuminated by the market crisis.
 Mr. Obama said that he would begin to address the country's deep deficit by raising taxes on the wealthy, while cutting them for the vast majority of American workers. But he dodged the question of what programs he would have to sacrifice to help foot the proposed bailout's $700 billion price tag. Mr. McCain dodged the same question with equal energy. 
 He clung to his argument that cutting Congressional earmarks -- which amount to about $18 billion a year -- and reducing waste and abuse would solve most of the country's economic problems and allow him to continue President Bush's catastrophic tax cuts.
 It was disturbing to see that Mr. McCain seems to have learned nothing from the disastrous war in Iraq. He talked about recent progress there, which is indisputable, and his support for the troop surge that has brought down violence. But Mr. McCain still was talking about winning, rather than how he was going to plan a necessary and responsible exit. And he steadfastly refused to acknowledge that the decision to invade Iraq was an enormous mistake.
 Mr. Obama offered no details on how he plans to get out of Iraq, but he offered an important truth when he said that the United States should never have invaded and can never win in Afghanistan as long as it is tied down in Iraq. 
 We didn't hear nearly as much detail as we would have liked. But the debate was a move toward a serious discussion of this country's many problems. Americans need to hear more of that, and less of the tactical sparring, before going to the polls.

HEADLINE: RIVALS DISPLAY STARK CONTRASTS IN CLASHES ON WAR AND ECONOMY: FIRST ENCOUNTER

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JEFF ZELENY; Peter Baker, Michael Cooper and Patrick Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
From the economy to foreign affairs to the way they carried themselves on stage, Senators John McCain and Barack Obama offered a dramatic contrast to the nation in their first presidential debate on Friday night, mixing disdain and often caustic remarks as they set out sharply different views of how they would manage the country and confront America's adversaries abroad.
The two men met for 90 minutes against the backdrop of the nation's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and intensive negotiations in Congress over a $700 billion bailout plan for Wall Street.
Despite repeated prodding, Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama refused to point to any major adjustments they would need to make to their governing agendas -- like scaling back promised tax reductions or spending programs -- to accommodate what both men said could be very tough economic times for the next president. 
For the first 40 minutes, Mr. Obama repeatedly sought to link Mr. McCain to President Bush, and suggested that it was policies of excessive deregulation that led to the financial crisis and mounting economic problems the nation faces now.
''We also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain -- the theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most and somehow prosperity will trickle down,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It hasn't worked, and I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.''
Mr. McCain became more animated during the second part of the debate, when it shifted to the advertised topic: foreign policy and national security. The two men offered strong and fundamentally different arguments about the wisdom of going to war against Iraq -- which Mr. McCain supported and Mr. Obama opposed -- as well as how to deal with Iran.
More than anything, Mr. McCain seemed intent on presenting Mr. Obama as green and inexperienced, a risky choice during a difficult time. Again and again, sounding almost like a professor talking down to a new student, he talked about having to explain foreign policy to Mr. Obama and repeatedly invoked his 30 years of history on national security (even though Mr. McCain, in the kind of misstep that no doubt would have been used by Republicans against Mr. Obama, mangled the name of the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and he stumbled over the name of Pakistan's newly inaugurated president, calling him ''Qadari.'' His name is actually Asif Ali Zardari.).
''I don't think I need any on-the-job training,'' Mr. McCain said in the closing moments of the debate. ''I'm ready to go at it right now.''
But Mr. Obama seemed calm and in control and seemed to hold his own on foreign policy, the subject on which Mr. McCain was assumed to hold a natural advantage. Mr. Obama talked in detail about foreign countries and their leaders, as if trying to assure the audience that he could hold his own on the world stage. He raised his own questions about Mr. McCain's judgment in supporting the Iraq war.
''You like to pretend like the war started in 2007 -- you talk about the surge. The war started in 2003,'' Mr. Obama said. ''At the time, when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong.''
There were no obvious game-changing moments -- big mistakes, or the kind of sound bites that dominate the news for days -- in the course of the 90-minute debate, held at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. Still, the debate served as a reminder of just how different these two men would be as president as they appeared for their first extended session together before a huge audience, including many Americans who are just beginning to focus on this long-lasting race.
The differences were in no small part stylistic and visible with a glance to the stage: a 47-year-old black man who has been in the Senate for nearly four years standing at one lectern, facing a 72-year-old white-haired fixture of the Senate standing across from him. In many ways, Mr. Obama was a very different candidate than he was during the primary battles. He answered questions directly and affirmatively, typically looking right into the camera as he spoke.
Throughout the debate, Mr. Obama called Mr. McCain by his first name; Mr. McCain did not. The direct engagement was encouraged by the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS, who declared, ''I'm just determined to get you all to talk to each other,'' though it was an invitation that the two men repeatedly ignored.
Mr. McCain was feisty and aggressive but, particularly during the start of the debate, his language and demeanor offered a reminder of just how much he was a creature of the Senate, as he used phrases that were no doubt understandable in Washington but might have been lost to the audience at home. He spent much of the first 20 minutes of the debate criticizing Mr. Obama for supporting earmarks, special projects sought by members for their district.
''The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day -- sometime next week -- with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends,'' he said. ''Look at 'em. You'll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.''
On Iraq, both candidates used the stories of fallen soldiers to support their own positions on the war. Mr. McCain told the audience about a New Hampshire woman who presented him with a bracelet of her 22-year-old son who was killed in combat. She asked him to keep alive the mission so his death was not in vain.
''I will wear his bracelet with honor,'' Mr. McCain recalled, raising his right hand to show the bracelet that still remains on his arm.
The moment he finished, Mr. Obama said, ''I've got a bracelet, too.'' He told the story of a Wisconsin woman who presented him with a token from her son who was killed in the war. She asked Mr. Obama to end the war so other mothers do not share her anguish.
If Mr. Obama came into the debate seeking to link the economic crisis to Mr. McCain and to Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain sought to portray his rival as a naive interloper; he barely looked at him all night, and seven times used a variation of the phrase that Mr. Obama ''doesn't understand.''
''I'm afraid Senator Obama doesn't understand'' and ''What Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand'' and ''Senator Obama still doesn't understand'' were Mr. McCain's constant refrains, delivered with a frozen smile and a hint of condescension.
''A little bit of naivete there,'' Mr. McCain said after Mr. Obama's remarks on a question about the American-Russian relationship.
The two men were somewhat wary of the debate's unusual format -- each had two minutes to answer a question, and then five minutes for free-flowing and perhaps unpredictable debate. During the first question, they generally kept outlining their policy views rather than engaging directly.
''Ten days ago, John said the fundamentals of the economy are strong --'' Mr. Obama started.
''Say it directly to him,'' said Mr. Lehrer, the moderator.
''John, you said 10 days ago the fundamentals of the economy are strong --'' Mr. Obama said to laughter.
''Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?'' Mr. McCain said to Mr. Lehrer, to more laughter.
The differences between the two men included taxes, Iraq and Iran. When Mr. McCain was asked how he would deal with the economic crisis, he talked about curbing government spending, especially what he said was $18 billion in spending on pet projects.
''The first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington. It's completely out of control,'' he said, and assailed Mr. Obama for requesting $932 million in earmark spending as a senator.
''That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C.,'' he said ''That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.''
Mr. Obama responded by assailing Mr. McCain's call for tax cuts for the wealthy. ''Let's be clear: earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.''
Turning to Mr. McCain, he said: ''John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending, this orgy of spending and enormous deficits and you voted for almost all of his budgets.''
Mr. McCain accused Mr. Obama of having ''the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.'' He chuckled aloud, adding: ''It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.''
A few moments later, Mr. Obama responded: ''John mentioned me being wildly liberal. Mostly, that's just me opposing George Bush's wrongheaded policies since I've been in Congress.''
Correction: October 2, 2008, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the first presidential debate misstated Senator John McCain's age in some editions. He is 72, not 71.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the First Presidential Debate

 BODY:
Excerpts from the presidential debate on Friday night in Oxford, Miss., between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama, as recorded by Federal News Service. The moderator was Jim Lehrer of PBS. A full transcript and video: nytimes.com.
 MR. OBAMA You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street, I think, have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy. And you're wondering: How's it going to affect me? How's it going to affect my job? How's it going to affect my house? How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?
 So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely.
 And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort. 
 No. 1, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process. Seven-hundred billion dollars potentially is a lot of money.
 No. 2, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains if the market and when the market returns.
 No. 3, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad C.E.O. bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes.
 And No. 4, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country.
 Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies -- promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain -- a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down.
 It hasn't worked. And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake. That's why I'm running for president. And that's what, I hope, we're going to be talking about tonight. ...
 MR. MCCAIN Jim, I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately. So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges. But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why. Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing for the first time in a long time Republicans and Democrats together sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in.
 And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis. And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street, we're talking about failures on Main Street and people who will lose their jobs and their credits and their homes if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while.
 But the point is, we are finally seeing Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package. This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses rather than the government taking over those loans. It has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.
 And yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives. And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that.
 And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.
 But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight: This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis. This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable. And we've got a lot of work to do. And we've got to create jobs. And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. ...
 MR. LEHRER Much has been said about the lessons of Vietnam. What do you see as the lessons of Iraq?
 MR. MCCAIN I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear, that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict.
 Our initial military success, we went into Baghdad and everybody celebrating, and then the war was very badly mishandled. I went to Iraq in 2003 and came back and said we've got to change the strategy. This strategy requires additional troops, it requires a fundamental change in strategy, and I fought for it. And finally we came up with a great general and a strategy that has succeeded. This strategy has succeeded, and we are winning in Iraq. And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds.
 And I want to tell you that now that we will succeed and our troops will come home, and not in defeat, that we will see a stable ally in the region and a fledgling democracy. The consequences of defeat would have been increased Iranian influence, it would have been increasing sectarian violence, it would have been a wider war, which the United States of America might have had to come back. So there was a lot at stake there. And thanks to this great general, David Petraeus, and the troops who serve under him, they have succeeded, and we are winning in Iraq, and we will come home -- and we will come home as we have when we have won other wars and not in defeat.
 MR. LEHRER Two minutes for how you see the lessons of Iraq, Senator Obama.
 MR. OBAMA Well, this is an area where Senator McCain and I have a fundamental difference because, I think, the first question is whether we should have gone into the war in the first place.
 Now, six years ago, I stood up and opposed this war, at a time when it was politically risky to do so, because I said that not only did we not know how much it was going to cost, what our exit strategy might be, how it would affect our relationships around the world and whether our intelligence was sound but also because we hadn't finished the job in Afghanistan. We hadn't caught bin Laden. We hadn't put Al Qaeda to rest. And as a consequence, I thought that it was going to be a distraction.
 Now, Senator McCain and President Bush had a very different judgment. And I wish I had been wrong, for the sake of the country, and they had been right. But that's not the case.
 We've spent over $600 billion so far, soon to be a trillion. We have lost over 4,000 lives. We have seen 30,000 wounded. And most importantly from a strategic, national security perspective, Al Qaeda is resurgent, stronger now than at any time since 2001.
 We took our eye off the ball and not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched, and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government.
 So I think the lesson to be drawn is that we should never hesitate to use military force, and I will not as president in order to keep the American people safe. But we have to use our military wisely, and we did not use our military wisely in Iraq.
 MR. LEHRER Do you agree with that lesson of Iraq?
 MR. MCCAIN No, the next president of the United States is not going to have to address the issue as to whether we went into Iraq or not. The next president of the United States is going to have to decide how we leave, when we leave, and what we leave behind. That's the decision of the next president of the United States.
 Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure. Recently on a television program he said it exceeded our wildest expectations. But yet, after conceding that, he still says that he would oppose the surge if he had to decide that again today. Incredibly -- incredibly -- Senator Obama didn't go to Iraq for 900 days, and never asked for a meeting with General Petraeus.
 MR. LEHRER Well, let's go at some of these -- 
 MR. MCCAIN Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO, that's in Afghanistan. To this day he's never had a hearing.
 MR. LEHRER What about that point?
 MR. MCCAIN: I mean, it's remarkable.
 MR. LEHRER All right, what about -- 
 MR. OBAMA Which point? You raised a whole bunch of them.
 MR. LEHRER Well, the latter point. I know. All right. Let's go to the latter point and we'll back up, the point about your not having been -- 
 MR. OBAMA Look, I'm very proud of my vice presidential selection, Joe Biden, who's the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And as he explains and as John well knows, the issues of Afghanistan, the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole. But that's Senate inside baseball.
 Let's get back to the core issue here. Senator McCain is absolutely right that the violence has been reduced as a consequence of the extraordinary sacrifice of our troops and our military families. They have done a brilliant job, and General Petraeus has done a brilliant job.
 But understand, that was a tactic designed to contain the damage of the previous four years of mismanagement of this war.
 And John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007. You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003. And at the time, when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong. You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shi'a and Sunni and you were wrong.
 And so if the question is of judgment, about whether or not -- 
 MR. MCCAIN Senator Obama doesn't know what -- 
 MR. OBAMA If the question who is best equipped as the next president to make good decisions about how we use our military, how we make sure that we are prepared and ready for the next conflict, then I think we can take a look at our judgment.

HEADLINE: Conservatives Viewed Bailout As Last Straw

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The seeds of the House Republican revolt over the financial industry bailout were sown in an e-mail message circulated Monday night as internal animosity built quickly over the Bush administration's request for $700 billion to prevent an economic collapse.
In a message to members of the conservative Republican Study Committee, leaders of the bloc of more than 100 lawmakers solicited ideas, calling for a ''free-market alternative to the Treasury Department's proposal so that, regardless of how individual R.S.C. members vote on final passage, House conservatives have something to be for.'' 
As the week progressed, it became abundantly clear that one thing conservative Republicans were most certainly not for was the Treasury plan, prompting them to begin searching for an alternative to avoid the perception of strictly being naysayers.
By the end of Friday, at least a portion of their alternative seemed likely to be included in the broader proposal as a sweetener for Republicans, although closed-door negotiations continued into the evening on Friday, and the contours of the final package remained in limbo.
After years of acceding to the White House on a variety of initiatives despite deep misgivings, House Republicans found the administration's latest proposal to be too much to swallow.
Just as they were trying to reassert themselves as a party of fiscal restraint, President Bush, on his way out the White House door, was asking them to sign off of on a $700 billion bailout built on taxpayer dollars, with very few questions allowed.
''You were being asked to choose between financial meltdown on the one hand and taxpayer bankruptcy and the road to socialism on the other and you were told do it in 24 hours,'' Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, head of the conservative group, said. ''It was just never going to happen.''
As they dig in against the White House, House Republicans are drawing strength and encouragement from outside critics of the bailout, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Club for Growth, a conservative economic group known for financing primary challenges against apostate Republicans.
Richard Viguerie, the longtime conservative leader, on Friday heralded House Republicans for guarding against ''this total cave-in by President Bush and the Senate Republicans.''
The resistance caps two years of frustration among House Republicans after losing the majority in 2006. They believe they have suffered serious mistreatment at the hands of the Democrats and that they have been marginalized in legislative negotiations since they, unlike their Senate counterparts, do not have the procedural weapons to force their way to the negotiating table.
They also complain that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has been too quick to bargain mainly with Democrats, led by the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, not only on this plan but on the stimulus proposal earlier this year, a subsequent housing bill and other economic measures.
The Monday e-mail message, which led to a statement of principles that many other conservatives embraced, became their manifesto. By Thursday, a legislative alternative was circulating, one centered on federal insurance for mortgage assets combined with tax cuts on investment gains. When Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, put that alternative on the table at the White House on Thursday afternoon, a verbal brawl broke out, scuttling a grand compromise and forcing negotiators back to the table.
With the blessing of Mr. Boehner, the plan was promoted by a troika made up of Mr. Hensarling along with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, a major fund-raiser and a rising star in the Republican ranks, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who is seen as one of the sharpest economic minds in the Republican conference.
The legislative alternative, combined with anger at their vastly reduced power on Capitol Hill and fueled by an internal power struggle , has made House Republicans suddenly relevant again. They have become the chief impediment to speedy approval of a bailout plan, because Democrats say they will not push one through on their own.
It represents a risky approach, raising the prospect that Republicans could be blamed if the bailout collapses and the markets plunge. But they could also claim victory if some of their plan is incorporated into the final product and it generates Republican support -- still a large question mark as negotiations continued. Democrats and the Treasury Department both say the Republican plan is flawed and unworkable.
Recognizing the prospect that a failure could be attributed to them, Republicans took pains Friday to make it clear they recognized some government intervention was necessary, just not the sort sought by the White House. And Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the No. 2 House Republican, was tapped to serve as an official emissary to the negotiations.
Mr. Cantor acknowledged, ''People want to see a deal made, no question about it.''
Yet, at the same time, it was becoming quite obvious that some House Republicans no longer saw themselves as an extension of the Bush White House.
For example, in advance of the president's speech Wednesday, Representative Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan, a member of the Republican leadership, sent out this statement expressing his pique: ''Who's giving the Republican response?''
The revolt surprised many because the Republican leadership of the House and Senate initially appeared to be solidly in Mr. Paulson's corner. Participants at last week's meeting between the leadership and administration economic advisers said Mr. Boehner was among those most willing to endorse a drastic intervention, a position he emphasized in a later television interview, calling for speedy action.
But he began rolling back as the negotiations moved ahead and was adamant, after the Thursday announcement of a deal in principle, that there was no deal he had blessed. By Thursday night, he had moved behind the Republican alternative, demanding it get a hearing.
Aides to Mr. Boehner said he was motivated partly by what he saw as a political effort by Democrats to seal a deal before Senator John McCain, the party's presidential candidate, could have a say in talks when he arrived Thursday.
On Friday, when House Republicans met to review the state of play, Mr. Boehner received a standing ovation at the Republican meeting in tribute to his decision to balk at the plan.
''Republicans say they believe they stand to be rewarded for forcing closer review of the bailout. They say Democrats can always pass the Treasury plan on their own.
''If Democrats believe the only plan that will save the economy is the Paulson plan, they have the power and the moral responsibility to go ahead and pass it,'' said Mr. Hensarling. ''They don't have to have Republican votes to get it done.''

HEADLINE: 1-800-CALL-DIMON

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
As the nation's largest savings and loan teetered on Thursday morning, a senior federal regulator called a familiar number: James Dimon's.
It was the same number that the Federal Reserve had called six months earlier, when Bear Stearns, one of the oldest names of Wall Street, lurched toward a collapse that many feared would send losses cascading from one financial institution to the next.
This time, the trouble was at Washington Mutual, a giant savings and loan that had been hobbled by bad mortgages.
On the line from his Park Avenue headquarters, Mr. Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, listened as the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation told him the F.D.I.C. was about to seize WaMu -- and then sell it to JPMorgan. 
''We're going to get it!'' Mr. Dimon barked to one of his lieutenants. ''Get ready!''
As one institution after another is laid low by the present crisis, Mr. Dimon stands at the head of a small band of bankers who are coming out on top in the new financial landscape.
With two bold deals -- first Bear and now WaMu -- Mr. Dimon has muscled in further on Wall Street's traditional turf and transformed JPMorgan into the country's largest commercial bank. With WaMu, JPMorgan will have $905 billion in deposits and 5,400 branches nationwide, rivaling Bank of America in size and reach.
Mr. Dimon, 52, concedes that he has taken risks to get here. To cover losses and write-downs at WaMu, which is based in Seattle, JPMorgan sold $10 billion of new stock on Friday. But while many of his rivals are playing defense, Mr. Dimon said, JPMorgan was raising ''offensive capital.''
''We are raising capital to do a deal, to buy something, to grow,'' he said in an interview. ''We are not raising capital to fill a hole.''
For Mr. Dimon, a Queens native whose grandfather and father were stockbrokers, this has been a watershed year. Only a decade ago, he was cast out of Citigroup by his mentor, Sanford I. Weill, leaving his career in shreds. It was a stinging blow; the two men were so close that for a time they shared an office.
Mr. Dimon eventually joined Bank One as its chief executive. There, he cut costs, pulled the ailing bank into the black and sold it to JPMorgan in 2004, setting the stage for a remarkable Wall Street comeback.
But Mr. Dimon has few illusions about the challenges ahead. JPMorgan is still trying to digest Bear Stearns and its toxic assets. That will make absorbing the WaMu purchase that much harder. And if the housing market and economy worsen, WaMu could become an albatross.
''If we have a big depression, you may wind up saying that this was a dumb move,'' Mr. Dimon said of buying WaMu. ''You may be right. There are always uncertainties in deals. Our eyes are not closed on this one.''
For the moment, investors are on Mr. Dimon's side. JPMorgan's share price rose nearly 11 percent on Friday, as the fate of the government's $700 billion economic bailout -- one that would benefit Mr. Dimon and his bank -- remained unclear.
It has been a remarkable journey for James Dimon, who works only a few footsteps from the roll-top desk that belonged to J. Pierpont Morgan, the feared lord of the House of Morgan. Like the bank's namesake before him, Mr. Dimon has become a principal player in the biggest financial drama of his age. And, like J. P. Morgan himself, he is capitalizing on the fear and panic that can grip the markets to expand his banking empire.
Mr. Dimon had eyed WaMu for years, and bided his time.
In March, JPMorgan wrote to WaMu, urging it to consider a sale in light of the weakening economy. At the time, JPMorgan believed the savings and loan might face losses of more than $30 billion. Even as Mr. Dimon oversaw the purchase of Bear Stearns that month, he dispatched his fellow executives to Seattle to meet with WaMu's management. WaMu balked.
''They cut us out,'' Mr. Dimon recalled. Crestfallen, he and his team returned to New York.
Mr. Dimon's hopes sank further in April, when TPG, the big private equity firm run by David Bonderman, invested $7 billion in WaMu. ''We might get another bite of the apple,'' Mr. Dimon told colleagues.
He did not have to wait long. At the end of June, WaMu's problems were so serious that its primary regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, effectively put it on probation.
When IndyMac Bank, a big mortgage lender in California, collapsed in July, WaMu came under more pressure. Depositors began withdrawing money in growing numbers. To halt the exodus, WaMu raised interest rates on certificates of deposit to unusually high levels, which made regulators even more nervous.
The situation deteriorated in September, when Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy and the government effectively took over the American International Group. That is when WaMu's customers began pulling out nearly $17 billion of deposits, an outflow one regulator characterized as an ''avalanche'' of withdrawals.
On Wednesday night, Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., phoned Mr. Dimon to tell him that JPMorgan had submitted the winning bid and to be prepared if the government seized WaMu. Regulators took action Thursday evening.
JPMorgan paid $1.9 billion to the F.D.I.C. to acquire all of WaMu's assets, branches and deposits. But the bank will most likely be responsible for absorbing $31 billion in losses tied to WaMu's troubled loans. WaMu shareholders and certain bondholders were wiped out, avoiding another expensive taxpayer-financed bailout.
In buying first Bear and then WaMu, Mr. Dimon has clung to the Morgan tradition. A century ago, J. P. Morgan demanded that New York banks rescue one of their own during what became known as the Panic of 1907. In the mid-1980s, the bank helped with the Mexican bailout and the rescue of Continental Illinois, the largest bank failure until WaMu.
But while WaMu's shareholders stand to lose billions of dollars -- WaMu's shares, which reached a record $46 in 2003, collapsed to 16 cents on Friday -- Mr. Dimon has scooped up potentially lucrative businesses.
Now more than ever, Mr. Dimon has pitted himself against his counterpart at Bank of America, Kenneth D. Lewis, who only weeks ago bought Merrill Lynch and rescued Countrywide Financial, the troubled mortgage lender, in January.
On the surface, the two executives have very different styles: Mr. Lewis, who hails from Mississippi, is a soft-spoken banker who helped his mentor, Hugh L. McColl Jr., build Bank of America with a series of acquisitions. The tough-talking Mr. Dimon learned to cut deals under Mr. Weill.
But Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, said the two men are more alike than it may seem. ''Both are visionary, humble and great on execution,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On Wall St. Crisis, Rivals Pivot to More Familiar Turf

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
With the economy on the edge and their presidential ambitions on the line, Senators Barack Obama and John McCain on Friday night pointed to different villains behind the tumult on Wall Street. But they quickly turned the discussion to a more conventional debate over taxes and spending. 
 At a time when storied financial firms are failing almost by the day, Mr. McCain focused his passion on more comfortable ground of fighting lobbyists in Washington and paring the size of government. Mr. Obama expressed empathy for the plight of the middle class, but like his opponent stayed away from the intricacies of financial policy that have led to this economic crisis. 
 Mr. McCain repeatedly pounded Mr. Obama for requesting $932 million in special projects known as earmarks, ''nearly a million dollars for every day that he has been in the United States Senate.'' Mr. Obama said he shared the antipathy for earmarks and had suspended his requests, but he noted that all special projects add up to just $18 billion a year, compared with the $300 billion in tax cuts he said Mr. McCain wanted to give corporations and wealthy Americans. 
 Their sharpest divergence over the financial crisis centered on who was to blame. ''This is a final verdict,'' Mr. Obama said, ''on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most and somehow prosperity will trickle down.''
 Mr. McCain blamed powerful interests. ''Somehow in Washington today, and I'm afraid on Wall Street, greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded and corruption, or certainly a failure to carry out our responsibility, is rewarded,'' he said. ''As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.'' 
 Although they offered contrasting diagnoses for the most dire financial crisis since the Great Depression, the two candidates seemed to offer largely similar prescriptions. Both expressed general support for the concept underlying Mr. Bush's proposal, to buy as much as $700 billion in toxic securities as long as the program meets certain criteria of transparency and accountability. But neither elaborated much on their conditions. 
 Likewise, neither outlined specifically what they would have to give up in their programs because of the financial bailout. ''There's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done,'' Mr. Obama said, then ticked off items he still wants to spend money on, including health care, energy development, infrastructure, and science and technology.
 Mr. McCain responded with his regular proposals for eliminating ethanol subsidies and curbing excessive military contracts, then suggested an across-the-board spending freeze except for defense, veterans' care and entitlements. ''Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate,'' he said. ''It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.''

HEADLINE: Congress Pushes to End Impasse on Bailout

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Graham Bowley and Sharon Otterman contributed reporting from New York, and Elisabeth Bumiller, Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg and David Stout from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Struggling to find their way in a politically charged atmosphere, the Bush administration and Congressional negotiators on Friday began to confront demands from rebellious House Republicans as they tried anew to assemble rescue plan for the nation's financial system. 
 House Democratic leaders said on Friday afternoon that negotiations were progressing, and that they were confident that an agreement could be reached fairly quickly. 
 ''Now we're back on track,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said in a brief question-and-answer session in the Capitol. She said that there had been ''a good deal of progress,'' and that Democrats were prepared to work as long as necessary, ''and we hope it doesn't take long.''
 Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Republicans were taking part in talks on the House side along with aides to Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the minority whip. 
 ''Some differences'' remain on the table, Mr. Frank said, but nothing in his choice of words or demeanor suggested that he viewed those differences as unbridgeable. The discussions continue to be based on ''the core'' of the plan offered by the administration through Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., Mr. Frank said.
 The hopeful report from the Democrats came after President Bush appealed for urgent action, and lawmakers in both parties said they would continue to press for a swift deal. But all were wrestling with realities imposed by presidential politics and the Congressional elections, which have led some legislators to see little political benefit in voting for the bailout.
 Both parties were still trying to digest the ramifications of a remarkable uprising led by House Republicans, who said on Thursday that they could not support the administration's plan. The Republicans have challenged the Democrats, who hold a majority in Congress, to approve the package on their own. But Democrats say they need the White House to persuade reluctant Republicans in Mr. Bush's party to go along.
 After Thursday's high political drama at the White House, Republicans sought to contain the disarray that led House members and Senator John McCain, the party's presidential nominee, to essentially scuttle the administration's $700 billion bailout plan. While some Republican senators said they were close to a deal, others insisted it was not so.
 Before flying to Mississippi for the first presidential debate, Mr. McCain met on Friday morning at the Capitol with the minority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, and with House Republican leaders, who then installed Mr. Blunt of Missouri to replace Spencer Bachus of Alabama as their lead negotiator.
 Mr. McConnell's office said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior member of the Budget Committee, would represent Senate Republicans, a role that he undertook on Thursday night when Mr. Paulson struggled to keep the plan alive after the contentious meeting at the White House. With Mr. Blunt and Mr. Gregg, the Republicans were relying on senior figures to present a consistent message to Democrats.
 Democrats sought to seize political advantage, and slammed Mr. McCain for suspending his campaign, and trying to postpone the debate, to return to Washington and help broker a deal, saying he had done more harm than good.
 ''We need the president to respectfully tell Senator McCain to get out of town,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
 As Mr. Paulson sought to get the talks back on track, the administration also stepped up lobbying efforts on and off of Capitol Hill. The Treasury Department encouraged business executives to call lawmakers and urge swift passage of a deal, while the White House said that Vice President Dick Cheney had canceled a campaign trip to New Mexico and Wyoming in order to help negotiate a package.
 Speaking from the White House, President Bush noted the disagreements among lawmakers about how the rescue should be shaped. ''But there is no disagreement,'' he said, ''that something substantial must be done.'' 
 Discussions on a draft bill were continuing, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said he was hopeful that with cooperation between Republicans and Democrats, a bill could be done by midnight Friday, and could be voted on Sunday or Monday.
 Mr. Reid, standing next to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the Senate banking committee, said that negotiations had been headed toward a successful conclusion Thursday evening, but that the arrival of the presidential candidates, Mr. McCain and Senator Barack Obama, as well as the failure of House Republican leaders to participate in some discussions, helped to derail them.
 ''The insertion of presidential politics into the process has not been helpful,'' Mr. Reid said. ''It's been harmful.'' (The McCain committee rejected that interpretation of events, asserting that Mr. McCain's decision to momentarily suspend his campaign ''was made in the hopes that politics could be set aside to address our economic crisis,'' and that too many in Washington were playing the ''blame game.'')
 House Republicans leaders said they were only trying to protect taxpayers. ''We will not agree to a bill that sell taxpayers' out to bail out Wall Street,'' the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said. Fielding questions in a Capitol corridor, the Congressman told the reporters he would not negotiate in front of them because ''last time I checked, you didn't have a vote.''
 Mr. Boehner, who said Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri would lead House negotiators for his side, disputed the notion that he had sprung a surprise on Thursday by offering alternate bailout ideas. 
 On the contrary, he said, he had been talking with administration officials and Ms. Pelosi about different ways to approach the crisis.
 Earlier Friday morning, lawmakers staked out their positions on a round of morning television talk shows. Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that an agreement depended on House Republicans' ending their opposition and ''dropping this revolt'' against the plan proposed by the administration, The Associated Press reported. He described the rival plan as ''an ambush.'' 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee and a critic of the plan, said the proposal had to change before it would win support of Republicans.

HEADLINE: Russia Loans Venezuela $1 Billion for Military

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Russia will loan Venezuela $1 billion for arms purchases and military development, a Kremlin spokesman said Friday, the second day of a visit here by President Hugo Chavez aimed at tightening a relationship that has caused increasing discomfort in the West. 
 Mr. Chavez , who is on his second visit to Russia in two months, met with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday, and on Friday traveled to the southern city of Orenburg near the border with Kazakhstan to meet with President Dmitri A. Medvedev. 
 A Kremlin statement released Thursday night said Mr. Putin and Mr. Chavez had spoken on enhancing economic cooperation and trade in commercial goods as well as military technologies. 
 The $1 billion loan will help finance programs related to military-technical cooperation, the statement said. The Kremlin spokesman, who spoke anonymously under normal diplomatic ground rules, would not elaborate on the details of the deal. 
 Between 2005 and 2007 Venezuela has signed 12 contracts for weapons purchases from Russia for a total of more than $4.4 billion, the Kremlin statement said. 
 The move is the latest gesture of military friendship between Russia and Venezuela, two counties that have increasingly positioned themselves as mavericks vis-a-vis the West. The Kremlin says its economic and political stability have allowed it to broaden the scope of its military and economic cooperation beyond what it calls its traditional sphere of influence. 
 Moscow is also frustrated with what it considers aggressive military posturing from the West, particularly the United States. Washington's plans to deploy elements of a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, as well as its support of NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine, have set Russia on edge. 
 In turn, Russia has sought to expand its military footprint in recent years, inching closer and closer to American shores. Russian bombers have flown sorties close to Alaska and its naval vessels have been pushing deeper into the Atlantic. 
 Latin America, and Venezuela in particular, has become has become a major theater for this expansion. 
 Earlier this month a pair of Russian Tu-160 long-range bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons received a warm welcome when they landed in Venezuela. Russia has also dispatched a squadron from its North Sea Fleet to the Caribbean to take part in joint naval exercises with the Venezuelan Navy sometime in November. 
 ''Latin America, of course, is becoming an obvious link in the chain making up a multipolar world,'' Mr. Putin said during his meeting with Mr. Chavez. ''We will allocate more and more attention to this vector of our economics and foreign policy.'' 
 Russia has already delivered Sukhoi Su-30 fighters, Mi-17 transport helicopters, and thousands of Kalashnikov assault rifles to Venezuela. There are also plans to build a factory in the country that will manufacture these weapons under license. 
 Ties between the two countries appear to have been strengthened following Russia's five-day war with Georgia last month, which caused relations between Moscow and the West to plummet to their lowest point since the Cold War. 
 At his meeting with Mr. Medvedev on Friday, Mr. Chavez expressed ''firm support'' for Russia's unilateral recognition of independence for Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two Georgian separatist enclaves, Interfax reported. Only Nicaragua has officially followed Moscow's recognition, which prompted broad international criticism.
 Mr. Chavez's remarks fell short of official recognition of the republics, despite speculation that he would use his visit to offer it.

HEADLINE: D-Day Has Arrived For Congress

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Here we go again.
 Just nine days ago -- Thursday, Sept. 18 -- financial Armageddon was warded off when word began to leak about the government's giant bailout plan. The news first broke around 2:10 p.m., when Bloomberg moved an article quoting Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, as saying the government was considering a ''permanent'' plan to address the financial crisis. (In fact, as Mr. Schumer told me later, he had not meant for his words to sound so definitive; he really didn't know the planning was so far along.) 
 Then, less than an hour later, CNBC reported that an ''R.T.C.-type plan'' was being readied by the Treasury Department. That did it. In the time between the Bloomberg article and the CNBC report, the stock market rose 145 points. In a 45-minute burst right after the CNBC report, stocks rose another 270 points. The Dow closed up 410 points. 
 And by the time Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. made his big speech on Friday morning, laying out some of the details of the government's $700 billion bailout plan, a good deal of the pressure in the markets had eased. The credit-default swap spreads narrowed on Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, meaning that the credit market was less worried about the possibility that they might default. 
 Morgan Stanley, which had been frantically negotiating a merger with Wachovia, stopped the negotiations. Money market funds, which had been hit hard by withdrawals earlier in the week, saw an inflow of money. Other credit indicators also suggested that the credit markets were unfreezing.
 Here we are a week later, and guess what? Armageddon is again approaching. All week long, the credit-default swap spreads on Morgan Stanley widened, until, by Friday, they were actually worse than they were at any time during the previous week. (And this time, the chief executive, John J. Mack, can't blame the short-sellers for his troubles, since short-selling in financial stocks has been temporarily banned.)
 On Thursday, investment-grade loans were trading lower than junk bonds, because investors were selling off their most liquid assets to raise capital. Wachovia, the nation's fifth-largest bank holding company, suddenly appeared to be in deep trouble: ''Wachovia is trading as if it's going to fail,'' Dave Klein, a manager at Credit Derivatives Research, said on Friday. Washington Mutual was seized by the government. The markets may not be as panicked as they were last week, but with every passing day, the situation is getting increasingly dangerous. 
 Or, to put it another way, with every passing day, Congress is fiddling while Rome is burning.
 Last week, I wrote a column suggesting that the Paulson plan was unlikely to fix the enormous problems facing the financial markets and the country's faltering economy. I am still not sure it will work -- or that it is the best possible solution -- but this week, I have a different, more urgent concern. 
 Whatever its imperfections -- and despite the possibility it might not work -- it needs to be approved, quickly. I'm praying that by the time the markets open on Monday, Congressional leaders will have reached a consensus on the bailout plan. We're running out of time.
 I know there is something tremendously galling about the prospect of Americans putting $700 billion -- or more -- of their tax dollars at risk to come to the aid of banks and investment banks whose reckless behavior has so damaged the country. They gamed the system. They lined their pockets. They made terrible, terrible mistakes. I'm as angry about it as you are. 
 I am also aware that there are lots of smart people who don't like the bailout plan. On my blog the other day, I posted a letter to the House leadership from more than 200 economists. They complained about what they saw as the plan's essential unfairness (''The plan is a subsidy to investors at taxpayers' expense''), its ambiguity (''Neither the mission of the new agency nor its oversight are clear''), and the potential that it might ultimately weaken the very markets it was aimed at saving. The objection of the House Republicans who are currently blocking the plan -- namely, that a taxpayer bailout of this magnitude should be avoided if at all possible -- also deserves to be taken seriously.
 Finally, I've been hearing a number of interesting ideas that could well turn out to be better than the Paulson plan. One of the most intriguing ones comes from Andrew Feldstein, the chief executive of Blue Mountain Capital Management, a hedge fund that specializes in credit instruments. He proposes that instead of buying bad assets that are crippling the balance sheets of the nation's banks, the government should establish a ''good bank'' that would buy only solid assets. 
 By setting up such a bank -- Mr. Feldstein envisions having the government put up $300 billion and taking an equity stake, so that taxpayers can profit when it is sold after the crisis passes -- the government would make it possible for credit to ''again flow to deserving borrowers.'' Bad banks might eventually fail -- but they would have a place to sell their good assets as they liquidate. Healthier institutions could once again start lending. Taxpayers would face much less risk.
 If the country had more time, I would argue that we put ideas like that into the sunlight and see if they flower. But we don't have any more time. Nine days ago, the financial markets were staring into the abyss; the only thing that pulled them back was the news that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve had come up with a bailout plan.
 And the only thing that has kept them from falling back is the expectation that the plan will be approved quickly. For a while, it looked as if that was exactly what would happen. 
 Mr. Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, spent the early part of the week defending the plan before Congress. While they faced tough questioning, their main point came through: they had to act fast, otherwise the economy would crater. 
 Behind the scenes, Congressional leaders began to hammer out the outline of a deal, with the Democrats insisting on strong oversight for the fund, curbs on executive compensation for institutions that sold off their toxic securities to the government and aid for struggling homeowners, among other things.
 On Thursday, after an arduous three-hour meeting, it appeared a deal had been struck, but it quickly fell apart after House Republicans -- and Senator John McCain -- objected to it. That afternoon, I had a short conversation with Representative Barney Frank, the Democrat from Massachusetts who leads the House Financial Services Committee. He was seething.
 ''Spencer was in the meeting with us the whole time,'' he said. He was referring to Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, who was representing the House Republicans in the negotiations. ''And now here comes John McCain acting like Andy Kaufman -- 'Here I come to save the day.' Inserting presidential politics into this is just ---- '' He stopped suddenly. Whatever word he had in mind he didn't want to share with a reporter. 
 There is no question that a large part of the reason House Republicans are objecting to the Paulson plan is because of the potential loss of taxpayers' money. 
 ''Putting $700 billion of taxpayers' money at risk -- that's not something we do every day,'' said an aide to the House minority staff (who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the leadership). Indeed,the proposal offered by Representative John A. Boehner, the House minority leader -- to create a government-backed insurance pool to guarantee mortgage-backed securities -- is another of those interesting ideas that would deserve merit if there were more time.
 But it is also true that much of the opposition to the Paulson plan is purely ideological -- there are Republicans who believe that the bailout plan is a step toward socialism. And it appears that they would rather see the economy go down the tubes than do something they find ideologically distasteful.
 And that's what is so infuriating. Henry Paulson is not what you'd call a socialist -- nor is Ben Bernanke or President Bush. They are all holding their noses as they sell this plan. Barney Frank is allied with Mr. Paulson and a president he holds in low esteem because he, too, believes this is a step the country has to take.
 And so do the markets themselves, which is the most important point of all. Psychology always drives market behavior, and right now, the markets are desperately clinging to the idea that the Paulson plan is the only hope of regaining the confidence of borrowers, lenders and investors. Politics is politics, but the markets are not going to wait forever for a deal to be struck. In fact, I don't think they are going to wait much past the weekend. No deal, no credit markets. It's as basic as that.
 And if that happens, the consequences will be far more pressing than the failure of a Morgan Stanley or a Goldman Sachs. You won't be able to get a mortgage. Credit card rates will skyrocket. Businesses will be unable to expand and grow. Unemployment will rise. 
 Every part of our economy depends on the credit markets. I know you've heard it before, but it bears repeating. If we do not claw our way out of this crisis, the country will face a severe recession.
 On Friday, the German finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, predicted that America would ''lose its superpower status in the global financial system.'' He may well turn out to be right, but let's worry about that later, O.K.? 
 Right now, our elected representatives need to get down to business and agree to pass the Paulson plan. If they don't, they -- and we -- will live to regret it.

HEADLINE: Terrorism Fears and Economic Trouble Shake Pakistan's Faith in New Leader

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Pir Zubair Shah contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
A week after the bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel here, Pakistan is struggling to deal with a financial meltdown and a terrorism threat that has moved to the nation's heart and badly shaken confidence in the new government among Pakistanis, diplomats and investors alike.
 In New York on Friday, President Asif Ali Zardari met with representatives of a group of donor countries, including the United States and Saudi Arabia, who were trying to come up with $5 billion to prevent Pakistan from defaulting on its debt.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said afterward that the United States would work toward Pakistan's economic stability. But no decisions were made, according to participants, except that the donors would meet again in Abu Dhabi next month.
 As the financial situation has deteriorated, diplomats here have become increasingly uneasy about the government's capacity to prevent further attacks on the scale of the hotel bombing, which killed at least 53 people and wounded more than 250 others. 
 ''The cabinet in Islamabad is confronted with a general breakdown of the state,'' said an editorial in the Friday issue of The Daily Times, a newspaper that generally supports the government of President Zardari. 
 In an extraordinary attempt at calming the jitters, Rehman Malik, the senior adviser at the Interior Ministry, met Friday with more than 50 ambassadors to try to reassure them that their embassies and their staffs would be safe. 
 Mr. Malik's audience went into the meeting with ''very deep concern,'' a senior diplomat said. They came out barely reassured, he said. 
 He and another Western ambassador, neither of whom wanted to be identified when commenting on domestic matters, said they were disturbed that Mr. Malik did not report any progress on the investigation into the Marriott bombing, or how it was carried out. ''If they start arresting groups, that would reassure us,'' the senior diplomat said.
 Mr. Malik used a PowerPoint presentation to outline new security measures that included more police officers around the enclave where many embassies are situated, and more concrete barriers and closed-circuit television cameras.
 But a second ambassador said that although Mr. Malik showed ''good will,'' there were grave doubts about the government's ability to finance and follow through on the steps.
 The American Embassy closed its visa section on Thursday and Friday after what it called continuing threats. Embassy staff members were encouraged to work from home. All American government employees were forbidden, according to embassy orders, to stay at hotels in Pakistan's main cities.
 The bombing has cast gloom over the capital that is compounding the economic troubles that outlasted the administration of President Pervez Musharraf. 
 Lawyers and businessmen have talked about moving away, particularly to Dubai or Malaysia. Foreign investment had almost dried up before the attack, they said, and now some worried it would disappear altogether. Some of Pakistan's biggest businessmen had already shipped capital abroad, crimping new business ventures.
 Moody's, the international credit rating agency, cut Pakistan's credit outlook from ''stable'' to ''negative'' on Tuesday, citing dwindling foreign exchange reserves, risks from extremists and high inflation.
 Foreign exchange reserves have shrunk to $5.7 billion, with only about $3 billion available to cover payments for oil and food, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
 A major disappointment for the government has been the failure of Saudi Arabia, a traditional benefactor, to announce concessions on oil. In past economic crunches, Saudi Arabia has agreed to defer payment for the 100,000 barrels of oil Pakistan imports daily from the kingdom, the economists said.
 That has not happened this time, and even with the recent drop in oil prices, Pakistan is eating through its reserves at the rate of about $1.25 billion a month, Pakistani economists say.
 ''The international community cannot allow Pakistan to become a failed state,'' said a senior economist from one of the international financial institutions trying to salvage the economy.
 Diplomats and others are weighing what steps to take for themselves. 
 British Airways announced this week that it was suspending all flights from London to Islamabad, the only direct connection between Europe and Pakistan.
 At a meeting on Friday, senior officials of the United Nations agencies in Pakistan postponed a decision on whether to send family members of their foreign employees home, participants said. 
 Such a move would have sent an unmistakable signal that the security situation was grave. It would also likely have prompted some of the 250 United Nations employees to leave with their families, threatening projects ranging from Unicef's efforts to immunize children against polio to the World Food Program's distribution of food.
 Of most concern, the ambassadors said, is lax security in the capital. On the night of the bombing, the policemen along the roads in the center of the city, which is designated a high-security ''red alert zone,'' were sitting on the curb eating in the ritual breaking of the Ramadan fast, the senior diplomat said. 
 That was one reason it was so easy for the truck to approach the Marriott without scrutiny, he said.
 Pakistani officials and Western diplomats said they believed that the attack had been organized by the Pakistani Taliban, who work with Al Qaeda in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.
 Most troubling was the likelihood that the huge amount of explosives -- estimated at 1,300 to 2,200 pounds -- had been loaded onto the truck over time in relatively small quantities. 
 It seemed likely that the truck was prepared somewhere within Islamabad, according to a Pakistani intelligence official who declined to be identified by name because he was not authorized to talk on the matter. He said the suicide bomber who drove the truck came from a training camp in Waziristan, a Qaeda stronghold.
 The explosives used for the bomb were TNT and RDX, mixed with aluminum oxide, said Talat Masood, a retired army general and a former director of Pakistan's largest munitions and weapons factory.
 Such explosives are commonly found in anti-tank mines, Mr. Masood said. The explosives could have come from stores left behind by the Soviets when they left Afghanistan, he said. He said he was confident that investigators would discover the ''signature'' that would reveal where the explosives came from.
 Though the death toll published by Pakistani newspapers is 53, foreign embassies said they had been informed by the Pakistani foreign office that more than 60 had died.
 Two American military men -- Petty Officer Third Class Matthew J. O'Bryant, 22, of Duluth, Ga., a Navy cryptologic technician, and Maj. Rodolfo I. Rodriguez, 34, of El Paso, from the Air Force's 86th Construction and Training Squadron at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, died in the attack, the American Embassy said. A third American, described as a contractor for the State Department, is unaccounted for, the embassy said.
 Even Pakistanis accustomed to suicide bomb attacks against government installations have been shaken by the attack on a landmark hotel and the prospect of more assaults on soft targets.
 At a shopping center in Islamabad, Akhlaq Abbasi, 60, leaned on his counter and surveyed his empty store. Sales of fabric for men's suits and drapes, and cloth for women's traditional dress had evaporated since the Marriott attack, he said. 
 Babar Sattar, a prominent lawyer, talking over a cup of coffee at McDonald's, said he would stay. But everyone was depressed, he said. ''The government's first reaction was: 'We've done all we could.' That's what really terrifies people. There seems no way to stopping the attacks.''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 30, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about a decrease in confidence in the Pakistani government among Pakistanis, diplomats and investors after a bomb attack at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad paraphrased incorrectly from a comment by a spokesman for the American Embassy there about the status of one of three Americans. The spokesman said the whereabouts of the man, described as a contractor for the State Department, were unknown; the spokesman did not say that the American was dead. (On Sunday, the spokesman said the remains of the contractor had since been identified, but he did not release additional information.)

HEADLINE: Leading the G.O.P. Vanguard Against the Bailout

 BODY:
Representative Jeb Hensarling
 Republican of Texas
 Since being elected to the House in 2002, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, has loudly called for cutting spending and taxes -- not surprising for a protege of former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, who was Mr. Hensarling's professor at Texas A&M University.
 During his first term in the House, Mr. Hensarling, who represents part of Dallas and some of its suburbs, co-founded the ''Washington Waste Watchers,'' which sought to eradicate abuse, fraud and waste in government. Mr. Hensarling has also proposed a constitutional amendment that would limit the growth in federal spending to the rate of economic growth. 
 He says the sponsors of pet projects added to appropriation bills should be publicly identified, to make members think twice before submitting requests. Now the chairman of the Republican Study Committee -- a group he has called the ''keeper of the conservative flame'' -- Mr. Hensarling, 51, urged Republicans to return to their conservative roots after they lost the House and Senate in 2006. 
 ''Like mosquitoes in a nudist colony,'' he said after the 2006 elections, ''Republicans will have more than enough opportunities to show the voters we deserve our conservative brand back.''
 Representative Eric Cantor 
 Republican of Virginia
 Now finishing his fourth term in the House, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, is widely seen as a rising star both among conservatives and in the Republican Party. His name was one of those floated as a potential running mate for Senator John McCain. 
 Mr. Cantor, 45, whose political base is in the Richmond area, was appointed chief deputy whip of the Republican caucus after just two years in Congress. He is one of his party's premier fund-raisers, having raised around $30 million for Republican House candidates in 2006 as head of the National Republican Congressional Committee's ''Battleground'' program.
 A former real estate developer, Mr. Cantor has collected thousands of dollars in donations for his own campaigns from Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, though his most consistent contributions come from companies with bases in Virginia, like Dominion Resources and Philip Morris USA. 
 A fiscal conservative like the other members of the trio, Mr. Cantor has displayed some sharp elbows while in Congress. He was called a ''Bush attack dog'' in 2004, and he harshly criticized Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, for visiting Syria in 2007 and meeting the country's president, Bashar al-Assad.
 Representative Paul Ryan
 Republican of Wisconsin
 Once among the youngest members of Congress, Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and now 38, became the ranking member of the House Budget Committee last year.
 From that perch, Mr. Ryan, a protege of former Cabinet secretaries Jack F. Kemp and William J. Bennett, has fervently pushed supply-side economic theory. 
 He offered a plan in 2007 that would extend expiring tax cuts and called for a reformed budget process, saying the government could face bankruptcy unless it started spending less. Mr. Ryan also supported President Bush's attempts to change Social Security by allowing recipients to invest in personal accounts.
 He says he believes that the country's health care system should be more market-driven and more competitive.
 ''Washington really is broken,'' Mr. Ryan told a Wisconsin newspaper this year. But ''nobody wants to make a bold proposal out of fear of being demagogued and attacked by the other party.'' 
 Unlike Mr. Cantor and Mr. Hensarling, whose districts are reliably Republican, Mr. Ryan's district, which stretches from the Milwaukee suburbs to the Illinois border, gave George W. Bush only 54 percent of the vote in 2004. Still, Mr. Ryan has won more than 62 percent of the vote in each of his re-election campaigns.

HEADLINE: Politics Take Hold Of Bailout Proposal

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration and Congressional negotiators agreed on Friday to meet some demands of rebellious House Republicans as they sought to resurrect a $700 billion rescue plan for the nation's financial system that the critics said would spend too much taxpayer money upfront. 
 Democrats said that they had accepted a Republican proposal that would create a hybrid plan, allowing the Treasury to choose on a case-by-case basis between directly purchasing mortgage-backed securities, or offering government insurance for those troubled debts, the option pressed by the rebellious Republicans because it would keep the securities in private hands. 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, has dismissed the idea of an insurance program as inadequate, and has shown no indication that he would employ it, meaning that the concession appeared mostly symbolic. Initial reaction among House Republicans suggested that an optional insurance program would not be enough to win their support. 
 But the resumption of talks provided new hope of a deal and it came as the atmosphere around the negotiations became ever more charged politically, as President Bush again appealed for urgent action, and the calendar weighed on lawmakers who had hoped that Congress would adjourn this week so members could return home to campaign for re-election. 
 With the Jewish New Year beginning on Monday evening, lawmakers must pass a bill through the House and Senate by then or face the prospect of returning to Washington late next week. ''We will not leave until legislation is passed that will be signed by the president,'' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. 
 The lead Congressional negotiators said they would meet again on Saturday, but staff members, including officials from the Treasury Department, were working into the night, combing through the 102-page draft legislation that had some lawmakers predict at just before 1 p.m. on Thursday that a deal was close at hand. 
 The renewed talks came even as lawmakers were still reeling from Thursday's high drama at the White House where a meeting between Mr. Bush, Congressional leaders and the two presidential candidates -- Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama -- broke down in acrimony. 
 Democrats sought to seize advantage after the failed meeting, which Mr. Bush convened after Mr. McCain suspended his campaign and suggested delaying the first presidential debate in Mississippi. 
 ''Now that Senator McCain is safely in Mississippi, we can get back to serious work,'' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee and the lead negotiator for House Democrats in the bailout talks. Mr. Frank predicted a deal by Sunday. 
 House Republicans said that Mr. McCain had saved their caucus from being stampeded in negotiations by Democrats and by the White House. ''I believe and my colleagues believe that America is on the edge of an economic crisis,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. ''We believe that Congress needs to act and we need to act quickly.'' 
 For much of Friday, Wall Street seemed almost numb to the latest developments in Washington, but Mr. Bush's assurances that a deal was within reach and progress on Capitol Hill helped the Dow Jones industrial average rise 121.07 points, to 11,143.13, while the Nasdaq fell 3.23 points to 2,183.34. 
 On both sides, lawmakers are feeling tremendous pressure. Public opinion polls show the bailout to be deeply unpopular, and even lawmakers who say Congress must act to protect the economy see little political benefit in voting for it. 
 The political climate, combined with the combustible nature of presidential politics, contributed to the remarkable uprising by House Republicans who said on Thursday that they could not support the administration's plan. 
 They have challenged Democrats, who hold a majority in both chambers of Congress, to approve the rescue package on their own. Democrats said they could not muster enough votes to pass a bill requested by the White House unless Mr. Bush persuades his fellow Republicans to go along. 
 Republicans on Friday sought to contain the disarray that led House members and Mr. McCain to balk at the administration's plan on Thursday, just hours after some Republican senators said they were very close to a deal on the rescue plan.
 The purchase by the government of up to $700 billion in troubled assets is the centerpiece of the rescue plan, which seeks to restore liquidity to the markets and keep credit flowing to businesses and consumers. 
 The administration's original proposal asked for virtually unfettered authority for the Treasury secretary, but Congressional leaders and Mr. Paulson had already agreed to a number of changes, including an independent oversight board; limits on pay for executives of firms that seek government assistance; and a mechanism that would allow taxpayers to profit should the rescue plan help companies prosper in the future. 
 The insurance program promoted by the House Republicans as an alternative to the government buy-up of troubled assets would require financial firms to pay premiums, and House Republicans appeared reluctant to explain on Friday exactly how it would work. A major problem on Wall Street is that many of the firms are short on cash. Even Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, and a main proponent of the insurance idea, conceded that it could only work in conjunction with a direct purchase of troubled debt by the Treasury. 
 In addition to pressing for the insurance package, Republicans also demanded that any profits from the rescue plan be returned to the Treasury, while Democrats want 20 percent of profits used to create affordable housing. 
 House Republicans on Friday installed Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House whip, to replace Spencer Bachus of Alabama as their lead negotiator.
 The office of Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader from Kentucky, said Senate Republicans would be represented by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior member of the budget committee.
 As Mr. Paulson and other administration officials sought to get the talks back on track, the administration also stepped up lobbying efforts on and off of Capitol Hill. The Treasury Department encouraged business executives to call lawmakers and urge swift passage of a deal, while the White House said that Vice President Dick Cheney had canceled a campaign trip to New Mexico and Wyoming in order to help negotiate a package.
 The administration has enlisted chief executives from dozens of the nation's largest companies to call members of Congress, urging them to settle their differences and pass the bailout plan. 
 Among those who have made calls, according to people involved in the campaign, were Rick Wagoner of General Motors and Harold McGraw III of McGraw-Hill. The chief executives of General Electric, Caterpillar, Dow Chemical and DuPont are also taking part, they said.
 ''Our concern is what's happening in the credit market,'' said John J. Castellani, the president of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives from about 160 companies.

HEADLINE: McCain: Bearish On Debates

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
John McCain looked a bit off his game during the big presidential debate. Maybe he was exhausted from parachuting into Washington to resolve the financial crisis. Really, there are only so many hills a man can charge up in the course of a single week.
 The debate had barely begun, the financial crisis barely addressed, when McCain started off on government spending. ''You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana ...'' 
 Oh, no! Not the bear study. Congress is working feverishly on the $700 billion rescue of the national financial system and McCain is complaining again about the $3 million the Senate blew to help determine whether the grizzlies are still an endangered species. 
 To be fair, both McCain and Barack Obama appeared equally eager to move past the central issue of the day and on to -- anything else. Neither seems capable of saying anything about the credit crisis except that it's important to protect Main Street from Wall Street. Don't the other streets of America deserve a little consideration, candidates? Can we have a few mentions for Elm Street once in a while? What about Broadway?
 Least compelling moment following the bear DNA episode: the intense argument over whose position on negotiating with Iran was most like Henry Kissinger's. 
 This was supposed to be the foreign affairs debate, and it's hard to beat down McCain on foreign affairs -- anybody who can start a sentence with ''I've been to Waziristan ...'' has a natural advantage. But Obama really more than held his own.
 ''John, you like to pretend like the war started in 2007,'' he said. ''You talk about the surge. The war started in 2003. And at the time, when the war started, you said it was going to be quick and easy. You said we knew where the weapons of mass destruction were. You were wrong.'' Although this is a very old argument, it sounded remarkably fresh, like revisiting semiforgotten territory. 
 McCain stumbled over the name of the president of Iran and misstated the name of the new leader of Pakistan. This would, under normal circumstances, be less than nothing. But the first presidential debate is meant to be an event so fraught with meaning that combat to the death pales in comparison. Every word matters!
 This campaign has been so chock full of excitement, however, that the debate lost some of its normal most-important-moment-in-history sheen. The real tension, after all, had been getting McCain there in the first place. A simple trip to Mississippi turned into a saga featuring many, many rapidly changing story lines:
 * Cancel the debate! 
 * Maybe cancel the debate!
 * No debate unless Congress passes a financial rescue bill!
 * No debate unless Congress has a plan to pass a financial rescue bill. 
 * Oh, what the heck.
 After all that, when the wandering debater finally showed up Friday night, he just looked like a smallish, grayish, slightly grumpy guy with a grizzly obsession. 
 To be fair, it had been a very long week for McCain, what with ruling out the debate, ruling in the debate and returning to a Senate from which he has been AWOL so long that it's believed his desk is now being used to store janitorial supplies. 
 He raced there in answer to the crisis call, after a brief detour to New York to deliver a desperately needed speech on fossil fuels at the Clinton Global Initiative. He could not have sounded more filled with passion about service and country and the need for his leadership. Then he joined President Bush, Obama and members of Congress in a White House meeting that his campaign had orchestrated, where he sat in near-silence as a bipartisan consensus fell apart. 
 One thing we now know for sure. Electing John McCain would be God's gift to the profession of journalism. A story a minute.
 Imagine what would happen if a new beetle infested the Iowa corn crop during the first year of a McCain administration. On Monday, we spray. On Tuesday, we firebomb. On Wednesday, the president marches barefoot through the prairie in a show of support for Iowa farmers. On Thursday, the White House reveals that Wiley Flum, a postal worker from Willimantic, Conn., has been named the new beetle eradication czar. McCain says that Flum had shown ''the instincts of a maverick reformer'' in personally buying a box of roach motels and scattering them around the post office locker room. ''I can't wait to introduce Wiley to those beetles in Iowa,'' the president adds.
 On Friday, McCain announces he's canceling the weekend until Congress makes the beetles go away.
 Barack Obama would just round up a whole roomful of experts and come up with a plan. Yawn.

HEADLINE: Palin's Words Raise Red Flags

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The country is understandably focused on the financial crisis. But there is another serious issue in front of us that is not getting nearly enough attention, and that's whether Sarah Palin is qualified to be vice president -- or, if the situation were to arise, president of the United States.
 History has shown again and again that a vice president must be ready to assume command of the ship of state on a moment's notice. But Ms. Palin has given no indication yet that she is capable of handling the monumental responsibilities of the presidency if she were called upon to do so. 
 In fact, the opposite is the case. We know that there are some parts of Alaska from which, if the day is clear and your eyesight is good, you can actually see Russia. But the infantile repetition of this bit of trivia as some kind of foreign policy bona fide for a vice presidential candidate should give us pause. 
 The McCain campaign has done its bizarre best to shield Ms. Palin from any sustained media examination of her readiness for the highest offices in the land, and no wonder. She has been an embarrassment in interviews. 
 But the idea that the voters of the United States might install someone in the vice president's office who is too unprepared or too intellectually insecure to appear on, say, ''Meet the Press'' or ''Face the Nation'' is mind-boggling.
 The alarm bells should be clanging and warning lights flashing. You wouldn't put an unqualified pilot in the cockpit of a jetliner. The potential for catastrophe is far, far greater with an unqualified president.
 The United States has been lucky in terms of the qualifications of the vice presidents who have had to step in over the last several decades for presidents who either died or, in Richard Nixon's case, were forced to leave office. Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson became extraordinary presidents in their own right. Gerald Ford successfully guided the nation through the immediate aftermath of one of the most traumatic political crises in its history.
 For those who think Sarah Palin is in that league, there is no problem. But her unscripted public appearances would lead most honest observers to think otherwise. When asked again this week about her puerile linkage of foreign policy proficiency and Alaska's proximity to Russia, this time by Katie Couric of CBS News, here is what Ms. Palin said she meant:
 ''That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, Russia, and on our other side, the land -- boundary that we have with -- Canada.''
 She went on, but lost her way midsentence: ''It's funny that a comment like that was kind of made to -- cari -- I don't know, you know? Reporters ...''
 Ms. Couric said, ''Mocked?''
 ''Yeah, mocked,'' said Ms. Palin. ''I guess that's the word. Yeah.''
 It is not just painful, but frightening to watch someone who could become the vice president of the United States stumbling around like this in an interview.
 Ms. Couric asked Ms. Palin to explain how Alaska's proximity to Russia ''enhances your foreign policy credentials.''
 ''Well, it certainly does,'' Ms. Palin replied, ''because our, our next-door neighbors are foreign countries, there in the state that I am the executive of. And there--''
 Gently interrupting, Ms. Couric asked, ''Have you ever been involved in any negotiations, for example, with the Russians?''
 ''We have trade missions back and forth,'' said Ms. Palin. ''We do. It's very important when you consider even national security issues with Russia. As Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace of the United States of America, where do they go? It's Alaska. It's just right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because they are right there. They are right next to our state.''
 It was surreal, the kind of performance that would generate a hearty laugh if it were part of a Monty Python sketch. But this is real life, and the stakes couldn't be higher. As Ms. Palin was fumbling her way through the Couric interview, the largest bank failure in the history of the United States, the collapse of Washington Mutual, was occurring.
 The press has an obligation to hammer away at Ms. Palin's qualifications. If it turns out that she has just had a few bad interviews because she was nervous or whatever, additional scrutiny will serve her well.
 If, on the other hand, it becomes clear that her performance, so far, is an accurate reflection of her qualifications, it would behoove John McCain and the Republican Party to put the country first -- as Mr. McCain loves to say -- and find a replacement for Ms. Palin on the ticket.

HEADLINE: Do I Hear 4%? On This Site, Banks Bid for Your Cash

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN some bazaars, vendors call out their prices, lowering them on the spot as they vie with one another for a shopper's business.
 That's the kind of competitive selling -- and possible good deals for shoppers -- that one new Web site hopes to bring to those looking to invest a nest egg in a certificate of deposit or other savings account at an attractive rate.
 The hawking will not be done by shouting vendors, but instead through a modern, electronic equivalent: automated auction software running on a Web site that gets its bidding orders from dozens of banks looking for business. When a customer comes to the site and asks for the terms of a C.D., the banks bid against one another via the software to win the deposit. 
 MoneyAisle (www.moneyaisle.com) has signed up 108 small and midsize banks across the country, many of them eager to build their customer bases, especially in a time when some investors are withdrawing money from shakier investments in search of a safer harbor. When people come to the site shopping for a C.D. or a high-yield savings account, the banks engage in a fast-moving auction. A hundred banks may bid in the first round, 80 in the second round, 50 in the third, until the bank with the highest offer wins the auction. 
 As the bids rise, the interest rates click past on the screen like numbers on the gauge of a gas pump. The customer can take the final deal or leave it. There's no charge. 
 The automated software engine was developed by neoSaej, the company in Burlington, Mass., that created MoneyAisle. Each bank can adjust this software, based on goals or market conditions, for example. If two banks offer the same final rate, the software randomly picks a winner. The winning bank pays a fee to neoSaej only if it acquires the customer. NeoSaej expects to expand the auctions to other products, said Mukesh Chatter, the C.E.O.
 MoneyAisle's business model of competing banks certainly owes some of its inspiration to LendingTree.com, a company that matches up shoppers with mortgages and other loans under the motto, ''When banks compete, you win.'' 
 But MoneyAisle is aiming for a multitude of bidders going after each customer. 
 Typically, 80 or so banks compete for the customers at MoneyAisle in active bidding, Mr. Chatter said. Then the customer sits back and waits to see who wins. At LendingTree, the number of banks who compete is usually capped at four, and the bidding is not automated, said Allison Vail, a LendingTree spokeswoman. ''We mail the consumer the loan offers, including rates, and they compare and select,'' she said.
 The software and hordes of competing banks that engage in automated bidding may prove attractive to some consumers, said Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., who directs the Laboratory of Financial Engineering there. ''There are many competitors trying to snap up the customer at MoneyAisle,'' he said, while LendingTree has far fewer competitors for loans.
 In search of competitive rates, I tried out MoneyAisle about three weeks ago, using the example of a six-month, $10,000 C.D. After a brisk, one-minute round of bidding involving 82 banks, I was offered 4.2 percent, well above the national average at the time of 3.15 percent. Last Wednesday, I tried again and didn't fare quite as well: the final offer was 4.02 percent, though still far above the national average of 3.19 percent.
 Bob Egan, chief analyst at the financial research firm TowerGroup in Needham, Mass., also experimented with MoneyAisle. ''I got the best deal I could find anywhere,'' he said of one search.
 But to offer attractive rates consistently, Mr. Egan said, neoSaej, which started MoneyAisle in June, will need to draw into its system far more banks and customers. ''If the bank population isn't large enough, and the bidding isn't aggressive enough, the consumer isn't going to get the best rate,'' he said. ''And, likewise, banks may be willing to bid for consumers' business, but it has to be worthwhile for them, too.''
 ISABELLA BANK in Mount Pleasant, Mich., is among the participants in MoneyAisle, said Greg Mapes, vice president. So far, its experience has been worthwhile. ''It allows us to reach additional customers without the expense of building an Internet presence,'' he said. ''We pay a fee only when we consummate a deal.''
 Benjie Guion, chief financial officer at NewDominion Bank in Charlotte, N.C., also a MoneyAisle participant, said the system had other advantages. ''At sites like Bankrate.com,'' he said, comparison sites that list banks and rates for C.D.'s and other products, ''banks pay when a customer clicks on their link, whether the customer signs up or not.'' At MoneyAisle, though, ''you don't pay every time they look at your bank,'' he said, ''only when an account is opened.''
 The MoneyAisle site, while original, has certain drawbacks, said Brad Strothkamp, an analyst at Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ''You are asking consumers to apply for a product online with a provider they don't know,'' he said. ''And it's not a brand name.'' 
 Professor Lo of M.I.T. said MoneyAisle was a creative idea well worth trying. ''This is an additional avenue for various banks to compete against one another to give consumers the highest rate,'' he said. ''It's a kind of eBay in reverse.'' But he, too, wasn't sure that the business model would succeed. 
 ''The power of the Internet is that it allows people to experiment and try out different business models,'' he said. ''The ones that ultimately add real value to the individual consumer will win out.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 5, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The Novelties column last Sunday about MoneyAisle.com, where banks offer interest-rate bids on certificates of deposit and other savings accounts, referred incorrectly to two procedures at LendingTree.com, where banks compete for mortgages and other loans. LendingTree's matching of consumers and competing banks, though not an auction, is indeed automated. And it sends offers by e-mail, not regular mail, for the consumer to compare.

HEADLINE: A Tally of Federal Rescues

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH

 BODY:
SOME very large numbers have become regular features of news reports of late.
The skyscraping sums involved in the government's aid to the financial system come in several varieties, from takeovers of troubled institutions to lines of credit to keep other companies going. Those numbers are shown here, along with items from the federal budget, for comparative purposes. But the two sets of figures differ in important ways. 
First, the rescues are mostly infusions of credit (loans, or assets that will eventually be resold) versus direct cash payments (spending on Social Security in 2008, for example). The government expects to get some of its rescue money back. Maybe most of it. It might even profit from some deals.
We are years away from knowing the ultimate cost to taxpayers. The 1979 Chrysler bailout, quaint by today's standards, was repaid in full (although the low interest rate was a form of subsidy) -- $3.6 billion in today's dollars. Now, Ford and G.M. are the latest to plead for help, asking for $25 billion in loan guarantees to retool factories for smaller cars.
The rescues cover varying periods of time, some yet to be determined. Most of the direct spending shown here is for the 2008 fiscal year.
Below are four kinds of financial lifelines that the government has tossed out since the collapse of Bear Stearns in March, and their potential value.
PURCHASES:
The largest expense. Taxpayers control Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the collapsed mortgage giants. And they may soon own billions in troubled mortgage securities, if a version of the Bush administration's plan to rescue the financial markets is approved by Congress. It provides up to $700 billion to purchase banks' troubled investments that are worth far less than banks paid for them; with the Fannie and Freddie takeovers, the goverment could spend as much as $900 billion acquiring these assets. It hopes to get much of that back by selling them. The difference between what the government takes in and spends is $407 billion for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30.
Guarantees
Earmarks Congress directed the Federal Housing Administration (F.H.A.) to insure up to $300 billion in refinanced mortgages to reduce foreclosures. The Treasury Department said it would use an obscure fund to insure customers of shaky money market funds against losses. Automakers are seeking $25 billion in loan guarantees.
Grants
The F.H.A. bill had grants of $4 billion for localities to buy foreclosed properties. President Bush opposed the provision as a giveaway to lenders but relented to get the larger bill passed
Loans
The Federal Reserve provided money for the Bear Stearns and A.I.G. rescues. It is lending throughout the financial system; as of Wednesday, it had more than $217 billion in additional outstanding credit. It also agreed to extend up to $277 billion in credit through foreign central banks.

HEADLINE: Deep Discounts Offered To Stimulate Travel

BYLINE: By HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
Travel companies and hotel chains continue to offer special deals to keep Americans moving despite rising gas prices and the ailing economy. Travelocity has the Race to Savings promotion, in which over 4,000 hotels, resorts and cruise lines are listing discounts and perks that can amount to up to 60 percent in savings. Hotel and vacation package rates are good for trips booked by Nov. 15 for travel through Jan. 15, 2009, and savings on selected cruises are good though December 2009 (www.travelocity.com/racetosavings). 
 And the Hilton Hotels HHonors program, which rewards points and miles to participants, is tripling the number of base points of those who spend a Sunday night at participating hotels in New York through Dec. 31. It is tripling the mileage points of those traveling to China (on 18 airlines) who also stay two nights at participating hotels starting Nov. 1 and going through Feb 2. It is also giving away up to 5,000 bonus points at some Hilton properties in Europe, and 2,500 bonus points at designated properties throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia to those whose stays include a Saturday night starting Oct. 1 (www.hiltonhhonors.com).

HEADLINE: On Massachusetts Ballot, a Tax Repeal That Worries Leaders

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: GRAFTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
Given the opportunity to get out of paying state income tax, who wouldn't jump at the chance? 
 Certainly Ruth Gregoire would. Ms. Gregoire, 71, a retired employee of a fire sprinkler company, dipped into chocolate ice cream at Swirls and Scoops and pronounced the no-tax idea ''very nice.''
 Lakis Theoharis, 56, the owner of the nearby Pepperoni Express, said: ''I'm for the repeal of the tax. To me, the smaller the government, the better for the citizens.''
 And Rich Masterson, 39, a trucking company supervisor, said, ''I would love to see that!'' 
 That view is exactly what most state and local officials in Massachusetts are afraid of. Amid the whirlwind presidential election, Massachusetts has a ballot contest of its own this November that could drastically alter -- some would say cripple -- state government. 
 At issue is Question 1, which would eliminate the state income tax. It would save the average taxpayer about $3,600 a year. Annual revenue from the tax is about $12.5 billion, roughly 45 percent of the state's budget of about $28 billion. 
 ''These are tough times for everyone as it is, and if Question 1 passes, things will become exponentially more difficult,'' said Leslie A. Kirwan, the Massachusetts secretary of administration and finance.
 Ms. Kirwan added that because some state programs cannot legally be cut, others would face cuts of 60 percent or more. The loss of billions of dollars from Question 1, she said, would devastate state services.
 Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, has called the ballot measure ''just a dumb idea.''
 And elected leaders across the state are worried.
 ''The knee-jerk reaction would be, 'That's a great idea because it means more money for me,' '' said Brook Padgett, chairman of the Board of Selectmen in Grafton, a town of about 17,000 near Worcester, which he said would lose 25 percent of its budget because of state cuts. ''It would affect everybody -- schools, police, municipal services, snow plowing. I couldn't begin to tell you what we would do.''
 Although Massachusetts is still often tagged with its ''Taxachusetts'' reputation, its recent history is more nuanced. 
 In 2000, voters approved a phased rollback of the income tax rate from 5.75 percent to 5 percent. The Legislature froze the rate at 5.3 percent in 2002, permitting further reductions only if economic conditions allowed.
 In 2002, a ballot measure to scrap the income tax received hardly any public attention. But to the shock of elected officials, it netted 45 percent of the vote statewide and a majority in nearly a third of towns. 
 Now, with the withering economy, opponents fear that Question 1 will have even more traction. 
 Health care workers, small-business owners and unions are especially concerned about that prospect. A new group, the Coalition for Our Communities, has raised $1.3 million, about $1 million of that from national teachers' unions, and plans television advertisements and direct mail campaigns against the repeal. 
 Karen White, director of campaigns and elections for the National Education Association, which has given $750,000, said the ''reckless proposal'' would have ''dire consequences that will put education at risk, health care at risk, public safety at risk.''
 She added: ''We're prepared to commit more money if we need to. We're going to do what we need to do to make sure that we win this one.''
 The pro-repeal effort, which gathered 11,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot, has much less money -- about $25,000 left to spend, disclosure reports show. 
 ''Politicians at the state and local level are overwhelmingly against us,'' said Carla Howell, chairwoman of the Committee for Small Government, who ran for governor in 2002. ''Everyday voters are much more inclined to end the income tax.'' 
 Question 1 would cut the tax by half the first year and eliminate it the next year, and Ms. Howell said the state could compensate by cutting lucrative employee pensions, paring bureaucracies and spending wisely. 
 ''We don't have to cut any essential services or any government programs that are providing a benefit to the people of Massachusetts,'' Ms. Howell said. ''All we have to do is cut government waste.''
 Some voters who wanted taxes lowered to 5 percent have decided to support Question 1 to show their anger at the state, said Barbara Anderson, director of Citizens for Limited Taxation, which advocated 5 percent but is now producing bumper stickers that read ''Hell Yes! Question 1.''
 ''It's the only game in town, it's the only question on the ballot, it's the only chance for us to express our outrage,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''The more we looked at it and realized that other states get along very well without an income tax, like New Hampshire, you start dreaming.''
 The 5.3 percent income tax rate is far from the nation's highest, and, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group, Massachusetts, which used to rank second in combined local and state tax burden, now ranks 23rd. 
 Only seven states have no income tax, but while ballot questions on sales and other taxes are common, those proposing income tax repeals are rare, said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, which supports the Massachusetts measure. North Dakota has a ballot measure this year to halve the state income tax. 
 ''There aren't many places where you can initiate an income tax repeal from the citizens that haven't already done it,'' Mr. Sepp said. 
 Still, even before the anti-repeal campaign has begun in earnest in Massachusetts, there are many voters who think Question 1 is a bad idea. 
 One poll, conducted by 7News/Suffolk University, found 36 percent in favor of eliminating the tax and 50 percent opposed. Another poll, conducted by WBZ-TV, was closer: 45 percent favored scrapping the tax, 47 percent wanted to keep it. 
 ''If it passes, you're looking at least double or triple whatever your property taxes are now,'' said Mike Kozlowski, who owns a garden store in Worcester. 
 Beth Piknick, a Cape Cod nurse who is president of the state nurses' association, said: ''This is really, really dangerous and extremely short-sighted. Unfortunately what happens is the populations that are most vulnerable get it first -- the disabled, the elderly, the poor.''
 In Grafton, where voters were evenly divided on repeal in 2002, people like Henry Cyr, 63, a retired Air Force officer, said, ''The trauma to our financial system would just be too great.'' 
 And Marcia LeBlanc, 66, a school bus driver, said: ''I don't think it's a good idea. How are they going to pay for state services?''
 State Representative George Peterson of Grafton, a Republican who voted for repeal in 2002, declined to say how he would vote this time. 
 ''If we lose $12.5 billion, can I build a responsible budget with that loss in revenue?'' Mr. Peterson asked. ''No, I can't.'' 
 But he suggested that if the repeal passed, even though it is technically binding, the Legislature might be forced to find a way around it and pass a new law setting taxes at the 5 percent rate voters asked for eight years ago. ''I'm telling my constituents, if you want to send a message that we have a budget that is out of control, send me that message.''

Henry Cyr, 63, a retired Air Force officer, opposes it. ''The trauma to our financial system would just be too great,'' he said.
 Rich Masterson, 39, a trucking company supervisor, supports the plan, which would cost the state about $12.5 billion a year. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CJ GUNTHER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: Bracing for Trickle-Down As Wall Street Flounders

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

 BODY:
WITH Wall Street's losses rocking the global economy, state officials and others say the shock waves will reach Connecticut, where thousands depend on New York's financial arena to make their living. But, they say, it is lost state income tax rather than lost jobs that will hurt the most.
 State government relies heavily on income taxes paid by its wealthiest citizens, many of whom live in Fairfield County, earning incomes of six, seven and eight figures from Wall Street jobs and investments. 
 When those who work in the financial services bring home less money, public services in the entire state suffer. ''You may not see a lot of people losing jobs, but those that do will affect us on the revenue side,'' John Tirinzonie, an economist for the State Department of Labor, said last week. 
 The state's coffers had suffered even before Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy filing and the takeover of Merrill Lynch this month. ''This will make it worse,'' said Jeffrey Beckham, a spokesman for the state's Office of Policy and Management. ''When Wall Street sneezes, we catch a cold.''
 Forty-five percent of the state's personal tax receipts come from residents of Fairfield County, whose wealth is rooted in Wall Street. And 30 percent is from people earning more than $1 million a year, most of whom live in Fairfield County -- ''what we refer to as the investor class,'' Mr. Beckham said. 
 For years, ''Fairfield County has subsidized government spending in other parts of the state,'' said Steven Lanza, executive editor of The Connecticut Economy. It was hard to balance the current budget, he said, and it will be tougher next year, given that thousands of Connecticut residents earn their living in New York's financial sector. 
 The state's biennial budget is intact until next June, so service cuts won't be seen before then. But when the next budget comes up for review, ''the whole panoply of services will be on the table,'' Mr. Beckham said. ''We'll have to take a look at all of it.''
 A sense of the dollars involved will emerge in January, when estimated tax payments are due, but the budget office will not have solid figures until after the state income tax filing deadline in April.
 Connecticut is heavily dependent on the financial services industry, through the pay packages and peripheral jobs the industry brings. Each Wall Street job is believed to support at least three others throughout the region, state officials said. In lower Fairfield, reduced spending means ''gardeners and chauffeurs will see less work,'' said Dr. Lanza, a professor in the University of Connecticut's department of economics. 
 In Stamford, Mayor Daniel P. Malloy said he wished that the government had stepped in sooner to stem the crisis. ''There's nervousness, but people believe in the long-term strength of Fairfield County,'' he said, noting that he spoke several times this month with Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, who said last week that his administration was considering a 7 percent property tax increase on homeowners in January to offset losses caused by the crisis. 
 Tighter lending policies resulting from the nation's mortgage crisis have delayed some building projects, Mr. Malloy said. Plans for a new Ritz-Carlton have stalled, but redevelopment of Stamford's South End will proceed, he said. RBS, which plans to open new headquarters next spring or early summer, recently bought an adjacent parcel, doubling its property. ''We're in regular contact with them,'' he said.
 ''We are a lower-cost alternative to New York,'' Mr. Malloy said. Because job reductions in Manhattan would be more cost-effective than layoffs in Stamford, he is optimistic that fewer jobs will be slashed in his area. 
 How the hedge funds concentrated in lower Fairfield County will fare remains to be seen. ''Some of these folks will do well picking up the pieces of others' demise, and others will close up,'' the mayor said. ''We don't have any clear signs on that.''
 STAMFORD'S downtown stores are preparing for ''the weakest Christmas in a decade, and some of the restaurants have taken a hit,'' Mayor Malloy said. But liquor stores' sales are up. ''People are staying in and having their wine at home with their home-cooked steak,'' he said.
 Some experts believe more businesses will fold, contract or consolidate, putting others out of work. For now, though, in-state jobs are holding steady while the overall number of unemployed is rising. Statewide, unemployment rose to 6.5 percent last month, inching past the national average of 6.1 percent.
 That might indicate the job losses are tied to employment outside the state, Dr. Lanza said. ''There could be 10,000 jobs lost in New York, so we'll see more people unemployed'' in Connecticut, he said. 
 Mr. Tirinzonie, the economist, said unemployment in the Stamford-Bridgeport corridor rose to 6 percent in August from 4.2 percent a year earlier. The speed with which the federal government stems the hemorrhaging on Wall Street will make a difference in the number of jobs lost, he said. ''Sooner or later it may affect Stamford, but nothing near what we're seeing on Wall Street,'' he said.
 Although jobs statewide are still up over last year, Mr. Tirinzonie anticipates an overall loss of jobs by year's end, ''but hopefully on the minor side.'' 
 Dr. Lanza said, ''This is not good for the housing industry.''
 As job losses mount, so will foreclosures, economists said. In the first seven months of this year, they increased 69.66 percent, to 3,215 from 1,895 in the same period last year, according to the Warren Group, which tracks real estate data in New England. New Haven County topped the list with 1,015 foreclosures, but Hartford County had the biggest percentage increase -- up 131.6 percent, to 755 from 326. 
 Statewide sales of single-family homes from January through July tumbled 25.31 percent, and the median price fell 8.33 percent. Fairfield County sales plunged the most, 32.24 percent, with the median price dropping 10.61 percent, to $545,250 from $610,000.
 Although some experts forecast a turnaround by next year, Dr. Lanza thinks it will take until 2010, when he believes house prices will stop falling. For now, lack of available credit and tighter lending policies are squeezing an already struggling market. 
 Casey Eggart, 31, of Bridgeport, had no trouble buying his house five years ago. ''It was 5 percent down, no credit check, nothing,'' he recalled. This summer, Mr. Eggart, a carpenter and the manager of New England Eyecare in Norwalk, tried to buy a home in foreclosure in Bridgeport that had sold for $260,000 in 2006 and was then priced at $99,000. Each of several banks approached for a mortgage quickly granted preapproval with a 5 percent down payment, but subsequently tightened their requirements, one wanting 25 percent down, another demanding a signed lease on Mr. Eggart's house, which he planned to rent out after renovating the new one. ''I think they're misleading everybody,'' he said of the lenders. 
 After the federal government agreed to bail out American International Group, the State Insurance Department's consumer affairs division received several hundred calls from consumers worried that their annuities would be lost. ''We try to instill some calm and a rational view,'' Insurance Commissioner Thomas R. Sullivan said. He said he was concerned about churning -- moving an annuity to another company and incurring transactional fees. ''I'm fearful that consumers will make decisions that aren't thought out,'' he said. 
 ''A.I.G. and its underwriting affiliates are still sound, solid, functioning affiliates,'' he said, stressing that the problems had occurred at the holding company level. Also, even in the worst case, safety nets exist in Connecticut, he said. A guaranty fund for annuities and life and health insurance protects investments up to $500,000. A guaranty fund for property insurance safeguards claims up to $400,000.
 Other insurers might benefit from the A.I.G. crisis. ''I would suspect competitors would view this as an opportunity,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Fine Philly

BYLINE: BY CAROLINE TIGER

 BODY:
Style Map Philadelphia
 This year, the printed program of events for the fourth Design Philadephia (Oct. 16-22) looks more like a book than a pamphlet a reflection, no doubt, of Philly's expanding creative economy. The local design culture is springing up in previously untrodden fringes of the city, while the mushrooming of design studios, boutiques and gallleries and the recent reinvention of several venerable cultural institutions attest to the spirit of optimism ushered in by a new mayor and his commitment to the arts. Here are some hot spots that contribute to the critical mass. CAROLINE TIGER
 1. Okooko 
 How much for the David Trubridge bed/boat in the window? At $25,000, the designer's Float is aspirational, but the other New Zealand-designed beds inside the only Okooko outpost in the United States are within reach. All share a certain grace of design and the use of sustainable native timber, and some have clever tricks like built-in iPod docks and sleek storage solutions. 205 Arch Street; (215) 667-8240; okooko.com.
 2. Perelman Building at the Philadelphia Museum of Art
 Behind the Art Deco facade of Fidelity insurance's former headquarters sits the Museum of Art's Richard Gluckman-designed addition, with its soaring galleria and galleries for works on paper, fashion and modern design. A satellite museum shop stocks works by design icons. Fairmount and Pennsylvania Avenues; (215) 763-8100; philamuseum.org/perelman.
 3. Calderwood 2
 ''A dealer's goal is to be ahead of the curve,'' says Janet Calderwood, who, with her husband, Gary, is known for selling top-shelf Art Deco design at their eponymous Center City gallery. To that end, they opened Calderwood 2 in a former warehouse on the up-and-coming North Broad Street. Managed by their son Chris, the store is full of poppy, mod and padded-shoulder decorative arts from the 1960s to the '80s. 631 North Broad Street; (215) 787-0677.
 4. Rae
 The local architecture firm DAS carved a restaurant out of the oblique, stark-white lobby of the Cira Centre, Cesar Pelli's faceted glass tower. The city skyline serves as a backdrop while the open kitchen blazing at the center sends out New American fare. 2929 Arch Street; (215) 922-3839; raerestaurant.com.
 5. The Independent Philadelphia
 An alternative to Philly's big convention hotels has arrived in the form of a boutique property in the heart of the Gayborhood. The rooms have copper-tiled ceilings and leopard-print rugs, but the best amenity might be the preprogrammed phones, with neighborhood restaurants on speed dial. 1234 Locust Street; theindependenthotel.com.
 6. Bruges Home
 Ed Gray is inspired by the Belgian aesthetic that mixes the organic, the handcrafted and the patinated. His vast, two-story shop is arranged in homey vignettes, making it easier to imagine the earthy Mud Australia dinnerware on your own table and the char-black vintage Swedish armchair, upholstered in Paul Smith for Maharam fabric, in conversation with your own leather couch. 323 Race Street; (215) 922-6041; brugeshome.com.
 7. The Fabric Workshop and Museum
 In 2007, this 31-year-old contemporary arts space relocated to its current location on Arch Street, where it now boasts two shops and four exhibition spaces, including two ''storefront projects,'' and a continuing window series showing work by the likes of Ingo Maurer and Ivan Navarro. 1214 Arch Street; (215) 561-8888; fabricworkshop.org.
 8. Wood Turning Center 
 The hub of the international wood-turning community maintains a low profile, but those who stumble across its pristine headquarters on the edge of Old City are rewarded with a gallery of rotating exhibitions featuring work by emerging and internationally known artists. The spacious museum store sells everything from exotic hardwood and metal bangles to the stunning, jigger-size vessels that inexplicably started as pine cones on the artist Michael Shuler's lathe. 501 Vine Street; (215) 923-8000; woodturningcenter.org.

BYLINE: BY CHRISTINE LENNON

 BODY:
Heath Ceramics, the Sausalito, Calif., dinnerware and tile manufacturer, is such a good example of a modern-day company with a conscience (and a cult following) that it's easy to forget Heath has been at it, with very few changes to its methods, for more than 50 years. Throughout Northern California, devotees talk about the dinnerware as if the pieces were heirlooms -- and certainly they're durable enough to span generations -- while dozens of area restaurants serve their locally grown sunchokes on Heath plates. (There is even a Heath Chez Panisse collection.) And in the last few years, under energetic new ownership, Heath has not only expanded and updated its product lines but also begun to invite other, like-minded companies to its table, all of which are committed to making products in an environmentally sound, aesthetically glorious way. 
 ''Primarily, we were looking for companies or individuals that make things because they love it and their business was generated from that,'' says Robin Petravic, who, along with his business partner and wife, Catherine Bailey, purchased the company in 2003 from its ailing 90-something founder, the ceramicist Edith Heath, who died two years later. Bailey, a product designer, and Petravic, a product development engineer, had no background in pottery when they bought Heath. But they knew enduring design when they saw it and recognized an opportunity to bring the brand back to its postwar heyday -- but with a contemporary edge. 
 Heath's weighty ceramic tiles and hand-finished plates and cups are still designed, made and sold under the same roof, in a factory that was built in 1959. The company has a waste-not ethic that has been eco-friendly for decades, dating back to the days when green was just another color option. A product of the Depression, the ever-frugal Edith Heath sourced local clay from nearby Sacramento, developed a low-temperature firing technique to cut fuel consumption and built a self-contained business (with its own machine shop to handle repairs) that still generates very little waste: all the clay scraps are reused, and defective products are sold at a discount at Heath's onsite factory store or recycled by mosaic artists. Though the original motives were economic, these practices match up to the modern model of conservation.
 But as environmentally sound as Heath's products were, their presentation left something to be desired, as evidenced by the rather forlorn look of the factory store. ''When we got here, the store was this really funky place that wasn't really designed for selling anything,'' Bailey says. ''It was dusty. There were no prices except for a list on the wall. And there was no one to sell to the customers.'' To liven things up, Bailey and Petravic pulled the cups and plates off the shelves to create full table displays -- which led to Heath's partnerships with other companies. 
 ''When you're putting together a store, there's merchandising to think of,'' she says. ''We thought, You need flatware and glassware to eat, so let's put that in the store, too. But we didn't want to sell anything that didn't mesh with our beliefs. At first, we looked for lines made in the U.S. that were respectful of manufacturing, craft and great design. Then we had to go a little wider to find products that fit those criteria.''
 Those include stainless-steel flatware by David Mellor, the celebrated British designer and retailer. (The colorful handles of Mellor's children's flatware inspired Heath to create a line of children's plates and cups in red, yellow and blue.) There are also Green Glass tumblers, made from recycled wine bottles in Weston, Wis., and mouth-blown stemware and decanters from Holmegaard, a Danish manufacturer that was founded by a widowed mother of seven in the 1820s. Handcrafted Creative Candles, solid maple cutting boards by Edward Wohl, table linens by Native Organic and hand-printed tea towels from the South African company Skinny LaMinx are among the other lines that Heath now sells.
 This winter, Heath is expanding south to Los Angeles, where it will team up with Atwater Pottery's founder, Adam Silverman, to open a retail and studio space in West Hollywood. According to Silverman, a respected studio potter and (sorry, Adam) part of the local hipster establishment, the plan is to invite ceramics artists to a sort of residency program where they will work with him, experimenting with glazes and prototypes for new designs to be considered for production by Heath. 
 The studio will also reach out to the thriving local design community and businesses like restaurants, offering its services for custom projects that might be too big for Silverman to take on alone or too small for Heath to make in its main factory. 
 ''What they make now won't change,'' Silverman says. ''It's just good design. It doesn't date, and it works in so many different environments. But there's some really obvious room for growth, like making vases or garden planters or ceramic lighting. We're hoping there will be a lot of activity here in terms of making, designing, thinking and doing.''

DATELINE: FOREST CITY, Iowa 

 BODY:
 ON a late summer evening in this small community in north-central Iowa, fireflies twinkled despite the hints of fall in the air. A line of large recreational vehicles parked in the tidy campground seemed to glow like the fireflies, lighted from within.
 Between two of the motor homes a folding table was being set for dinner. Cathie Carr spread a gingham tablecloth and arranged stoneware, silverware and glasses for iced tea. Two local specialties, picked from a nearby field earlier in the day, were on the menu: fresh corn and watermelon.
 Mrs. Carr's next-R.V.-neighbor, Janice Lasko, 66, arrived with the corn, piping hot from her microwave oven. Mrs. Lasko's husband, Gabby, 83, was close behind with a heaping bowl of melon slices. Mrs. Carr's husband, Bud, who had been tinkering in their immaculate 40-foot motor home, an Itasca Horizon built by Winnebago, materialized soon after the food arrived.
 The Carrs and Laskos criss-cross the country in their R.V.'s year-round, and they often find themselves veering off for a stop in Forest City, the home of Winnebago Industries. They are not alone; thousands of other owners of Winnebago products make the pilgrimage much as swallows flock back to San Juan Capistrano. 
 The Carrs, whose last permanent home was near Livingston, Tex., explained to a guest -- an impromptu invitee to share in this feast -- that they had just driven here from western Canada, on their way to Florida. The Laskos came here from an R.V. meet in Gillette, Wyo. Now they have a notion, as Mr. Lasko noted, of ''heading south,'' perhaps to Branson, Mo., or Texas.
 Never mind that Forest City isn't really a logical midpoint on either of those itineraries.
 ''Forest City is on the way to everywhere,'' Mrs. Lasko said between bites of the sweet corn.
 ''For full-timers, nothing is out of the way,'' Mr. Carr agreed, using the expression for people who have left ground-bound homes behind. 
 The lure of a stop in Forest City was potent enough to cause the Laskos and Carrs, not to mention other R.V.ers in the campground, to add hundreds of miles to their journeys.
 For owners of recreational vehicles made by Winnebago Industries, like the Carrs and Laskos, Forest City is home -- literally. As the huge blue water tower that hovers over the town reminds visitors, this is where Winnebago and Itasca motor homes are made, and have been for nearly 40 years. To buy one is to be adopted by an extended family of like-minded R.V. enthusiasts, not to mention by the company itself.
 ''We needed to replace a plastic water tank that cracked,'' Mr. Lasko said.
 The company was happy to oblige.
 ''You don't even have to have an appointment, although they would probably prefer that you make one,'' Mr. Lasko continued. ''But even if you just show up unannounced, somehow they'll get you in, and get you fixed up.'' 
 Since the early 1970s, Winnebago has welcomed owners of its products to stop by for parts, service, repairs and upgrades, or just to talk shop. Across the street from the service facility, the company provides a campground where visitors can hook up their rigs for the night.
 The Laskos and Carrs were staying free in the 1,544-hookup campground, where electricity, water and sewage dump facilities are provided, saving the $40 to $50 a night it can cost for an R.V. park hookup. Owners can stay until the parts they need arrive and their turns for service come up.
 It's not that there are maintenance issues with Winnebago products, Mr. Carr and Mr. Lasko hastened to emphasize. ''It's just that every so often something needs to be touched up,'' Mr. Lasko said.
 ''They make an excellent product,'' Mr. Carr added. ''And they stand behind them.''
 Mrs. Carr expressed some remorse that service on their vehicle was likely to be finished quickly. ''Dang! I hope they don't get that part in,'' she said. ''I want to stay for a while. I could spend several months here.''
 It doesn't take much -- the Laskos' leaky water tank, the Carrs' broken drawer latch -- to provide the impetus for Winnebago owners to reroute themselves to the family-friendly confines of the company's parklike campground, formerly a municipal golf course.
 ''People come throughout the summer,'' said Kelli Harms, a spokeswoman for the company, ''although some weeks are busier than others.'' She estimated that some 60 owners would be arriving in the coming week, a slowdown from the peak summer season because schools were back in session and family campers were done for the year. As the weather turns colder, the stream of visitors will recede to a trickle.
 ''Our customer service facility remains open year-round,'' Ms. Harms said. ''Not everyone, though, wants to come to Iowa in the winter.''
 But many owners return each summer, like migratory birds.
 ''We need to reconnect,'' Mrs. Carr said, relating the story of a woman whose husband had died last year. ''So she learned, at age 80, how to drive the rig herself so she could come back this year.''
 Owners come not only to renew acquaintances, but also for scheduled service, upgrades, instruction on the latest operating and maintenance techniques -- and even for collision repairs.
 Each July, these reunions take on an especially festive spirit when the company sponsors its Grand National Rally, open to all 16,000 member coaches of the Winnebago-Itasca Travelers Club. 
 The six-day rally features nightly musical acts in a 3,000-seat amphitheater, craft and trade shows, carnival rides for children and other down-home attractions. Weddings have been held in the conference center. Dozens of free seminars are also offered, on topics ranging from ''Know Your Chassis,'' and ''The Joy Is the Journey,'' to ''C.P.R. for Friends and Family.''
 Up to 1,600 R.V.'s have come to past rallies; during such occasions, Forest City's year-round population of about 4,000 easily doubles.
 ''This year, we had about 1,300, which was still quite a nice turnout,'' Ms. Harms said. ''Some people were staying closer to home, maybe not being gone for as many days. If they needed work done, they might have gone to a local dealer instead.''
 The rally will celebrate its 40th anniversary next year, Ms. Harms said, ''and we expect a big turnout.''
 That is despite the bleakest R.V. sales year since the economic slump in the Carter administration. This summer, Winnebago Industries closed a satellite manufacturing facility, laid off some workers and did not fill job openings created by attrition. But the company's commitment to the rally, and its owners, continued nonetheless.
 ''We continue to remain busy with customer service,'' Ms. Harms said. ''Some owners do stay over, but others just drop off their coaches and take their tow cars sightseeing.''
 The Laskos' turn for service came the next morning. They passed the time in a wood-paneled customer waiting room along with two dozen fellow campers while their motor home received its care and service. Gabby Lasko read, his back to a television blaring daytime network fare; Janice Lasko crocheted.
 The part Cathie and Bud Carr were awaiting still had not arrived, so they were out riding together through the rolling farmland that surrounds Forest City on the Honda touring motorcycle they haul behind their rig.
 They were looking, they said, for some more freshly picked sweet corn for that night's supper.

CAPITOL MEN
 The Epic Story of Reconstruction Through the Lives of the First Black Congressmen
 By Philip Dray
 Illustrated. 463 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $30
 In a speech in 1861, on the eve of the Civil War, Alexander H. Stephens, vice president of the newly formed Confederate States of America, declared that the South was great because of slavery. The Confederacy, he said, had achieved ''the highest type of civilization ever exhibited by man,'' because ''its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition.'' 
 Four blood-soaked years later, the South was in ruins and slavery had been abolished. But the view that blacks must be kept down persisted among disgruntled ex-Confederates like Stephens, who became a leading foe of civil rights. 
 One of the stirring episodes in Philip Dray's eye-opening book ''Capitol Men'' involves Stephens getting his comeuppance on the floor of the House of Representatives at the hands of Robert Brown Elliott, a black congressman from South Carolina who was riding the progressive tide of Reconstruction. In January 1874, after Stephens challenged a civil rights bill that was before Congress, Elliott eloquently defended social and political equality for all Americans, regardless of race. To applause and cheers, he remarked of the Confederacy, ''The progress of events has swept away that pseudo-government which rested on greed, pride and tyranny.'' Reconstruction had remade democracy. American society, he said, was poised to become ''the grandest which the world has ever seen'' because of legislation like the civil rights bill, which would bring ''equal, impartial and universal liberty.'' 
 Elliott's optimism proved premature. Reconstruction soon collapsed. The era of Jim Crow settled in. 
 Was Reconstruction, then, a success or a failure? Did it bring real progress for African-Americans? Some argue that it did little good in the long run, as evidenced by its aftermath -- the period between the late 1870s and the early 1950s, when advances blacks had made just after the Civil War were largely negated. Others say that Reconstruction, though ephemeral, established an ideal of racial equality that America is still trying to reach. 
 Dray casts fresh light on the positive aspects of Reconstruction and powerfully dramatizes its negative side. His well-researched book is both exhilarating and disturbing. It offers a collective biography of several black congressmen in the South during Reconstruction who bravely took a public stance against racial prejudice. But it also shows that these politicians were stymied by a rising culture of white supremacy and home rule in the South. 
 While only two blacks, both from the North, are known to have held public office in American history up to the Civil War, hundreds of African-Americans were elected during Reconstruction as a result of Northern Republicans' efforts to refashion Southern governments and compensate for centuries of slavery. Political activity among African-Americans was especially notable in South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana, the states with majority black populations. In Mississippi alone, during the 12 years of Reconstruction, 226 black officials served in every position from county tax collector to United States senator. 
 Dray focuses on a handful of black leaders on the national scene, bringing attention to figures often neglected in Reconstruction surveys. These politicians were pioneers. Hiram Rhodes Revels of Mississippi became the first African-American member of Congress in 1870 when he took the Senate seat once held by Jefferson Davis. Another Mississippian, Blanche K. Bruce, was also elected to the Senate, where he combated segregation. Senator P. B. S. Pinchback of Louisiana had been a riverboat gambler and street fighter before becoming a forceful advocate for the integration of blacks into white society. South Carolina elected blacks to the House of Representatives, including Robert Smalls, a former slave and Civil War hero who endorsed free public education for all children, and Richard Cain, who emphasized black economic opportunities. 
 These and other leaders set an important precedent of political involvement for later generations of African-Americans. They also worked with forward-thinking whites who supported the 15th Amendment, which gave black men the vote; the Freedmen's Bureau, which arranged labor relations between blacks and their former masters; and several civil rights bills. 
 Dray, the author of ''At the Hands of Persons Unknown,'' a history of the lynching of African-Americans, demonstrates that the more powerful blacks became, the more hostility they provoked among Southern whites. Some areas in the South enforced Black Codes, which set curfews for blacks, barred them from militias and regulated their private conduct. The Ku Klux Klan enlisted whites who disguised themselves and made nighttime rides terrorizing blacks. Groups with names like the White League, the Southerns and the Flanagan Guards copied the Klan. 
 Dray provides harrowing details about race riots that erupted in New Orleans, Memphis and other Southern cities and towns. With appalling regularity, white mobs went on rampages, massacring scores of blacks. ''We are going to kill all the Negroes,'' a Mississippi man announced during one such spree. ''The Negro men shall not live.'' 
 Whites stripped blacks of power in the voting booth. Voter fraud, intimidation and bribery became rules of thumb in many Southern states. One Southerner wrote, ''Every Democrat must feel honor bound to control the vote of at least one Negro, by intimidation, purchase, keeping him away or as each individual may determine.'' 
 Economic ostracism also took a heavy toll. Republicans, both white and black, found it hard to earn a living when their names appeared in local papers with warnings that advised readers not to hire them or patronize their businesses. 
 Other problems sped the downfall of Reconstruction. President Ulysses S. Grant, though supportive, lagged in enforcing its regulations. Women's rights reformers complained that federal law awarded suffrage to black men but withheld it from women. A severe financial blow came in 1874 when the Freedman's Bank in Washington, an economic hub for African-Americans, collapsed owing to mismanagement. 
 White supremacists became increasingly brazen. The South Carolina politician Benjamin Tillman declared: ''We have done our level best'' to disenfranchise blacks. ''We have scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one of them. We stuffed ballot boxes. We shot them. We are not ashamed of it.'' 
 Many blacks decided to leave the South. It is telling that one of the last black leaders Dray discusses at length is the former slave Benjamin Singleton of Nashville, who decided that people of color would never gain equal rights if they remained in the South. Singleton led the so-called Exoduster Movement, in which thousands of Southern blacks relocated to the Kansas frontier. 
 By the 1880s, Southern blacks had two alternatives, both grim: leave and face an uncertain future elsewhere, or stay put, virtually without citizenship rights, under the constant threat of violence. It would not be until Brown v. Board of Education, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. that the oppressive weight of legalized segregation began to lift. Even today, Robert Brown Elliott's prophecy of ''equal, impartial and universal liberty'' in America seems like an impossible dream.

HEADLINE: The Dutch Are Returning For the City's Celebration

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
What do bowling, the Bowery, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Harlem, Stuyvesant Town, the Yankees, the Roosevelts and coleslaw have in common?
 They are all part of New York's Dutch heritage. You might have missed it, what with the continuing financial crisis and the parade of world leaders in town for the United NationsGeneral Assembly, but Dutch officials, including the prime minister and the heir to the Dutch throne, were also in town last week to inaugurate the city's 400th birthday celebration.
 The party begins next year with the quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's voyage up what became the eponymous river. It's also 400 years since Champlain sailed down the lake that took his name. In addition, the bicentennial of Robert Fulton's inaugural steamboat voyage in 1807 is being observed. 
 Given the perhaps never-to-be-settled debate over which year New York was actually founded, the celebration of Hudson's voyage is likely to revive competing claims over which explorer arrived first.
 Verrazano, an Italian sailing for the French, anchored off Brooklyn in 1524 and described a large lake that was probably Upper New York Bay. The Spanish dispatched Esteban Gomez, a navigator from Portugal. He arrived in New York Harbor on St. Anthony's Day in 1526 and christened the river (later known as the Hudson) the San Antonio. 
 Since neither explorer discovered anything considered of great value, Europeans apparently decided that New York wasn't a nice place to live, or to visit. Hudson -- an Englishman hired by the Dutch -- didn't make it here until more than 80 years later, in 1609. 
 As a harbinger of the city's emergence as a fashion capital, perhaps, Hudson's first mate, Robert Juet, said of the natives: ''They desire clothes.'' 
 Juet also wrote that ''the people of the country'' seemed ''very glad of our coming'' and were ''very civil.'' But by the second day he was expressing mistrust, and on the third day, Sept. 4, he reported that five sailors on a scouting mission were ''set upon'' by two dozen natives in two canoes and that an Englishman, John Coleman, was killed with an arrow in his throat. 
 The 300th anniversary of Hudson's arrival in September 1909 was a very big deal. Wilbur Wright flew from Governors Island and over the Hudson to Grant's Tomb and back. A flotilla of hundreds of vessels included a replica of Hudson's ship, the Half Moon, which, lamentably, sailed smack into a facsimile of Robert Fulton's vessel, the Clermont. 
 Celebrators were cautioned about pickpockets. They were told that police officers had orders to arrest ''elbowers.'' And, in a warning that resonates today, they were urged to say something ''if you see anyone acting in a suspicious manner.'' 
 New York is still home to about 25,000 people who claim Dutch ancestry, but that is fewer than most other ethnic groups. Much of the Dutch legacy seems tied to the sponsorship of the New York City Marathon by ING, the Dutch financial group, to renewed interest in windmills to meet energy needs, and in surviving names derived from the Dutch, including Yankee and Roosevelt. 
 Next year, the Dutch intend to exhibit here for the first time evidence of the legendary sale of Manhattan Island for $24: Peter Schaghen's 1626 letter announcing to the ''High and Mighty Lords'' of the West India Company that the settlers in Lower Manhattan were in good spirits; had borne some children; grew wheat, barley and other grain; and bought the roughly 22,000-acre island for 60 guilders worth of goods.
 The Dutch also plan to open a pavilion in Rockefeller Center, which they hope to move eventually to tiny Peter Minuit Plaza at the Battery, and install street signs downtown with their original Dutch names.
 More commemorations are planned by, among others, the city, the state's Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commission and the National Parks of New York Harbor Conservancy.
 Last week, visiting Dutch officials planted a hickory sapling on Governors Island (which the Dutch first named Nooten Eylandt, or Nut Island, after the nut trees that grew there). 
 Today, the Netherlands is grappling with an issue that New Yorkers came to grips with 400 years ago: diversity.
 Frans Timmermans, the Dutch minister for European affairs and international cultural policy, said there were slaves in early New Amsterdam and some anti-Semitism, but he recalled that Peter Stuyvesant resisted orders from Holland to get rid of, among others, the Swedes.
 ''What we now call tolerance was really indifference, as long as you behaved,'' Mr. Timmermans said in an interview.
 Today, an influx of Moroccans and Turks is changing the face of the Netherlands. In major cities, almost half the population is no longer of European origin. 
 ''We still call people immigrants or foreigners in the third generation,'' but New York ''is the most successful immigrant society,'' Mr. Timmermans said. ''The day you step off the boat or plane you're a New Yorker. That has to do with its history.''

HEADLINE: Missing Persons

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO

 BODY:
The conventional symbols for darkness and illumination are reversed in Arnaldur Indridason's austere Icelandic police procedurals. In this arctic land where the natives ''yearned for the cold black of night and the deep winter,'' shadows bring understanding, and nothing good comes with the light of day. Inspector Erlendur Sveinsson, the compassionate detective in this remarkable series, draws the curtains against the ''relentless May sun'' in THE DRAINING LAKE (St. Martin's Minotaur, $24.95), instinctively blaming its warming rays for drying up Lake Kleifarvatn, where a hydrologist studying the shrinking water levels has turned up a human skeleton with a hole in its skull. (In point of fact, an earthquake opened fissures in the lake bed -- suggestive of yet more alarming metaphors.) 
 Were it not for the vintage Soviet radio transmitter found with the bones, the police would be inclined to write off these macabre findings as just another anonymous suicide. ''It isn't considered significant in this country if people disappear,'' Erlendur dryly notes. But as someone who watched his only brother swept from sight in a winter storm when they were children, the detective comes naturally to his role as champion of the disappeared and comforter of those who still wait for them. This is a man who, while giving his professional attention to long-forgotten missing persons cases, spends his quiet hours reading accounts of avalanches and other catastrophes that leave no trace of the lives they sweep away. 
 In this book as in Indridason's previous ones (all translated with grave sensitivity by Bernard Scudder), Erlendur's effort to reclaim one lost soul opens a broader investigation into a neglected piece of Icelandic history. Here it's the ''weird times'' of the cold war, when Iceland was of strategic interest to both the United States, which kept a military base at Keflavik, and the Soviet Union, which had plenty of spies on the ground. 
 Indridason reclaims this historical moment with a parallel narrative line recalling the bitter disillusionment of Icelandic students whose socialist ideals were betrayed when they went to study in East Germany. Once again, Erlendur's persistent search for something of inestimable value that has long been lost -- from one woman's beloved fiance to the political innocence of an entire generation -- becomes the touchstone for Indridason's pursuit of the missing chapters of his national heritage. 
 You want cold? You want cheerless? Leave Iceland to its sultry spring and decamp for the Siberian Territory. Stuart M. Kaminsky's endearing Russian bear of a detective, Chief Inspector Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov, is forced to voyage there in PEOPLE WHO WALK IN DARKNESS (Forge/Tom Doherty, $23.95) when a Canadian geologist is murdered after encountering a ghostly child deep below the earth in a diamond mine. 
 The one-legged but indomitable Rostnikov is petrified of tunnels, yet he must avert the sabotage of Russia's diamond production before it affects the world market. (''I wonder,'' someone reflects, ''if they ever have problems like this at DeBeers.'') Faithful as ever to the split-focus formula of the police procedural, Kaminsky leaves it to Rostnikov's colleagues to untangle an intricate smuggling network connecting Moscow, Kiev and Botswana. Meanwhile, the chief inspector is dispatched to the wretched town of Devochka, which consists of eight identical single-story concrete buildings and a cracked concrete road to the mine. While some people can and do go mad in such places, Devochka inspires Kaminsky's sleuth to new levels of irony. 
 Harsh environments are supposed to build strong character. But the seasons aren't ''what they used to be'' in the north woods of Minnesota where William Kent Krueger sets his rugged novels. Instead of toughening up over the long winter, citizens of the region's economically depressed mining and logging towns are turning mean-spirited and violent. In RED KNIFE (Atria, $25), ugly racial conflicts erupt when someone executes the leader of an Ojibwe youth gang and his wife. The culprits could be members of the Mexican drug cartel that's been using the Indian reservation as a depot, but there's so much hatred brewing here, it could be anyone. Cork O'Connor, a former sheriff whose Indian bloodline gives him tribal access, is one of those hometown heroes you rarely see (and can hardly believe in) anymore -- someone so decent and true, he might restore his town's battered faith in the old values. 
 No one shows you the ugly side of Alaska the way Stan Jones does in his somber novels about Nathan Active, an Eskimo state trooper posted back to Chukchi, his native village in the Arctic Circle. In FROZEN SUN (Bowhead, paper, $13.95), Nathan is sent to balmy Anchorage for computer training, giving him a chance to track down Grace Sikingik Palmer, a former ''Miss North World'' and onetime pride of the village, now rumored to be a homeless prostitute working Anchorage's infamous Four Street district. After giving her up for dead, Nathan learns that his fallen angel may be working in a fish-processing plant in the Aleutian Islands. It's a hellish place (''You not puke in here, you go in john,'' the line foreman warns Nathan), and Jones makes no attempt to prettify it. Just as he doesn't pretend to find anything remotely character-building in the conditions of those who have survived the unforgiving climate of the Arctic only to disappear on the streets.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Paul Feig

BYLINE: By JOHN BOWE. 
John Bowe is the author of ''Nobodies: Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the New Global Economy.'' His last article for the magazine was about gay sperm donors seeking to be part-time dads.

 BODY:
I'D KNOWNPAUL FEIG for about four, four and a half minutes when I asked him that most routine of Hollywood icebreakers: ''What projects are you working on?'' We were in his shiny silver Mini Cooper, leaving the Burbank house he shares with his wife, Laurie, to drive south to the Comic Con convention in San Diego, in which Feig was scheduled to participate. He lurched without bravado into a litany of film pitches, a young-adult book series, a handful of TV shows at various stages of development and his new gig as co-executive producer of NBC's No. 1 comedy hit, ''The Office.'' Hunched over the Mini's tiny steering wheel, at more than six feet in a Ralph Lauren Black Label suit, Feig paused, as if maybe nine projects weren't enough. He mentioned one more little idea in the works. It sailed forth in a torrent, which, I later realized, represents the problem with Paul Feig. 
 ''There's an adult novel I have an idea for that I'm in love with,'' he began. ''It could possibly be a really weird, quirky indie movie, but I think it's going to be funnier as a book. It's just really dumb. 
 ''It's called 'Three Wishes for a Fat Guy,' '' he went on. ''And it's basically about this fat guy who's a total geek, works in a comic-book store and is into gaming and all that stuff. He's lonely, he can't get any dates and stuff, and he has this little dog -- just like my dog, Linus. Crazy dog. And then one day, in this completely contrived, hokey way, he finds a genie in a bottle. And he gets three wishes.'' Feig looked at me askance. I was listening.
 ''His first wish,'' Feig continued, ''is that he can fly. He's like: 'If I could fly, I'd be famous, so I'd get all these girls and all this other stuff, and it'd be cool. And the other thing is, I'm lonely. So I would love my dog, who's my best friend in the world, to be able to talk. And the third wish, I'm gonna save that for, you know -- if there's trouble with those first two.' 
 ''So suddenly he can fly. But as with any wish, he's not specific enough, and it turns out he can only fly if he's nude or in really lightweight pajamas. So he goes on a talk show and like, flies around the audience, and everyone is like, 'Ohhh, he's so cool.' But then when he sits down on the panel, he's really boring and his jokes are terrible and everybody kind of doesn't like him anymore. So then he starts realizing: Well, I've got this talking dog! I'll bring the dog out.'' 
 Feig wasn't done: ''And the dog comes out and starts telling everything about his owner, like: 'He masturbates! He masturbates constantly!' So the dog becomes famous and the fat guy can fly, but now the dog is just outing him on everything in his life and then it kind of goes from there, and how the fat guy decides he needs to get a manager to come on board to help him get his life together.''
 Feig turned from the sluggish freeway traffic to me, to see if I got it. So far, so good. And then he paused to reflect, before concluding, with absolutely no irony whatsoever, ''It's basically the story of how I met my wife.''
 FEIG, AN ACTOR, producer, writer and director, is perhaps best known as the creator of NBC's 1999 cult favorite ''Freaks and Geeks.'' The show, drawn in loving and obsessive detail from his Michigan childhood, depicts the comic but painfully realistic growth pains of a group of high-school students in the early '80s. ''Freaks'' had some of the most painfully acute music choices of any show ever televised (Cheap Trick's ''Gonna Raise Hell,'' Van Halen's ''Runnin' With the Devil,'' Journey's ''Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' ''). It also introduced a startling number of popular actors, including Seth Rogen (''Knocked Up,'' ''Pineapple Express''), James Franco (''James Dean,'' ''Pineapple Express''), Linda Cardellini (''ER''), Jason Segel (''Forgetting Sarah Marshall,'' ''How I Met Your Mother''). Yet the program itself was always regarded as an abused stepchild; only 12 of 18 finished episodes were shown on NBC before it was yanked by the network in 2000. 
 The critical success and general menschiness of ''Freaks and Geeks'' established for Feig (pronounced FEEG) a career in television that most Hollywood aspirants would envy. He went on to direct three films, and directed eight episodes of ''Arrested Development,'' three episodes of ''Weeds,'' eight episodes of the American version of ''The Office'' and an episode each of ''30 Rock'' and ''Mad Men.'' The list reads like a who's who of cool TV shows. 
 But whether it's Feig's personality or the tortured nature of any creative business, his experience of success is as comically and painfully unsatisfying as it might be for the type of characters he tends to draw. He writes about geeks being rejected, a subject that causes his ideas to be rejected by ''cool'' studio executives. The rejection causes Feig to feel like a geek, which causes him to approach life like a geek, which causes him to pitch stories about geeks, which causes his projects to be rejected again, thereby setting the whole cycle in motion again -- unto perpetuity. It's the myth of Sisyphus in the key of geekdom. 
 ''I'm kind of a failure,'' Feig admits. ''I mean, I'll be honest. I'm successful in that I'm getting to work on great stuff, but I think I'm a failure in all the personal stuff that is most important to me. 'The Office' is very important as well. I'm very proud of that and the other stuff I've done. But the stuff that I'm generating on my own, the shows and movie ideas I'm creating myself -- they've all been a disaster.''
 ''FREAKS AND GEEKS'' came to life at the same time as Fox's ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' another show about the pains of being a teenager. But where ''Malcolm'' was an unconventional but emotionally over-the-top half-hour sitcom with straightforward gags and hammy camera work, the hourlong ''Freaks'' hovered tensely and subtly between pimples and humor, shyness and abject losertude, drama and comedy. Some people called it a ''dramedy''; Feig prefers the term ''comma'' -- comedy that includes realistic slices of drama. 
 ''Paul wanted a realistic tone,'' says Feig's longtime friend and fan Judd Apatow, who produced ''Freaks and Geeks.'' ''He was very passionate about the show being about kids who failed at the things they were attempting to do during high school. It was an argument against wish-fulfillment television. We agreed that we weren't gonna water it down. And what was most exciting was that Paul was willing to go down with the ship.'' 
 And down he went.
 In 2001, nearly a year after ''Freaks and Geeks'' was unceremoniously given the boot, Feig was honored with an Emmy nomination for his writing on the show's final episode. The award went to Alex Reid, a writer for ''Malcom in the Middle.'' While Feig is quick to credit ''Malcolm in the Middle'' with superb writing and direction, it disheartens him to this day that its over-the-top style won out over his show's more down-to-earth aesthetic. ''It was a bit like finding out that nobody wanted your take on the world.'' And indeed, to Feig's dismay, many people don't. 
 Ira Glass, creator of ''This American Life,'' the popular public-radio show, recalls producing a film that Feig directed called ''Unaccompanied Minors.'' The idea came out of a ''This American Life'' segment featuring a woman talking about how, as a child of divorce, she would spend half of Christmas with one parent, then get on a plane to visit the other parent. One Christmas, she and her sister were snowed in at O'Hare and spent the night with planeloads of other kids in the same predicament. 
 ''What happened in the course of making the film,'' Glass told me recently, ''is that at some point, an executive at Warner Brothers asked, 'Well, do they have to be kids of divorce?' And we said, 'Well, if they're not divorced, what are they doing at the airport on Christmas alone without adults?' And he was just like, 'Well, the divorce thing is such a downer!' There were all these rough, dark edges that gave more heft and emotion to the story, and at a couple of key moments, we heard back from the executives, 'Let's smooth all that out.' After a while, you had to wonder, Well, why get Paul Feig to direct? That's what he does. He does the comic stuff but with the dark stuff too.''
 Feig describes his brand of comedy, whether in ''Freaks and Geeks'' or ''Three Wishes for a Fat Guy,'' as ''a comedy for outsiders, for people who don't tend to get the respect of the normal world.'' In the Freaks versus Geeks contest of life (Bill O'Reilly versus Bill Moyers, for example, or Bush versus Gore), he has always identified with the geeks. Geekhood, he clarifies, isn't just a matter of shyness -- Feig's voice-mail message says, ''Please leave your name and number and I'll, um, y'know, call you back'' -- it's a matter of conviction. According to Feig, geeks are people who are unabashedly enthusiastic about uncool things. Things that don't get you status points. Things that get you beaten up at school. Things that -- well, let's just say that in his wedding picture, which hangs proudly in his home, Feig and his wife both wear kilts.
 Feig carries himself a bit like the late Vincent Price, a tall man who doesn't like towering over anyone. While directing, he wears a suit and tie, partly to remind himself that he's going to work, partly out of a sense of respect for the crew and actors and partly to offset what he calls ''L.A.'s tyranny of the casual.'' His white-gray hair is almost primly trimmed but still irrepressibly shaggy. His face is kind, even when he laughs at himself, which he does often and with a bit of a thump.
 When Feig, the Mini Cooper and I finally arrived at Comic Con -- held each year for purveyors and enthusiasts of comic books and ''popular arts'' -- we were met at the door by his publicist from Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. She led Feig to a booth for a signing of his first young-adult novel (in what will be a series of five), ''Ignatius MacFarland: Frequenaut!'' (He has also written two memoirs: ''Kick Me: Adventures in Adolescence'' and ''Superstud: Or How I Became a 24-Year-Old Virgin.'') A small but nice-size crowd awaited. Not just kids, but adults. Julie, Ramona, Dillon -- they all had ''Freaks'' on their mind as they held out their books for Feig's signature. 
 One man said sympathetically: ''I'm a huge fan of 'Freaks and Geeks.' It ended way too early.'' Another handed over his book to be signed. ''Hey, Paul. We met a couple of times after the show got canceled. Great show. You know, I tried so hard to get people to watch it.''
 Feig thanked them earnestly. Later, we discussed the sad fact that while books allow for free expression, they reach a dissatisfyingly small audience. Movies and TV reach millions, but then there's the notoriously stupid, painful and difficult development process to wind through. Forever. And ever. Best not to get started on the subject.
 The signing over, we strolled through the crowd. These were Feig's people. Comic Con runs for four days, attracting 125,000 ticketholders who come to tour blocks of booths and displays of comics (from manga to sci-fi and graphic novels to pornography); young-adult literature; software, costumes, action figures, dolls and Hollywood movie promos (with guest appearances by stars like Hugh Jackman, Richard Dreyfuss and Lou Ferrigno). Many of the conventiongoers were wearing costumes -- maid outfits, camo miniskirts and fishnets, eye masks, top hats, Ghostbuster, Jedi knight and Japanese manga outfits -- and kilts. An awful lot of the guys seemed to bounce instead of walk. Ba-boing, ba-boing. 
 Feig glowed. ''Look at them,'' Feig said, clearly identifying with the crowd. ''These people are out of their minds with joy. They're happy.'' He mentioned the fact that before the advent of the Internet, geeks like himself -- and the crowd members -- had to cower in their corners, alone. Now they could gather forces online and discover many thousands of like-minded souls across the land. It was, to Feig, a step forward in the march of progress. 
 At noon we headed for a panel discussion by the writers and actors (they're often the same) of Feig's new day job, ''The Office.'' Greg Daniels, the primary executive producer of the show, tapped Feig to introduce the panel. Feig ad-libbed for 30 seconds, introduced the panelists, then signed off with the geekiest gesture in American culture: the double thumbs up. 
 In Feig's final event of the day, a 2 p.m. panel, ''Comics: Across Every Medium,'' Feig shared the stage with assorted greats from the world of comics. During the question-and-answer part, a young woman asked Feig, ''Can you tell us about your new show on NBC?'' Feig seized up. She was referring to ''Kath & Kim,'' Feig's latest setback. He'd signed on to direct an American version of the Australian hit show, known for its laconic humor and hyped-up verite style. He helped put the show together, including casting, designing the sets and directing the pilot -- only to be taken off the project at the last moment. (Feig left the show in June, and it will have its premiere early next month.) According to an executive producer at NBC, Feig's version was ''too straightforward.'' Feig said he'd heard through the grapevine that the replacement director had repainted the sets -- ''in funnier colors.'' 
 He stood in front of the 2,000-person audience, wondering what to say but not wanting to talk trash about his employer. ''I was like 'Oh, no,' '' he recalled later. ''Uhhhh, yeah. Let's not talk about that.''
 ONE NIGHT IN JULY, Feig and his wife, Laurie, took me to a Mexican restaurant in Hollywood called the Gardens of Taxco. We met the valet. 
 ''Hello, Mr. Paul!'' 
 ''Hello, Jorge!'' 
 We entered the restaurant and met the maitre'd. 
 ''Hello, Mr. Paul!'' 
 ''Hello, Esteban!''
 As we were led through the tables, we saw a server and a waiter.
 ''Hello, Gregorio!'' 
 ''Hello, Ervin!''
 ''Hello, Mr. Paul!'' 
 We sat down, and Laurie and Paul began talking in turns, overlapping and segueing like a double helix (they've been together 17 years). They told me that Feig was born and raised in Mount Clemens, Mich., a working-class suburb of Detroit; his mother, a telephone operator, met his father, an army-surplus-store owner, at a church social; both were in their 40s. Feig describes being an only child as a delight, not a bane. His parents had time to indulge his every interest. 
 ''His mother decided when he was born that he was gonna be in show business,'' Laurie said. ''That was her dream. And so from the minute he would show any interest in playing guitar, he'd have guitar lessons. If it was tap dancing, he'd take tap dance. Anything he was interested in.''
 At 14, Feig began taping commercials for his father's store. The store was on Gratiot Avenue, which is pronounced ''Grashet'' -- unless, like Feig, you have a lisp. The Feigs paused for me to imagine the sound of a lisping 14-year-old, pronouncing ''Grashet and ''surplus'' again and again. For a movie camera. For the public. ''It was very difficult,'' he admitted. To make matters worse, Feig was obsessed at the time with Steve Martin and had dressed himself in a white three-piece suit. ''It was pretty funny,'' Laurie said, ''but it was people laughing at him, not with him.''
 In high school, Feig began doing a magic act for the school's talent show. Feig's father maintained that every good magician needed a shtick; earlier in life, he'd collected jokes he heard at nightclubs. He shared his files with Paul to use between magic tricks. Feig's mother -- clad in red 364 days a year and green on St. Patrick's day -- drove him to comedy clubs to learn jokes, then nursing homes and hospitals to practice his act. In some ways, it was the official childhood of a geek: nowhere along the way did either parent explain that in America, it's very uncool to do what your heart dictates. Better to be cool -- and smooth down those rough edges.
 ''I had a Donald Duck pin I would wear all the time in high school,'' Feig remembered. ''I loved Donald Duck. I thought the pin was kind of cool. But walking through the mall, the teens, the meaner ones, would sit along this kind of one low wall along this main walkway and heckle you and call you names. Throughout my teens, I just wanted to go somewhere I could wear a Donald Duck pin and no one would care.''
 After a year in Detroit's Wayne State University, studying mass communications and theater, Feig bolted for L.A. to work as a tour guide at Universal Studios. He eventually transferred to U.S.C., which led to a job reading scripts and a 15-year career in stand-up comedy. Along the way, Feig befriended half of comic Hollywood and landed a string of small roles on TV series, including: ''Dirty Dancing,'' the TV show; ''Good Sports,'' with Ryan O'Neal and Farrah Fawcett; ''It's Garry Shandling's Show''; ''The Jackie Thomas Show''; ''The Louie Show''; and finally, a repeating gig on ''Sabrina the Teenage Witch,'' playing Sabrina's science teacher. 
 Feig, apparently unique among stand-up comics, never succumbed to drugs or alcohol. He saved his money, worked assiduously and during the off-season, used his savings to shoot a 16-millimeter movie starring Penn Jillette. The film, about four characters who meet in a field, was shot over six days, cost Feig $30,000, never found an audience and managed to obliterate the first nest egg he acquired in his life. When it was finished and time to get back to ''Sabrina'' to refresh his coffers, he was informed that he would not be invited back. 
 Feig took to the road, driving from campus to campus, trying with mixed success to encourage students to watch his movie. It was around this time that Laurie, who was originally his manager, then girlfriend, then wife (it's unclear to them what rationale drove the transition), persuaded him to abandon the vagaries of acting and focus on the vagaries of writing. The result was ''Freaks and Geeks.'' He showed it to Apatow, a friend from stand-up days, and within 12 hours, the show was sold to Dreamworks. Feig shrugged. ''That's the story of how my worst year became my best year.''
 A mariachi singer (''Hi, Jaime!'' ''Hi, Mr. Paul!'') drifted up to our table. Jaime asked Feig for a request. Of course: ''Brazil.'' Feig requests it every time. The band began to play, and as Laurie looked on lovingly, Feig and Jaime harmonized -- Jaime in Spanish, Feig in a sort of mumbly Esperanto:
 Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June, We stood beneath an amber moon And softly murmured, ''Someday soon.'' We kissed and clung together. ...
 Jaime asked if Feig had another request. Yes! He did! What was that song called? The upbeat one? ''Happy, Happy''? Jaime smiled. No, that wasn't the name, not in Spanish. But for Mr. Paul? Of course. The band began to play, and we lurched back into a conversation about the odd nature of Feig's success. Or failure. Or which one is it?
 ''You know, I get sent a lot of projects to direct,'' Feig said. ''And I start reading a script that's kinda like, you know: 'John's a lawyer who has it all. He's handsome he's this and that' -- and you know he's gonna have some downfall or something like that. And it's like, You know what? I don't care about that stuff. What am I gonna learn from him? Don't be too cool? I don't think that's a lesson that's gonna apply to my life. I care more about Kip, the janitor who works at that guy's building, or his neighbor or the guy who drives him around.''
 Whether it's movies or TV, Feig's wheel of fortune turns from advance to trauma, pain, suffer, repeat. From 2001 to 2004, Feig worked on an adaptation of Ann Holm's acclaimed novel ''I Am David,'' starring James Caviezel (''before he was Christ,'' Feig notes). The movie, shot in Bulgaria for $7 million, is about a kid who grows up in a communist labor camp after World War II and escapes to see if his mother is still alive. While Feig was elated to direct the film, it bombed. How could it not have? As he later joked, ''It's about a kid in a communist labor camp! Hey! Who's not gonna wanna see that? Oh, my God. It made nothing.''
 Feig's insistence on keeping some element of reality intact has led to one stumble after another. ''Nice Guys'' was about three guys and a fat girl, whom Feig describes as ''decent, kind of nerdy people in their 20s who are trying to date.'' HBO bought the pitch but wanted something with ''edge.'' 
 Feig wrote a scene where the guys go to a strip club -- and feel uncomfortable. Friends advised him to make one of the characters seem cool. To Feig, it didn't make sense. Either all the friends were geeks or none of them were geeks. ''That's the structure of friends,'' he explained. ''You don't invite in a friend who is the antithesis of the rest of you. You're not gonna have a scene where two guys are uncomfortable, and their friend is like, 'No, you gotta have a happy ending!' They always say, 'Hey, you gotta have one of those guys.' Well, I don't wanna have one of those guys. The whole point is about how uncomfortable they are!'' In the end, the show never ran.
 Then there was ''Other Space,'' which Feig describes as a sci-fi version of ''The Office.'' ''The show was set on a spaceship that gets pulled into an alternate universe,'' he said. NBC bought it, but then disagreements arose about how to shoot it. According to Feig, the executives wanted it shot as a typical sitcom, with a very obvious, punched up style. Feig didn't.
 ''There's a million tales of woe like this in town,'' he continued, ''but it's always this thing, like, 'Oh, we so want you to do our next show.' And then they're like: 'Oh, no. That's not what we wanted.' My whole career is kind of like: 'I told you that's what I was gonna do.' 'Oh, yeah, but we didn't think it would be like that.' '' 
 Earlier, Judd Apatow remarked to me that all great television is the result of someone simply being able to get his point of view across. ''If you see 'The Sopranos' or 'Mad Men' or 'Curb Your Enthusiasm,' '' he said, ''you know those creators are winning every single argument.'' Feig, he said, was talent waiting for such an opportunity. ''Paul has a very unique point of view, and it's best presented without having to go through a committee. You want pure Paul.''
 Feig knows very well that he's not going to win every argument. And in fact, he has never clung to the idea of the lone genius who takes advice from no one. He likes advice. But: ''My style of comedy is very real and bittersweet, and sort of always on the verge of kind of being tragic,'' he explained. ''If suddenly someone's like, 'Hi, there, Bobby!' and starts mugging for the cameras, then I have to kill myself, because it throws everything off.''
 FEIG'S FIRST DAY with the fifth season of ''The Office'' began on a late July day with a 7 a.m. read-through. The cast, along with the writers and a few network executives, met in a studio on a nondescript lot deep in the valley. Normally, episodes are a half-hour, but since this was the season opener, it would be an hour, which meant a nine-day shoot, and lots to organize.
 Feig's job as co-executive producer means that while Greg Daniels oversees story lines (the Jim-Pam relationship, developments in Jan's personal life, skirmishes between Michael and corporate at Dunder Mifflin, for example), Feig works mainly as in-house director; he has several episodes of his own and supervises the efforts of visiting directors. Feig's involvement in the show dates back to his direction of several critical episodes in the second season, when ''The Office'' broke away from its British predecessor and found its own style. Where Ricky Gervais's mercurial, mildly sociopathic doofus somehow resonated, Steve Carell's early interpretation of the character never quite clicked with American sensibilities.
 It wasn't until Carell starred in ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' and it became a hit that he turned into a potentially lovable character. It soon became evident to creators of ''The Office'' that Carell's newfound lovability could help the show succeed. Shortly thereafter, Feig directed an episode in which Carell's character, Michael, was feeling glum. The show's original direction would have called for muting the glumness by covering it with jokes. Feig and Daniels, changing tack, encouraged Carell to go with his instincts. In the end, Carell's character, Michael, became unthinkably weepy. Audiences responded, and the show ''broke out'' and garnered a large, intelligent, upscale audience. It's now one of NBC's most valuable show in terms of ad revenue.
 For Feig, ''The Office'' is simply another extension of the kinds of characters and humor he's been interested in since ''Freaks and Geeks.'' The characters, camouflaged by flimsy veneers of adulthood, ''struggle with the same questions as adolescents,'' Feig told me. ''Who am I? Where do I fit in? The only difference is they're also trying to figure out how they fit into their job. And that's my main thing. People figuring out, 'Where's my life going?' It's all these insecure people going through real emotions.'' For Feig, the challenge isn't creating wacky characters, it's molding humor so that audiences can relate. ''You want them to go like, 'Oh, my God, I know a guy like that!' '' 
 On the day I visited the set, Feig directed a scene in which almost all the staff members of Dunder Mifflin crowd into a meeting room in order to stuff as much food into their faces as possible. The set was disgusting -- a huge, foldout table crammed with glistening mac and cheese, greasy ribs, fried chicken, chili dogs and humming, gloopy cheese and chocolate fountains, slurp, slurp, slurping over the actors' lines. 
 Afterward, Feig broke off some of the actors to do the show's signature talking-head shots, in which characters hold one-on-one asides with the camera. He and Carell crammed themselves into a small room. Feig put on headphones, and the cameras rolled.
 In a conversational voice, Feig asked Carell, ''So, what's the deal with all the food out there?'' 
 The bare-bones script called for Carell to reply: ''H.R. is sponsoring a branchwide weight-loss contest to lower health premiums. If we win, our new H.R. rep, the lovely Holly, looks good to corporate and everyone in the branch gets three extra vacation days, so -- double-edged sword.''
 With Feig's encouragement, Carell began improvising: ''Well, the idea came from corporate, and they realized that to save on health premiums, they wanted everyone to lose weight. They sponsored a competition, kind of branch to branch.'' He grinned conspiratorially with idiotic enthusiasm, as if a ''branch to branch'' competition within a paper company was an especially spicy prospect. ''Three extra vacation days'' turned into ''five days of vacation time,'' which he then calculated to be . . . ''five-sevenths of a week!'' Somewhere, over a few takes, Carell trivialized his speech to the final comic degree by adding, ''And . . . so . . . that's the dealio!'' 
 He and Feig laughed heartily. Feig asked him to work with ''the dealio,'' and the result was a triumph of gratuitous verbalization, the baroque and spiritless joie de vivre that characterizes so much of what passes as personality and office cheer. From the top, Carell indicated the buffet full of food in the conference room and began: ''I know -- it looks bizarre. But here's the dealio: in an effort to lower our health-care premiums, corporate has come up with a weight-loss contest, branch versus branch. Whatever branch loses the most weight will win five extra vacation days. Which is . . . five-sevenths of a week. And our new H.R. rep, Holly Flax, will look good to corporate . . . she already does, but I think it'll be a feather in her cap. Which to me is a classic double-edged sword . . . type situation.''
 Stupid. Perfect. ''Cut on that,'' Feig said. 
 Afterward, Carell remarked on why it's so easy to ad-lib with Feig. ''He's not standoffish or judgmental in any way. He's incredibly genuine, and I think he likes to give some credit to the audience, that they will pick up the humor without being force-fed.''
 I asked Feig again about his remark that he's a failure. Judd Apatow, Ira Glass and Steve Carell think he's cool. He has written and directed for the half-dozen most-beloved in-crowd comedies. He has a happy marriage and a circle of friends and colleagues who clearly adore him. What's the problem?
 He stopped short. ''Look,'' he says. ''I'm extremely, extremely lucky to be who I am and do what I do and work with the people I work with. Even though I can always find something to complain about, I find it very hard to complain.'' He paused and sighed.
 ''I forgot to tell you: I just got nominated for an Emmy,'' he said. The nomination was for an ''Office'' episode from last year. The awards wouldn't be announced until late September, but Feig already knew he was doomed. ''There's no way in hell I'm gonna get that prize.''

 BODY:
1. THE WORST PART OF THE WHOLE PROJECT
Brad Guy started taking apart Cleveland a little after 8 o'clock on a Monday morning in June. Standing in the vandalized dining room of 6538 Lederer Avenue, he bent to the bottom of the wall and drove the end of a crowbar through the plaster with his hammer. He shimmied the bar behind the oak baseboard, feeling for nails. He was teaching his crew how to pry the wood loose without splitting it. Many of the workers who showed up that morning did not know what ''deconstruction,'' as this kind of work is called, actually was. Some assumed it was another word for remodeling -- not realizing, or maybe not allowing themselves to believe, that no bulldozer was coming, that they would be disassembling this house by hand, down to the foundation, one piece at a time. They watched Guy wrestle with the baseboard for a while. He put down the crowbar and picked up a heavier one. ''This is some old nice work that they did,'' he said. 
Guy is 49, with a round face and soft, nasal voice that's mostly monotone but rises unsurely at the end of sentences. (When he hollers, ''Break time, 15 minutes,'' the worker next to him, thinking this is a question, will check her watch and say, ''I guess so.'') He was a dancer and choreography student before being lured into architecture and is now the president of the Building Materials Reuse Association, a nonprofit in Pittsburgh that supports the fledgling deconstruction industry. He has spent the last 14 years as a journeyman architectural academic, conducting meticulous studies on how to efficiently dismantle the American house to reuse its materials instead of just clobbering it with a backhoe and sweeping it into a landfill.
In that time, Guy has deconstructed about 30 buildings, from row houses in Philadelphia to a 9,000-square-foot Army warehouse at Fort Campbell, Ky., where attack helicopters flew overhead and artillery went off as he stood on the roof dissecting it. While many deconstructors have far more hands-on experience, he is gathering scrupulous data about the process and organizing it all into research papers and spreadsheets that he describes as ''five miles long.'' Last year, he went back to school for a Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon. ''I'm basically an office worker,'' he told me. He trained for this project in Cleveland with long walks and dumbbell exercises.
With the baseboard finally detached, Guy gave a quick lesson on how to twist out each nail. (Nearly 30 percent of a deconstruction job's total labor hours can be spent denailing wood; Guy knows this because he has walked around some job sites every 15 minutes, writing down what each person was doing.) Then he started on the wall itself. He drew back with a crowbar and gave it a round of good whacks. Some plaster flaked off, a patch about three feet wide. He picked up a flathead shovel. He wrenched its edge across the wall, scraping off the plaster. After about a minute, he lowered it. He was breathing hard. The clearing had barely doubled in size.
The house on Lederer Avenue was 2,000 square feet. It had 12 rooms on two floors, with front and back porches, a basement and an attic. All told, Guy estimated it was 300,000 pounds of stuff -- all solidly conjoined by people who never considered that it might one day come down. ''This is the worst part of the whole project,'' he told his crew. Then he lifted the shovel again and threw himself back into it.
2. THE GREATEST LOCATION IN THE NATION
The house at 6538 Lederer was built in 1900 on a quiet back street in the Slavic Village neighborhood of Cleveland. By the '50s, Slavic Village, named for the immigrants who came to work in its steel mills, had grown to 70,000 residents; Cleveland was billed as ''the greatest location in the nation.'' Then, gradually, machines replaced men at the mills, and the laborers left.
Recently, Slavic Village has been a perpetual media symbol for the subprime mortgage fiasco, akin to what the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans became after Katrina. According to its city councilman, Tony Brancatelli, 1 of every 11 homes in the neighborhood is now empty. Many are bought and sold on eBay for as little as $5,000. Arson has been a problem, and in the two years since 6538 was boarded up, looters tore out its copper wiring and peeled off its aluminum siding as high as they could reach. A dead cat awaited Guy in an upstairs bedroom.
There are now 8,000 vacants in Cleveland. The city, ramping up condemnations, will spend $9 million demolishing 1,100 of them by the end of the year. It plans to continue at this clip indefinitely. The Cleveland Foundation, a well-endowed nonprofit, approached Guy to run a pilot study assessing the feasibility of deconstructing, or even partly deconstructing, some of those structures instead. What would end up being preserved, and what might be created in the process?
Guy estimates that maybe as few as 300 homes were fully deconstructed in America last year. At first glance, it almost seems like a satire of our escalating mania for greenness: first we're scrubbing labels off bottles and sorting them into recycling bins beside the house; then we're recycling the house. There is a calculus to any salvage. Even a demolition contractor might spend time skimming antique fixtures from a house before razing it if that material looks valuable enough to stake the extra labor costs; the architectural-salvage industry has specialized in such recovery for decades. But there is a point of diminishing returns, and it's that point deconstructors are compelled to barrel straight past. ''We're taking the wood, the toilets, the glass,'' says Rick Denhart, an industry veteran who is now deconstructing homes damaged by Katrina in New Orleans with the N.G.O. Mercy Corps. ''It's not just the fancy stuff you see on the front porch. It's the two-by-fours holding the walls up.'' Depending on what is there to be salvaged and how easily the architecture can be taken apart, deconstructing a particular house can end up costing twice as much as demolishing it. At times, the process is unapologetically unprofitable. Denhart says that he has reclaimed more than 98 percent of certain structures. This involves scouring out the insulation and bagging it for resale like cotton candy.
Still, there is a compelling ethic behind deconstruction, one challenging our very standards of profitability and prodding us to rethink how we use all the different kinds of capital we have -- from the resources built into a given house to the people who have built a community around it. Guy is not oblivious to how crazy his work looks. (Over dinner one night in Cleveland, he told me, ''You're asking me these questions, and I'm like, Wow, I don't have any good answers for you that don't make this sound just nutty.'') But it looks that way within a certain framework of circumstances and values, some of which may gradually be changing. Builders now scramble to earn the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED certification points by landfilling less and using reclaimed materials in new constructions. The Environmental Protection Agency has steadily financed Guy's research, and he recently received a call from Cooking Light magazine asking about minimizing waste during kitchen remodeling. ''It's still crazy,'' Guy said, ''but it's on the edge of not crazy now.''
A quarter of a million homes are demolished annually, according to the E.P.A., liberating some 1.2 billion board feet of reusable lumber alone. For the most part, this wood has been trucked out to a landfill and buried. Remodeling actually ends up generating more than one and a half times the amount of debris every year that demolishing homes does. (America generates a total of 160 million tons of construction and demolition debris every year, 60 percent of which is landfilled.) The Stanford archaeologist William Rathje, who spent decades excavating landfills, has estimated that construction and demolition debris, together with paper, account for ''well over half'' of what America throws out. He called it one of a few ''big-ticket items'' in the waste stream actually worthy of the debates we have over merely ''symbolic targets'' like disposable diapers.
At the same time, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, new construction consumes 60 percent of all materials used in the nation's economy every year, excluding food and fuel. Few of those resources are renewable. Older homes are among the last repositories of old-growth timber, like heart pine or cypress, and keeping even the most mundane building materials in circulation at the end of a house's life preserves their ''embodied energy'' (the energy expended producing and shipping natural resources in the first place) instead of drawing new resources to replace them.
''This is a manufacturing process,'' Guy told me. ''That's the way you should look at this. We are making building materials.'' In fact, the aim of deconstruction has always been more socioeconomic than environmental: employing local people to harvest a stock of low-cost materials so that lower-income homeowners and rental landlords in the same area can afford to maintain their properties. Denhart talks about houses as being part of a community's collective history and wealth. Deconstruction maintains and redistributes that wealth. ''The community is really taking care of itself,'' he says. ''It's protecting its identity.'' Moreover, a study Guy wrote with two environmental engineers uncovered an empirical argument for keeping those materials local: on average, shipping them more than 20 miles away for resale can cancel out any energy conserved by reclaiming them.
Guy has spent years refining such oblique cost-benefit analyses in his research and, more recently, in projects in New Orleans, Philadelphia and Boston, trying to expand our criteria for efficiency beyond sheer speed. Because when it comes to speed, deconstruction will get trounced by demolition every time. Building owners who choose deconstruction can, however, very regularly make up the difference in costs by donating the salvaged materials to one of more than 900 nonprofit, secondhand building-supply stores across the country, like Habitat for Humanity's ReStores. Owners then take a federal tax deduction for their value. One of Guy's first projects showed that after that tax deduction the average cost of deconstructing six homes around Gainesville, Fla., was 37 percent less than the average cost of demolition. On one house, deconstruction beat demolition by $8,000.
And yet in Cleveland the drawback of deconstruction that Guy was always trying to compensate for -- that it takes two weeks and a dozen wage earners to do what a piece of hydraulic machinery accomplishes before lunch -- was actually a selling point. The Cleveland Foundation was attracted to deconstruction as a way to provide jobs and job training in a county where unemployment is high and 5,000 ex-offenders surge out of prison every year. As a concept, at least, it fit nicely into the city's effort to become a cradle for sustainable industries and green-collar jobs.
The city contributed $19,000 to Guy's pilot project, the cost of demolishing the two condemned houses he would now deconstruct. The Cleveland Foundation agreed to cover the ultimate difference in cost. As the project got under way, the city, the foundation and its nonprofit partners were all committed to taking a close look at the results and exploring what subsidies or incentives might be put in place to stimulate a new, local industry. No one seemed to have any concrete ideas of how exactly they might go forward. But they floored Guy with their enthusiasm. He had never experienced such openness outside of famously green cities like Portland or San Francisco.
Guy's job, then, was to make those two houses disappear as quickly and cheaply as he could. He was the unlikely hammering man in a straightforward John Henry story of man versus backhoe. He had four weeks.
3. SPEED, SPEED, SPEED!
''It would take me a day,'' Michael Taylor, executive director of the National Demolition Association, told me when I asked how he would bring down a house like 6538. Understand, he said, America's demolition industry does $4.5 billion of business with only 22,000 employees. Machines do most of the work, and they work fast.
At 6538, Taylor would bring in a backhoe and ''ride the building down.'' Or else he would beat it to the ground with the front of a track loader. Then he would drive over the debris to compact it. He would do that 12, maybe 14 times. (''Keep crunching it up, Jon, crunching it up!'' he said.) Once the wreckage was hauled away, he would plow through what was left of the foundation, filling the basement with the rubble. Then, Taylor said, he would truck in some dirt, plant some grass and go home: ''And it returns to like it was when the Native Americans lived there in 1640.''
The demolition industry has identified 14 recyclable building materials, he told me, but it only recycles three in any real volume: concrete, metal and wood. Moreover, a contractor will only bother separating these materials when demolishing large buildings, where there's enough volume to make doing so pay. With a typical wood-frame house, a contractor will usually just bring it down as quickly as possible, then throw out the splintered consequences all at once. ''It's speed, speed, speed,'' Taylor explained.
Speed has obsessed the demolition industry for at least 80 years. Citing rising real estate prices, a 1930 New York Times article explained that ''the demand for speed in house wrecking'' was transforming the business. Until then, men would generally swarm into a building, cleave its pieces apart and send many of them down to the prospectors and resellers congregating around the job site. Historically, significant volumes of building materials have always been discarded or abandoned. But in his fine book ''Rubble,'' Jeff Byles notes that up to this point there was a lucrative-enough salvage market in place that wreckers regularly paid building owners, not the other way around. By 1930, however, the industry titan Albert Volk's men no longer had the time for cleaning and reselling bricks. Bathtubs that used to resell for $25 each, Volk said, were now being smashed up and sent ''sail[ing] out through the Narrows on Father Knickerbocker's trash-carrying scows to find a well-earned rest at the bottom of the sea.''
Wrecking balls, then bulldozers, then hydraulic backhoes assumed their roles. The wages of workers who took apart buildings and sorted material rose, while tipping fees -- the cost of simply landfilling unsorted material -- stayed relatively the same. The calculus of salvage shifted. Soon hand-wrecking and large-scale salvage survived only in a few pockets of the country.
Lawrence Larner started in the wrecking trade during its twilight in Boston, in 1962, as a member of what is now the last remaining Building Wreckers local in the country, Local 1421. Larner says that he and three other men would dismantle a three-story, three-family home in a week. ''We'd go in and take the hardwood floors on the top,'' he told me, ''we'd take the milled plank underneath the floor and the timbers under that'' -- funneling the debris down two ''dirt holes,'' or chutes, they cut clear through the house.
As in Volk's day 40 years earlier, each man used one tool only: a wrecker's adz, a heavy iron blade on a long wooden handle. ''It took you about a year to become very proficient with the adz,'' Larner said. ''It's a very hard tool to learn.'' The sharpened front was used for prying, and the blunt backside did the breaking. ''That's why we were so efficient,'' he told me, since you never put the thing down. ''You wouldn't be fooling around with pinch bars and hammers.'' The wreckers of Larner's local almost exclusively do asbestos removal now.
Hand-wrecking was also made even less cost-effective and necessary by the availability of new, cheaper building materials, like plywood and drywall, after World War II. Precut to standard sizes, they also allowed builders to throw up huge subdivisions, like the 17,000 homes of Levittown, N.Y., much more rapidly. Houses could now be fit together in assembly-line-like processes by unskilled laborers.
Two changes had happened simultaneously: wreckers were replaced by machines, and builders were reduced to cogs in one. The modern house is now made of stuff less worth saving and torn down in a way that makes saving it a hassle. This is a triumph from a certain perspective -- one bent on minimizing labor but able to run through a glut of resources less stingily. But what if we are entering an era in which people are the overabundant resource and certain materials are precious again? Then, despite how it sounds, we might start to see dignity in the idea of Clevelanders stripping their ruined communities for parts. We might see it as profitable, restorative -- like a W.P.A. project in reverse: a monumental taking down of what has been built to reclaim the energy and value locked away there.
''The only constant is change,'' Guy told me. Cities sprawl and contract. Old structures are torn down to clear space for modern ones. The average American moves more than 11 times in a lifetime. The average American house is only 32 years old, Guy said. ''Clearly there are a whole bunch of things we should be doing better,'' he said. ''The bottom line is, we demolish the hell out of our country.''
4. THE OPPOSITE OF BARN RAISING
Guy's crew of three women and four men fanned out that first morning to harvest 6538 Lederer's windows, doors and moldings, battling screws stripped decades ago by some careless do-it-yourselfer or cemented under generations of varnish and grime. There was a lot of unsure improvisation, putting down one tool and trying another.
On the back porch, two men pried at opposite sides of a six-paned window. (They were hired through a program that trains public-housing residents for green-collar jobs; others came via Hard Hatted Women, a nonprofit preparing women for construction work with technical training, math classes and weight lifting.) The men shattered one pane. Then they split the wooden frame. ''Hit it more,'' one told the other. By the time they got it free, it was worthless and had to be thrown out. It would be another full day before one of these men pulled a co-worker aside and asked her: ''What exactly is deconstruction? What's going to be left when we finish this?'' When she told him there would be nothing left, he still didn't believe her, so he asked around.
Working faster or more innovatively lowers labor costs and amasses more valuable salvage, bringing deconstruction's bottom line closer to that of demolition. But ultimately, how cost-effective the process can be hinges on a slew of symbiotic circumstances outside a crew's control. A foundational one is the cost of just throwing the house out -- the tipping fees at local landfills that dictate the cost of demolition. In the past 10 years, tipping fees in much of the country have risen as construction and demolition landfills have reached capacity or been surrounded by housing developments and closed. A wave of state and local legislation has also begun restricting the volume sent to those landfills or banned certain fill like concrete, asphalt or brick outright. These and other mandates can help spur economies of scale in the recycling of previously unworthwhile materials, absorbing more of what deconstructors wind up with that isn't readily reusable and further lowering their disposal costs. Before Cleveland, Guy did a project in Boston where tipping fees are about $130 a ton, among the highest anywhere in the country. There, he found, hand-disassembling 60 percent of a typical house cost virtually the same amount as dumping that same portion of it into a landfill. The value of the salvaged goods you ended up with would be almost pure profit.
One of the country's most successful deconstruction outfits, the ReBuilding Center, has capitalized on high tipping fees and other favorable conditions in Portland, Ore. Now entering its 11th year, it attracts enough work -- about 200 jobs a year -- to retain three full-time crews. The ReBuilding Center does lower-volume ''skims'' before remodels and will fully deconstruct about 30 homes this year. Consequently, its crews have become astoundingly proficient; four people can take down a single-family home in as little as a week. (''I'm told we're the fastest,'' says Shane Endicott, the executive director.) It routinely recoups as much as 85 percent of a house's materials for reuse and has hit upon ways to recycle most of the remainder. The old-growth Douglas fir that Portland's houses are rich with is regraded and resold, while water-wasting old toilets are sent to be ground up for roadbeds.
Eight tons of material now move through the ReBuilding Center's store every day. This is the highest volume of any secondhand building-supply store in North America. Such stores usually sell their reclaimed materials for 50 percent or less of the price of new ones. And as tastes change, those goods are not only cheaper than what's on offer at Home Depot but often seen as more attractive, distinctive or durable. ''We have people that show up in brand new Mercedeses and Escalades,'' Endicott says, ''and they're having us load a beat up radiator into the trunk.'' Of course the presence of such wealthy homeowners is another local asset contributing to the company's success. They are able to pay deconstruction's higher upfront cost and sometimes even excited to do it, relishing the greenness of it all. ''They're all wrapped together in a kind of synergistic way,'' Guy told me. ''You need some kind of legislative or legal incentives, some kind of market conditions, a willing populace and leadership with a few champions.''
Still, all Guy had to work with in Cleveland was houses. All the other infrastructure would have to grow together, starting from scratch in a less-than-ideal environment. Tipping fees are extremely low in the area, hovering around $30 a ton. ''That was one big signal that, Wow, this is going to be tough,'' he said. ''Because waste is cheap.''
Everywhere he went, he seemed to be asking everyone to operate just a little outside their comfort zones. The city had a modest Habitat for Humanity ReStore, but Guy had to talk it into reselling reclaimed lumber for the first time. To prove the demand was there, he drove around Ohio touring half a dozen of the state's ReStores. One shop, in Wooster, told him that it has customers coming not only from Cleveland, more than a hour away, but from 14 other counties too.
Guy's crew was being asked to stretch most of all. As the first week wore on, the workers still didn't seem to internalize the totality of their job -- that ''the whole house means the whole house,'' as Guy put it. On walls stripped nearly to their framing lumber, small plots of plaster and wallpaper hung on for days. Worse, the team as a whole was working far less efficiently and aggressively than he expected, and a couple of crew members seemed almost defiantly unmotivated at times. ''Everything here is something -- it's waste or it's salvage -- and we're dealing with it,'' Guy told the group one morning with what, in his limited range, passed for sternness. On Day 4, he showed up at 5:45 a.m. and started prepping for the day's work himself. ''I keep thinking that if there were eight of me, maybe it would be getting done,'' he told me. ''But then I think, There's no way I'd want to work with eight of me.''
He planned to break into 6538's roof that afternoon, a full day behind schedule. Starting to dismantle the roof carried psychological weight. It motivated you. It was around that point that a house weakened; it stopped looking like a house -- something big and impenetrable -- and started challenging you to pry it apart.
Guy would ''panelize'' the roof. Standing in the basket of a diesel-powered lift, he would make two cuts down the length of one side with a saw, carving a rectangular section 8 or 10 feet across. This panel, weighing more than half a ton, would fall with a thud onto the attic floor and lie flat. The crew could then easily gather around, disassembling and denailing its red-pine skeleton. When they were done, Guy would make the next cut, letting the next panel drop, and so on until the entire roof had toppled and dispersed into parts, like the opposite of a barn raising. He was in the attic, hammering together some support braces, when the mayor arrived.
The Cleveland Foundation had arranged for Mayor Frank Jackson to tour the site, a level of interest so early in the process that greatly encouraged Guy but also, frankly, totally flummoxed him. (''Try to ignore him as best you can and don't hurt him'' was all he could say to his crew that morning.) Jackson and his entourage toured the house in borrowed hard hats and then assembled at the foot of the driveway where the mayor made a series of approving but cautious statements to the media: the three-man camera crew the Cleveland Foundation hired to make some sort of video about the project -- and me.
''It's no longer a luxury to talk about things that are environmentally sound or recycling -- it's really a necessity now,'' Jackson offered. And then, ''I believe everything old is not bad.'' ''Nothing works unless you institutionalize it,'' he said at one point, later adding: ''Deconstruction is the right way to go. It does, however, have to become more efficient and cost-effective'' if it is going to join demolition as ''the way we do business.'' And there, really, was deconstruction's quandary: things that don't work yet rarely get institutionalized.
By midafternoon, Guy was on the roof while the crew denailed the white-oak floorboards stacking up in the backyard with pneumatic Nail Kickers, a reverse nail gun, one of the few specialized deconstruction tools on the market. All week a group of neighbors had watched as the peculiar operation at the end of their block progressed and didn't progress. Most had done some construction work, and they now stood in a puzzled huddle, looking up at Guy as he tried to pry a narrow opening in the roof before panelizing it. He was roped into the lift, straddling the peak of a dormer, scraping at the shingles with a short-handled shovel. ''What's he doing with that little-bitty roofing shovel?'' one of the men said. ''He'll be all day with that.''
Among them was Robert Middlebrooks, a widower living in a foreclosed home next door. (A judge, he said, ordered him to stay when the mortgage company didn't show up in court.) Last fall, Middlebrooks's son, a truck driver, was shot and killed across the street. A few months later, Middlebrooks had two toes amputated after a fall. He had taken to standing at the curb in front of 6538 most mornings, holding a pair of black work gloves just in case Guy was hiring. Now he stared at the roof and the small man sitting on it, throwing scraps of shingle and sheet metal to the ground. ''It's amazing what muscle can do,'' Middlebrooks said.
5. BREAKING OUT
Guy ran out of time. He came down sunburned and frustrated, failing to drop the first panel of the roof. The crew went home. But an hour later, Guy was in the attic, hunched under the slanted wall of the dormer. He couldn't let himself leave that night with 6538's roof unbroken. ''I should be embarrassed,'' he said. Then he picked up his tool -- a wrecker's adz special-ordered from a company in Boston -- and went to work.
The following week, with 6538 still standing but reduced to a gutted, one-story box, Guy's crew would move on to the pilot project's second house. There, Guy stopped holding back. He rolled out some of the more complicated, time-saving deconstruction techniques that he had worried were ''too chaotic'' for his inexperienced crew. He started on the roof almost immediately, dropping two panels at a time, one on top of the other like playing cards. His workers cut two chutes through the house to funnel debris. They attacked the interior walls differently. ''I started thinking, I just need to deconstruct these things myself,'' he said. One day, while chipping away at the roof of that house with his shovel, he watched a backhoe roll in and swiftly wipe out the house behind it -- another empty foreclosure.
In the end, Guy's crew of novices would take about twice as long to bring down the two houses as would typically be expected in a deconstruction job. And they would salvage far less, irreparably harming the bottom line of the pilot study. Still, they reclaimed cabinets with lead-filigreed doors, 108-year-old oak flooring, mammoth joists of old-growth pine that had run for 24 feet along the width of the second house. ''There is no question,'' Guy later reported to the Cleveland Foundation, that there was enough value squirreled away in such houses to more than recoup the extra labor costs of deconstructing them -- if, that is, Cleveland cultivated a ''better-prepared and -motivated work force.'' Applying data from his previous studies, he projected that even a modestly more adept crew could have diverted about 76 percent of each house from a landfill, salvaging more than $20,000 of materials in all.
Back in the attic of 6538 that evening, after everyone had left, Guy pierced the dormer's slanted wall with his wrecker's adz. He wedged it wherever he could and wrenched it back, again and again. Guy huffed under his dust mask. Slowly, boards came off.
A stench of tar and sweat built up and, occasionally, as he freed a piece and flung it aside, a sheet of black soot dumped out of the house like a solid object: 80 years of stored-up Cleveland air pollution, Guy had explained, back to the Depression-era belches of Slavic Village's steel mills.
Guy ate away at the frame. But even as the wallboards started to disappear, five layers of roofing -- shingles, tiles and copper flashing piled up over the life of the house and now legible like tree rings -- hung in place behind them. He struggled to roll forward the mass of roofing, pushing it down and out of the way. It was like trying to ball up a phone book.
Eventually he shoved the roofing down to the gutter where it hung off the house in a gnarled wad. He started to pry off the last cedar planks. It was close to 8 o'clock, but there was still plenty of daylight. He could see it. The dormer was a balcony now.

HEADLINE: Green The Bailout

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Many things make me weep about the current economic crisis, but none more than this brief economic history: In the 19th century, America had a railroad boom, bubble and bust. Some people made money; many lost money. But even when that bubble burst, it left America with an infrastructure of railroads that made transcontinental travel and shipping dramatically easier and cheaper.
 The late 20th century saw an Internet boom, bubble and bust. Some people made money; many people lost money, but that dot-com bubble left us with an Internet highway system that helped Microsoft, I.B.M. and Google to spearhead the I.T. revolution. 
 The early 21st century saw a boom, bubble and now a bust around financial services. But I fear all it will leave behind are a bunch of empty Florida condos that never should have been built, used private jets that the wealthy can no longer afford and dead derivative contracts that no one can understand.
 Worse, we borrowed the money for this bubble from China, and now we have to pay it back -- with interest and without any lasting benefit.
 Yes, this bailout is necessary. This is a credit crisis, and credit crises involve a breakdown in confidence that leads to no one lending to anyone. You don't fool around with a credit crisis. You have to overwhelm it with capital. Unfortunately, some people who don't deserve it will be rescued. But, more importantly, those who had nothing to do with it will be spared devastation. You have to save the system.
 But that is not the point of this column. The point is, we don't just need a bailout. We need a buildup. We need to get back to making stuff, based on real engineering not just financial engineering. We need to get back to a world where people are able to realize the American Dream -- a house with a yard -- because they have built something with their hands, not because they got a ''liar loan'' from an underregulated bank with no money down and nothing to pay for two years. The American Dream is an aspiration, not an entitlement.
 When I need reminding of the real foundations of the American Dream, I talk to my Indian-American immigrant friends who have come here to start new companies -- friends like K.R. Sridhar, the founder of Bloom Energy. He e-mailed me a pep talk in the midst of this financial crisis -- a note about the difference between surviving and thriving.
 ''Infants and the elderly who are disabled obsess about survival,'' said Sridhar. ''As a nation, if we just focus on survival, the demise of our leadership is imminent. We are thrivers. Thrivers are constantly looking for new opportunities to seize and lead and be No. 1.'' That is what America is about.
 But we have lost focus on that. Our economy is like a car, added Sridhar, and the financial institutions are the transmission system that keeps the wheels turning and the car moving forward. Real production of goods that create absolute value and jobs, though, are the engine. 
 ''I cannot help but ponder about how quickly we are ready to act on fixing the transmission, by pumping in almost one trillion dollars in a fortnight,'' said Sridhar. ''On the other hand, the engine, which is slowly dying, is not even getting an oil change or a tuneup with the same urgency, let alone a trillion dollars to get ourselves a new engine. Just imagine what a trillion-dollar investment would return to the economy, including the 'transmission,' if we committed at that level to green jobs and technologies.''
 Indeed, when this bailout is over, we need the next president -- this one is wasted -- to launch an E.T., energy technology, revolution with the same urgency as this bailout. Otherwise, all we will have done is bought ourselves a respite, but not a future. The exciting thing about the energy technology revolution is that it spans the whole economy -- from green-collar construction jobs to high-tech solar panel designing jobs. It could lift so many boats.
 In a green economy, we would rely less on credit from foreigners ''and more on creativity from Americans,'' argued Van Jones, president of Green for All, and author of the forthcoming ''The Green Collar Economy.'' ''It's time to stop borrowing and start building. America's No. 1 resource is not oil or mortgages. Our No. 1 resource is our people. Let's put people back to work -- retrofitting and repowering America. ... You can't base a national economy on credit cards. But you can base it on solar panels, wind turbines, smart biofuels and a massive program to weatherize every building and home in America.''
 The Bush team says that if this bailout is done right, it should make the government money. Great. Let's hope so, and let's commit right now that any bailout profits will be invested in infrastructure -- smart transmission grids or mass transit -- for a green revolution. Let's ''green the bailout,'' as Jones says, and help ensure that the American Dream doesn't ever shrink back to just that -- a dream.

HEADLINE: A Loan Fit for the Countryside

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS the subprime mortgage crisis has left thousands of people in the New York City area jobless and struggling to make housing payments, the United States government is encouraging a move to the country -- way out in the country.
 The Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Agency, which was established to help to raise the economic standing of those living in outlying communities, is making mortgages at a pace unseen in recent years. 
 For borrowers, a big attraction is that they can qualify even if they have no down payment. 
 There's a catch, though. Actually two of them. First, borrowers must have a household income that does not exceed 115 percent of the area's median. In the New York City area, that means a total income of no more than $82,000 for a two-person household and $102,500 for a family of four.
 Second, the borrower must buy in a designated rural area. In the New York City region, that limits the choice of homes on Long Island to the far east end, beyond the town of Southampton or on the North Fork, and in Westchester County to northeastern communities like Pound Ridge and North Salem. All of Putnam County also qualifies.
 In New Jersey, you have to get out to towns like Newfoundland and Kinnelon, in Passaic and Morris Counties, some 30 or 40 miles from Midtown, before you qualify. In Fairfield County, Conn., homes in Weston and Redding can qualify, as well as some farther northeast.
 If you're lucky enough to find a home you can afford on a moderate income in those areas, the loans offer a rare benefit, said Joaquin Tremols, the director of single-family loan programs at the Rural Development Agency. ''It's the only no-down-payment program left in America for nonveterans,'' he said.
 In general, lenders have steadily increased their down payment requirements as the mortgage industry has struggled -- a logical response, given that borrowers may be more inclined to walk away from loans when they have little at stake. Now, many borrowers cannot qualify for a loan unless they can put down 20 percent of a property's value.
 Mr. Tremols said demand for the rural loans had jumped sharply in the past fiscal year, doubling to more than $6 billion in mortgages. That pattern, he said, has held true in the greater New York area, but the absolute numbers are relatively modest.
 In the first 11 months of this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, New Yorkers took out almost 700 Agriculture Department mortgages for roughly $65 million, while in New Jersey borrowers took out about 200 loans for $37.5 million. In Connecticut, 128 of the loans were distributed, for a total of $24 million.
 By comparison, Michigan topped the list, with nearly 4,000 loans, worth around $388 million.
 Although one need not have a down payment or a huge salary to qualify, prospective borrowers must have a fairly clean financial picture. Mr. Tremols said a borrower must be able to document his or her income, and the monthly mortgage expense cannot exceed 29 percent of the income.
 When the mortgage is combined with car payments, credit cards and other debts, the borrower's monthly payments cannot exceed 41 percent of his or her income. (This is the so-called combined debt-to-income ratio.)
 Interest rates for Agriculture Department loans are in line with prevailing market rates, although the program's borrowers incur a one-time fee of 2 percent.
 For those considering a second home in the country, there is bad news: the loans are available only to those who use the home as their primary residences.

WAR LEFT ECONOMY
Of Georgia Battered
Before the war with Russia, Georgia had fashioned itself as the new economic tiger of the Caucasus, with a telegenic, pro-business president, Mikheil Saakashvili; a savvy work force; 12 percent annual growth; and foreign investment that tripled last year to nearly $2 billion. Now, the economic vitality of Georgia -- a Western ally suddenly at the front line of a power struggle with Russia -- is being tested. PAGE 8
RESHAPING BOLIVIA
Evo Morales, the first indigenous president of Bolivia, faces strong -- and frequently violent -- protests in lowland departments that are home to most of the nation's petroleum reserves and a European-descended elite that sees its interests as threatened. But Mr. Morales appears more and more likely to get the constitutional changes he wants, proposals that have the potential to keep him in power for the next decade. PAGE 12 
BOMB KILLS BOY IN INDIA
A small bomb went off in a busy market in New Delhi, killing a young boy and wounding more than a dozen, officials said. The explosion was exactly two weeks after synchronized blasts killed 24 people in three areas of the city, and it was the fifth bombing to hit an Indian city in four months. It also occurred just days after the New Delhi police boasted of having cracked an Islamist terrorist cell. PAGE 10

Destructive as it was, Hurricane Ike may be remembered as much for what did not happen as for what did: no chaotic flood of panicked people; no people crammed into a stadium or trapped on roofs; fewer deaths than feared. A comprehensive response by Texas played a role. But so did luck. PAGE 20

BUSH'S FINAL DAYS,
Week by Week
In ''The War Within,'' the final volume in Bob Woodward's four-part Bush oeuvre, the reported bombshells are hardly surprising. What is most consequential about the book, Jill Abramson writes, is the evolutionary shift it marks for the author: Mr. Woodward, famous for a writing style devoid of synthesis and judgment, provides interstitial analysis and arguments --and an extremely harsh final appraisal of President Bush.

VILLAGE PEOPLE
Candace Bushnell's new novel, ''One Fifth Avenue,'' whose characters live in the Greenwich Village Art Deco landmark that gives the book its title, trains its sharp and knowing eye on the unhappy rich, yielding a portrait that's less juicy than you hoped but more shapely than you feared, Henry Alford writes.

Kristin Scott Thomas, who is making her Broadway debut in Chekhov's ''Seagull,'' is juggling two acting careers -- one in English, one in French. Some critics have even said that she is two different actresses, and that she's warmer in French. She disagrees. ''The main difference is just that I get different roles in France,'' she said. ''They don't make films about the 1930s in country houses there.'' PAGE 1

THE END OF AN ERA,
Even at Goldman Sachs
The swashbuckling days on Wall Street -- with its big egos, big cars and ever bigger yachts -- are over. That change in the corporate culture has been felt at Goldman Sachs, the white-shoe firm that was the envy of the others on Wall Street, and which epitomized the suddenly out-of-vogue high-risk, high-return culture.

THE CASE FOR THE NAP
A study by Harvard researchers has found that people are more creative after sleep. That has changed the attitudes toward sleep in the business world. And so in order to promote productive workplace napping, companies like Google and Procter & Gamble have installed EnergyPods, leather recliners with egglike hoods that block noise and light, for employees to take naps at work.

OUT IN HOLLYWOOD,
But Lead Roles Are Rare
There are more gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered characters on television than ever before, and more Hollywood actors and actresses are openly gay, like Neil Patrick Harris and David Burtka, above.

THE BOX DEFENDS ITSELF
After weeks of bad publicity and the loss of their liquor license, the owners of the Box, a hip Manhattan cabaret and hot spot, decided to fire back at their critics, who include some of their former employees.

HEADLINE: How We Value The Super-Rich

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: San Francisco 

 BODY:
-- Americans, as unfolding economic events remind us, are of two minds about other people's piles of money. We can resent the enormous riches generated on Wall Street. At the same time, we can venerate other kinds of wealth -- Silicon Valley's, for example.
 It's almost as if there are ''good'' billionaires and ''bad'' billionaires in the public consciousness. When the super-rich are loved and admired, or maybe unloved but respected, it is often because people can actually see and enjoy the fruits of their labors. Donald Trump builds office towers and puts his name on them. Steven Spielberg makes movies with nice special effects. Martha Stewart decorates our lives and houses. Tiger Woods, on course to be sports' first billionaire, hits a golf ball really, really well. 
 The not-so-admired billionaires, particularly the wizards of Wall Street, operate in the shadows of capitalism. We are not really sure how they are making all that money. But we suspect that just a little bit of it used to be ours. 
 In Tom Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' the investment banker Sherman McCoy attempts to explain his Wall Street job to his daughter. His wife chimes in:
 ''Darling,'' said Judy, ''Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals, and he doesn't help people build them, but he does handle the bonds for the people who raise the money.''
 ''Bonds?''
 ''Yes. Just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake, and you didn't bake the cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of the cake a tiny little bit comes off, like a little crumb, and you can keep that.''
 Sherman is not well pleased about the crumbs, but imagine looking for a way to describe credit default swaps to a child. 
 The super-rich of high-tech, on the other hand, create tangible things that make our lives easier, and this we can respect. Steve Jobs gave us the ubiquitous iPod. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the roller-blading Google guys, devised a better way to search the Internet. Jeff Bezos gave people a way to shop in their pajamas. Bill Gates makes the desktop software on the computers most people use every day. 
 Of course, a segment of the population, particularly those whose computers seized up last week, have complicated feelings toward Mr. Gates and his ilk. Some might argue that their epic wealth is bloated by bubbles in the stock market, but few would begrudge them their overall financial reward.
 In contrast, the public seems to resent the big boys of Wall Street because they do not appear to have invented anything -- unless you count ingenious ways to make more money. Option derivatives are as inexplicable to the general public as particle physics. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, Alan Schwartz of Bear Stearns and Robert Willumstad of AIG might have tremendous records of innovation. If they do, none of us were told.
 We tend to like our billionaires better as we get to know more about them, too. Perhaps sensing this, technology companies actively promote their gazillionaire founders and their rags-to-riches stories, sometimes even awkwardly putting them in television commercials (Mr. Gates, Michael Dell and Charles Schwab). Yahoo, the embattled Internet search giant, is suddenly inserting its co-founder and chief executive Jerry Yang into promotional videos at every opportunity.
 The unpopular rich, on the other hand, are the ones who remain largely anonymous -- until they burst onto the scene with a perp walk (L. Dennis Kozlowski or Ken Lay), or they are garroted by the press for their ridiculous pay (Robert Nardelli of Home Depot, Dick Grasso of the New York Stock Exchange). 
 Then there are all the visual contrasts that we react to so viscerally. We envision Wall Street bankers wearing crisp Hermes ties and Paul Stuart suits while we associate technology executives with khakis and turtlenecks. We imagine the finance folks riding in limos, the tech-set gliding on their Segways and in Priuses.
 The Valley, to be sure, has carefully crafted its own image. But the upper-echelon of the region tends to believe its own spin. Entrepreneurs, they preach, should be rewarded only for what they create. Wealth is tightly linked to success; founders and executives receive equity in their companies and restrain annual salaries.
 ''If you succeed, you win; if you lose, you walk away with nothing,'' said Mitchell Kertzman, at partner at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and a longtime Valley entrepreneur
 The Wall Streeters can apparently walk away from both the flaming wreckage of their storied firms and the smoking remains of the national economy. Daniel Mudd and Richard Syron, former heads of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are together leaving with $9.43 million in retirement benefits, even after the government took over their companies and canceled their even larger severance packages.
 To folks in Silicon Valley and those that share their business values, a big payday for steering your company into catastrophe smells. 
 ''These are people who want to be rewarded as if they were entrepreneurs,'' said Jeffrey A. Sonneneld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. ''But they aren't. They didn't have anything at risk.''
 In the last century, recurring high-profile scandals on Wall Street helped create this image problem. Congressional investigations before World War I into Wall Street's banking trusts inspired the creation of the Federal Reserve and the Clayton antitrust law. During the Great Depression, Congress investigated the stock market crash and uncovered a variety of unsavory practices by the banks, leading to the creation of public disclosure laws for corporations. The savings-and-loan scandal of the 1980s exposed fresh Wall Street skullduggery and gave the public new antagonists (Charles Keating, Michael Milken).
 ''There has been a century of scamming, and we're not allowed to control it because the Wall Street guys always appeal to the American spirit of freedom and innovation,'' said G. William Domhoff, a professor of psychology and sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ''But lo and behold, sometimes they screw up and we begin to suspect that it's all just a big cover for the fact that they want to make extraordinary profits.'' 
 Now that the Wall Street wealthy have helped plunge the nation into economic calamity, they have an even more serious public relations problem. Perhaps they should move to Silicon Valley.

BYLINE: Interview by DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
As one of Canada 's most esteemed novelists and poets, you are about to deliver a series of public lectures on a seemingly nonliterary subject, ''Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth,'' which is also the title of your latest book. Your timing is perfect. Well, I didn't do it on purpose. It's not my fault. I didn't make those banks collapse. 
 I thought maybe you made the banks fail in order to help your book sales. I didn't even consider it. When I came up with the idea two or three years ago and planned out the lectures, this was not on the horizon. Everybody was happily buying subprime-mortgage vehicles. 
 So what led you to take up the subject of debt? Long ago, I was a graduate student in Victorian literature. When you think of the 19th-century novel, you think romance -- you think Heathcliff, Cathy, Madame Bovary, etc. But the underpinning structure of those novels is money, and Madame Bovary could have cheerfully gone on committing adultery for a long time if she hadn't overspent. 
 Are you saying we should view her as a pioneer of deficit spending? You can examine the whole 19th century from the point of view of who would have maxed out their credit cards. Emma Bovary would have maxed hers out. No question. Mr. Scrooge would not have. He would have snipped his up.
 What about you? Have you ever carried credit-card debt? No. I am very picky about that because you have to pay such large sums in interest. There's a little bit of Scrooge in all of us, but apparently not enough in some. 
 Right, there's a lot of Madame Bovary out there now, with people blithely sliding into debt. When did that shift happen? I can actually tell you. When the credit card came in. It made you feel richer than you were. The credit card in its present form -- a piece of plastic that arrives in the mail -- didn't come in big until the early '70s, as I recall. 
 I read somewhere that the average American household now has nearly $9,200 in credit-card debt, which is not a small amount. No. A great many people are spending more than they are earning. 
 How would you compare household debt to the budget deficit run up by the federal government, which is now more than $400 billion? Sooner or later, the householder has to pay up or declare bankruptcy. The federal government, on the other hand, has what they think of as an infinite source of money -- namely, you. You can't say, ''I'm not going to pay my taxes.'' You're a cash cow. 
 Why do you think the Bush administration has spent so extravagantly? They've been allowed to get away with it. Nobody has held them to account and whoever did was called not patriotic and a bad person. So, Spend-O-Rama. 
 In 1985, you published ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' a much-discussed classic set in a future in which the U.S. government has come to be controlled by right-wing fundamentalists. Do you feel you anticipated the likes of Sarah Palin? Ha. You can order action figures of her now. 
 Do you own any? No, I am afraid of what the actions would be. Read the book by Antonia Fraser called ''The Warrior Queens .'' You will see that no woman ruler has been successful if she has been an advocate for women at large. Not one, ever. It's the Thatcher model, which is, ''All women should stay home and take care of their babies except me.''
 On the other hand, Palin is tapping into Madonna iconography by appearing in public with her infant. The Virgin Mary was known for being modest and demure. She is not a gun-toting mama. I'm sorry.
 Well, thank you for your time and insights. I feel indebted. Next time, you have to let me interview you. Then the debt balance will be even.

HEADLINE: In Financial Food Chains, Little Guys Can't Win

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IMAGINE, if you will, that a man who had much to do with creating the present credit crisis now says he is the man to fix this giant problem, and that his work is so important that he will need a trillion dollars or so of your money. Then add that this man thinks he is so indispensable that he wants Congress to forbid any judicial or administrative questioning of anything he does with your dollars.
 You might think of a latter-day Lenin or Fidel Castro, but you would be far afield. Instead, you should be thinking of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the rapidly disintegrating United States of America, right here and now. 
 But I am getting ahead of myself. First, I am furious at what the traders, speculators, hedge funds and the government have done to everyone who is saving and investing for retirement and future security. Millions of us did nothing wrong, according to the accepted wisdom of the age. We saved. We put a large part of our money into the stock market, as we were urged to do. Because the market wasn't at ridiculously high levels, it seemed prudent to invest in broad indexes, foreign indexes and small- and large-cap indexes. 
 Now we have had the rug pulled out from under us. Our retirements have been put into severe jeopardy. The ''earnings'' part of those price-to-earnings ratios turns out to have been fiction for some financial companies, which normally account for a big part of total corporate earnings. In fact, earnings of giant finance players were often wildly negative, creating a situation rarely seen since the Great Depression, when the aggregate earnings of the Dow 30 were negative. 
 The current negativity occurred because of wild, casino-type operations of big finance players, creating liabilities way beyond anything we could have reasonably expected. This looks a lot like theft on a spectacular scale -- of our wallets, our peace of mind, our futures.
 Second, according to what I hear from my betters in the world of finance, the most serious problems are not with the bundles of subprime mortgages themselves -- a large but not lethal quantum as far as I can tell -- but with derivatives contracts tied to subprime and other dicey debt. These contracts are superficially an attempt to ''insure'' against risks of default, hence the name ''credit-default swaps.'' In fact, they are an immense wager -- which anyone with lots of money or borrowing ability can enter -- about how mortgage-backed bonds, leveraged loan bonds, student loan bonds, credit card bonds and the like will perform.
 These wagers entail amounts many times larger than the total of subprime loans. In fact, there are roughly $62 trillion in credit-default swap derivatives out there, compared with about $1 trillion of subprime mortgages. These derivatives are ''weapons of financial mass destruction,'' in the prophetic words of Warren E. Buffett. (Apparently believing that the worst is over, at least for one big investment bank, Mr. Buffett is now investing in Goldman Sachs.)
 The swaps market has been unregulated. It has been just a lot of people making bets with one another. Some of them made incredibly fortunate payoff wagers against the mortgage bonds, using credit-default swaps as their wagering vehicle. I am not sure who the big winners are, but they are out there, and the gains were big enough to cripple the part of Wall Street on the losing side of the bets.
 Almost no one (except Mr. Buffett) saw this coming, at least not on this scale. But let's get back to the man of the hour. Why didn't Mr. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, see it? He was once the head of Goldman Sachs, an immense player in the swaps world. Didn't people at Treasury have a clue? If they didn't, what was going on in their heads? If they did, why didn't they do something about it a year ago, when saving the world would have been a lot cheaper?
 If Mr. Paulson and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, didn't see this train coming, what else have they missed? What other freight train is barreling down the track at us?
 All of this would be bad enough. But by far the most terrifying item I read in my morning paper last week was this: Mr. Paulson demanded that Congress forbid judicial review of his decisions on use of the money in the mortgage bailout. This would amount to an abrogation of the Constitution. Not only would his decisions be sacrosanct and above the law, but so would the actions of his pals in the banking world in connection with this bailout. 
 The people whose conduct got us into this catastrophe have not only taken our money, hopes and peace of mind, but they apparently also want a trillion or so more dollars to put into their Wall Street Buddy System Fund. This may be the most dangerous attack on the law in my lifetime. What anarchists even dared consider this plan? Thank heaven that minds more devoted to the Constitution on Capitol Hill are questioning this shocking request.
 By the way, if we are actually thinking about tossing the Constitution out the window, why not simply annul these credit-default swap contracts? With that done, the incomprehensibly large liability of the banks would cease, and we wouldn't need this staggering bailout. Shouldn't we consider making the speculators pay some of the price?
 WE have survived housing-price corrections before. Why is this one causing so much anguish? It must be the side bets, the credit-default swap bets, multiplying the effect of the housing downturn many times over. Maybe we should just get rid of these exotic bets and start again without them. ''Insurance'' on market moves is always a bad idea, because it does not tamp down market disruptions but instead greatly magnifies them -- as in the disastrous effect of ''portfolio insurance'' in the 1987 crash.
 Then there was Mr. Paulson's insistence that there be no compensation caps for executives of companies being bailed out by the factory workers, the farmers, the schoolteachers and the medical doctors. He told a skeptical Congress on Tuesday that if these caps were put into place, bank executives simply wouldn't participate in the bailout or sell us suckers their debts. Fine with me. If the banks are in good enough shape so that petulant executives can simply opt out rather than live on a few million a year, maybe we don't need the bailout at all. Maybe we would be better off if those executives simply bailed out and were replaced by people with more sense and more patriotism.
 One final little thought bubbles into my mind: Maybe the bailout should not be of the banks at all, but of homeowners themselves. Maybe if we make the government the buyer of last resort of homes, we will stabilize the markets, stabilize the debt associated with the markets and take the gain out of the credit-default swaps for the speculators. Yes, price would be a huge issue, but so it is for Mr. Paulson's plan for buying debt from banks. 
 Why not? We do it for farmers. Why not for the individual homeowner? Oh, right. Because Treasury secretaries don't know any of those people.

HEADLINE: 24/7 School Reform

 BODY:
As Congress considers proposals to address the shortcomings of our nation's educational system, Paul Tough (Sept. 7) reminds us of the need to look beyond the classroom for programs that help lower-income children succeed in the classroom. 
 Congress need look no further than early intervention programs like the Nurse-Family Partnership highlighted in the story, which provides registered nurses to visit the homes of lower-income, first-time mothers and their children for two and a half years. The nurses help parents with prenatal health, child health and development and economic self-sufficiency. Because this strategy is delivering such great results, I introduced the Healthy Children and Families Act of 2007 to create a federal and state collaboration that will broaden the program. 
 With Republicans and Democrats both championing this bill, the next administration can take an important first step in giving every child an opportunity to fulfill the American dream. 
 KEN SALAZAR

 John McCain was right when he called education the ''civil rights issue of our time'' but incomprehensible when he then proposed the same old failed ideas -- parent choice, vouchers, tougher standards on teachers. Those ideas don't work now, and never have. Most obviously, it assumes that parents who care might get their child into a ''good'' school, so clearly students without parents to fight for them will be left in the failing ones. Isn't that the system we already have? McCain completely ignores the undeniable fact that educational failures stem from community failures: broken homes, broken communities, a lack of role models, little hope for a different future and major cultural barriers to ''success'' as most of us would label it. Canada is spot on in pinpointing the missing skill sets that result. Schools have very serious responsibilities, but to pretend a one-period high-school teacher can undo all the disadvantages accumulated before the student enters his classroom is ludicrous.

 As Paul Tough's article makes clear, disagreement among those who are all fundamentally on the side of educational reform could stand in the way of true progress even if Obama is elected. In hesitating to endorse brilliant and progressive programs like Canada's Harlem Children's Zone out of a fear of being ''paternalistic,'' some would-be reformers obstruct the very needs of the constituency they should be helping.
 Participation by inner-city families in programs like the Harlem Children's Zone, Early Head Start or Avance is not compulsory; it is an option for those who are fortunate enough to live in the neighborhood and who choose to take advantage of what such programs offer.

Energy From Incineration
 To the Editor:
 I read with great interest the article (''Tapping Power From Trash,'' Sept. 14) about harvesting methane gas from landfills to fuel electricity generation. 
 Former Vice President Gore has challenged the United States to switch to 100 percent electricity generation from clean, renewable sources within the next 10 years. To accomplish this, we must nurture the development of wind, solar and biomass sources, such as landfill methane recovery. Unfortunately, so-called green power offerings remain more expensive than fossil fuel or nuclear-generated electricity. Unless this changes, green power will likely continue to be just a boutique industry, catering only to well-off, environmentally concerned customers.
 Until the price of green electricity attains parity with conventional electricity, I propose waiving the state sales tax on purchases of certified green power. Widespread enrollment in green power programs will only occur with a level economic playing field.

 Norwalk Marching Band Teaches Life Lessons
 To the Editor:
 I was a member of the Norwalk High Marching Bears from 1985 to 1989, the beginning of Jeff Smith's tenure at Norwalk High School. During those four years, the band made huge leaps in becoming the dominant program that Mr. Smith has maintained for 20 years. While it's great to see the recovery of the band profiled (''A Lot Like Boot Camp, but With Horns and Drums,'' Sept. 14), the real story is Jeff Smith. His dedication, as well as his high and unyielding expectations remain an important and inspirational lesson in my life. We all could use more teachers like him. Thank you for the article.

 To the Editor:
 One did not have to be from Norwalk to appreciate this article (''A Lot Like Boot Camp, but With Horns and Drums,'' Sept. 14) and how much it meant to many high school students, parents and anyone who has ever known someone who has gone through a program like this from any town.
 I don't live in Norwalk, but I can attest to the fact that their fall musical program is one of the finest in the area. It is a very competitive and rigorous program, and the kids are stronger because of programs like this. Nobody makes them join a program like this (it is all voluntary, at least in our town it is) and the drop-out rate is low.

 Puzzling Over Peggy Preheim
 To the Editor:
 In Benjamin Genocchio's review of the exhibition ''Peggy Preheim: Little Black Book'' at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (Sept. 21), he says, ''What is missing is any kind of sociological significance, or any real indication that this artwork has a meaning beyond simple sentimentality.''
 As the designer of the exhibition catalog, I spent considerable time with Peggy Preheim and her work. Ms. Preheim's work is about cycles, reproduction, heredity, gender, social hierarchies, relationships, solitude, transformations and metaphysics. Some inspirations are family, Greek mythology, fairy tales, geometry, the Bible, Homer, Rilke, bees and spiders. 
 And contrary to Mr. Genocchio's claim that ''the exhibition catalog is not much help here, steering away from any kind of revealing background information that might help viewers interpret the work,'' Gregory Volk, in the catalog essay ''Slant Truth,'' interprets the sociological ideas communicated in Ms. Preheim's work with insights supported by discussions with the artist; goes on to examine and interpret 28 of the 89 works in the catalog; and offers biographical information on Ms. Preheim's Mennonite upbringing in South Dakota.

HEADLINE: The Unbrand

BYLINE: By ARMAND LIMNANDER

 BODY:
What a welcome surprise, especially in this trying economic climate, to covet something that is actually affordable! Such were my thoughts one blistering summer morning when I discovered that the much-anticipated Muji store had finally opened on the ground floor of The New York Times Building. The locale, like all other Muji outposts, has the confidence to be a little boring: there are no intrusive signs, overwhelming salespeople or dazzling window displays. Instead, just tables and shelves of plainly displayed -- yet plainly desirable -- stuff.
 There is something comforting about a small store that sells a bit of everything, especially if it's the right everything. Did you say you spilled coffee on your shirt right before a big meeting? Pop in and grab a nice new one for less than 60 bucks. Is the chaos on your desk draining your will to live? Simplify with a recycled paper notepad and a couple of brightly colored gel ink pens. Exhausted after a particularly brutal day? Stock up on memory foam pillows on the way home, and throw in a washable feather duvet -- or, for that matter, a new bed. While you're at it, add some bookcases, functional storage bins and a pair of cool little cardboard speakers. 
 Muji was founded in Tokyo in 1980; the name is short for mujirushi ryohin, which means ''no-brand quality goods.'' Its initial product range, sold in the Seiyu supermarket chain in Japan, consisted of just 9 household items and 31 food staples, packaged in nondescript bottles, cans and bags. By 1983, the line had expanded to 723 items, and Muji had opened its first free-standing store, in Tokyo; in 1991 it began a global expansion. Nowadays there are 339 stores in Japan, 83 in other countries across Asia and Europe, and 3 in New York, including a branch at Kennedy Airport, to open in October. (There are plans for others in the United States.) In total, Muji currently carries more than 7,000 products. 
 Despite its growth, Muji has maintained its commitment to producing carefully considered basics at the lowest possible price -- a strategy that was brilliantly counterintuitive in the 1980s, when Japan was an epicenter of conspicuous consumption. Muji rebelled against the more-is-more credo that Western luxury houses were greedily promoting in Asia, and made a name for itself by recycling and curtailing waste: a 1981 ad for canned salmon flakes, which utilized parts of the fish that tend to be discarded, urged foodies to ''enjoy every edible part of the salmon, from head to tail!'' (Take that, Fergus Henderson.) 
 In Japan, Muji currently sells Bread Crust Snacks -- packets of chips made from what you trim off sandwiches -- and Pie With Eggshells, which apparently has a lot of calcium and is good for you. Colorful socks and tank tops are made from excess yarn discarded during production of other garments; a cool, crinkly T-shirt is folded upon itself to create a perfect cube, eliminating the need for superfluous packaging. Even the more upscale items, like bicycles, home furnishings and an award-winning, wall-mounted CD player, flaunt a proudly minimalist aesthetic.
 Muji's frill-free philosophy seems particularly on-target now that the design world is veering toward understatement and familiar shapes instead of the ''forward-thinking'' (read: overdesigned) gizmos and doodads that we have gotten so used to lately. With recession a reality and sustainability issues no longer just a concern of politically engaged homemakers in Northern California, a return to simplicity seems not only desirable but downright inescapable. ''People tend to look for something new or radical,'' says Naoto Fukasawa, who has been Muji's design adviser since 2002. ''But I don't think these new items can replace others with history. The fact that things last through time is their strength and value.''
 To prove his point, Fukasawa recently curated an exhibition titled ''Super Normal: Sensations of the Ordinary'' in collaboration with the designer Jasper Morrison. They displayed 210 everyday objects (a Seiko watch, a plain plastic bucket, a Bic lighter) whose main appeal, according to the supernormal, sensationally ordinary paperback that accompanied the show, is ''the capacity to conceal its features until they become virtually invisible.'' In other words, products whose design is so instinctive that it's as if they had never been designed at all. Not surprising, several Muji classics (a calculator, an air filter and a kettle, among others) made the cut. 
 Goichi Hayashi, who is Yohji Yamamoto's business partner and advises Muji on its fashion collection on Yamamoto's behalf, takes a similar position. His mission, he says, is to make clothing that ''someone will wear until it falls apart, and then buy the same thing again'' -- like a gauzy white shirt or a basic blazer. He feels that Muji's home items offer the same kind of integrity. ''They look like they are not 100 percent finished, and that is very attractive to the design community. A wooden coffee table, for example, has the screws showing -- even though it would be easy to hide them -- but it looks good like that. It's honest.'' 
 Ultimately, Muji's goal is to let customers relate to their surroundings through the products they use. ''I think people are questioning whether special design is really necessary,'' says Fukasawa. ''Muji's approach is to eliminate designed-ness from all products and provide reliable choices, so labeling the brand becomes unnecessary. Simple is not a style -- it is a state of harmony.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street, R.I.P.: The End of an Era

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and BEN WHITE

 BODY:
WALL STREET. Two simple words that -- like Hollywood and Washington -- conjure a world. 
 A world of big egos. A world where people love to roll the dice with borrowed money. A world of tightwire trading, propelled by computers. 
 In search of ever-higher returns -- and larger yachts, faster cars and pricier art collections for their top executives -- Wall Street firms bulked up their trading desks and hired pointy-headed quantum physicists to develop foolproof programs. 
 Hedge funds placed markers on red (the Danish krone goes up) or black (the G.D.P. of Thailand falls). And private equity firms amassed giant funds and went on a shopping spree, snapping up companies as if they were second wives buying Jimmy Choo shoes on sale.
 That world is largely coming to an end. 
 The huge bailout package being debated in Congress may succeed in stabilizing the financial markets. But it is too late to help firms like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, which have already disappeared. Merrill Lynch, whose trademark bull symbolized Wall Street to many Americans, is being folded into Bank of America, located hundreds of miles from New York, in Charlotte, N.C. 
 For most of the financiers who remain, with the exception of a few superstars, the days of easy money and supersized bonuses are behind them. The credit boom that drove Wall Street's explosive growth has dried up. Regulators who sat on the sidelines for too long are now eager to rein in Wall Street's bad boys and the practices that proliferated in recent years. 
 ''The swashbuckling days of Wall Street firms' trading, essentially turning themselves into giant hedge funds, are over. Turns out they weren't that good,'' said Andrew Kessler, a former hedge fund manager. ''You're no longer going to see middle-level folks pulling in seven- and multiple-seven-dollar figures that no one can figure out exactly what they did for that.''
 The beginning of the end is felt even in the halls of the white-shoe firm Goldman Sachs, which, among its Wall Street peers, epitomized and defined a high-risk, high-return culture. 
 Goldman is the firm that other Wall Street firms love to hate. It houses some of the world's biggest private equity and hedge funds. Its investment bankers are the smartest. Its traders, the best. They make the most money on Wall Street, earning the firm the nickname Goldmine Sachs. (Its 30,522 employees earned an average of $600,000 last year -- an average that considers secretaries as well as traders.) 
 Although executives at other firms secretly hoped that Goldman would once -- just once -- make a big mistake, at the same time, they tried their darnedest to emulate it. 
 While Goldman remains top-notch in providing merger advice and underwriting public offerings, what it does better than any other firm on Wall Street is proprietary trading. That involves using its own funds, as well as a heap of borrowed money, to make big, smart global bets.
 Other firms tried to follow its lead, heaping risk on top of risk, all trying to capture just a touch of Goldman's magic dust and its stellar quarter-after-quarter returns.
 Not one ever came close.
 While the credit crisis swamped Wall Street over the last year, causing Merrill, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers to sustain heavy losses on big bets in mortgage-related securities, Goldman sailed through with relatively minor bumps.
 In 2007, the same year that Citigroup and Merrill cast out their chief executives, Goldman booked record revenue and earnings and paid its chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, $68.7 million -- the most ever for a Wall Street C.E.O.
 Even Wall Street's golden child, Goldman, however, could not withstand the turmoil that rocked the financial system in recent weeks. After Lehman and the American International Group were upended, and Merrill jumped into its hastily arranged engagement with Bank of America two weeks ago, Goldman's stock hit a wall. 
 The A.I.G. debacle was particularly troubling. Goldman was A.I.G.'s largest trading partner, according to several people close to A.I.G. who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. Goldman assured investors that its exposure to A.I.G. was immaterial, but jittery investors and clients pulled out of the firm, nervous that stand-alone investment banks -- even one as esteemed as Goldman -- might not survive. 
 ''What happened confirmed my feeling that Goldman Sachs, no matter how good it was, was not impervious to the fortunes of fate,'' said John H. Gutfreund, the former chief executive of Salomon Brothers.
 So, last weekend, with few choices left, Goldman Sachs swallowed a bitter pill and turned itself into, of all things, something rather plain and pedestrian: a deposit-taking bank. 
 The move doesn't mean that Goldman is going to give away free toasters for opening a checking account at a branch in Wichita anytime soon. But the shift is an assault on Goldman's culture and the core of its astounding returns of recent years. 
 Not everyone thinks that the Goldman money machine is going to be entirely constrained. Last week, the Oracle of Omaha, Warren E. Buffett, made a $5 billion investment in the firm, and Goldman raised another $5 billion in a separate stock offering.
 Still, many people say, with such sweeping changes before it, Goldman Sachs could well be losing what made it so special. But, then again, few things on Wall Street will be the same. 
 GOLDMAN'S latest golden era can be traced to the rise of Mr. Blankfein, the Brooklyn-born trading genius who took the helm in June 2006, when Henry M. Paulson Jr., a veteran investment banker and adviser to many of the world's biggest companies, left the bank to become the nation's Treasury secretary. 
 Mr. Blankfein's ascent was a significant changing of the guard at Goldman, with the vaunted investment banking division giving way to traders who had become increasingly responsible for driving a run of eye-popping profits. 
 Before taking over as chief executive, Mr. Blankfein led Goldman's securities division, pushing a strategy that increasingly put the bank's own capital on the line to make big trading bets and investments in businesses as varied as power plants and Japanese banks. 
 The shift in Goldman's revenue shows the transformation of the bank. 
 From 1996 to 1998, investment banking generated up to 40 percent of the money Goldman brought in the door. In 2007, Goldman's best year, that figure was less than 16 percent, while revenue from trading and principal investing was 68 percent.
 Goldman's ability to sidestep the worst of the credit crisis came mainly because of its roots as a private partnership in which senior executives stood to lose their shirts if the bank faltered. Founded in 1869, Goldman officially went public in 1999 but never lost the flat structure that kept lines of communication open among different divisions.
 In late 2006, when losses began showing in one of Goldman's mortgage trading accounts, the bank held a top-level meeting where executives including David Viniar, the chief financial officer, concluded that the housing market was headed for a significant downturn. 
 Hedging strategies were put in place that essentially amounted to a bet that housing prices would fall. When they did, Goldman limited its losses while rivals posted ever-bigger write-downs on mortgages and complex securities tied to them. 
 In 2007, Goldman generated $11.6 billion in profit, the most money an investment bank has ever made in a year, and avoided most of the big mortgage-related losses that began slamming other banks late in that year. Goldman's share price soared to a record of $247.92 on Oct. 31. 
 Goldman continued to outpace its rivals into this year, though profits declined significantly as the credit crisis worsened and trading conditions became treacherous. Still, even as Bear Stearns collapsed in March over bad mortgage bets and Lehman was battered, few thought that the untouchable Goldman could ever falter. 
 Mr. Blankfein, an inveterate worrier, beefed up his books in part by stashing more than $100 billion in cash and short-term, highly liquid securities in an account at the Bank of New York. The Bony Box, as Mr. Blankfein calls it, was created to make sure that Goldman could keep doing business even in the face of market eruptions. 
 That strong balance sheet, and Goldman's ability to avoid losses during the crisis, appeared to leave the bank in a strong position to move through the industry upheaval with its trading-heavy business model intact, if temporarily dormant.
 Even as some analysts suggested that Goldman should consider buying a commercial bank to diversify, executives including Mr. Blankfein remained cool to the notion. Becoming a deposit-taking bank would just invite more regulation and lessen its ability to shift capital quickly in volatile markets, the thinking went. 
 All of that changed two weeks ago when shares of Goldman and its chief rival, Morgan Stanley, went into free fall. A national panic over the mortgage crisis deepened and investors became increasingly convinced that no stand-alone investment bank would survive, even with the government's plan to buy up toxic assets. 
 Nervous hedge funds, some burned by losing big money when Lehman went bust, began moving some of their balances away from Goldman to bigger banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank. 
 By the weekend, it was clear that Goldman's options were to either merge with another company or transform itself into a deposit-taking bank holding company. So Goldman did what it has always done in the face of rapidly changing events: it turned on a dime. 
 ''They change to fit their environment. When it was good to go public, they went public,'' said Michael Mayo, banking analyst at Deutsche Bank. ''When it was good to get big in fixed income, they got big in fixed income. When it was good to get into emerging markets, they got into emerging markets. Now that it's good to be a bank, they became a bank.''
 The moment it changed its status, Goldman became the fourth-largest bank holding company in the United States, with $20 billion in customer deposits spread between a bank subsidiary it already owned in Utah and its European bank. Goldman said it would quickly move more assets, including its existing loan business, to give the bank $150 billion in deposits.
 Even as Goldman was preparing to radically alter its structure, it was also negotiating with Mr. Buffett, a longtime client, on the terms of his $5 billion cash infusion. 
 Mr. Buffett, as he always does, drove a relentless bargain, securing a guaranteed annual dividend of $500 million and the right to buy $5 billion more in Goldman shares at a below-market price. 
 While the price tag for his blessing was steep, the impact was priceless. 
 ''Buffett got a very good deal, which means the guy on the other side did not get as good a deal,'' said Jonathan Vyorst, a portfolio manager at the Paradigm Value Fund. ''But from Goldman's perspective, it is reputational capital that is unparalleled.'' 
 EVEN if the bailout stabilizes the markets, Wall Street won't go back to its freewheeling, profit-spinning ways of old. After years of lax regulation, Wall Street firms will face much stronger oversight by regulators who are looking to tighten the reins on many practices that allowed the Street to flourish.
 For Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which are converting themselves into bank holding companies, that means their primary regulators become the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversee banking institutions.
 Rather than periodic audits by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Goldman will have regulators on site and looking over their shoulders all the time. 
 The banking giant JPMorgan Chase, for instance, has 70 regulators from the Federal Reserve and the comptroller's agency in its offices every day. Those regulators have open access to its books, trading floors and back-office operations. (That's not to say stronger regulators would prevent losses. Citigroup, which on paper is highly regulated, suffered huge write-downs on risky mortgage securities bets.) 
 As a bank, Goldman will also face tougher requirements about the size of the financial cushion it maintains. While Goldman and Morgan Stanley both meet current guidelines, many analysts argue that regulators, as part of the fallout from the credit crisis, may increase the amount of capital banks must have on hand.
 More important, a stiffer regulatory regime across Wall Street is likely to reduce the use and abuse of its favorite addictive drug: leverage.
 The low-interest-rate environment of the last decade offered buckets of cheap credit. Just as consumers maxed out their credit cards to live beyond their means, Wall Street firms bolstered their returns by pumping that cheap credit into their own trading operations and lending money to hedge funds and private equity firms so they could do the same.
 By using leverage, or borrowed funds, firms like Goldman Sachs easily increased the size of the bets they were making in their own trading portfolios. If they were right -- and Goldman typically was -- the returns were huge. 
 When things went wrong, however, all of that debt turned into a nightmare. When Bear Stearns was on the verge of collapse, it had borrowed $33 for every $1 of equity it held. When trading partners that had lent Bear the money began demanding it back, the firm's coffers ran dangerously low.
 Earlier this year, Goldman had borrowed about $28 for every $1 in equity. In the ensuing credit crisis, Wall Street firms have reined in their borrowing significantly and have lent less money to hedge funds and private equity firms.
 Today, Goldman's borrowings stand at about $20 to $1, but even that is likely to come down. Banks like JPMorgan and Citigroup typically borrow about $10 to $1, analysts say. 
 As leverage dries up across Wall Street, so will the outsize returns at many private equity firms and hedge funds. 
 Returns at many hedge funds are expected to be awful this year because of a combination of bad bets and an inability to borrow. One result could be a landslide of hedge funds' closing shop.
 At Goldman, the reduced use of borrowed money for its own trading operations means that its earnings will also decrease, analysts warn.
 Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, predicts that Goldman's return on equity, a common measure of how efficiently capital is invested, will fall to 13 percent this year, from 33 percent in 2007, and hover around 14 percent or 15 percent for the next few years.
 Goldman says its returns are primarily driven by economic growth, its market share and pricing power, not by leverage. It adds that it does not expect changes in its business strategies and expects a 20 percent return on equity in the future.
 IF Mr. Hintz is right, and Goldman's legendary returns decline, so will its paychecks. Without those multimillion-dollar paydays, those top-notch investment bankers, elite traders and private-equity superstars may well stroll out the door and try their luck at starting small, boutique investment-banking firms or hedge funds -- if they can. 
 ''Over time, the smart people will migrate out of the firm because commercial banks don't pay out 50 percent of their revenues as compensation,'' said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics. ''Banks simply aren't that profitable.''
 As the game of musical chairs continues on Wall Street, with banks like JPMorgan scooping up troubled competitors like Washington Mutual, some analysts are wondering what Goldman's next move will be.
 Goldman is unlikely to join with a commercial bank with a broad retail network, because a plain-vanilla consumer business is costly to operate and is the polar opposite of Goldman's rarefied culture.
 ''If they go too far afield or get too large in terms of personnel, then they become Citigroup, with the corporate bureaucracy and slowness and the inability to make consensus-type decisions that come with that,'' Mr. Hintz said. 
 A better fit for Goldman would be a bank that caters to corporations and other institutions, like Northern Trust or State Street Bank, he said.
 ''I don't think they're going to move too fast, no matter what the environment on Wall Street is,'' Mr. Hintz said. ''They're going to take some time and consider what exactly the new Goldman Sachs is going to be.''

A chart last Sunday comparing the proposed Wall Street bailout package with several areas of federal spending misstated the size of the national debt. It is $9.6 trillion -- not $5.4 trillion, which is the debt held by the public.

HEADLINE: Six Tales of Perseverance, and Futility, in the Eye of a Fiscal Storm

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY and ERIC KONIGSBERG

 BODY:
A small-business owner in Brooklyn worries about making the payroll. A homeowner in Queens faces foreclosure. A suburban stay-at-home mother cuts back on luxuries. A retiree watches rent, food and cable bills rise while her income stays flat. An aspiring musician chooses between recording fees and a trip to see his family at Christmas. A head of a nonprofit group sees grants disappear. 
 Six New Yorkers anxiously watch the Wall Street roller coaster and wonder how it will affect them.
 Making Drinks and Song, But Not Enough of Either 
 Rescalla Cury, 22, an aspiring musician, lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and tends bar at a restaurant in Chelsea:
 I came to study music. I am taking private lessons, which made things a little bit harder. I also wanted to take a sound engineering course, but since I'm a foreigner, I would have had to pay the whole course up front, like $15,000. I play solo. I sing and play the guitar. My music is like Brazilian jazz with rock and blues. Hopefully I'm not going to be a bartender for the rest of my life.
 What I can see from last year to this year is that the season is definitely slower. I'm making less money because less people are going out. And when they go out, they spend less than what they used to. I've been doing the same, I've been having friends together in my house, to drink bottles of wine, instead of going out to bars. It's kind of like a chain. I make less money, and I stop going out too. 
 The rent is so absurd, and everything is so expensive. How can people afford $2,200 for an apartment? I want to stay in the apartment I'm in; hopefully my building won't get sold. 
 I was planning to start recording a track by the end of the year, but I don't know if it's going to happen or not. Because I may have to choose between recording a track and going home for Christmas with my family. 
 Income Is Unchanged, Costs and Worries Rise
 Betty Jones, 79, a retired social work administrator, lives in Stuyvesant Town, in Manhattan:
 I live on a fixed income to the extent that I get Social Security and then I get a small federal pension from my husband, who died in 1999. Then I get a monthly check from my retirement plan.
 Those three checks add up to about $5,000 a month -- about $2,000 a month short for covering my expenses. My basic yearly expenses are $60,000 to $65,000 but other things come up. I fortunately have some other savings my husband and I put aside, and that's how I make up the difference.
 Rent has gone up. The cost of food is up. I have RCN for cable and phone and that's gone up. So I really have to budget more carefully now.
 I just came back from Rwanda. It cost about $5,000, for 10 days. I went with People to People, to volunteer in orphanages and vocational training programs for young people. I came back wondering what's happening to my money. It was right in the middle of the week when the market crisis was happening. I was worrying, ''What about my money-market at Citibank?'' I get my statements and I'm getting poorer and poorer. I've lost about $40,000 or $50,000 in the past few months. 
 The money has to last a long time. I expect to keep ticking.
 I'm not nearly as frightened as some of my friends. But I won't spend $5,000 for another trip right away. Having been a part of the Depression as a child, I worry about what happens on Wall Street. I wonder, ''My God, are we going to live through that again? Is everything going to collapse around me?''
 I haven't taken any of my money out of the market yet. Where do I put it, under the mattress?
 An American Dream Slowly Evaporates
 Rico Lumaban, 49, immigrated from the Philippines in 1982 and lives with his wife, a nurse, and three children, ages 21, 19 and 13, in Bellerose, Queens:
 We bought our house in 1989. I had a 30-year fixed mortgage. But in the year 2001, I had difficulties. I bought the right to run a gas station in Astoria, Queens. They had all these accounts with people who work at the embassies. It was supposed to change everything. But the guy I bought it from built another shop and took all the customers with him. I lost close to $200,000; it was all my savings. 
 In 2006, I had the house refinanced, and I got into a very bad subprime loan. I needed to pay some debts. My son was starting college. I had used all his college savings; that was a very sad thing for him. 
 I got two kinds of loans, an adjustable-rate mortgage over three years and a home-equity loan. After three years, the mortgage will go to $4,000 a month. I didn't know that the mortgage payments would also increase every six months. 
 I was relying on the representative that was helping me to help me do the right thing. Sometimes you trust people. The worst thing was, after it's all said and done, I never heard anything from the representative. It's like they got away. 
 I'm trying to get a permanent job. I just do, like, moonlighting as a handyman and mechanic but it doesn't pay. 
 We are in the foreclosure process. I got the court summons and I answered it last week. I haven't been paying for the last five months, because I can't. 
 I don't want to think about it, with my three kids. I'm so stressed out thinking about where we're going to be next year. I'm just closing my eyes, and seeing if things change. It's really scary; it's hard to sleep. 
 Stay-at-Home Mother Ponders a Paycheck
 Jennifer Manthei, 40, worked in museums but now stays at home in Pelham, N.Y., with her two sons, ages 4 and 1 1/2:
 I don't know anybody who's had to go back to work out of necessity yet, but in our community of stay-at-home moms, it's certainly something we talk about.
 I'm an art historian, so my earning potential in the field is low even in a good market. I used to work at the Met. Curatorial jobs without a master's degree -- well, it was 10 years ago, but I made not even $30,000 a year. At the Museum of Natural History, where I worked after that, I was making more, but I was in an administrative job. But in a bad market, jobs in the arts are probably the first to get cut.
 So I would end up doing something like secretarial work, something just for the money, something that is not as fulfilling. I imagine if I were working I could make around $50,000 now, and I imagine a great percentage of that would go toward providing the basic care for my children -- a baby sitter and day care, plus nursery school for our oldest. So it would be a lose-lose situation, basically.
 My husband co-owns a small recruiting boutique and he specializes in information-technology placement. Because he places people for both temporary and permanent jobs, his business can weather some of the employment ups and downs, but I think he's felt the change in the economy in his business. And he anticipates he might feel it more.
 Our family's economic certainty is something we've been talking about more than in the past. We're already cutting back on things that I consider luxuries. I'd sound silly if I considered this a real sacrifice, but we're not redoing all of the first floor like we'd wanted to, just some rooms. We wonder about how much money we'll be able to set aside for our children's college fund this year.
 Restoring Hot Lunches, At the Expense of Jobs
 Stanley Richards, 47, is chief operating officer of the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization in Long Island City, Queens, which helps former convicts find jobs and housing:
 Our budget is about $14 million. Ninety percent of our contributions come from government funding and the rest is mostly foundations. We're already feeling the pinch. We've talked about the worst-case scenario and what programs we absolutely can't cut. The cuts will come down on the drug treatment side, on the housingside, for the next few years. 
 This year for the first time, the city gave us a 50 percent cut in a contract that had started in January. It was already August -- the year was more than half over -- so we had to end the program immediately and go through a series of steps to recoup the money we'd already spent past July 1. 
 Also, we had a discharge-planning program -- for prisoners who are going to be released soon. The Department of Corrections stopped funding it, so we've canceled that. 
 We're looking at a minimum of a 5 percent cut from the city. State contracts will be cut worse. We expect notification any day now. A funder at the city Department of Health and Mental Hygiene told us to be prepared for our AIDS housing funding to be cut by two-thirds, from about $1.6 million a year to $600,000. 
 Two foundations have told us that their portfolio is in trouble. One is cutting back their contribution this year and the other told us to reapply and ask for less.
 We wiped out our hot lunches earlier this year, but we've decided that has to stay, and so we're going to bring it back and have layoffs. The food program, for some of these people who come in -- some of them have kids -- it's the only meal of the day. Right now we're serving peanut butter and jelly and what they call ''jail soup,'' which is dry packets.
 Earlier this year, we laid off 21 people -- about 10 percent of our staff. It's very personal for me. A lot of people who work here are former inmates. This is the first place they come when no one else wants to hire them. I started here in 1991 as a counselor. Prior to that, I'd been in prison several times, for robbery the last time, a four-and-a-half year term.
 Success Breeds Growth And an Element of Caution
 Tricialee Riley, 34, owns the Polish Bar of Brooklyn, a nail and beauty salon on Myrtle Avenue in Clinton Hill, and she just signed a lease to open a second location in neighboring Prospect Heights: 
 I've been in the beauty business since college, since I was 19, and I've been in New York for 10 years. For seven years, I was working and earning and saving. There was never a day without me planning my small business. I always saved, and knew it was going to happen. And I opened in July 2006. 
 It's a small business, but I had a very big opening, and business has been tremendous. So much so that we're expanding and opening a much larger space. I just signed my lease 15 minutes ago. We'll be opening in December 2008.
 Securing a loan for the second business was a lot more challenging that I anticipated. We had been successful. I have a good credit score. All my i's are dotted and my t's are crossed. I literally have in the savings almost the equivalent of what I needed to secure the second store. But my own personal bank denied me the loan, so I went to a microlender to do the financing. That was shocking. 
 All my profits are in savings, liquid cash. Because that might have to be the payroll for a while. We anticipated on hiring 14 people for the second store, but will probably hire 8 and take on people as needed.
 We're in the middle of something that's so extremely exciting for us, but worried about how the economy will affect us. Everybody's being suggested to watch their money and cut their spending and we're at the top of the list of what to cut. 
 I think there may be a drastic change in the habits and behaviors of women over the next season. I am fearful of the change, I am. But I can't work off of fear. 
 There is a doubt that creeps in now that I really haven't had to deal with a lot. On Saturday (Sept. 20) in particular. I came into work, early in the morning. And I said 'God, if I'm doing too much too soon, I can wait a year and a half.' I'd rather wait a year and a half and give up a wonderful location than to fail. I had so much doubt. And he sent me a sign. I opened the store and we had our second largest day ever, after a week when Myrtle Avenue looked like a ghost town.

HEADLINE: War Left Georgia Economy Bruised, but Not Broken

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia 

 BODY:
During the recent war between Georgia and Russia, Russian soldiers broke into a tower housing Georgia's largest Internet provider and blew up its transmission equipment with hand grenades, shutting down television, phone and digital access for two million people across the country. 
 More than a month later, the company, Caucasus Online, is still struggling with the economic fallout. The company's managing director, Mamia Sanadiradze, said that having restored Internet access to clients at a cost of $50 million, he now risks defaulting on plans to build a giant telecommunications network stretching to Western Europe. 
 The project was to be completed by October, but has been set back because American engineers hired to install an underwater cable are said to be too worried about the security risk of returning to Georgia and to the field. Mr. Sanadiradze estimated he would lose $1 million for every month the project was delayed. 
 ''The Russians are still stationed on Georgian territory, and at any time they can paralyze our communications network or blow up the railway and nobody can stop them,'' he said. ''As long as the Russians are here, it will be impossible to restore business confidence in Georgia, that we spent years trying to build up.'' 
 Before the war, Georgia, a country of 4.6 million people, had fashioned itself as the new economic tiger of the Caucasus, with a telegenic, pro-business president, Mikheil Saakashvili; a savvy work force; 12 percent annual growth; and foreign investment that tripled last year to nearly $2 billion. Now, the economic vitality of Georgia -- a Western ally suddenly at the front line of a power struggle with Russia -- is being tested. 
 The fighting rocked Georgia's economy. After hostilities broke out on Aug. 7, the transport routes between Poti, Georgia's main Black Sea port, and Tbilisi, the capital, were cut off. That created a bottleneck for many products, including electronic goods and toilet paper, leading dozens of importers to default on contracts. Georgia's stock market plummeted. Tens of thousands of Georgians withdrew cash from banks, wiping out $165 million in deposits at the Bank of Georgia, the largest bank in the country. 
 Meanwhile, Georgia's once-blossoming tourism industry has been severely hit. The country's pristine forests were burned by Russian incendiary bombs; its scenic resorts on the Black Sea -- which have long attracted rich Russians -- sit largely empty. 
 Despite the buffeting, made worse by a global financial crisis, economists and policy makers here say the Georgian economy has proved to be relatively resilient. Nor has the political system been destabilized. 
 Lado Gurgenidze, Georgia's prime minister and a former investment banker who worked in London, said Georgia had suffered about $1 billion in infrastructure damage from the war -- damage that could be more than offset by $2 billion in combined aid from the United States and the European Union. 
 Mr. Gurgenidze also emphasized that in a region known for coups and revolutions, Georgia had not been consumed by lawlessness and disorder, even as Russian tanks rolled a mere half-hour from the capital. ''We are experiencing the unpleasant consequences of a shock to the system,'' he said, ''but we have not seen panic buying or hoarding, and we have not seen a widespread investment flight.'' 
 Even so, the confidence of foreign investors was one of the biggest casualties of war. Amy Denman, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Georgia, which represents 130 of the biggest foreign investors in the country, said the presence of Russian troops on Georgian territory would deter foreign investment for a long time. 
 The Kazakh state oil and natural gas company, KazMunaiGas, announced Wednesday that it had dropped plans to build a $1 billion oil refinery in the Georgian port of Batumi, saying it was not economically viable. The Kazakh government, an important foreign investor in Georgia, has also withdrawn from plans to build a $10 million grain terminal in Poti, citing concerns raised by the war. 
 Other businesses are retrenching as well. the Ofer Group, an Israeli shipping and property development company, said it would forge ahead with a shopping center project in Tbilisi on which it had already broken ground. But it delayed development of a four-star hotel. 
 Russia has agreed to withdraw from Georgia within 10 days after an observer mission from the European Union arrives in Georgia, around this Wednesday. But so far there has been only a partial retreat, while the Kremlin is emphatic it will retain a military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's two breakaway regions. 
 The war may also have stymied Georgia's aspirations to become an alternative supply route for energy consumed by the European Union, which seeks to offset its vulnerability to Moscow's pipeline politics. The United States and the European Union have pressed for the construction of a pipeline called Nabucco to bring natural gas to Europe from Central Asian countries like Turkmenistan, with Georgia as an important part of the route. 
 Borut Grgic, a Slovenia-based specialist on energy in the region, said the war had severely dented Georgia's credibility as an alternative supply route, potentially denying it hundreds of millions of dollars in future transit fees. 
 Russia had long been a huge market for Georgia, but it imposed a trade embargo in the fall of 2006 after Georgia arrested four Russian military officers on espionage charges. Executives here cite Georgia's ability to thrive despite the embargo as evidence of their resilience. 
 ''Everyone said the Russian embargo would be an economic disaster, yet for the last two years Georgia has had double-digit growth,'' said Nicholas Enukidze, chairman of the Bank of Georgia. 
 Perhaps no one knows better the necessity of offsetting dependence on Russia than Badri Japaridze. He is chief executive of Borjomi, the largest Georgian beverage company, whose celebrated spring water was once the preferred refreshment of Russian czars. When Russia embargoed Georgian goods, Borjomi, then the No. 1 bottled water brand in Russia, had to withdraw 180 million bottles of water from 30,000 stores, which Mr. Japaridze said cost the company $50 million in lost sales. 
 Mr. Japaridze said Borjomi had weaned itself from dependence on Russia by expanding into Ukraine, the Baltic states and Japan, among other countries. ''We learned the painful and costly lesson that you should not be so exposed to one market,'' he said. ''But our comeback also illustrates that Georgian companies can thrive without the Russian market.'' 
 Despite the embargo, Russian businesses have not stopped investing in Georgia, and several said that the war would not alter their plans. 
 Valeri Pantsulaia, a spokesman for Telasi, a Russian-owned utility that distributes electricity in Tbilisi, said that Telasi had experienced no disruptions during the war and that the Georgian government had assured the company it would not nationalize Russian assets in Georgia. 
 ''I don't think people think about whether we are Russian or not,'' Mr. Pantsulaia said. ''Business is business. Georgians want electricity, regardless of whether it is a Russian or Georgian company that is keeping the lights on.'' He added that Telasi was nevertheless wondering whether to rehang its Russian flag outside its Tbilisi office. 
 Mr. Japaridze of Borjomi insisted that the war had paradoxically put little Georgia on the global map, which he said in the long run could help attract investors, especially Americans for whom the name Georgia meant only a peach-growing state in the American South. 
 ''There is better country awareness about Georgia than ever before -- with even both U.S. presidential candidates talking about us,'' he said. ''Now we just need to change our image from a country that hosts Russian tanks to something more peaceful.''

HEADLINE: Diplomacy Over Drama

BYLINE: By SUSAN C. SCHWAB. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I WAS born in Washington, and my family moved abroad when I was 6 weeks old. I spent eight years in Africa and lived in Europe and Asia as well. My father was with the Foreign Service, and after that he worked for the Agency for International Development.
I attended kindergarten in West Africa, in Lome, the capital of Togo, then a French colony. Living in Africa gave me a sense of what poverty looks like and the need for economic development. 
I went to high school in Switzerland and Bangkok and then attended Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. My senior year was a turning point. I had to decide whether to go to graduate school and study economic development or become an apprentice costumer at Joseph Papp's Shakespeare Festival in New York. Professionals from New York used to perform, direct and work backstage at the college. I worked backstage, and one of the costumers suggested that I go to New York. I had been admitted to Stanford, however, and I decided to pursue a master's instead.
My first job after graduating was as a junior agricultural negotiator in the agency where I work now. I had absolutely no contacts. I traveled to Washington and chose a name from a directory on a wall at the building then housing the Office of the United States Trade Representative because the person's name and job sounded interesting. I met the man's assistant and was passed from person to person until I met someone who knew of a job opening. I started four months later, after obtaining the necessary security clearances.
I worked with Robert S. Strauss, who was the United States trade representative in the Carter administration at the time and my first mentor. He took me to Capitol Hill when he met with Congressional delegations. We were trying to get beef into the Japanese market, and I'm still trying to do that 30 years later.
In 1981, I was serving in Japan when I learned from another staffer that Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, then the chairman of the International Trade subcommittee, had a job opening, so I paid my own way back from Tokyo to interview for it.
The senator became another crucial mentor. I worked on trade policy for him and moved from a tenured career path into the wild and woolly world of politics.
I never knew from one year to the next where I'd be working. Eventually I became legislative director for Senator Danforth. I learned to deal with change, and I learned that taking risks has its rewards.
I've traveled close to 500,000 miles in the two and a half years I've been the United States trade representative. There are 153 countries in the World Trade Organization. I've learned that the keys to travel are to set your body clock to whatever time zone you're in, look for sunshine and walk a lot. Frequently I'll go on a power walk with the Secret Service detail traveling with me.
Recently I returned from the Doha round of trade talks in Geneva, which were about lowering trade barriers. A handful of countries brought the talks down, but that's not to say it's over.
This administration has closed 17 free-trade agreements. I've closed four, with Columbia, South Korea, Peru and Panama. I'm not giving up. As a trade representative, you've got to be an optimist.
For women, there's not the same sense of a glass ceiling in Washington as there is in other careers. In corporate America, out of 18 board members, you don't often find five women. There are five of us among 21 cabinet officials in this administration, and no one notices.
I married late in life, at age 41. My husband was a professional magician who was hysterically funny and incredibly talented. I was lucky to have found him. We were married almost 10 years before he died. I miss him a lot.

 BODY:
Every generation gets the Constitution that it deserves. As the central preoccupations of an era make their way into the legal system, the Supreme Court eventually weighs in, and nine lawyers in robes become oracles of our national identity. The 1930s had the Great Depression and the Supreme Court's ''switch in time'' from mandating a laissez-faire economy to allowing New Deal regulation. The 1950s had the rise of the civil rights movement and Brown v. Board of Education. The 1970s had the struggle for personal autonomy and Roe v. Wade. Over the last two centuries, the court's decisions, ranging from the dreadful to the inspiring, have always reflected and shaped who ''we the people'' think we are. 
 During the boom years of the 1990s, globalization emerged as the most significant development in our national life. With Nafta and the Internet and big-box stores selling cheap goods from China, the line between national and international began to blur. In the seven years since 9/11, the question of how we relate to the world beyond our borders -- and how we should -- has become inescapable. The Supreme Court, as ever, is beginning to offer its own answers. As the United States tries to balance the benefits of multilateral alliances with the demands of unilateral self-protection, the court has started to address the legal counterparts of such existential matters. It is becoming increasingly clear that the defining constitutional problem for the present generation will be the nature of the relationship of the United States to what is somewhat optimistically called the international order.
 This problem has many dimensions. It includes mundane practical questions, like what force the United States should give to the law of the sea. It includes more symbolic questions, like whether high-ranking American officials can be held accountable for crimes against international law. And it includes questions of momentous consequence, like whether international law should be treated as law in the United States; what rights, if any, noncitizens have to come before American courts or tribunals; whether the protections of the Geneva Conventions apply to people that the U.S. government accuses of being terrorists; and whether the U.S. Supreme Court should consider the decisions of foreign or international tribunals when it interprets the Constitution.
 In recent years, two prominent schools of thought have emerged to answer these questions. One view, closely associated with the Bush administration, begins with the observation that law, in the age of modern liberal democracy, derives its legitimacy from being enacted by elected representatives of the people. From this standpoint, the Constitution is seen as facing inward, toward the Americans who made it, toward their rights and their security. For the most part, that is, the rights the Constitution provides are for citizens and provided only within the borders of the country. By these lights, any interpretation of the Constitution that restricts the nation's security or sovereignty -- for example, by extending constitutional rights to noncitizens encountered on battlefields overseas -- is misguided and even dangerous. In the words of the conservative legal scholars Eric Posner and Jack Goldsmith (who is himself a former member of the Bush administration), the Constitution ''was designed to create a more perfect domestic order, and its foreign relations mechanisms were crafted to enhance U.S. welfare.''
 A competing view, championed mostly by liberals, defines the rule of law differently: law is conceived not as a quintessentially national phenomenon but rather as a global ideal. The liberal position readily concedes that the Constitution specifies the law for the United States but stresses that a fuller, more complete conception of law demands that American law be pictured alongside international law and other (legitimate) national constitutions. The U.S. Constitution, on this cosmopolitan view, faces outward. It is a paradigm of the rule of law: rights similar to those it confers on Americans should protect all people everywhere, so that no one falls outside the reach of some legitimate legal order. What is most important about our Constitution, liberals stress, is not that it provides rights for us but that its vision of freedom ought to apply universally. 
 The Supreme Court, whose new term begins Oct. 6, has become a battleground for these two worldviews. In the last term, which ended in June, the justices gave expression to both visions. In two cases in particular -- one high-profile, the other largely overlooked -- the justices divided into roughly two blocs, representing the ''inward'' and ''outward'' looking conceptions of the Constitution, with Justice Anthony Kennedy voting with liberals in one case and conservatives in the other. The Supreme Court is on the verge of several retirements; how the justices will address critical issues of American foreign policy in the future hangs very much in the balance. 
 This may seem like an odd way of thinking about international affairs. In the coming presidential election, every voter understands that there is a choice to be made between the foreign-policy visions of John McCain and Barack Obama. What is less obvious, but no less important, is that Supreme Court appointments have become a de facto part of American foreign policy. The court, like the State Department and the Pentagon, now makes decisions in cases that directly change and shape our relationship with the world. And as the justices decide these cases, they are doing as much as anyone to shape America's fortunes in an age of global terror and economic turmoil.
 What Conservatives Understand About International Law
 The debate between inward-looking conservatives and outward-looking liberals has recently taken a turn toward the shrill. Liberal lawyers do not simply accuse their conservative counterparts of denigrating the rule of law; they accuse them of violating it themselves. Calling last spring for the firing of the tenured Berkeley professor John Yoo, an architect of the Bush administration's legal strategy in the war on terror, Marjorie Cohn, the president of the National Lawyers' Guild, declared that ''Yoo's complicity in establishing the policy that led to the torture of prisoners constitutes a war crime under the U.S. War Crimes Act.''
 The conservatives' arguments are no less heated: not only, they contend, do liberals paint a naively romantic picture of the world -- one in which the United Nations and its agencies and courts would make law for Americans -- but liberals are also endangering American lives. Dissenting this past June from the Supreme Court decision giving those held at Guantanamo Bay a right to challenge their detention, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the majority's ruling ''will almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.''
 These sorts of accusations are overstated and unhelpful. Neither the liberal nor the conservative view corresponds to the stereotype assigned to it by its opponents. Notwithstanding their limitations, both views express values that are deeply grounded in the American constitutional tradition and in the rule of law. Each is necessary to help us make sense of the Constitution's role in an increasingly complex global world.
 Consider first the conservative vision, which is sometimes called ''sovereigntist'' because it emphasizes the power and prerogative of the United States to act as if it is responsible to no one but itself. The Bush administration, through its characteristic combination of boldness, historical ambition and operational incompetence, has given sovereignty a bad name, much as it has for unilateralism. But the constitutional principle here is actually one that most liberals also fully embrace: namely, the principle of democracy.
 International law, as even its staunchest defenders must acknowledge, often fails to accord with democratic principle. Such law is not passed by a democratically elected Congress and signed by a democratically elected president. It is true that the U.S. Constitution says that international treaties signed by the president and approved by the Senate shall be the supreme law of the land, thereby conferring some democratic legitimacy on treaties. But a great deal of international law derives not from treaties signed by consenting nations but rather from the vague category of international custom, which over time can harden into binding law. For hundreds of years, until more formal treaties were adopted, custom was the main way international law was created, giving rise to the laws of war, for instance, and condemning terrorism and torture. Even today, the existence of a treaty among only a select group of nations can be invoked in international forums as evidence of an established custom -- and nonparticipating countries can come to be bound by treaties that they themselves never signed.
 To conservatives, such international ''law'' is anathema. Even in cases in which explicit treaties among nations do exist, conservatives worry. Such treaties, after all, are increasingly interpreted by nondemocratic institutions like tribunals of the World Trade Organization or the United Nations' International Court of Justice. Two hundred years ago, treaties tended to be simple agreements between two parties, with each reserving the right to interpret (and, if necessary, enforce) the treaty's terms for itself. Today, though, many of the most important treaties -- those governing trade, the environment and other crucial matters -- involve a large number of nations that agree as a condition of the treaty to be bound by the decisions of an international body. To sign on to such a treaty, conservatives point out, confers future lawmaking authority on some unelected and thus undemocratic body.
 According to the sovereigntists, the United States, faced with such undemocratic regimes, should feel free to reject any undesirable verdict of a body like the International Court of Justice and embrace a policy more in line with U.S. interests -- much in the way that Israel responded to the I.C.J.'s condemnation of the path of its security barrier on the West Bank. In a world where Libya can lead an international human rights commission, no international institution is free from the distortions that arise when all countries are treated as equals. Even within the distinguished higher echelons of the United Nations or European Union, there is a risk that bureaucrats may pursue policies that reflect the values and priorities of their own technocratic classes. The worst-case scenario, from the perspective of the conservatives, is one in which enemies of the United States engage in ''lawfare,'' opportunistically charging the country with violations of international law to impede it from rightfully ensuring its safety.
 Another key sovereigntist principle is the right of the United States, when acting abroad, to protect itself, whether fighting wars or preventing terrorist attacks. Historically, the court has given the president, as commander in chief, great latitude to act abroad as he sees fit. In situations in which Congress has explicitly authorized the president's action, the court has recognized the prerogative as almost absolute. For instance, when the United States acquired Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines in the Spanish-American War, the Supreme Court allowed Congress and the president to govern those territories without extending constitutional rights to the residents. Similarly, after World War II, when Germans held by the United States in occupied Germany pending war-crimes charges petitioned for judicial review, the Supreme Court turned them away.
 Conservatives argue, not implausibly, that these historic decisions did not undermine the rule of law: they embodied it. The Supreme Court's judgments derived, after all, from the Constitution itself and its own democratic pedigree. One central reason that the people of the United States formed the Constitution was in order to provide for the common defense. The Constitution does protect rights, according to this view -- but they are the rights of citizens, not the rights of mankind in general or of foreigners who have never even set foot in the United States.
 What Liberals Understand About International Law
 From the liberal perspective, the vision espoused by the conservatives is crabbed and parochial. Of course the Constitution demands democracy and gives rights to American citizens. But, say the progressives, that does not explain why over the last two centuries the Constitution has become the very model of what a system of government under law looks like. The key to the Constitution's global appeal, according to the liberal view, is that the document stands for the universal principle that state power over individuals may only ever be exercised through law -- no matter what government is acting, and no matter where on earth. 
 This outward-looking, ''internationalist'' conception of the Constitution respects the sovereignty of the United States and that of other countries -- provided they deliver a just legal order to their citizens. But liberals point out that even a constitutional state that guarantees rights for its own citizens will not protect people in many places and times, often when rights are most sorely needed. In wartime, for instance, almost no nation will have an interest in protecting the rights of foreign enemies that it encounters. On the open seas, no domestic law applies. And for reasons of sheer practicality, no country's laws regulate all its potential relations with all other states. To cover situations like these, where domestic law runs out of rope, is the task of international law. Such law seeks to ensure rights for all, not by replacing the domestic law of independent nations but by holding it to standards of universal justice and by supplementing it where it is incomplete or inadequate.
 From this perspective, international law is necessary to ensure that the rule of law will actually obtain in situations where individual states do not provide it. This is why, for liberals, it is essential that the United States comply with its international obligations. The framers of the Constitution were certainly eager to demonstrate such compliance. When they made treaties the law of the land, they were saying -- according to an interpretation of Chief Justice John Marshall's that dates back to 1829 -- that the moment the Senate ratifies a treaty, it automatically becomes the supreme law of the land, binding in every court in the nation.
 Deepening their historical argument, the liberals also point out that from the earliest days of the United States, the nation's courts applied customary international law, regularly deciding who owned ships captured on the high seas according to immemorial practice that was not found in any treaty. What is more, the framers' reliance on international law and custom went to the very heart of their constitutional endeavor: what, otherwise, did the framers mean when they spoke in the Constitution about the declaration of war, or about letters of marque and reprisal, or about judicial authority over ambassadors?
 In practice, the internationalist camp argues for the prudent use of international legal materials in constitutional decision-making -- not only for purposes of rhetoric and persuasion but also to provide rules and principles to help actually decide cases. For example, liberals argue that if the United States adopts laws designed to comply with the Geneva Conventions, the government is obligated to follow the treaty to the letter should the government invoke the authority to detain prisoners that the treaty confers. Likewise, when the United States has undertaken to comply with the decisions of international tribunals, those tribunals' rulings must be treated as law, just as the treaties themselves are.
 Liberals concede that the framers showed respect for international law, in part, because their country was new and revolutionary, and they sought legitimacy in the community of nations. But the liberal view stresses that the tradition of respect continued even once the nation was well established, and that it was kept alive by successive generations for different but always compelling reasons. The United States helped found the United Nations after World War II, for instance, at what was then the nation's moment of greatest global power. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's idea, shared by liberals then and now, was that the international rule of law was good not just in principle but also in practice. As a country governed by law, we were asserting the superiority of our system to others governed by dictatorship. Moreover, since the United States was a permanent member of the Security Council, any compromises to our national sovereignty were more than outweighed by the tremendous benefits of having a legitimate international legal order through which, as a superpower, it could assert its will.
 As liberals see it, being a leading exponent of the rule of law internationally strengthens America's ability to pressure or bully other countries to respect the rights of their own citizens. In this way, oddly enough, the liberal view is consonant with certain aspirations of the Bush administration. In Afghanistan, Iraq and beyond, President Bush has tried to export liberal constitutionalism, including both elections and basic rights. His ''freedom agenda'' is, in fact, a direct descendant of liberal internationalism, a policy associated with Woodrow Wilson and his plans to make the world safe for democracy through the work of international institutions. 
 The Bush administration, of course, distrusts international organizations that continue in the tradition of the League of Nations, which Wilson helped to found (though he could not persuade his own country to join it). But Bush's notion that America's democratic Constitution should be an inspiration for the world is identifiably Wilsonian -- as is the zeal to spread the good word, voluntarily when possible but by force if necessary. If the greatest tragedy of the Bush presidency is the enormous human cost of America's ham-handed efforts to accomplish this worthy goal, a second, related tragedy is that the spreading of constitutional democracy is rarely talked about anymore as a liberal goal at all.
 The Court's Liberal Victory
 Each constitutional worldview -- the one conservative and inward-looking, the other liberal and outward-focused -- has found exponents on the current Supreme Court. This past spring, in two cases before the court, each side won an important victory. The larger battle, however, was widely overlooked. The liberal victory was widely publicized, but its full implications were not often noted. As for the conservative win, its very existence went almost entirely unnoticed.
 The liberal victory, in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, took place against the backdrop of the detentions of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The detainees were being held there because the Bush administration's lawyers were confident that, under the Supreme Court's precedent, the detainees would not enjoy constitutional rights. Like the Germans denied review after World War II, the detainees were noncitizens who were neither arrested nor held in the United States. Guantanamo was leased from Cuba under a 1903 treaty, so it was not in the United States, and yet there was no tradition of applying Cuban law there. 
 In light of these circumstances, the Bush administration seemed to believe it could treat Guantanamo as a law-free zone. Unlike Iraq, which the administration conceded was a war zone in which the Geneva Conventions applied, Guantanamo was initially considered legally off the grid. It is often said by liberal critics that Bush's anti-terror policies ignored the Constitution and international law. But this is a misleading oversimplification. What the choice of Guantanamo demonstrates, rather, is the profoundly legalistic way in which those policies were designed. Using the law itself, the lawyers in the Bush administration set out to make Guantanamo into a legal vacuum.
 The court's decision in Boumediene repudiated that attempt. The majority, led by Justice Kennedy, announced that for constitutional purposes, Guantanamo Bay was part of the United States: the detainees there enjoyed the same rights as if they had been held in Washington. The Boumediene decision was chiefly the accomplishment of Justice John Paul Stevens, who has made overturning the Bush detention policies into the legacy-defining task of his distinguished career. In key opinions issued in 2004 and 2006, Stevens chipped away at the special status asserted for Guantanamo, each time referring the matter of judicial review for the detainees back to Congress. But Congress repeatedly approved the administration's proposals to deny access to the courts. To win the fight even against Congress, Stevens needed Kennedy to provide the fifth vote and hold that denying the Guantanamo detainees their day in court actually violated the Constitution. 
 The opinion that Kennedy wrote for the court's majority in Boumediene announced squarely that the Constitution applied to the detainees being held in Guantanamo. Kennedy insisted that he was not overruling the precedent of the German detainees who were denied review. Unlike the situation with the Germans after World War II, he argued, the Guantanamo detainees had not received a hearing; the Guantanamo naval base was entirely under U.S. control; and granting hearings was not so impractical that it would fundamentally disrupt the operation of the prison. In effect, however, Kennedy's opinion rejected what the Bush administration claimed to be the rule that noncitizens held outside the United States were not entitled to constitutional protection.
 Having refused to overturn Roe v. Wade in the 1990s and having championed gay rights in recent years, Kennedy may now be depicted as an unlikely liberal hero -- the latest in a line of Republican appointees (one of whom is John Paul Stevens) who gradually evolved into staunch exponents of liberal rights. The key to Kennedy's reasoning in the Guantanamo case was his expansive conception of the rule of law. In the central paragraph of the decision, Kennedy explained his underlying logic: if Congress and the president had the power to take control of a territory and then determine that U.S. law does not apply there, ''it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint,'' he wrote. Government without courts, Kennedy suggested, was not constitutional government at all. ''Our basic charter,'' he went on, ''cannot be contracted away like this.''
 What seemed to most offend Kennedy about Guantanamo, then, was precisely the effort by the executive branch, with the approval of Congress, to make Guantanamo into a place beyond the reach of any law. By insisting on its own authority, the court was striking a blow for law itself. In this way, the court embraced the ideal of the outward-looking Constitution: a document that protects the rights not only of citizens within the United States but also of noncitizens outside its formal borders. This Constitution, by extension, stands for the ideal of legal justice being made available to all persons -- no matter where they might be.
 Holding that the Constitution did indeed follow the flag to Guantanamo was an act with tremendous international resonance. It can even be read as an attempt to hold the Bush administration to its own rhetoric about democracy. The rule of law, after all, is not solely an American ideal but one that is broadly shared globally. To insist that some law covers all people wherever they may be found underscores the universality that law aims to create.
 The Court's Conservative Victory
 From the conservative point of view, of course, Kennedy's decision did not follow from the basic principle of the rule of law. According to the four conservative dissenting justices, whose views closely tracked those of the Bush administration, the Constitution unquestionably binds the government. But according to their view, the Constitution also allows the president and Congress, acting together, to lease or even acquire territory and govern it without allowing recourse to the courts. Indeed, this view was precisely the one adopted by the Supreme Court after the Spanish-American War, when the United States was a rising imperial power. The dissenters in Boumediene actually agree with the liberals that law does apply to Guantanamo; they just maintain that the courts are not part of it.
 The conservative cause may have lost in Boumediene. It prevailed, however, in a case decided last March that garnered little public attention-- but that was, in its own way, just as important to defining our constitutional era. The case, Medellin v. Texas, grew from a conflict between the Supreme Court and the International Court of Justice over death-row inmates in the United States who were apparently never told they had the right to speak to the embassies of their home countries, a right guaranteed by a treaty called the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The international court declared that the violation tainted the inmates' convictions and insisted that they have their day in court to try to get them overturned. 
 The Supreme Court disagreed. In his initial trial and appeal, Jose Medellin, the man who brought the Supreme Court case, did not raise his right to speak to his embassy -- presumably because, having never been informed of the right, he had no idea that it existed. Under the arcane rules for postconviction judicial review, a defendant ordinarily cannot ask the courts to consider legal arguments that were not raised when he was tried in the first place. And in its decision, the court upheld those rules: the violation of the treaty, it held, did not demand any special exception to the usual rules governing review. The fact that the United States had violated its international-treaty obligation was of no use on death row. Medellin was executed by the State of Texas on Aug. 5. 
 What made this conflict between the Supreme Court and the International Court of Justice particularly stark was that the Bush administration had for once taken the side of international law. Before the Supreme Court issued its opinion, President Bush issued a memorandum advising state courts to follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice. With the ruling of the Supreme Court on one side, and that of the international court -- endorsed by the president -- on the other, just what did the Constitution require the state courts to do? 
 The United States signed three separate treaties stating that it undertook to obey the judgments of the International Court of Justice. But the Supreme Court bridled at the thought that the international court's decision might trump its own. This was not just instinctive turf-protection, though that concern no doubt played a part. Never before had an international body replaced the Supreme Court in telling lower courts in the United States that their own procedural rules were unacceptable. The natural order of things seemed to be turned on its head.
 The Supreme Court held that the treaties obligating us to listen to the International Court of Justice were not binding law. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that a careful reading of the text of the treaties revealed no intention to subject the United States to the judgments of the international court -- not, that is, unless Congress passed a separate statute demanding such obedience. 
 This opinion upended the rules for applying treaties in the U.S. courts. In dissent, Justice Breyer painted a grim picture of the consequences. If treaties were not automatically binding law unless they said so, he wrote, the applicability of some 70 treaties involving economic cooperation, consular relations and navigation was now thrown into doubt. The rest of the world, he intimated, would be left wondering whether the United States intended to obey its treaty obligations or not -- which is not a trivial concern when the world also suspects the United States of ignoring its obligations of humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions. To Breyer, the decision was a reversal of nearly 180 years of precedent and a message to the world that the United States was prepared to play fast and loose with its international commitments. 
 When the justices rejected the death-row appeal, they were acting on the basis of familiar conservative concerns. The judges of the International Court of Justice were not appointed according to any constitutional procedure. To let the international body decide matters of law that would be binding for state courts seemed fundamentally undemocratic -- an unjust usurpation of the judicial function. It would be absurd for the Constitution, as the core document of our democracy, to require such a result. 
 The old precedent regarding treaties was thus, according to the conservatives, truly obsolete. It made no sense to apply it in a globalized world where treaties are not just straightforward agreements between sovereign states; now, they often create irresponsible international tribunals to adjudicate their meaning. If the judgments of an international court were to be obligatory, a democratically legitimate body should say so explicitly -- either the Senate that approved the treaty promising compliance or the whole Congress in a separate legal enactment. 
 By its own lights, the Supreme Court in the Medellin case was reading the Constitution to guarantee us control over our own destiny. That meant turning away from international law in a systematic and profound sense. The cost to the United States might be real, but the court considered it justified by the preservation of our democratic sovereignty.
 Which Side Is Right?
 The Boumediene decision saw the Constitution as facing outward, expanding and promoting the rule of law throughout the world. The Medellin decision, by contrast, saw the Constitution as a domestic blueprint designed to preserve and protect the United States from foreign encroachment, even at some cost to the international rule of law. 
 Underscoring the tension between the two cases is the fact that nearly all the justices of the Supreme Court voted consistently across both of them. The four conservatives -- Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, John Roberts and Samuel Alito -- dissented from the extension of habeas corpus rights to Guantanamo Bay in Boumediene and joined the majority opinion in Medellin that made it harder for treaties to become law. Meanwhile the court's liberals -- Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer -- joined the majority in the Guantanamo case, and all but Stevens dissented in Medellin. (Though Stevens voted with the majority in that case, he did so seemingly only for tactical reasons; he wrote a separate, concurring opinion that did not embrace the logic of Roberts's majority opinion.)
 The key vote in both cases was that of Kennedy. In both cases, he acted to uphold the prerogatives of the Supreme Court -- against the president and Congress in the Guantanamo case, and against the international court in the Medellin decision. And Kennedy does argue that such judicial supremacy is crucial to the rule of law. But the other justices did not see the cases in those terms. To them, the cases were not primarily about the perennial issue of the division of powers between the different branches of government. To these eight justices, the cases were about what sort of Constitution we have: either outward-facing or inward-looking.
 Who is right? It is tempting to conclude that the Constitution must look inward and outward simultaneously. But embracing contradiction is not the answer, either. Instead what we need to resolve the present difficulty is a subtle shift in perspective.
 There is an important way in which neither of the predominant approaches to the Constitution and the international order can provide a fully satisfactory answer to the problem. Although they differ deeply about what the Constitution teaches, the two sides share a common image of what the Constitution is. Both imagine it to be a blueprint offering a coherent worldview that will allow us to reach the best results most of the time. According to this shared assumption, the way to find the real or the true Constitution is to identify the core values that the document and the precedents stand for, and to use these as principles to interpret the Constitution correctly.
 There is nothing wrong with this picture of constitutional interpretation when it is applied to the vast majority of constitutional decisions, from the right to bear arms to the meaning of equal protection of the laws. Deciding what deep principles emerge from our history can help resolve even problems unimagined by the framers, like those presented by abortion or claims to gay rights. Most of the time, constitutional interpretation proceeds in precisely this way -- and so it should.
 But when we are talking about the basic direction the country needs to face in order to achieve its goals in the modern world, deriving principles from history is often inadequate to dictate outcomes. The national and global situations in which we find ourselves are ever-changing. The ship of state must navigate in waters that correspond to no existing chart. The complexity of the world, coupled with the profound changes in the role the United States plays in it, is a very different thing from, say, our progressive recognition that African-Americans, women, gays and lesbians deserve the same equality and respect as everybody else. 
 For this reason, when the world has changed drastically, the Constitution has always had the flexibility to change along with it. The industrial economy, for example, was so much bigger and more complex than the economy of 1787 that the old constitutional order no longer worked. The New Deal ushered in systematic regulation and administrative agencies that had no real place in the three-branch system -- but that we now accept as constitutional today. The original federal system limiting the power of the central government relative to the states also had to be reconfigured when the economy became truly national. The changed nature of the president's war powers offers yet another pragmatic example of flexibility and change. Modern wars demand rapid decision-making and overwhelming concentrations of force; in the light of these needs, we have largely abandoned the framers' model for war powers, which gave Congress much more authority than it is able to exercise today.
 On each occasion that the Supreme Court has had to confront such drastically changed circumstances, it has adopted the approach of seeing constitutional government as an ongoing experiment. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that our system of government is an experiment, ''as all life is an experiment.'' Justice Robert Jackson, confronting the separation of powers -- about which the Constitution is cryptic at best -- admitted frankly that nothing in the document, the case law or the scholars' writings got him any closer to an answer. Then he tried to come up with his own rules, designed to reflect political reality and the changed nature of the presidency. 
 Looking at today's problem through the lens of our great constitutional experiment, it emerges that there is no single, enduring answer to which way the Constitution should be oriented, inward or outward. The truth is that we have had an inward- and outward-looking Constitution by turns, depending on the needs of the country and of the world. Neither the text of the Constitution, nor the history of its interpretation, nor the deep values embedded in it justify one answer rather than the other. In the face of such ambiguity, the right question is not simply in what direction does our Constitution look, but where do we need the Constitution to look right now? 
 Answering this requires the Supreme Court to think in terms not only of principle but also of policy: to weigh national and international interests; and to exercise fine judgment about how our Constitution functions and is perceived at home and abroad. The conservative and liberal approaches to legitimacy and the rule of law need to be supplemented with a healthy dose of real-world pragmatism. In effect, the fact that the Constitution affects our relations with the world requires the justices to have a foreign policy of their own.
 On the surface, it seems as if such inevitably political judgments are not the proper province of the court. If assessments of the state of the world are called for, shouldn't the court defer to the decisions of the elected president and Congress? Aren't judgments about the direction of our country the exclusive preserve of the political branches?
 Indeed, the Supreme Court does need to be limited to its proper role. But when it comes to our engagement with the world, that role involves taking a stand, not stepping aside. The reason for this is straightforward: the court is in charge of interpreting the Constitution, and the Constitution plays a major role in shaping our engagement with the rest of the world. The court therefore has no choice about whether to involve itself in the question of which direction the Constitution will face; it is now unavoidably involved. Even choosing to defer to the other branches of government amounts to a substantive stand on the question.
 That said, when the court exercises its own independent political judgment, it still does so in a distinctively legal way. For one thing, the court can act only through deciding the cases that happen to come before it, and the court is limited to using the facts and circumstances of those cases to shape a broader constitutional vision. The court also speaks in the idiom of law -- which is to say, of regular rules that apply to everyone across the board. It cannot declare, for instance, that only this or that detainee has rights. It must hold that the same rights extend to every detainee who is similarly situated. This, too, is an effective constraint on the way the court exercises its policy judgment. Indeed, it is this very regularity that gives its decisions legitimacy as the product of judicial logic and reasoning.
 Why We Need More Law, More Than Ever
 So what do we need the Constitution to do for us now? The answer, I think, is that the Constitution must be read to help us remember that while the war on terror continues, we are also still in the midst of a period of rapid globalization. An enduring lesson of the Bush years is the extreme difficulty and cost of doing things by ourselves. We need to build and rebuild alliances -- and law has historically been one of our best tools for doing so. In our present precarious situation, it would be a terrible mistake to abandon our historic position of leadership in the global spread of the rule of law. 
 Our leadership matters for reasons both universal and national. Seen from the perspective of the world, the fragmentation of power after the cold war creates new dangers of disorder that need to be mitigated by the sense of regularity and predictability that only the rule of law can provide. Terrorists need to be deterred. Failed states need to be brought under the umbrella of international organizations so they can govern themselves. And economic interdependence demands coordination, so that the collapse of one does not become the collapse of all.
 From a national perspective, our interest is less in the inherent value of advancing individual rights than in claiming that our allies are obligated to help us by virtue of legal commitments they have made. The Bush administration's lawyers often insisted that law was a tool of the weak, and that therefore as a strong nation we had no need to engage it. But this notion of ''lawfare'' as a threat to the United States is based on a misunderstanding of the very essence of how law operates. 
 Law comes into being and is sustained not because the weak demand it but because it is a tool of the powerful -- as it has been for the United States since World War II at least. The reason those with power prefer law to brute force is that it regularizes and legitimates the exercise of authority. It is easier and cheaper to get the compliance of weaker people or states by promising them rules and a fair hearing than by threatening them constantly with force. After all, if those wielding power really objected to the rule of law, they could abolish it, the way dictators and juntas have often done the world over.
 On those occasions when the weak, using the machinery of courts, are able to vindicate their legal rights, the reason their demands are honored is generally that those who have the most influence in the system recognize it is in their own long-term interest to make the concession. Those who consider law a tool of the weak mistake these rare trade-offs for defeat, when -- from the perspective of power -- they are simply part of the cost of doing business. This is why, for example, the police and prosecutors embrace the Miranda warnings: they require that defendants be read their rights. But once the formality is satisfied, it is almost guaranteed that the defendants' statements will be admissible into evidence.
 Applying the lesson that the world and the United States need law more than ever at this particular moment yields some specific conclusions. The executive branch certainly should be accorded considerable leeway in defending the nation from attacks by stateless groups like Al Qaeda. But it was an error of constitutional dimensions to choose Guantanamo as a global symbol of those efforts precisely because of the way it seemed to be outside the reach of our domestic Constitution, the law of any other country or international law itself. 
 The Supreme Court therefore was right to reinsert Guantanamo in the legal grid -- but not because this was definitively the best reading of the constitutional materials, which were contradictory and indeterminate. What justifies the decision is the practical necessity and importance of reassuring the citizens of the United States and the world at large that the United States had not given up the role it assumed after World War II as the chief proponent of the rule of law worldwide. Not every Supreme Court decision has this monumental symbolic effect -- but the Boumediene case was guaranteed to be seen as either a victory or a defeat for the very idea of law itself. In an ideal world, the Supreme Court would not have had to send this message, and it could have avoided the substantial expansion of its own power to which it was driven by the foolishness of the Bush administration.
 The Medellin case is trickier. On one hand, globalization inevitably inserts us into an ever-widening array of treaty regimes, each with its own mechanism of adjudication. There is no turning back the clock to the simpler world of the framers. Joining the World Trade Organization, as we have, or the Kyoto Protocol, as we ultimately have not, does detract from the democratic legitimacy of the laws that govern us. This lesson can be easily learned from a glance at the European Union, where countries increasingly cede sovereign authority to the bureaucrats in Brussels. Under these circumstances, there is much to be said for requiring either the treaty ceding this authority to speak explicitly, or else for Congress to make this concession expressly, in full view of the public who elects it.
 On the other hand, there is the problem of timing. Had the United States not invaded Iraq under a claim of international law that many other countries rejected, or had the Guantanamo disaster been avoided by the exercise of wiser judgment, it would be relatively easy to conclude that the Supreme Court was right to pull us back from too rapid an entrance into an international order that undercuts our sovereignty. But the treaty decision came at just the moment when the United States was trying to reassert its commitment to the rule of law internationally. The conservatives who carried the day did not care. For them, upholding international judgments that differ from our own courts' is inconsistent with our core constitutional values. The message sent, then, in the world and at home, is precisely the wrong one for this historical juncture, when the United States needs -- at least for the moment -- to convince the world that the project of international legality is one in which we believe.
 What the Election May Bring
 There are going to be many more opportunities in the coming years for the court to take a position on the Constitution and the international order. Should John McCain become president, there is good reason to believe he would be more committed than President Bush to the international rule of law. Influenced by his experience of being tortured in Vietnam, McCain has sponsored legislation requiring that U.S. government personnel comply with the Geneva requirement of humane treatment of prisoners. Yet McCain has also snubbed Justice Kennedy, promising to nominate justices like Roberts and Alito in their ideological orientation; justices of this persuasion are likely to see the Constitution in largely inward-looking terms. 
 Meanwhile, Barack Obama, with his globalized upbringing and insistence on multilateralism, could be expected, as president, to nominate justices more sympathetic to an outward-looking Constitution. But if, as seems likely, the first retirees from the court are liberals, the best Obama could hope for would be to maintain the status quo -- not to institutionalize a liberal majority for the future.
 Whichever candidate is elected, once the Bush administration is out of office, the war on terror will almost certainly be waged differently, and the constitutional issues that arise will not be exactly the same as before. Guantanamo Bay will probably be closed, and the legal team that planned it will be long gone. But most of its detainees will still have to be tried, and their appeals will reach the Supreme Court once again. Of course we will still want to catch terrorists -- especially before they act -- and we will have to figure out what to do with them when we do. No matter who is president, the United States will still find itself deeply enmeshed in the affairs of Afghanistan, even if in the next few years there are substantial troop withdrawals from Iraq. 
 At the same time, the processes of globalization have not been turned back by the war on terror. The growing global financial crisis calls for more international regulation, not less. Conflicts between U.S. courts and international tribunals about the meaning of our international obligations are going to become more and more common, just as they have become for members of the European Union. Next time, the Supreme Court may not be able to avoid conflict by asserting that the courts are not obligated to listen to the international body. When that happens, new doctrines and solutions are going to have to be developed. 
 In these all-important processes, as always in the history of the court, people are everything. Justices vary widely in temperament, ideology, intelligence and preparedness. The best justices can be really very impressive; the worst ones truly disastrous. 
 Charged with interpreting the Constitution and therefore shaping its contemporary orientation, the Supreme Court needs to be extraordinarily sensitive to the demands of history. When the court gets it wrong, the consequences can be serious. The Constitution we get will still be the one we deserve, but our deserts need not be good ones. The Constitution, let us not forget, gave us slavery and segregation. It gave us dysfunctional limitations on progressive legislation that was desperately needed in the years before the Great Depression. We like to think the Constitution is always leading us toward a more perfect union. But this has not always been the case, and as with any experiment, there is no guarantee that it will be in the future.

HEADLINE: Leaving Hollywood, Headed South, Bound for Indie

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
MOST movies set out to tell a story. Lance Hammer was after something more amorphous. He wanted to depict a tone, an atmosphere, how a place feels and how that affects the people who live there. 
 A native Californian, Mr. Hammer was driving through Tennessee one winter about 10 years ago, he said, kicking around ideas for a film. Recalling the oft-repeated assertion that the lobby of Memphis's Peabody Hotel is the northernmost point of the Mississippi Delta, he decided to head south to see the heart of that fabled alluvial plain. What he discovered when he got there -- a desolate gray-scale landscape with low skies and endless horizons -- became both the setting and the subject of his first feature, ''Ballast.''
 ''It was beautiful like the moon,'' Mr. Hammer said. ''Everything was barren and fallow and muddy. I knew then I wanted to make a film to capture that beauty and sorrow. The challenge was to make something with a fraction of the emotional experience I was having.'' 
 ''Ballast,'' which won the directing and cinematography awards at the Sundance Film Festival and opens Wednesday in New York, is shaping up as one of the most acclaimed independent films of the year, and perhaps the most emblematic. With American indie cinema suffering both an identity and an economic crisis, almost everything about ''Ballast,'' from its expressive minimalism to its regional specificity to Mr. Hammer's choice to distribute the film himself, stands as a forward-looking alternative.
 Mr. Hammer, 41, has done time in Hollywood, where he worked as an art director on studio movies. He had developed a feature to direct within the system. It was the frustrating collapse of that project a few years ago that spurred him to return to the South. He said, ''I thought to myself, 'I'll make a film invisibly and not use actors and not think about its commercial viability.' ''
 He wrote a screenplay, a period piece set in the delta, and shot some of it, but the more he learned about the region, the less qualified he felt to make a film there. ''I realized how complicated everything is: the social structures, the racial relationships, the engagement of the present with history,'' he said. ''I had no authority to speak of that, so I started over.'' 
 He decided to write about grief, which he called ''the great uniter, something that makes people drop their differences for a moment.'' A friend of his girlfriend had lost an identical twin to suicide. A surviving twin ''suffers in a way no other survivor suffers,'' he said. (His mother, he added, is an identical twin.) ''Ballast'' is set in the aftermath of a suicide, tracing the triangle of need and resentment that forms among Lawrence, the surviving twin; Marlee, the dead man's ex-wife; and James, her 12-year-old son. 
 Mr. Hammer was at first acutely aware of being an interloper, an outsider shooting in a predominantly black area. ''There was a little skepticism,'' he said. ''People assumed that a white filmmaker in the South would just be talking about civil rights or the blues.'' 
 To gain the trust of the residents Mr. Hammer discussed the project with church leaders, who helped put out the word. Looking to use local nonprofessional actors, Mr. Hammer held casting calls and approached people who matched his physical impressions of the characters. 
 ''My faith in nonactors comes from Bresson,'' Mr. Hammer said, referring to Robert Bresson, the French director who insisted on working with untrained actors. ''If they're a blank canvas, you can believe them from Frame 1.'' He also drew inspiration from other filmmakers' improvisatory methods: Mike Leigh's actor-driven workshops, Wong Kar-wai's on-the-spot screenwriting.
 While Bresson viewed his actors as models, pure vessels delivering scripted lines, Mr. Hammer encouraged his actors to take ownership of their characters. He never gave them a script and let them read a page only once or twice, so they could grasp the thrust of a scene but not memorize the lines. 
 He also filmed in sequence, keeping the actors in the dark about the progression of the story. ''It was like reading a good book,'' said Tarra Riggs, who plays Marlee, a struggling single mother. ''I never knew what kind of drama Marlee would be going through next.'' Mr. Hammer even misled Ms. Riggs and Micheal J. Smith, who plays Lawrence, about their characters' relationship. ''They came in with a built-in bias,'' he said. ''I had them fight it out while I mediated. It was almost like psychotherapy.''
 The film's intimate visual style is rooted in its commitment to capturing moment-to-moment experience. Mr. Hammer and his cinematographer, Lol Crawley, shot handheld and used available light, so they could respond to shifts in the weather and avoid constraints on the movements of the actors.
 Mr. Hammer went to architecture school at the University of Southern California, which he said was perhaps better training than film school: ''Architecture's about having faith in something unformed which you then have to manifest materially.'' 
 He has one building to his credit, an advertising agency in Redondo Beach, Calif., but was sidetracked into the movie business. His thesis work dealt with digital space, and Warner Brothers hired him to help design Gotham City in ''Batman Forever'' (1995). 
 Mr. Hammer, who calls himself an idealist, speaks of his time in Hollywood almost as a period of captivity. ''I had tremendous frustration at the end of my art-directing career justifying what I was doing,'' he said. ''Filmmakers are from a privileged class and tend to make films about themselves. That's decadent and in my opinion worthless.''
 Still, his Hollywood stint led to some useful alliances. On ''Batman Forever'' he befriended Andrew Adamson, then a visual effects artist and later the director of ''Shrek'' and ''The Chronicles of Narnia.'' Mr. Adamson introduced Mr. Hammer to the longtime producer Mark Johnson, whose recent credits include the ''Narnia'' movies. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Adamson helped Mr. Hammer find crew members and secure deals on film stock (and are credited as executive producers).
 Mr. Johnson, who usually manages budgets many times larger than what Mr. Hammer had to work with, said of ''Ballast,'' ''It's a reminder that you need so very little to make a good film.'' He added, ''His commitment was so total you had to believe in him. There's no halfway with Lance.''
 Mr. Hammer's approach has now carried over to distribution. Shortly after Sundance ''Ballast'' was acquired by IFC Films, the most active player in the increasingly bleak indie landscape. But Mr. Hammer, who made ''Ballast'' with his own money, pulled out of the deal a few months later, opting to release the film himself. 
 ''The state of the marketplace means that filmmakers now give up their film for free, and give up control over it, which is completely illogical,'' Mr. Hammer said recently. He has had to raise money for prints and advertising -- a worthwhile trade-off, he said, to retain ownership and oversee every aspect of the release. He designed the poster and edited the trailer, and, with the help of consultants and publicists, has devised a release and outreach strategy, focusing on colleges, film societies and, most important to him, Southern audiences.
 ''I think we're doing a decent job, but that's not the point,'' he said.''It's about following through. The film was made in a particular way. We're presenting it to the world in a similar way.''

HEADLINE: Malltown, U.S.A.

BYLINE: BY BENJAMIN ANASTAS

 BODY:
The Americana at Brand rises from its 15.5-acre lot in downtown Glendale, Calif., like the setting for a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. From my seat aboard the vintage-style trolley that makes a circuit around this $400 million outdoor shopping mall and residential community, I glide down what reminds me of Rodeo Drive to Rush Street in Chicago, skirt the dancing fountain in Vegas, turn onto Newbury Street in Boston and end up in New Orleans, each stop announced by the cheerful ringing of the conductor's bell. The Americana, where I'm spending a weekend, is the newly minted brainchild of the California megadeveloper Rick Caruso, the force behind the Grove in Los Angeles and a family of other open-air retail developments that turn up the design volume on the dreary shopping mall experience, past theme-park kitsch, all the way to something sublime, say, a Diamond as Big as the Ritz. 
 At the Grove, at Third and Fairfax, Caruso and his in-house team perfected their formula of marrying retail with entertainment, dining, a gently curving promenade for strolling and a world of other trademark touches like valet parking, piped-in music from the Rat Pack era and a concierge desk where shoppers can make dinner reservations or borrow an umbrella in the rare event of rain. More than just a builder with a dramatic flair and a nostalgia for small-town America, Caruso is a producer of alternative realities -- where Sinatra is still young, service employees all wear crisply tailored uniforms and the clock stops every 30 minutes, right in sync with a mesmerizing water-jet show at the fountain. And this fantasy strikes a chord with the public: more than 18 million visitors flock to the Grove every year, while sales per square foot, according to Caruso Affiliated, are 75 percent higher than the industry average.
 ''The whole idea isn't just to shop or eat or go to a movie,'' Caruso explains. The appeal of his developments, he insists, has more to do, with recovering that which is lost in Southern California's car culture -- the sense of community that comes from street life. ''There's a desperate desire to actually see people. We don't get that in L.A. When I'm in New York walking down Fifth Avenue or Madison Avenue, there's an energy to it. You feel like you're alive. On Rodeo Drive you could shoot off cannons at 6 o'clock and you wouldn't hurt anybody. The place just rolls up.'' 
 With the Americana, Caruso has upped the ante by rolling out a two-acre green as the project's centerpiece, attracting higher-end stores, including Barneys New York Co-op and Tiffany & Company, and building 238 rental apartments as well as 100 luxury condos that come with all the amenities of a five-star resort. If shopping is America's favorite pastime, then why not just move to the mall and call it home?
 The trick, of course, is to make a developer's dream dropped into the middle of an existing landscape (downtown Glendale, once a boomtown, has lately grown shabby) feel appealing enough for shoppers to put down their credit cards and even more important, for residents to put down roots. To that end, Caruso and his vice president for architecture, Dave Williams, traveled widely across the America and abroad to study how retail and residential communities interact when they've evolved together organically over time. One model that appealed to them was Newbury Street in Boston, which they used to create one of the Americana's ''neighborhoods'' along Americana Way, anchored by Barneys Co-op. The residential units, housed in a four-story building called the Lido, are set back from the shops to create a sense of openness on the street below; they feature curved balconies to please the eye, stone veneer recesses to capture shadows and a range of colors that create the illusion of separate town houses. The storefronts below are extra-tall -- 22 feet -- for curb appeal, while across the way in the neighborhood anchored by a Cheesecake Factory, they are only 18 feet high. On the stretch of Caruso Avenue that smacks of Rodeo Drive, home to tenants like Lucky Kid and Kate Spade, the storefronts are even smaller in scale.
 ''Having varying heights and not creating one consistent horizontal line is necessary to give the project a more organic feel,'' Williams says, strolling through the development on a busy Friday afternoon. ''So it looks like it was built over a period of time, much like a city street.'' Similar thought went into the Americana's elaborate, ready-made landscaping; more than 560 fully grown trees, including a 45-foot-tall California sycamore on the green, provide shade from the scorching sun, in addition to 230 mature palm trees, from Mexican fan to pygmy date. 
 Each rental complex, as well as the condo building, Excelsior, has a distinctively designed lobby that opens directly onto either the green or one of the Americana's major thoroughfares. That way, a pineapple mojito at Katsuya or a free Sunday morning yoga class on the green is a short walk for everyone. Within the buildings themselves, shared elevators and central courtyards create the familiarity that comes from everyday contact.
 ''The hope,'' Williams says, ''is that residents will start to feel like they're part of the neighborhood by getting to know their neighbors -- that way they'll stay longer. The residences are driven by this whole idea of 'arriving home.' I'm not just going back to my apartment; I'm going home. There's a subtle difference.''
 It's one thing to arrive at home and quite another to come home every day to the Caruso lifestyle. My home at the Americana for the weekend is a two-bedroom model apartment in a rental building called the Marc, outfitted with a coffee maker, a refrigerator stocked with small-batch soft drinks and, best of all, three balconies overlooking the green where I start my mornings sipping coffee, and watching the sprinklers come alive and the workers filtering in from the outside world. With the first song of the day bursting from the outdoor P.A. system (appropriately, ''Can't Buy Me Love''), I head down to Caffe Primo for breakfast, guessing that the dearth of shoppers is explained by an early-summer heat wave. By midafternoon, however, the trolley is packed, a critical mass has gathered around the fountain to cool off in the spray, and the terrace at the Cheesecake Factory is filled with enervated shoppers eating sundaes and slices of the chain's most famous menu item.
 In the evening, with those balcony views, it's easy to appreciate the extravagant dream behind the Americana at Brand. The avenues are full of young, old and everyone in between. The gas lanterns flicker in the dark. The air is full of murmuring and laughter as people filter out of the Pacific Theaters multiplex and into the night. And when the fountain comes to life for Louis Armstrong's ''What a Wonderful World,'' I think of Fitzgerald's observation that America is ''a willingness of the heart.'' The Americana at Brand is not for everyone, and it may take an economic miracle to sustain its current level of surface polish. But there is no denying the power of Caruso's lavishly constructed fantasy of home, even if it never feels true to life.

HEADLINE: Profile in Style: Ilse Crawford

BYLINE: BY CHRISTINE MUHLKE

 BODY:
A CREATIONIST
 Ilse Crawford has proved that there is life after magazines. In 1989, she introduced British Elle Decoration, making it an international decorating bible with its livable mix of modern furniture and personal funk. In 1998, she left to work for Donna Karan, soon moving on to designing interiors, including her London loft -- where she lives with her husband, the Colombian-born creative director Oscar Pena -- followed by Soho House in New York. ''Whether you're making something for 2- or 3-D,'' she says, ''you're still making something. It doesn't feel any different'' designing outside the pages. ''And it lasts longer!'' Her work doesn't have a signature style but rather a signature feeling: emotional and deeply rooted to the place. It's summed up in the way she describes her favorite winter destination, Cartagena, Colombia: ''It's incredibly alive.'' 
 INTERIOR MOTIVES
 Crawford strives to infuse design -- in both the visible and physical sense -- with what she calls emotional values. She's more focused on life than on style, she says: ''When I look at making spaces, I don't just look at the visual. I'm much more interested in the sensory thing, in thinking about it from the human context, the primal perspective, the thing that touches you.'' She's also attuned to how quality affects life on an everyday basis. For example, she made a conscious decision to have her studio near the Borough Market, London's excellent greenmarket, so that her employees could cook and eat beautiful local food together. And for decades, her favorite piece of music has been Glenn Gould's ''Well-Tempered Clavier'': how can so much feeling come from just one instrument? ''It's not the thing,'' she concludes. ''It's what you do with it.''
 A FINGER IN EVERY POT
 Studioilse, Crawford's London office, has its hands on every facet of the design world. She especially enjoys redefining existing spaces like the Olde Bell Inn and the Crown Inn: ''I love the idea of the inn: warm, affordable, indecisive and connected to good food.'' Her fondness for great chairs can be seen in the Olde Bell's dining room, which showcases seating by the English designer Matthew Hilton. ''Local chairs, local cheese,'' she explains. Crawford has also taken to designing objects, like tables, mirrored furniture and a sustainable lamp. She writes, she curates, she is head of the department of Man and Well-being at the Design Academy Eindhoven (where her husband also teaches), and she rejuvenates brands like Swarovski crystal, with whom she masterminded the first Crystal Palace chandelier collection. Currently on the studio's inspiration board: Soho Beach House Miami.

HEADLINE: From Free Markets to $4 Gas

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein is a contributor to The Times Magazine. His latest book is ''While America Aged: How Pension Debts Ruined General Motors, Stopped the NYC Subways, Bankrupted San Diego, and Loom as the Next Financial Crisis.''

 BODY:
THE PREDATOR STATE
 How Conservatives Abandoned the Free Market and Why Liberals Should Too
 By James K. Galbraith
 221 pp. Free Press. $25
 As markets tumble and prices soar, and especially as the wages of ordinary workers lag inflation, the free-market dogmas that have governed the country over the last generation are increasingly under fire. If markets are so good, how come we're paying almost $4 for gas? If private enterprise does the work of the angels, what happened to all the good jobs? 
 Comes now James K. Galbraith, an economist at the University of Texas, to denounce and, he hopes, to refute just about everything you thought was true about the virtues of private markets. In ''The Predator State'' Galbraith argues that the Reagan revolution and all that followed was essentially a fraud. What remains of it? Nothing. Who still believes in it? Outside academia: no one. 
 Galbraith says Reaganism was founded on three policies: deregulation, monetarism and low taxes. He declares that the first was an artifice so that lobbyists could extract ''more money from those who can afford to pay -- and sometimes from those who cannot.'' 
 Monetarism (the tactic used, successfully, by the Federal Reserve in the 1980s to nip inflation) he depicts as a tool to kill off labor unions and elevate the power of Wall Street. And low taxes failed to achieve their supposed purpose -- encouraging saving. They were merely a sop to the wealthy. 
 The author, whose prose is reminiscent of that of his famous father, John Kenneth Galbraith, is as wickedly biting as he is over the top. He writes, ''It is fair to say that there will never again be any U.S. government for which a truly principled conservative might work.'' Fair to say? How about biased, vengeful and short-sighted to say? 
 I have a sneaky feeling Galbraith would take those fighting words as a compliment. He admits this is a ''personal'' work, since the conservative tide ''devalued my Keynesian education, obstructed my career and deprived me and my few comrades on Capitol Hill of purchase on the levers of power.'' He mourns the assault on his father's legacy. (Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning monetarist most responsible for toppling Galbraith from a revered place in the economist's pantheon, is likened to George Wallace. Yes, that George Wallace.) 
 Touching as his filial devotion is, Galbraith seems to believe we are still living in an economic ecosystem dominated by industrial behemoths -- which is to say, the world described in the elder Galbraith's 1967 masterpiece, ''The New Industrial State.'' When he observes of C.E.O.'s, citing Veblen, that their ''wives and servants are therefore fed and decorated to reflect the stature of their masters,'' he is dialing back to the 1950s, or maybe to the '20s. 
 Still, the gusto with which he repeatedly challenges tired conventions is refreshing. Did inflation really go up in the '70s because the Fed printed too much money -- or as Galbraith says, did big companies, big unions, and OPEC simply have too much pricing power? Does too much employment really lead to inflation, as conservatives tell us -- or is the very notion absurd? And if low taxes haven't promoted savings, Galbraith asks, why not raise them? 
 Galbraith delights in tweaking conservatives, but some of his surest arrows are aimed at liberals, whom he charges with cowering in a ''protective crouch.'' As a Keynesian, Galbraith does honor to deficit spending; he harpoons liberals for adopting the ideal of balanced budgets just when the right has abandoned it. Budget balancers are ''not merely parroting conservatives,'' he says; ''they are parroting dead conservatives.'' And he debunks the liberal approach to trade protection, which is often to insist that developing nations agree to reforms in their home economies. ''You cannot impose a wage standard on China or Vietnam,'' Galbraith points out. But you can do it at home. 
 Aiming, he says, ''to free up the liberal mind,'' he fearlessly endorses long since abandoned, and now generally discredited, liberal policies, from price controls to state planning. ''You want higher wages?'' he asks. ''Raise them. You want more and better jobs? Create them.'' 
 There is much in this book that strikes me as wrong. Most C.E.O.'s are neither ''functionaries'' nor are they ''idle.'' It is not true that the market never ferrets out scandal; Enron was spotted by hedge funds and undone by short-sellers. Hurricane Katrina exposed a failure not of markets but of government. And contrary to Galbraith, economic freedom as interpreted by market proponents is more than just ''the freedom to shop.'' 
 He writes so well, you have to pinch yourself to remember that, yes, the free market has produced robust growth and central planning has usually failed. Galbraith acknowledges that the United States has mostly enjoyed prosperity in recent years; his glib explanation is that hold-over New Deal institutions (government mortgage agencies, subsidized health care, student loans) have come to the rescue of misguided conservative policies. In other words, if it works, it's the residue of Franklin Roosevelt and Galbraith's dad; if it fails, it's the market's fault. That seemed preposterous when I first read it; but in the wake of the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when all of Wall Street could be headed for a bailout, one wonders. 
 Galbraith admits neither ambiguity nor doubt; indeed, his prose is absolutist in proportion to the extent to which his assertions are unprovable. For Galbraith, the market as its apostles describe it does not really exist. It is a ''vaporous'' idea, a ''cosmic and ethereal space,'' a ''negation,'' a ''nonstate.'' Finally, it is ''another god that failed.'' This is brilliant rhetoric. It is not brilliant economics, but give him his due: He has raised trenchant questions about a system in crisis.

HEADLINE: Ballpark's Echoes Endure

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Ron Swoboda is back at Shea Stadium for the weekend, nearly 39 years since he made one of the great catches in World Series history. 
 The catch, against the Orioles, shows up on videos all over the Internet -- a frantic man tumbling on the green grass of right field in the sunlight, making a backhand grab inches off the ground, undoubtedly saving the game for the Mets.
 There are a lot of memories in Shea Stadium, many bitter and many sweet -- the essence of this very human franchise. On a dank final Saturday, Johan Santana delivered one of the greatest clutch pitching performances in Mets history, a three-hit, 2-0 shutout of Florida, which kept the Mets alive. Santana kept postseason hopes alive by making sure the Mets did not have to resort to a bullpen that is a soul mate to the 1962 team, which won exactly 40 of 160 games. 
 Next April, Shea will be replaced by the handsome new stadium taking form behind the outfield walls. 
 People are coming from all over to pay respects, including a friend of the Swoboda family, Haruko Hasumi, who came all the way from Tokyo. When she walked down from the No. 7 elevated station, she started to cry.
 Swoboda, joined by his wife, Cecilia, and their two grown sons, came in from New Orleans, admitting to a major case of nostalgia for Shea, not so much for the seats and the girders and the ramps, but for the name itself. 
 ''I knew Bill Shea,'' Swoboda said in a husky voice, thinking of the lawyer who forced baseball to give New York back its National League identity, in 1962, at the ancient Polo Grounds. ''I sat next to Bill Shea at some games. Without him, maybe there is no team.''
 Next year, there is no Shea Stadium, at least officially. The new place, modern but with references to Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, will be named for a bank that has not vanished during this worldwide financial crisis, at least not yet. Some of us just may call it the New Shea.
 Mets fans come from far and wide -- including Japan. Hasumi started out as a baseball fan by seeing the Orioles during their tour of Japan in 1971, when she was 11. Later she became a fan of Nolan Ryan, a former Met, and in 1991, she saw his seventh and last no-hitter during one of her many trips to North America. 
 Two years later, she met Swoboda, who was working for a New Orleans television station and accompanied the football Saints to a preseason game at the Tokyo Dome. 
 Hasumi has since visited the Swobodas in New Orleans, and also Ron's family home in Baltimore. It was there that Swoboda's father, a tail gunner over Japan during World War II, discussed aerial maneuvers with Hasumi, whose parents had lived through the war.
 ''Can you imagine?'' Swoboda said Friday night, shaking his head that the world has come this far, that old friends from opposite ends of the globe can reunite in an obsolete ballpark in Queens.
 As Swoboda stood outside, fans of a certain age greeted him and said he was their favorite Met. His headstrong personality drove Casey Stengel and Gil Hodges a little nuts at times, but he captivated the growing legion of Mets fans. 
 Swoboda's signature moment (that is, aside from getting his foot stuck in a batting helmet during a moment of dugout petulance) came during that crazy time, Oct. 15, 1969, with antiwar demonstrators observing Moratorium Day by singing John Lennon's ''Give Peace a Chance.'' Tom Seaver had a 1-0 lead, on Donn Clendenon's homer, going into the ninth. But Frank Robinson and Boog Powell hit singles, and with one out and Frank Robinson on third, Brooks Robinson slashed a sinking line drive to right.
 Never the most graceful of fielders, Swoboda came thundering in, backhanding the ball before it could sink to the ground. His hat went flying as he tumbled a full 360 degrees, but he raised his glove, the ball still inside.
 The tying run scored, of course, but another run or two might have scored if the ball had gotten through. The Mets won in the 10th on a disputed play, and some people think his catch was even more important than Tommie Agee's two brilliant catches the day before. 
 Standing outside Shea on Friday night, Swoboda was asked about the catch. 
 ''First of all, without all those other guys, I'm just an average player and I'm not doing card shows,'' he said. Then he added: ''I had a lot of trouble in Shea at first. I was used to the lower stands in the minor leagues and had trouble seeing the ball here. But Eddie Yost took a fungo bat and hit the ball at me from 150 feet, and I finally figured out some things,'' he continued, referring to a Mets coach, without whom there was no catch, no card shows.
 Hasumi said she and her mother often looked at the video of Swoboda's catch, and every time they cheered. Perhaps the play will show up on the message board in the closing hours of Shea. 
 On Sunday, the Mets will observe the final regular-season game at Shea with a ceremony involving Tom Seaver, Willie Mays, Mike Piazza and nearly 40 other former Mets, including Swoboda. Old Shea soon becomes a parking lot, but the Mets should paint a marker over the spot where a young man tumbled on the grass 39 years ago during the crazy times.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths RUTHERFORD, G. WILLIAMS

 BODY:
RUTHERFORD--G. Williams, October 5, 1920 August 31, 2008. Born October 5, 1920, to Greta and Williams Rutherford in Deming, New Mexico, Mr. Rutherford spent his younger years moving throughout the West, attending high school at New Mexico Military Institute. He moved to San Diego in 1941, having completed training at Art Center in Pasadena as a photographer. During World War II, he worked for Consairways as a celestial navigator delivering planes from San Diego to the troops in the South Pacific. In 1943 he married Anna Gwyn Foster Dearing of Coronado, California. 
After the War, Mr. Rutherford attended Stanford University, completing an AB in Economics and Accounting (Phi Beta Kappa) and a JD from the Stanford Law School. He joined Ryan Aeronautical, San Diego, in the legal department, but was almost immediately promoted to Assistant Controller, and then Manager of the newly formed Electronics Division. Over the next 20 years, Mr. Rutherford took on increasingly complex management responsibility. By 1969, when Teledyne acquired Ryan Aeronautical, Mr. Rutherford was appointed Vice President and Group Executive of Teledyne Inc., responsible for up to 25 companies of the Teledyne Pacific Group. At his retirement in 1989, this sector of Teledyne produced sales of $1.4 billion from its aerospace, electronics and heavy manufacturing companies. Those who worked with him believed Mr. Rutherford to be a pioneer in the art of group management a brilliant, creative and imaginative businessman who could coordinate disparate companies and produce profitable results year after year. He was wellknown for his commitment to the people who worked for him, and was admired as a leader, a teacher, and an innovator. Many businessmen and women around the world considered Bill Rutherford their mentor and friend. His creative approach to problem solving, and his vision of excellence inspired all who had the privilege of his company. As a lifelong Episcopalian, Mr. Rutherford brought his considerable management talent and passion to the Church. He served on boards of schools and vestries of churches, always encouraging those in leadership positions to step out in faith. Mr. Rutherford is survived by his son, Dr. George Williams Rutherford III of Piedmont, CA, his daughter, the Rev. Amanda Rutherford May of San Diego, his step-daughter, Mrs. Alexandra Waits of El Cajon, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, Anna Gwyn Rutherford died in 2004, and his son Timothy Christopher Rutherford died in 2007. A Celebration of Mr. Rutherfords Life will be held at 3pm on Sunday, October 5, 2008, at All Souls Episcopal Church in San Diego. A reception will follow with an exhibit of Mr. Rutherfords collection of photographs, A Room with a View originally shown for his 70th birthday. Donations can be made to the G. Williams Rutherford Scholarship at New Mexico Military Institute or to the scholarship funds of the Stanford Law School, The Bishops School, or Church Divinity School of the Pacific.

HEADLINE: Breakthrough Reached on Bailout

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders and the Bush administration reached a tentative agreement early Sunday on what may become the largest financial bailout in American history, authorizing the Treasury to purchase $700 billion in troubled debt from ailing firms in an extraordinary intervention to prevent widespread economic collapse.
Officials said that Congressional staff members would work through the night to finalize the language of the agreement and draft a bill, and that the bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote on Monday.
The bill includes pay limits for some executives whose firms seek help, aides said. And it requires the government to use its new role as owner of distressed mortgage-backed securities to make more aggressive efforts to prevent home foreclosures.
In some cases, the government would receive an equity stake in companies that seek aid, allowing taxpayers to profit should the rescue plan work and the private firms flourish in the months and years ahead. 
The White House also agreed to strict oversight of the program by a Congressional panel and conflict-of-interest rules for firms hired by the Treasury to help run the program.
The administration had initially requested virtually unfettered authority to operate the bailout program. But as they moved toward clinching a deal, both sides appeared to have given up a number of contentious proposals, including a change in the bankruptcy laws sought by some Democrats to give judges the authority to modify the terms of first mortgages.
Congressional leaders and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. emerged from behind closed doors to announce the tentative agreement at 12:30 a.m. Sunday, after two days of marathon meetings.
''We have made great progress toward a deal, which will work and be effective in the marketplace,'' Mr. Paulson said at a news conference in Statuary Hall in the Capitol.
In the final hours of negotiations, Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois and Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, carried pages of the bill by hand, back and forth, from Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, where the Democrats were encamped, to Mr. Paulson and other Republicans in the offices of Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader.
At the same time, a series of phone calls was taking place, including conversations between Ms. Pelosi and President Bush; between Mr. Paulson and the two presidential candidates, Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama; and between the candidates and top lawmakers.
''All of this was done in a way to insulate Main Street and everyday Americans from the crisis on Wall Street,'' Ms. Pelosi said at the news conference. ''We have to commit it to paper so we can formally agree, but I want to congratulate all of the negotiators for the great work they have done.''
In a statement, Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said: ''We're pleased with the progress tonight and appreciate the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.''
A senior administration official who participated in the talks said the deal was effectively done. ''I know of no unresolved open issues for principals,'' the official said.
In announcing a tentative agreement, lawmakers and the administration achieved their goal of sending a reassuring message ahead of Monday's opening of the Asian financial markets.
Lawmakers, especially in the House, are also eager to adjourn and return home for the fall campaign season.
Among the last sticking points was an unexpected and bitter fight over how to pay for any losses that taxpayers may experience after distressed debt has been purchased and resold.
Democrats had pushed for a fee on securities transactions, essentially a tax on financial firms, saying it was fitting that they contribute to the cost.
In the end, lawmakers and the administration opted to leave the decision to the next president, who must present a proposal to Congress to pay for any losses.
Officials said they had also agreed to include a proposal by House Republicans that gives the Treasury secretary an additional option of issuing government insurance for troubled financial instruments as a way of reducing the amount of taxpayer money spent up front on the rescue effort.
The Treasury would be required to create the insurance program, officials said, but not necessarily to use it. Mr. Paulson had expressed little interest in that plan, and initial cost projections suggested it would be enormously expensive. But final details were not immediately available.
Saturday's intense negotiating effort followed a tumultuous week, including a contentious meeting at the White House with President Bush and the two presidential candidates.
That meeting had moments of drama, including a blunt warning by President Bush. ''If money isn't loosened up, this sucker could go down,'' he said. It ended with angry recriminations after House Republicans scotched a near-agreement from earlier in the day.
Mr. Paulson scrambled to revive the talks, and they resumed almost immediately. Congressional and Treasury staff then worked all of Friday and through the night, ending in the predawn.
Mr. Paulson and Congressional leaders stepped in at 3 p.m. Saturday and were in direct negotiations for most of the rest of the night. And immediately after the news conference, staff members began efforts to finalize the language.
Even then, their work is hardly over.
Congressional leaders who want the bailout to pass with solid bipartisan support had already begun to anxiously court votes, mindful of the difficulty they could face in a high-stakes election year.
Public opinion polls show the bailout plan to be deeply unpopular. Conservative Republicans have denounced the plan as an affront to free market capitalism, while some liberal Democrats criticize it as a giveaway to Wall Street.
Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chief negotiator for House Republicans, who have been among the most reluctant to support the plan, expressed some satisfaction but did not commit his members' support.
''We need to look and see where we are on paper tomorrow,'' Mr. Blunt said. ''We have been talking about how we can make these things work in a way that our conference can come together.''
Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the lead negotiator for the House Democrats, said that there was no expectation of making anyone smile.
''This was never going to be a bill that was going to make people happy,'' he said. ''No solution to a problem can be more elegant than the problem itself. We are dealing with a very difficult problem.''
''Given the dimensions of the problem, I believe we have done a good job,'' he added. ''It includes genuine compromises.''
Aides described a tense meeting on Saturday afternoon that included Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, shouting at Mr. Paulson about executive pay caps.
Outside, stunned tourists visiting the Capitol watched as camera operators shoved one another to get footage of lawmakers talking outside of the meeting room.
At one point, when too much information was leaking out, staff members' BlackBerrys were confiscated and collected in a trash bin.
While Congressional Republicans sent only their chief negotiators, Mr. Blunt and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, at least nine Democrats with competing priorities piled into the meeting, surprising the Republicans but apparently not unsettling them.
The centerpiece of the rescue effort remains the plan for the government to buy up to $700 billion in troubled assets from financial firms as a way to free their balance sheets of bad debts and to help restore a healthy flow of credit through the economy.
The money will disbursed in parts, with an initial $250 billion to get the rescue effort under way, followed by another $100 billion upon a report by Mr. Bush to Congress.
The president could then request the balance of $350 billion at any time. If Congress disapproved, it would have to act within 15 days to deny the Treasury the money.
Early in the day, the two presidential nominees were active from the sidelines. Mr. McCain telephoned Congressional Republicans to sound them out, and Mr. Obama got regular updates by phone from Mr. Paulson and top lawmakers.
Some lawmakers have made clear that they will not vote for the bailout plan under virtually any terms. ''I didn't want to be in the negotiations because I object to the basic principles of this,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee, who would normally be his party's point man.
Pressed about his role, Mr. Shelby replied, ''My position is 'No.' ''
Officials, including Mr. Bush, stepped up efforts to sell the plan to the American public, which, according to opinion polls, is deeply skeptical.
''The rescue effort we're negotiating is not aimed at Wall Street; it is aimed at your street,'' Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address. ''There is now widespread agreement on the major principles. We must free up the flow of credit to consumers and businesses by reducing the risk posed by troubled assets.''
In a brief speech on the Senate floor, Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said: ''It's not just going to be Wall Street. The chairman of the Federal Reserve has told us if the credit lockup continues, three million to four million Americans will lose their jobs in the next six months.''
The ultimate cost of the rescue plan to taxpayers is virtually impossible to know. Because the government would be buying assets of value -- potentially worth much more than the government will pay for them -- there is even a chance the rescue effort would eventually return a profit.
Some Democrats had sought to direct 20 percent of any such profits to help create affordable housing, but Republicans opposed that and demanded that all profits be returned to the Treasury.

OXFORD, Miss. -- The presidential campaigns roared out of here Saturday morning facing a task arguably as difficult, and as important, as the debate between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain itself: influencing the public perception of who won an encounter that produced no clear winner or loser.
It is a perennial battle, but rarely has it seemed more important than this year, with both candidates facing a restless electorate and locked in a tight battle that could be altered by the perceptions set by the debates.
To this end, the Obama campaign worked overnight to release, in the early morning, an advertisement criticizing Mr. McCain for failing to utter the words ''middle class.'' It was unclear whether Mr. Obama's campaign was spending a lot of money to broadcast the spot, or whether it was directed more at the opinion leaders who would be appearing on the Sunday morning talk shows or writing about the debate in their columns for the next few days. 
For its part, the McCain campaign had already released an Internet video citing several instances in which Mr. Obama had said he agreed with his rival's positions, a talking point that began to emerge even as the debate was going on here Friday night.
The activity was part of an intensive battle to shape public perceptions in the vital closing weeks of a razor-thin race. And it reflected a common belief in presidential politics: That many viewers base their judgment not necessarily on debate performance but on what they read and see in the days afterward.
On Saturday, Mr. McCain flew home to Northern Virginia and made phone calls from his campaign headquarters in Arlington in an effort to push along a deal on the financial bailout, as he tried to show himself as a leader in times of crisis.
Mr. McCain, of Arizona, gave his own opinion on his performance Friday night. Speaking to Representative Charles W. Pickering Jr., Republican of Mississippi, he was recorded by a television crew as saying, ''I was a little disappointed the media called it a tie, but I think that means when they call it a tie that means we win.''
Mr. Obama returned to the campaign trail in North Carolina, where he stuck to the campaign's post-debate theme. ''He didn't even say the words 'middle class,' '' said Mr. Obama, of Illinois. ''He didn't say the words 'working people.' ''
Even as they sought to mold perceptions from the previous night, the campaigns were embarking on a similar public relations exercise in preparation for the next two debates, one Thursday between Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, and the other between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama in a town-hall-style setting on Oct 7.
Speaking with reporters on a conference call Saturday morning, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe, called Ms. Palin ''a gifted debater.'' Noting Mr. McCain's preference for town hall formats, and using the transparent, expectations-setting hyperbole common for both campaigns, Mr. Plouffe said he would be ''thrilled'' if ''we can just escape relatively unscathed.''
Mr. McCain's campaign, meanwhile, sent out a series of e-mail messages attacking Mr. Biden, and released a new advertisement citing Mr. Biden's disagreement with Mr. Obama on a war financing bill during the Democratic primary battle.
To the criticism that Mr. McCain had not said the words ''middle class'' in the debate, his aides countered that Mr. Obama had not used the word ''victory'' in reference to Iraq.
The positioning was in keeping with what is now a quadrennial rite, in which campaigns go full-bore to convince the news media, and ultimately the public, that their candidate won -- or more than that, to argue that a debate spotlighted some sort of character or issue defect in their opponent. This often involves highlighting some supposedly fatal mistake by their opponent: Al Gore's sighs in a 2000 debate, President George Bush's peek at his wristwatch while debating Bill Clinton in 1992.
In this case, Mr. McCain's campaign seized on a reference Mr. Obama made to a bracelet he had received from the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq. Mr. McCain had just spoken about one given to him, and saying he had one, too, Mr. Obama appeared to pause momentarily when mentioning the soldier's name, Sgt. Ryan David Jopek. Mr. McCain's aides sought to portray this as a gaffe.
The Obama campaign tried to seize on Mr. McCain's attacks and frequently serious demeanor to portray him as angry. They said he had not exercised the courtesy of even returning Mr. Obama's gaze, suggesting that he was being disrespectful or condescending to his rival.
While such criticisms may seem, on first glance, trivial, they are the kind of issues -- as the sighing Mr. Gore and the watch-checking Mr. Bush can attest -- that can catch fire and influence public perception. They can also put a candidate off guard for the next debate.
But the general sense was that the debate had not changed the static landscape of the overall campaign. An anchor on the Fox News Channel went so far as to tell a guest, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, ''They could have used you on the debate last night.'' Mr. Huckabee had won high marks for quips in the Republican primary debates.
Both campaigns emerged Saturday morning with what they presented as evidence of their successes, including competing declarations of victory from various commentators and editorial boards. Mr. Obama appeared to have an edge in the various snap polls taken the night of the debate, though these are notoriously unreliable.
For both campaigns, the effort to frame perceptions involves not just boring down on the minutiae of the debate performances but also trying to advance an overall narrative of the race.
On Saturday, Mr. Obama's aides declared that he had passed a threshold test: convincing a huge national audience that he could be commander in chief. They also said he had exceeded expectations on delivering his economic message to struggling Americans.
Mr. McCain's campaign argued that Mr. Obama had failed to allay voters' concerns about his qualifications. They expressed pride in the frequency with which Mr. McCain told Mr. Obama he did not ''understand'' various international matters.
''It was a very tough debate, but I don't think our candidate went over the line,'' said Mr. McCain's closest adviser, Mark Salter, adding that he ''stayed on offense in a respectful way.''
The war over shaping the post-debate narrative got off to an exceptionally early start, beginning, in fact, even before the event occurred.
Mr. McCain's campaign actually declared victory as early as 10 a.m. Friday, hours before the debate took place and even before he had agreed to take part in it. In what aides said was a mix-up, The Wall Street Journal posted an advertisement on its Web site 12 hours early that showed Mr. McCain proudly looking into the distance. ''McCain Wins Debate!'' read the text.
A reader of The Washington Post spotted it and alerted one of the paper's blogs, The Fix, which posted it before the red-faced McCain campaign removed it.
It was an embarrassing, yet telling, false start to the most important battle to shape perceptions of the election year so far, one pitting sophisticated war rooms against each another in an all-out effort to harness an increasingly fractured new media.
''This is the Super Bowl,'' said Mr. McCain's national spokesman, Tucker Bounds.
''We will be looking to accentuate the key turning-point moments to emphasize our points,'' Mr. Bounds added in an interview before the debate.
Mr. Bounds believed he had found one in Mr. Obama's reference to the soldier's bracelet, writing in an e-mail message later, '' 'Bracelet,' is the moment.'' A YouTube clip followed minutes later.
Similarly, Mr. Obama's aides seized upon the fact that Mr. McCain had not used the words ''middle class,'' highlighting it for reporters in talking points, interviews, their advertisement and in Mr. Obama's campaign appearance Saturday.
But by midday Saturday, neither story line was getting big play on television; a communications expert on ''Today'' on NBC even gave Mr. Obama credit for his reference to the bracelet.
Focus groups on CNN and the Fox News Channel included negative references to what viewers considered Mr. McCain's testiness. Mr. Obama was declared the winner by the Fox group.
''He cared about the average person,'' one participant said. Yet Mr. McCain got high marks from others. ''I do think John McCain came out on top,'' Nina Easton of Fortune magazine said on Fox News.
Aides to both men said they knew there was, ultimately, only so much they could do to shape perceptions.
''In the end, there's always going to be a settling back down to reality,'' said Mr. Obama's communications director, Dan Pfeiffer.

HEADLINE: House Supports India Nuclear Trade Deal

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives on Saturday approved an agreement to end the three-decade ban on nuclear trade with India, and Congressional leaders were optimistic about its passage in the Senate. 
 The agreement passed the House by a 298-117 vote, and the Democrats who control the Senate hoped to bring it to a vote there within days despite the opposition of some in their own party, Congressional aides said.
 Congressional approval is the last hurdle to the pact, which the Bush administration believes will secure a strategic partnership with India, the world's largest democracy; help India meet its rising energy demand; and open up a market worth billions.
 President Bush said in a statement that House passage of the legislation was ''another major step forward in achieving the transformation of the U.S.-India relationship.''
 He urged the Senate to approve it quickly so he could sign it into law.
 Critics argue that the deal undermines efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and sets a precedent allowing other nations to seek to buy such technology without submitting to the full range of global nonproliferation safeguards.
 The agreement, which first had to gain approval from the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group before coming to Congress, has drawn criticism from nonproliferation advocates because India has shunned the Nonproliferation Treaty meant to stop the spread and production of nuclear weapons, as well as a companion international pact banning nuclear tests.
 The Nuclear Suppliers Group regulates the sale of nuclear fuel. It approved the deal this month after a campaign by the United States and despite concerns about setting off an arms race in Asia.
 The deal is considered important for India's continued economic growth and increased demand for electricity. Since it conducted its first nuclear test decades ago, India has not been able to buy nuclear fuel or technology on the world market. 
 The country is now running short of uranium for existing nuclear reactors because it does not have enough of a domestic supply to feed them. India's leaders also want to substantially expand the civilian power program. 
 But even in India, the deal was dogged by intense political opposition, so much so that opponents of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sought to bring down his government this year over this issue, saying it would impinge on India's right to advance its strategic weapons program. 
 In the United States Senate, a vote has been held up by the objections of some Democrats, said Congressional aides who declined to name those blocking a vote.
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, urged his colleagues to drop their resistance, noting that under special rules for consideration of the nuclear deal it can ultimately be brought to a vote.
 ''For people who are concerned about the Indian nuclear agreement, and there are several senators that have concerns about that, all we would be doing is running out the time,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sound, But No Fury

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: OXFORD, Miss. 

 BODY:
 The first debate seemed like the perfect moment for Barack Obama to re-enact the Code Red courtroom scene from ''A Few Good Men,'' to slide under John McCain's skin and irritate until he goaded McCain into doing exactly what he really wanted to do: tell off the whippersnapper who'd never bled for his country.
 It would have been easy for smarty-pants Obama to get in the face of the temperamental older guy, just as Tom Cruise did with Jack Nicholson, to push him into erupting into some version of that climactic speech, like, ''Deep down, in places you don't talk about at your fancy faculty club, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall.'' 
 The timing was ideal. McCain was so aggressively erratic as he did his free-form break dance around the economy last week that it seemed the only possible explanation was that he was creating a wild diversion to distract people from Sarah Palin's stunningly junior varsity appearance with Katie Couric.
 Once Garbo began to speak, and people realized that Palin had a few key lacunae in her understanding of the globe and even of her running mate's record, the myth of the Alaska superwoman continued to unravel.
 Between her nonsensical answers and his complicity in the deregulation that led to the financial catastrophe, he felt he needed to take another crazy gamble.
 So he theatrically suspended his campaign and rushed back to get in the way of a bipartisan solution to the economic turmoil. When the two macho guys of the Republican Party -- W. and McCain -- took extreme measures not to look emasculated, they ended up emasculating themselves.
 The president, who is so insecure that he could only choose a vice president he knew would never hold his title, and so insecure that he needs proof of presidency emblazoned everywhere, even riding a Trek bike with the presidential seal affixed, was suddenly faced with his bete noire: sitting at a table in the White House with the two men who want his job, either of whom would do a better job, given that nearly everyone in the country thinks things are going horribly.
 McCain lost control of his campaign and then, in a gimmicky attempt to gain back ground, ended up in the Cabinet Room with W. when the bipartisan economic meeting collapsed in a humiliating nondeal, causing President Bush to lose control of his White House.
 It was quite a memorable moment in history for the M.B.A. president and the nominee of the party of business. Who would have dreamed that when socialism finally came to the U.S.A. it would be brought not by Bolsheviks in blue jeans but Wall Street bankers in Gucci loafers?
 The Republicans had a lot to answer for. The Bush administration had been warned about Osama bin Laden attacking and did nothing. It had been warned that there would be a civil war and insurgency if it attacked Iraq. It had been warned that Katrina was coming. It had been warned that the country's financial casinos were courting disaster. 
 W. biked through all those eves of destruction.
 Given the past week, the debate should have been a cinch for Obama. But, just as in the primaries, he willfully refuses to accept what debates are about. It's not a lecture hall; it's a joust. It's not how cerebral you are. It's how visceral you are. You need memorable, sharp, forceful and witty lines.
 Even when McCain sneered, ''I don't need any on-the-job training, I'm ready to go at it right now,'' Obama didn't directly respond, but veered off into a story about his father being from Kenya and how he got his name. (Thanks, Barack, we got that from your book. It's great for a memoir, but not a debate.)
 McCain kept painting Obama as naive, and dangerous, insisting that he ''doesn't quite understand or doesn't get it.''
 Obama should have responded ''Senator, I understand perfectly, I'm just saying you're wrong.''
 On the surge, he could have said that McCain was the arsonist who wanted to be praised for the great job he's doing putting out the fire he started.
 When Obama took quiet umbrage at McCain's attack about troop-funding, he could have pounded the lectern and said with real anger: ''John, I am sick and tired of you suggesting that I would take funds away from our brave soldiers. I no more voted for that than you did when you voted against our funding proposals that would have imposed a timetable. And unlike you, I did not vote against funding increases for the troops that have come home with devastating physical and mental injuries.''
 And who cares what Henry Kissinger thinks? He was wrong 35 years ago, and it's only gotten worse since then.
 Obama did a poor job of getting under McCain's skin. Or maybe McCain did an exceptional job of not letting Obama get under his skin. McCain nattered about earmarks and Obama ran out of gas.
 We're left waiting for a knockout debate. On to Palin-Biden.

HEADLINE: Those Other Guys on the Street

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Big investment banks and their legions of seven-figure financiers may be history. But there is still plenty of fast money to be made on Wall Street for those with the stomach for risk.
 On Wednesday evening, the same night President Bush warned in a televised address of a ''long and painful recession'' unless Congress acted quickly to prevent a financial catastrophe, John Paulson was speaking at a dinner for fellow hedge-fund titans at the St. Regis, the landmark Beaux-Arts hotel on Manhattan's East Side. 
 Mr. Paulson had put in some time in the 1990s at Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed earlier this year. But he got his start at a small hedge fund and eventually left Bear to start his own because, he explained, hedge funds are ''where the money is.'' 
 Today his fund manages some $30 billion. Last year, betting against mortgage-backed securities, he made $3.7 billion, probably the richest bounty in Wall Street history. It made even Lloyd C. Blankfein's $70 million paycheck last year for running the investment bank Goldman Sachs look, well, kind of puny.
 As Mr. Paulson (no relation to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.) discovered, you don't have to work at one of the big investment banks to make money on Wall Street. And that is why the seven-figure bonuses and $250 lunches at San Pietro in Midtown aren't going away anytime soon, though Goldman Sachs and Wall Street's other big investment bank, Morgan Stanley, have agreed to transform themselves into less adventurous -- and less profitable -- bank holding companies in order to survive.
 With the demise of those banks, the private equity firms and the largely unregulated $2 trillion hedge fund industry remain the places on Wall Street where outsize risks can reap outsize returns -- or losses.
 They also appear positioned to become even more powerful economic forces. Both have grown exponentially in recent years. But how powerful they become is likely to depend on at least two factors -- how they emerge from the carnage on Wall Street, and whether government regulators decide to rein in their risk-taking. 
 The players include firms like Mr. Paulson's Paulson & Company, and the Citadel Investment Group, founded by Kenneth C. Griffin, who went from trading bonds out of his Harvard dorm room to building one of the nation's most powerful hedge funds, with billions in capital. The firm, based in Chicago, doesn't just buy and sell stocks. It's already a mini-investment bank: it has an enormous stock loan department, ranks as one of the largest options market makers in the industry, owns several reinsurance companies and even provides administration services to other hedge funds. It is sometimes called the next Goldman Sachs.
 Likewise, private equity firms, like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., are increasingly playing the role of both investor -- their traditional role -- and banker. Blackstone has transformed itself into a full-service asset manager and investment banking franchise. The company doesn't underwrite corporate or municipal offerings or make markets -- at least not yet -- but it does run a hedge fund, invest in other hedge funds, and buy and sell both real estate and debt. It also advises corporate clients and recently served as an adviser to American International Group, the troubled insurance giant, as it came under government control earlier this month in an $85 billion bailout.
 Kohlberg Kravis, whose hostile takeover of RJR Nabisco was chronicled in the book ''Barbarians at the Gate,'' is planning to go public and recently received a securities broker-dealer license, which is required for the firm to facilitate the sale of securities.
 The hedge funds and private equity firms have not been immune to Wall Street troubles. But for the moment, at least, they are not suffering nearly as badly as the big investment banks -- in part, because they generally are smaller (and they would claim, better at managing risk). And before the markets turned, some had raised huge sums that will help see them through the downturn. Blackstone, for example, manages some $119.4 billion.
 Still, the average hedge fund lost more than 4 percent this year, according to Hedge Fund Research, putting the industry on course for its worst year on record. Blackstone, meanwhile, has seen its share price plummet since it went public last year, and several other big firms have shelved plans for public offerings because of gyrations in the market. How their investments fare will depend on the economy.
 The possibility of regulation also looms. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently imposed a temporary ban on short sales of financial stocks, which has hurt hedge funds that have made vast profits betting against financial firms. And a leading House Democrat, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has called for new oversight of the nation's major financial players, including hedge funds.
 Felix Rohatyn, the legendary financier, said he foresees the day when ''private equity firms will morph into the Merrills and Lehmans.''
 And that's where trouble could begin again. ''The question is whether they will have the incentive to inflate their balance sheet'' by taking ever bigger risks, said William J. Wilhelm Jr., an investment banking expert at the University of Virginia.
 ''I expect they will.''

HEADLINE: McCain's Suspension Bridge to Nowhere

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WHAT we learned last week is that the man who always puts his ''country first'' will take the country down with him if that's what it takes to get to the White House.
 For all the focus on Friday night's deadlocked debate, it still can't obscure what preceded it: When John McCain gratuitously parachuted into Washington on Thursday, he didn't care if his grandstanding might precipitate an even deeper economic collapse. All he cared about was whether he might save his campaign. George Bush put more deliberation into invading Iraq than McCain did into his own reckless invasion of the delicate Congressional negotiations on the bailout plan.
 By the time he arrived, there already was a bipartisan agreement in principle. It collapsed hours later at the meeting convened by the president in the Cabinet Room. Rather than help try to resuscitate Wall Street's bloodied bulls, McCain was determined to be the bull in Washington's legislative china shop, running around town and playing both sides of his divided party against Congress's middle. Once others eventually forged a path out of the wreckage, he'd inflate, if not outright fictionalize, his own role in cleaning up the mess his mischief helped make. Or so he hoped, until his ignominious retreat. 
 The question is why would a man who forever advertises his own honor toy so selfishly with our national interest at a time of crisis. I'll leave any physiological explanations to gerontologists -- if they can get hold of his complete medical records -- and any armchair psychoanalysis to the sundry McCain press acolytes who have sorrowfully tried to rationalize his erratic behavior this year. The other answers, all putting politics first, can be found by examining the 24 hours before he decided to ''suspend'' campaigning and swoop down on the Capitol to save America from the Sunnis or the Shia, or whoever perpetrated all those credit-default swaps.
 To put these 24 hours in context, you must remember that McCain not only knows little about the economy but that he has not previously expressed any urgency about its meltdown. It was on Sept. 15 -- the day after his former idol Alan Greenspan pronounced the current crisis a ''once-in-a-century'' catastrophe -- that McCain reaffirmed for the umpteenth time that the ''fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' As recently as Tuesday he had not yet even read the two-and-a-half-page bailout proposal first circulated by Hank Paulson last weekend. ''I have not had a chance to see it in writing,'' he explained. (Maybe he was waiting for it to arrive by Western Union instead of PDF.)
 Then came Black Wednesday -- not for the stock market, which was holding steady in anticipation of Washington action, but for McCain. As the widely accepted narrative has it, his come-to-Jesus moment arrived that morning, when he awoke to discover that Barack Obama had surged ahead by nine percentage points in the Washington Post/ABC News poll. The McCain campaign hastily suited up its own pollster to belittle that finding -- only to be drowned out by a fusillade of new polls from Fox News, Marist and CNN/Time, each with numbers closer to Post/ABC than not. Obama was rising most everywhere except the moose strongholds of Alaska and Montana.
 That was not the only bad news raining down on McCain. His camp knew what Katie Couric had in the can from her interview with Sarah Palin. The first excerpt was to be broadcast by CBS that night, and it had to be upstaged fast.
 But even that wasn't the top political threat McCain faced last week. Bigger still was the mounting evidence of the seamless synergy between his campaign and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage monsters at the heart of the housing bust that set off our current calamity. Most of all, it was the fast-moving events on that front that precipitated his panic to roll out his diversionary, over-the-top theatrics on Wednesday.
 What we were learning -- through The New York Times, Newsweek and Roll Call -- was ugly. Davis Manafort, the lobbying firm owned by McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, had received $15,000 a month from Freddie Mac from late 2005 until last month. This was in addition to the $30,000 a month that Davis was paid from 2000 to 2005 by the so-called Homeownership Alliance, an advocacy organization that he headed and that was financed by Freddie and Fannie to fight regulation.
 The McCain campaign tried to pre-emptively deflect such revelations by reviving the old Rove trick of accusing your opponent of your own biggest failings. It ran attack ads about Obama's own links to the mortgage giants. But neither of the former Freddie-Fannie executives vilified in those ads, Franklin Raines and James Johnson, had worked at those companies lately or are currently associated with the Obama campaign. (Raines never worked for the campaign at all.) By contrast, Davis is the tip of the Freddie-Fannie-McCain iceberg. McCain's senior adviser, his campaign's vice chairman, his Congressional liaison and the reported head of his White House transition team all either made fortunes from recent Freddie-Fannie lobbying or were players in firms that did.
 By Wednesday, the McCain campaign's latest tactic for countering this news -- attacking the press, especially The Times -- was paying diminishing returns. Davis abruptly canceled his scheduled appearance that day at a weekly reporters' lunch sponsored by The Christian Science Monitor, escaping any further questions by pleading that he had to hit the campaign trail. (He turned up at the ''21'' Club in New York that night, wining and dining McCain fund-raisers.) 
 It's then that Angry Old Ironsides McCain suddenly emerged to bark that our financial distress was ''the greatest crisis we've faced, clearly, since World War II'' -- even greater than the Russia-Georgia conflict, which in August he had called the ''first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war.'' Campaigns, debates and no doubt Bristol Palin's nuptials had to be suspended immediately so he could ride to the rescue, with Joe Lieberman as his Robin.
 Yet even as he huffed and puffed about being a ''leader,'' McCain took no action and felt no urgency. As his Congressional colleagues worked tirelessly in Washington, he malingered in New York. He checked out the suffering on Main Street (or perhaps High Street) by conferring with Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, the Hillary-turned-McCain supporter best known for her fabulous London digs and her diatribes against Obama's elitism. McCain also found time to have a well-publicized chat with one of those celebrities he so disdains, Bono, and to give a self-promoting public speech at the Clinton Global Initiative.
 There was no suspension of his campaign. His surrogates and ads remained on television. Huffington Post bloggers, working the phones, couldn't find a single McCain campaign office that had gone on hiatus. This ''suspension'' ruse was an exact replay of McCain's self-righteous ''suspension'' of the G.O.P. convention as Hurricane Gustav arrived on Labor Day. ''We will put aside our political hats and put on our American hats,'' he declared then, solemnly pledging that conventioneers would help those in need. But as anyone in the Twin Cities could see, the assembled put on their party hats instead, piling into the lobbyists' bacchanals earlier than scheduled, albeit on the down-low.
 Much of the press paid lip service to McCain's new ''suspension'' as it had to its prototype. In truth, the only campaign activity McCain did drop was a Wednesday evening taping with David Letterman. Don't mess with Dave. Picking up where the ''The View'' left off in speaking truth to power, the uncharacteristically furious host hammered the absent McCain on and off for 40 minutes, repeatedly observing that the cancellation ''didn't smell right.'' 
 In a journalistic coup de grace worthy of ''60 Minutes,'' Letterman went on to unmask his no-show guest as a liar. McCain had phoned himself that afternoon to say he was ''getting on a plane immediately'' to deal with the grave situation in Washington, Letterman told the audience. Then he showed video of McCain being touched up by a makeup artist while awaiting an interview by Couric that same evening at another CBS studio in New York. 
 It's not hard to guess why McCain had blown off Letterman for Couric at the last minute. The McCain campaign's high anxiety about the disastrous Couric-Palin sit-down was skyrocketing as advance excerpts flooded the Internet. By offering his own interview to Couric for the same night, McCain hoped (in vain) to dilute Palin's primacy on the ''CBS Evening News.'' 
 Letterman's most mordant laughs on Wednesday came when he riffed about McCain's campaign ''suspension'': ''Do you suspend your campaign? No, because that makes me think maybe there will be other things down the road, like if he's in the White House, he might just suspend being president. I mean, we've got a guy like that now!''
 That's no joke. Bush has so little credibility he can govern only through surrogates (Paulson is the new Petraeus). When he spoke about the economic crisis in prime time earlier that same night, he registered as no more than an irritating speed bump en route to ''David Blaine: Dive of Death.'' 
 It's that utter power vacuum that gave McCain the opening to pull his potentially catastrophic display of economic ''leadership'' last week. He may be the first presidential candidate in our history to risk wrecking the country even before being voted into the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: Behind Biggest Insurer's Crisis, A Blind Eye to a Web of Risk

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
''It is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions.''
-- Joseph J. Cassano, a former A.I.G. executive, August 2007
Two weeks ago, the nation's most powerful regulators and bankers huddled in the Lower Manhattan fortress that is the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, desperately trying to stave off disaster.
As the group, led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., pondered the collapse of one of America's oldest investment banks, Lehman Brothers, a more dangerous threat emerged: American International Group, the world's largest insurer, was teetering. A.I.G. needed billions of dollars to right itself and had suddenly begged for help. 
One of the Wall Street chief executives participating in the meeting was Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Paulson's former firm. Mr. Blankfein had particular reason for concern.
Although it was not widely known, Goldman, a Wall Street stalwart that had seemed immune to its rivals' woes, was A.I.G.'s largest trading partner, according to six people close to the insurer who requested anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. A collapse of the insurer threatened to leave a hole of as much as $20 billion in Goldman's side, several of these people said.
Days later, federal officials, who had let Lehman die and initially balked at tossing a lifeline to A.I.G., ended up bailing out the insurer for $85 billion.
Their message was simple: Lehman was expendable. But if A.I.G. unspooled, so could some of the mightiest enterprises in the world.
A Goldman spokesman said in an interview that the firm was never imperiled by A.I.G.'s troubles and that Mr. Blankfein participated in the Fed discussions to safeguard the entire financial system, not his firm's own interests.
Yet an exploration of A.I.G.'s demise and its relationships with firms like Goldman offers important insights into the mystifying, virally connected -- and astonishingly fragile -- financial world that began to implode in recent weeks.
Although America's housing collapse is often cited as having caused the crisis, the system was vulnerable because of intricate financial contracts known as credit derivatives, which insure debt holders against default. They are fashioned privately and beyond the ken of regulators -- sometimes even beyond the understanding of executives peddling them.
Originally intended to diminish risk and spread prosperity, these inventions instead magnified the impact of bad mortgages like the ones that felled Bear Stearns and Lehman and now threaten the entire economy.
In the case of A.I.G., the virus exploded from a freewheeling little 377-person unit in London, and flourished in a climate of opulent pay, lax oversight and blind faith in financial risk models. It nearly decimated one of the world's most admired companies, a seemingly sturdy insurer with a trillion-dollar balance sheet, 116,000 employees and operations in 130 countries.
''It is beyond shocking that this small operation could blow up the holding company,'' said Robert Arvanitis, chief executive of Risk Finance Advisors in Westport, Conn. ''They found a quick way to make a fast buck on derivatives based on A.I.G.'s solid credit rating and strong balance sheet. But it all got out of control.''
The London Office
The insurance giant's London unit was known as A.I.G. Financial Products, or A.I.G.F.P. It was run with almost complete autonomy, and with an iron hand, by Joseph J. Cassano, according to current and former A.I.G. employees.
A onetime executive with Drexel Burnham Lambert -- the investment bank made famous in the 1980s by the junk bond king Michael R. Milken, who later pleaded guilty to six felony charges -- Mr. Cassano helped start the London unit in 1987.
The unit became profitable enough that analysts considered Mr. Cassano a dark horse candidate to succeed Maurice R. Greenberg, the longtime chief executive who shaped A.I.G. in his own image until he was ousted amid an accounting scandal three years ago.
But last February, Mr. Cassano resigned after the London unit began bleeding money and auditors raised questions about how the unit valued its holdings. By Sept. 15, the unit's troubles forced a major downgrade in A.I.G.'s debt rating, requiring the company to post roughly $15 billion in additional collateral -- which then prompted the federal rescue.
Mr. Cassano, 53, lives in a handsome, three-story town house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood of London, just around the corner from Harrods department store on a quiet square with a private garden.
He did not respond to interview requests left at his home and with his lawyer. An A.I.G. spokesman also declined to comment.
At A.I.G., Mr. Cassano found himself ensconced in a behemoth that had a long and storied history of deftly juggling risks. It insured people and properties against natural disasters and death, offered sophisticated asset management services and did so reliably and with bravado on many continents. Even now, its insurance subsidiaries are financially strong.
When Mr. Cassano first waded into the derivatives market, his biggest business was selling so-called plain vanilla products like interest rate swaps. Such swaps allow participants to bet on the direction of interest rates and, in theory, insulate themselves from unforeseen financial events.
Ten years ago, a ''watershed'' moment changed the profile of the derivatives that Mr. Cassano traded, according to a transcript of comments he made at an industry event last year. Derivatives specialists from J. P. Morgan, a leading bank that had many dealings with Mr. Cassano's unit, came calling with a novel idea.
Morgan proposed the following: A.I.G. should try writing insurance on packages of debt known as ''collateralized debt obligations.'' C.D.O.'s. were pools of loans sliced into tranches and sold to investors based on the credit quality of the underlying securities.
The proposal meant that the London unit was essentially agreeing to provide insurance to financial institutions holding C.D.O.'s and other debts in case they defaulted -- in much the same way some homeowners are required to buy mortgage insurance to protect lenders in case the borrowers cannot pay back their loans.
Under the terms of the insurance derivatives that the London unit underwrote, customers paid a premium to insure their debt for a period of time, usually four or five years, according to the company. Many European banks, for instance, paid A.I.G. to insure bonds that they held in their portfolios.
Because the underlying debt securities -- mostly corporate issues and a smattering of mortgage securities -- carried blue-chip ratings, A.I.G. Financial Products was happy to book income in exchange for providing insurance. After all, Mr. Cassano and his colleagues apparently assumed, they would never have to pay any claims.
Since A.I.G. itself was a highly rated company, it did not have to post collateral on the insurance it wrote, analysts said. That made the contracts all the more profitable.
These insurance products were known as ''credit default swaps,'' or C.D.S.'s in Wall Street argot, and the London unit used them to turn itself into a cash register.
The unit's revenue rose to $3.26 billion in 2005 from $737 million in 1999. Operating income at the unit also grew, rising to 17.5 percent of A.I.G.'s overall operating income in 2005, compared with 4.2 percent in 1999.
Profit margins on the business were enormous. In 2002, operating income was 44 percent of revenue; in 2005, it reached 83 percent.
Mr. Cassano and his colleagues minted tidy fortunes during these high-cotton years. Since 2001, compensation at the small unit ranged from $423 million to $616 million each year, according to corporate filings. That meant that on average each person in the unit made more than $1 million a year.
In fact, compensation expenses took a large percentage of the unit's revenue. In lean years it was 33 percent; in fatter ones 46 percent. Over all, A.I.G. Financial Products paid its employees $3.56 billion during the last seven years.
The London unit's reach was also vast. While clients and counterparties remain closely guarded secrets in the derivatives trade, Mr. Cassano talked publicly about how proud he was of his customer list.
At the 2007 conference he noted that his company worked with a ''global swath'' of top-notch entities that included ''banks and investment banks, pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, hedge funds, money managers, high-net-worth individuals, municipalities and sovereigns and supranationals.''
Of course, as this intricate skein expanded over the years, it meant that the participants were linked to one another by contracts that existed for the most part inside the financial world's version of a black box.
Goldman Sachs was a member of A.I.G.'s derivatives club, according to people familiar with the operation. It was a customer of A.I.G.'s credit insurance and also acted as an intermediary for trades between A.I.G. and its other clients.
Few knew of Goldman's exposure to A.I.G. When the insurer's flameout became public, David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, assured analysts on Sept. 16 that his firm's exposure was ''immaterial,'' a view that the company reiterated in an interview.
Later that same day, the government announced its two-year, $85 billion loan to A.I.G., offering it a chance to sell its assets in an orderly fashion and theoretically repay taxpayers for their trouble. The plan saved the insurer's trading partners but decimated its shareholders.
Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, declined to detail how badly hurt his firm might have been had A.I.G. collapsed two weeks ago. He disputed the calculation that Goldman had $20 billion worth of risk tied to A.I.G., saying the figure failed to account for collateral and hedges that Goldman deployed to reduce its risk.
Regarding Mr. Blankfein's presence at the Fed during talks about an A.I.G. bailout, he said: ''I think it would be a mistake to read into it that he was there because of our own interests. We were engaged because of the implications to the entire system.''
Mr. van Praag declined to comment on what communications, if any, took place between Mr. Blankfein and the Treasury secretary, Mr. Paulson, during the bailout discussions.
A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment about the A.I.G. rescue and Goldman's role. The government recently allowed Goldman to change its regulatory status to help bolster its finances amid the market turmoil.
An Executive's Optimism
Regardless of Goldman's exposure, by last year, A.I.G. Financial Products' portfolio of credit default swaps stood at roughly $500 billion. It was generating as much as $250 million a year in income on insurance premiums, Mr. Cassano told investors.
Because it was not an insurance company, A.I.G. Financial Products did not have to report to state insurance regulators. But for the last four years, the London-based unit's operations, whose trades were routed through Banque A.I.G., a French institution, were reviewed routinely by an American regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision.
A handful of the agency's officials were always on the scene at an A.I.G. Financial Products branch office in Connecticut, but it is unclear whether they raised any red flags. Their reports are not made public and a spokeswoman would not provide details.
For his part, Mr. Cassano apparently was not worried that his unit had taken on more than it could handle. In an August 2007 conference call with analysts, he described the credit default swaps as almost a sure thing.
''It is hard to get this message across, but these are very much handpicked,'' he assured those on the phone.
Just a few months later, however, the credit crisis deepened. A.I.G. Financial Products began to choke on losses -- though they were only on paper.
In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2007, A.I.G. recognized a $352 million unrealized loss on the credit default swap portfolio.
Because the London unit was set up as a bank and not an insurer, and because of the way its derivatives contracts were written, it had to put up collateral to its trading partners when the value of the underlying securities they had insured declined. Any obligations that the unit could not pay had to be met by its corporate parent.
So began A.I.G.'s downward spiral as it, its clients, its trading partners and other companies were swept into the drowning pool set in motion by the housing downturn.
Mortgage foreclosures set off questions about the quality of debts across the entire credit spectrum. When the value of other debts sagged, calls for collateral on the securities issued by the credit default swaps sideswiped A.I.G. Financial Products and its legendary, sprawling parent.
Yet throughout much of 2007, the unit maintained that its risk assessments were reliable and its portfolios conservative. Last fall, however, the methods that A.I.G. used to value its derivatives portfolio began to come under fire from trading partners.
In February, A.I.G.'s auditors identified problems in the firm's swaps accounting. Then, three months ago, regulators and federal prosecutors said they were investigating the insurer's accounting.
This was not the first time A.I.G. Financial Products had run afoul of authorities. In 2004, without admitting or denying accusations that it helped clients improperly burnish their financial statements, A.I.G. paid $126 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement to settle federal civil and criminal investigations.
The settlement was a black mark on A.I.G.'s reputation and, according to analysts, distressed Mr. Greenberg, who still ran the company at the time. Still, as Mr. Cassano later told investors, the case caused A.I.G. to improve its risk management and establish a committee to maintain quality control.
''That's a committee that I sit on, along with many of the senior managers at A.I.G., and we look at a whole variety of transactions that come in to make sure that they are maintaining the quality that we need to,'' Mr. Cassano told them. ''And so I think the things that have been put in at our level and the things that have been put in at the parent level will ensure that there won't be any of those kinds of mistakes again.''
At the end of A.I.G.'s most recent quarter, the London unit's losses reached $25 billion.
As those losses mounted, and A.I.G.'s once formidable stock price plunged, it became harder for the insurer to survive -- imperiling other companies that did business with it and leading it to stun the Federal Reserve gathering two weeks ago with a plea for help.
Mr. Greenberg, who has seen the value of his personal A.I.G. holdings decline by more than $5 billion this year, dumped five million shares late last week. A lawyer for Mr. Greenberg did not return a phone call seeking comment.
For his part, Mr. Cassano has departed from a company that is a far cry from what it was a year ago when he spoke confidently at the analyst conference.
''We're sitting on a great balance sheet, a strong investment portfolio and a global trading platform where we can take advantage of the market in any variety of places,'' he said then. ''The question for us is, where in the capital markets can we gain the best opportunity, the best execution for the business acumen that sits in our shop?''
The Reckoning: Articles in this series will explore the causes of the financial crisis.
Correction: September 30, 2008, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the financial problems of American International Group referred incorrectly to the timing and participants at meetings at the New York Federal Reserve between Saturday, Sept. 13, and Monday, Sept. 15. Although there were indeed meetings that weekend, there was also a separate meeting on Monday to discuss financial aid for A.I.G. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, was the only Wall Street chief executive who attended the Monday meeting, not the only chief executive who attended weekend meetings. Also, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, did not lead or attend the Monday meeting. (Both Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Paulson did attend the weekend meetings.)

HEADLINE: For McCain and Team, a Host Of Ties to Gambling Industry

BYLINE: By JO BECKER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.; Kitty Bennett and Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator John McCain was on a roll. In a room reserved for high-stakes gamblers at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut, he tossed $100 chips around a hot craps table. When the marathon session ended around 2:30 a.m., the Arizona senator and his entourage emerged with thousands of dollars in winnings.
A lifelong gambler, Mr. McCain takes risks, both on and off the craps table. He was throwing dice that night not long after his failed 2000 presidential bid, in which he was skewered by the Republican Party's evangelical base, opponents of gambling. Mr. McCain was betting at a casino he oversaw as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and he was doing so with the lobbyist who represents that casino, according to three associates of Mr. McCain.
The visit had been arranged by the lobbyist, Scott Reed, who works for the Mashantucket Pequot, a tribe that has contributed heavily to Mr. McCain's campaigns and built Foxwoods into the world's second-largest casino. Joining them was Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's current campaign manager. Their night of good fortune epitomized not just Mr. McCain's affection for gambling, but also the close relationship he has built with the gambling industry and its lobbyists during his 25-year career in Congress. 
As a two-time chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. McCain has done more than any other member of Congress to shape the laws governing America's casinos, helping to transform the once-sleepy Indian gambling business into a $26-billion-a-year behemoth with 423 casinos across the country. He has won praise as a champion of economic development and self-governance on reservations.
''One of the founding fathers of Indian gaming'' is what Steven Light, a University of North Dakota professor and a leading Indian gambling expert, called Mr. McCain.
As factions of the ferociously competitive gambling industry have vied for an edge, they have found it advantageous to cultivate a relationship with Mr. McCain or hire someone who has one, according to an examination based on more than 70 interviews and thousands of pages of documents.
Mr. McCain portrays himself as a Washington maverick unswayed by special interests, referring recently to lobbyists as ''birds of prey.'' Yet in his current campaign, more than 40 fund-raisers and top advisers have lobbied or worked for an array of gambling interests -- including tribal and Las Vegas casinos, lottery companies and online poker purveyors.
When rules being considered by Congress threatened a California tribe's planned casino in 2005, Mr. McCain helped spare the tribe. Its lobbyist, who had no prior experience in the gambling industry, had a nearly 20-year friendship with Mr. McCain.
In Connecticut that year, when a tribe was looking to open the state's third casino, staff members on the Indian Affairs Committee provided guidance to lobbyists representing those fighting the casino, e-mail messages and interviews show. The proposed casino, which would have cut into the Pequots' market share, was opposed by Mr. McCain's colleagues in Connecticut.
Mr. McCain declined to be interviewed. In written answers to questions, his campaign staff said he was ''justifiably proud'' of his record on regulating Indian gambling. ''Senator McCain has taken positions on policy issues because he believed they are in the public interest,'' the campaign said.
Mr. McCain's spokesman, Tucker Bounds, would not discuss the senator's night of gambling at Foxwoods, saying: ''Your paper has repeatedly attempted to insinuate impropriety on the part of Senator McCain where none exists -- and it reveals that your publication is desperately willing to gamble away what little credibility it still has.''
Over his career, Mr. McCain has taken on special interests, like big tobacco, and angered the capital's powerbrokers by promoting campaign finance reform and pushing to limit gifts that lobbyists can shower on lawmakers. On occasion, he has crossed the gambling industry on issues like regulating slot machines.
Perhaps no episode burnished Mr. McCain's image as a reformer more than his stewardship three years ago of the Congressional investigation into Jack Abramoff, the disgraced Republican Indian gambling lobbyist who became a national symbol of the pay-to-play culture in Washington. The senator's leadership during the scandal set the stage for the most sweeping overhaul of lobbying laws since Watergate.
''I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes,'' the senator said in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination this month.
But interviews and records show that lobbyists and political operatives in Mr. McCain's inner circle played a behind-the-scenes role in bringing Mr. Abramoff's misdeeds to Mr. McCain's attention -- and then cashed in on the resulting investigation. The senator's longtime chief political strategist, for example, was paid $100,000 over four months as a consultant to one tribe caught up in the inquiry, records show.
Mr. McCain's campaign said the senator acted solely to protect American Indians, even though the inquiry posed ''grave risk to his political interests.''
As public opposition to tribal casinos has grown in recent years, Mr. McCain has distanced himself from Indian gambling, Congressional and American Indian officials said.
But he has rarely wavered in his loyalty to Las Vegas, where he counts casino executives among his close friends and most prolific fund-raisers. ''Beyond just his support for gaming, Nevada supports John McCain because he's one of us, a Westerner at heart,'' said Sig Rogich, a Nevada Republican kingmaker who raised nearly $2 million for Mr. McCain at an event at his home in June.
Only six members of Congress have received more money from the gambling industry than Mr. McCain, and five hail from the casino hubs of Nevada and New Jersey, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics dating back to 1989. In the presidential race, Senator Barack Obama has also received money from the industry; Mr. McCain has raised almost twice as much.
In May 2007, as Mr. McCain's presidential bid was floundering, he spent a weekend at the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas strip. A fund-raiser hosted by J. Terrence Lanni, the casino's top executive and a longtime friend of the senator, raised $400,000 for his campaign. Afterward, Mr. McCain attended a boxing match and hit the craps tables.
For much of his adult life, Mr. McCain has gambled as often as once a month, friends and associates said, traveling to Las Vegas for weekend betting marathons. Former senior campaign officials said they worried about Mr. McCain's patronage of casinos, given the power he wields over the industry. The officials, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity.
''We were always concerned about appearances,'' one former official said. ''If you go around saying that appearances matter, then they matter.''
The former official said he would tell Mr. McCain: ''Do we really have to go to a casino? I don't think it's a good idea. The base doesn't like it. It doesn't look good. And good things don't happen in casinos at midnight.''
''You worry too much,'' Mr. McCain would respond, the official said.
A Record of Support
In one of their last conversations, Representative Morris K. Udall, Arizona's powerful Democrat, whose devotion to American Indian causes was legendary, implored his friend Mr. McCain to carry on his legacy.
''Don't forget the Indians,'' Mr. Udall, who died in 1998, told Mr. McCain in a directive that the senator has recounted to others.
More than a decade earlier, Mr. Udall had persuaded Mr. McCain to join the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. Mr. McCain, whose home state has the third-highest Indian population, eloquently decried the ''grinding poverty'' that gripped many reservations.
The two men helped write the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 after the Supreme Court found that states had virtually no right to control wagering on reservations. The legislation provided a framework for the oversight and growth of Indian casinos: In 1988, Indian gambling represented less than 1 percent of the nation's gambling revenues; today it captures more than one third.
On the Senate floor after the bill's passage, Mr. McCain said he personally opposed Indian gambling, but when impoverished communities ''are faced with only one option for economic development, and that is to set up gambling on their reservations, then I cannot disapprove.''
In 1994, Mr. McCain pushed an amendment that enabled dozens of additional tribes to win federal recognition and open casinos. And in 1998, Mr. McCain fought a Senate effort to rein in the boom.
He also voted twice in the last decade to give casinos tax breaks estimated to cost the government more than $326 million over a dozen years.
The first tax break benefited the industry in Las Vegas, one of a number of ways Mr. McCain has helped nontribal casinos. Mr. Lanni, the MGM Mirage chief executive, said that an unsuccessful bid by the senator to ban wagering on college sports in Nevada was the only time he could recall Mr. McCain opposing Las Vegas. ''I can't think of any other issue,'' Mr. Lanni said.
The second tax break helped tribal casinos like Foxwoods and was pushed by Scott Reed, the Pequots' lobbyist.
Mr. McCain had gotten to know Mr. Reed during Senator Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, which Mr. Reed managed. Four years later, when Mr. McCain ran for president, Mr. Reed recommended he hire his close friend and protege, Rick Davis, to manage that campaign.
During his 2000 primary race against George W. Bush, Mr. McCain promoted his record of helping Indian Country, telling reporters on a campaign swing that he had provided critical support to ''the Pequot, now the proud owners of the largest casino in the world.''
But Mr. McCain's record on Indian gambling was fast becoming a difficult issue for him in the primary. Bush supporters like Gov. John Engler of Michigan lambasted Mr. McCain for his ''close ties to Indian gambling.''
A decade after Mr. McCain co-authored the Indian gambling act, the political tides had turned. Tribal casinos, which were growing at a blazing pace, had become increasingly unpopular around the country for reasons as varied as morality and traffic.
Then came the biggest lobbying scandal to shake Washington.
Behind an Inquiry
At a September 2004 hearing of the Indian Affairs Committee, Mr. McCain described Jack Abramoff as one of the most brazen in a long line of crooks to cheat American Indians. ''It began with the sale of Manhattan, and has continued ever since,'' he said. ''What sets this tale apart, what makes it truly extraordinary, is the extent and degree of the apparent exploitation and deceit.''
Over the next two years, Mr. McCain helped uncover a breathtaking lobbying scandal -- Mr. Abramoff and a partner bilked six tribes of $66 million -- that showcased the senator's willingness to risk the wrath of his own party to expose wrongdoing. But interviews and documents show that Mr. McCain and a circle of allies -- lobbyists, lawyers and senior strategists -- also seized on the case for its opportunities.
For McCain-connected lobbyists who were rivals of Mr. Abramoff, the scandal presented a chance to crush a competitor. For senior McCain advisers, the inquiry allowed them to collect fees from the very Indians that Mr. Abramoff had ripped off. And the investigation enabled Mr. McCain to confront political enemies who helped defeat him in his 2000 presidential run while polishing his maverick image.
The Abramoff saga started in early 2003 when members of two tribes began questioning Mr. Abramoff's astronomical fees. Over the next year, they leaked information to local newspapers, but it took the hiring of lobbyists who were competitors of Mr. Abramoff to get the attention of Mr. McCain's committee.
Bernie Sprague, who led the effort by one of the tribes, the Saginaw Chippewas in Michigan, hired a Democratic lobbyist who recommended that the tribe retain Scott Reed, the Republican lobbyist, to push for an investigation.
Mr. Reed had boasted to other lobbyists of his access to Mr. McCain, three close associates said. Mr. Reed ''pretty much had open access to John from 2000 to at least the end of 2006,'' one aide said.
Lobbyist disclosure forms show that Mr. Reed went to work for the Saginaw Chippewa on Feb. 15, 2004, charging the tribe $56,000 over a year. Mr. Abramoff had tried to steal the Pequots and another tribal client from Mr. Reed, and taking down Mr. Abramoff would eliminate a competitor.
Mr. Reed became the chief conduit to Mr. McCain's committee for billing documents and other information Mr. Sprague was digging up on Mr. Abramoff, Mr. Sprague said, who said Mr. Reed ''did a great to service to me.''
''He had contacts I did not,'' Mr. Sprague said. ''Initially, I think that the senator's office was doing Reed a favor by listening to me.''
A few weeks after hiring Mr. Reed, Mr. Sprague received a letter from the senator. ''We have met with Scott Reed, who was very helpful on the issue,'' Mr. McCain wrote.
Information about Mr. Abramoff was also flowing to Mr. McCain's committee from another tribe, the Coushatta of Louisiana. The source was a consultant named Roy Fletcher, who had been Mr. McCain's deputy campaign manager in 2000, running his war room in South Carolina.
It was in that primary race that two of Mr. Abramoff's closest associates, Grover Norquist, who runs the nonprofit Americans for Tax Reform, and Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian Coalition, ran a blistering campaign questioning Mr. McCain's conservative credentials. The senator and his advisers blamed that attack for Mr. McCain's loss to Mr. Bush in South Carolina, creating tensions that would resurface in the Abramoff matter.
''I was interested in busting'' Mr. Abramoff, said Mr. Fletcher, who was eventually hired to represent the tribe. ''That was my job. But I was also filled with righteous indignation, I got to tell you.''
Mr. Fletcher said he began passing information to John Weaver, Mr. McCain's chief political strategist, and other staff members in late 2003 or January 2004. Mr. Weaver confirmed the timing.
Mr. McCain announced his investigation on Feb. 26, 2004, citing an article on Mr. Abramoff in The Washington Post. He did not mention the action by lobbyists and tribes in the preceding weeks. His campaign said no one in his ''innermost circle'' brought information to Mr. McCain that prompted the investigation.
The senator declared he would not investigate members of Congress, whom Mr. Abramoff had lavished with tribal donations and golf outings to Scotland. But in the course of the investigation, the committee exposed Mr. Abramoff's dealings with the two men who had helped defeat Mr. McCain in the 2000 primary.
The investigation showed that Mr. Norquist's foundation was used by Mr. Abramoff to launder lobbying fees from tribes. Ralph Reed was found to have accepted $4 million to run bogus antigambling campaigns. And the investigation also highlighted Mr. Abramoff's efforts to curry favor with the House majority leader at the time, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, a longtime political foe who had opposed many of Mr. McCain's legislative priorities.
Mr. McCain's campaign said the senator did not ''single out'' Ralph Reed or Mr. Norquist, neither of whom were ever charged, and that both men fell within the ''scope of the investigation.'' The inquiry, which led to guilty pleas by over a dozen individuals, was motivated by a desire to help aggrieved tribes, the campaign said.
Inside the investigation, the sense of schadenfreude was palpable, according to several people close to the senator. ''It was like hitting pay dirt,'' said one associate of Mr. McCain's who had consulted with the senator's office on the investigation. ''And face it -- McCain and Weaver were maniacal about Ralph Reed and Norquist. They were sticking little pins in dolls because those guys had cost him South Carolina.''
Down on the Coushattas reservation, bills related to the investigation kept coming. After firing Mr. Abramoff, the tribe hired Kent Hance, a lawyer and former Texas congressman who said he had been friends with Mr. McCain since the 1980s.
David Sickey, the tribe's vice chairman, said he was ''dumbfounded'' over the bills submitted by Mr. Hance's firm, Hance Scarborough, which had been hired by Mr. Sickey's predecessors.
''The very thing we were fighting seemed to be happening all over again -- these absurd amounts of money being paid,'' Mr. Sickey said.
Mr. Hance's firm billed the tribe nearly $1.3 million over 11 months in legal and political consulting fees, records show. But Mr. Sickey said that the billing statements offered only vague explanations for services and that he could not point to any tangible results. Two consultants, for instance, were paid to fight the expansion of gambling in Texas -- even though it was unlikely given that the governor there opposed any such prospect, Mr. Sickey said.
Mr. Hance and Jay B. Stewart, the firm's managing partner, defended their team's work, saying they successfully steered the tribe through a difficult period. ''We did an outstanding job for them,'' Mr. Hance said. ''When we told them our bill was going to be $100,000 a month, they thought we were cheap. Mr. Abramoff had charged them $1 million a month.''
The firm's fees covered the services of Mr. Fletcher, who served as the tribe's spokesman. Records also show that Mr. Hance had Mr. Weaver -- who was serving as Mr. McCain's chief strategist -- put on the tribe's payroll from February to May 2005.
It is not precisely clear what role Mr. Weaver played for his $100,000 fee.
Mr. Stewart said Mr. Weaver was hired because ''he had a lot of experience with the Senate, especially the new chairman, John McCain.'' The Hance firm told the tribe in a letter that Mr. Weaver was hired to provide ''representation for the tribe before the U.S. Senate.''
But Mr. Weaver never registered to lobby on the issue, and he has another explanation for his work.
''The Hance law firm retained me to assist them and their client in developing an aggressive crisis management and communications strategy,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''At no point was I asked by Kent Hance or anyone associated with him to set up meetings with anyone in or outside of government to discuss this, and if asked I would have summarily declined to do so.''
In June 2005, the tribe informed Mr. Hance that his services were no longer needed.
Change in Tone
After the Abramoff scandal, Mr. McCain stopped taking campaign donations from tribes. Some American Indians were offended, especially since Mr. McCain continued to accept money from the tribes' lobbyists.
Resentment in Indian Country mounted as Mr. McCain, who was preparing for another White House run, singled out the growth in tribal gambling as one of three national issues that were ''out of control.'' (The others were federal spending and illegal immigration.)
Franklin Ducheneaux, an aide to Morris Udall who helped draft the 1988 Indian gambling law, said that position ran contrary to Mr. McCain's record. ''What did he think? That Congress intended for the tribes to be only somewhat successful?'' Mr. Ducheneaux said.
Mr. McCain began taking a broad look at whether the laws were sufficient to oversee the growing industry. His campaign said that the growth had put ''considerable stress'' on regulators and Mr. McCain held hearings on whether the federal government needed more oversight power.
An opportunity to restrain the industry came in the spring of 2005, when a small tribe in Connecticut set off a political battle. The group, the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, had won federal recognition in 2004 after producing voluminous documentation tracing its roots.
The tribe wanted to build Connecticut's third casino, which would compete with Foxwoods and another, the Mohegan Sun. Facing public opposition on the proposed casino, members of the Connecticut political establishment -- many of whom had received large Pequot and Mohegan campaign donations -- swung into action.
Connecticut officials claimed that a genealogical review by the Bureau of Indian Affairs was flawed, and that the Schaghticoke was not a tribe.
The tribe's opponents, led by the Washington lobbying firm Barbour Griffith & Rogers, turned to Mr. McCain's committee. It was a full-circle moment for the senator, who had helped the Pequots gain tribal recognition in the 1980s despite concerns about their legitimacy.
Now, Mr. McCain was doing a favor for allies in the Connecticut delegation, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a close friend, according to two former Congressional aides. ''It was one of those collegial deals,'' said one of the aides, who worked for Mr. McCain.
Barbour Griffith & Rogers wanted Mr. McCain to hold a hearing that would show that the Bureau of Indian Affairs was ''broken,'' said Bradley A. Blakeman, who was a lobbyist for the firm at the time.
''It was our hope that the hearing would shed light on the fact that the bureau had not followed their rules and had improperly granted recognition to the Schaghticoke,'' Mr. Blakeman said. ''And that the bureau would revisit the issue and follow their rules.''
Mr. McCain's staff helped that effort by offering strategic advice.
His staff told a lobbyist for the firm that the Indian Affairs Committee ''would love to receive a letter'' from the Connecticut governor requesting a hearing, according to an e-mail exchange, and offered ''guidance on what the most effective tone and approach'' would be in the letter.
On May 11, 2005, Mr. McCain held a hearing billed as a general ''oversight hearing on federal recognition of Indian tribes.'' But nearly all the witnesses were Schaghticoke opponents who portrayed the tribe as imposters.
Mr. McCain set the tone: ''The role that gaming and its nontribal backers have played in the recognition process has increased perceptions that it is unfair, if not corrupt.''
Chief Richard F. Velky of the Schaghticokes found himself facing off against the governor and most of the state's congressional delegation. ''The deck was stacked against us,'' Mr. Velky said. ''They were given lots of time. I was given five minutes.''
He had always believed Mr. McCain ''to be an honest and fair man,'' Mr. Velky said, ''but this didn't make me feel that good.''
Mr. Velky said he felt worse when the e-mailmessages between the tribe's opponents and Mr. McCain's staff surfaced in a federal lawsuit. ''Is there a letter telling me how to address the senator to give me the best shot?'' Mr. Velky asked. ''No, there is not.''
After the hearing, Pablo E. Carrillo, who was Mr. McCain's chief Abramoff investigator at the time, wrote to a Barbour Griffith & Rogers lobbyist, Brant Imperatore. ''Your client's side definitely got a good hearing record,'' Mr. Carillo wrote, adding ''you probably have a good sense'' on where Mr. McCain ''is headed on this.''
''Well done!'' he added.
Cynthia Shaw, a Republican counsel to the committee from 2005 to 2007, said Mr. McCain made decisions based on merit, not special interests. ''Everybody got a meeting who asked for one,'' Ms. Shaw said, ''whether you were represented by counsel or by a lobbyist -- or regardless of which lobbyist.''
Mr. McCain's campaign defended the senator's handling of the Schaghticoke case, saying no staff member acted improperly. The campaign said the session was part of normal committee business and the notion that Mr. McCain was intending to help Congressional colleagues defeat the tribe was ''absolutely false.''
It added that the senator's commitment to Indian sovereignty ''remains as strong as ever.''
Within months of the May 2005 hearing, the Bureau of Indian Affairs took the rare step of rescinding the Schaghticokes' recognition. A federal court recently rejected the tribe's claim that the reversal was politically motivated.
Making an Exception
That spring of 2005, as the Schaghticokes went down to defeat in the East, another tribe in the West squared off against Mr. McCain with its bid to construct a gambling emporium in California. The stakes were similar, but the outcome would be far different.
The tribe's plan to build a casino on a former Navy base just outside San Francisco represented a trend rippling across the country: American Indians seeking to build casinos near population centers, far from their reservations.
The practice, known as ''off-reservation shopping,'' stemmed from the 1988 Indian gambling law, which included exceptions allowing some casinos to be built outside tribal lands. When Mr. McCain began his second stint as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee three years ago, Las Vegas pressed him to revisit the exceptions he had helped create, according to Sig Rogich, the Republican fund-raiser from Nevada.
''We told him this off-reservation shopping had to stop,'' Mr. Rogich said. ''It was no secret that the gaming industry, as well as many potentially affected communities in other states, voiced opposition to the practice.''
In the spring of 2005, Mr. McCain announced he was planning a sweeping overhaul of Indian gambling laws, including limiting off-reservation casinos. His campaign said Las Vegas had nothing to do with it. In a 2005 interview with The Oregonian, Mr. McCain said that if Congress did not act, ''soon every Indian tribe is going to have a casino in downtown, metropolitan areas.''
Prospects for the proposed California project did not look promising. Then the tribe, the Guidiville Band of Pomo Indians, hired a lobbyist based in Phoenix named Wes Gullett.
Mr. Gullett, who had never represented tribes before Congress, had known Mr. McCain since the early 1980s. Mr. Gullett met his wife while they were working in Mr. McCain's Washington office. He subsequently managed Mr. McCain's 1992 Senate campaign and served as a top aide to his 2000 presidential campaign. Their friendship went beyond politics. When Mr. McCain's wife, Cindy, brought two infants in need of medical treatment back to Arizona from Bangladesh, the Gulletts adopted one baby and the McCains the other. The two men also liked to take weekend trips to Las Vegas.
Another of Mr. McCain's close friends, former Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, was a major investor in the Guidivilles' proposed casino. Mr. Cohen, who did not return calls, was best man at Mr. McCain's 1980 wedding.
Scott Crowell, lawyer for the Guidivilles, said Mr. Gullett was hired to ensure that Mr. McCain's overhaul of the Indian gambling laws did not harm the tribe.
Mr. Gullett said he never talked to Mr. McCain about the legislation. ''If you are hired directly to lobby John McCain, you are not going to be effective,'' he said. Mr. Gullett said he only helped prepare the testimony of the tribe's administrator, Walter Gray, who was invited to plead his case before Mr. McCain's committee in July 2005. Mr. Gullett said he advised Mr. Gray in a series of conference calls.
On disclosure forms filed with the Senate, however, Mr. Gullett stated that he was not hired until November, long after Mr. Gray's testimony. Mr. Gullett said the late filing might have been ''a mistake, but it was inadvertent.'' Steve Hart, a former lawyer for the Guidivilles, backed up Mr. Gullett's contention that he had guided Mr. Gray on his July testimony.
When asked whether Mr. Gullett had helped him, Mr. Gray responded, ''I've never met the man and couldn't tell you anything about him.''
On Nov. 18, 2005, when Mr. McCain introduced his promised legislation overhauling the Indian gambling law, he left largely intact a provision that the Guidivilles needed for their casino. Mr. McCain's campaign declined to answer whether the senator spoke with Mr. Gullett or Mr. Cohen about the project. In the end, Mr. McCain's bill died, largely because Indian gambling interests fought back. But the Department of Interior picked up where Mr. McCain left off, effectively doing through regulations what he had hoped to accomplish legislatively. Carl Artman, who served as the Interior Department's assistant secretary of Indian Affairs until May, said Mr. McCain pushed him to rewrite the off-reservation rules. ''It became one of my top priorities because Senator McCain made it clear it was one of his top priorities,'' he said.
The new guidelines were issued on Jan. 4. As a result, the casino applications of 11 tribes were rejected. The Guidivilles were not among them.

HEADLINE: The Lost Tycoons

BYLINE: By RON CHERNOW. 
Ron Chernow is the author of ''The House of Morgan'' and ''Alexander Hamilton.''

 BODY:
With breathtaking speed, the world of large Wall Street investment banks has vanished. Fabled firms, some more than a century old, have been merged out of existence (Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch), gone bankrupt (Lehman Brothers), or sought asylum as commercial bank holding companies (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley). Why on earth did this happen?
 The death of Wall Street has been a long-running, slow-motion crisis, barely discernible to participants who had still booked huge profits in recent years. Beneath the razzle-dazzle of trading desks and the wizardry of esoteric finance lay the inescapable fact that these firms had shed their original reason for being: providing capital to American business. 
 The dynastic power exercised by Wall Street tycoons in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was premised on scarce capital. Only a handful of European countries and their private bankers had surplus capital to finance overseas development. In this cash-poor world, J. Pierpont Morgan and other grandees exerted godlike powers over American railroads and manufacturers because they straddled the indispensable capital flows from Europe. With their top hats, thick cigars and gruff manners, these portly tycoons scarcely qualified as altruists. As Morgan liked to warn sentimental souls, ''I am not in Wall Street for my health.'' Yet he and his ilk rendered America an invaluable service by reassuring European investors that they would receive an adequate return on their investments, securing an uninterrupted flow of capital. 
 To safeguard those returns, old-line investment bankers became all-powerful overlords of their exclusive clients. When they issued company shares, they retained a large block for themselves. Some clients chafed at these gilded shackles, while others gloried in their servitude. As the head of the New Haven railroad, a Morgan client, boasted to reporters, ''I wear the Morgan collar, but I am proud of it. If Mr. Morgan were to order me tomorrow to China or Siberia in his interests, I would pack up and go.''
 In the sunless maze of Lower Manhattan, the old Wall Street houses were miniature temples of finance. Elite, all-male and lily-white, rife with snobbery and bigotry, they didn't bother to hang a shingle outside, and the tacit message to pedestrians was clear: keep on walking. This reflected the banks' patented formula of serving only the most creditworthy clients: industrialized nations, blue-chip corporations and wealthy individuals.
 In London, these small partnerships were called ''issuing houses'' because they issued stocks and bonds but didn't trade or distribute them. In their risk-averse culture, J. P. Morgan and his breed considered the stock market a faintly vulgar place, better left to Jews and assorted ethnic groups outside the top ranks of investment houses. This bias would later give predominantly Jewish firms like Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs a marked competitive edge. Even in the 1920s, patrician Wall Street firms stayed somewhat aloof from the stock market mania.
 Securities laws during the New Deal, mandating fuller disclosure of corporate accounting, eroded the Wall Street moguls' power. The new transparency reduced the need of many companies for a banker's imprimatur to certify their soundness. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which forced full-service banks to choose between commercial and investment banking, further shrank the investment houses' influence.
 After World War II, as capital markets revived, Wall Street investment banks remained tiny partnerships with outsize power over corporate America. Morgan Stanley demanded exclusive banking relations with the cream of corporate America: AT&T, General Motors, United States Steel, General Electric, DuPont, I.B.M. and Standard Oil of New Jersey. The essence of the business was still the traditional underwriting of stocks and bonds. The era's emblem was the solemn, rectangular ''tombstone'' ad in newspapers for share offerings, listing the dozens of firms involved, with Wall Street's rulers in the top tier. 
 Underwriting bred a sociable culture of ''relationship'' banking in which a smooth golf swing, Ivy League credentials, glib patter over a martini and family connections counted for more than financial ingenuity. Firms didn't advertise and paid publicists to keep them out of the press. They disdained hostile takeovers, stock trading and other activities that might threaten their coveted underwriting business. And they enforced more rules of etiquette than a debutante's ball. It was considered bad form to poach an employee or raid another firm's client. Whatever their flaws, these elite firms still played a vital role in the economy, floating stocks and bonds to create new factories and businesses.
 The old Wall Street began to die a lingering death in 1979 when I.B.M. told Morgan Stanley that it wanted to have Salomon Brothers co-manage a $1 billion debt issue. Fearing that its stable of captive clients would likewise revolt, Morgan partners insisted on sole management of the issue. They were flabbergasted when I.B.M. sent back word that Salomon Brothers would be lead manager for the issue. 
 What accounted for this startling shift? For the first time since the heyday of J. P. Morgan, traditional corporate clients had outgrown their bankers. With Europe and Japan devastated by World War II, American companies had enjoyed unrivaled supremacy in world markets. They had grown big enough to finance expansion from retained earnings and had many more borrowing options than before. Many had developed their own financial subsidiaries with triple A credit ratings and scarcely needed Wall Street bankers to vouch for their solvency. Trading firms like Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs were using their prowess to cultivate relations with powerful institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies, eating into the profits of white-shoe houses. Underwriting deteriorated into a low-margin business as traders trumped blue-blooded bankers in the Darwinian struggle.
 The demise of traditional underwriting would create in the coming decades a vacuum filled by a host of volatile, risky businesses. The cozy world of relationship banking yielded to the brutal world of ''transactional'' banking. Stock, commodity and derivatives trading, hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and prime brokerage for hedge funds required ever-larger balance sheets, forcing investment houses to become huge, publicly traded companies. Firms that once remained distant from the stock market were now its storm-tossed creatures, as investors demanded ever-higher profits amid cutthroat competition, forcing bankers to take risks that would have horrified their Wall Street ancestors. 
 Where the old Wall Street stuck to the most prestigious clients, the new Wall Street engaged in an unseemly rush to the bottom. Investment houses that once dealt only in grade-A bonds became swept up in junk bond mania in the 1980s. Firms that once snubbed companies beyond the Fortune 500 flocked to Silicon Valley in the 1990s, eager to take fly-by-night companies public. And, in the final reductio ad absurdum, Wall Street during the past decade gorged on mortgage-backed securities, tying its fate to America's least creditworthy borrowers. Addicted to colossal amounts of leverage, the onetime arbiter of scarce capital had become the most profligate borrower.
 The large investment banks that once allocated precious capital now exist in a world awash with money, crisscrossed by capital flows from many continents, with financial markets deep and liquid as never before. Once the current crisis is past, investment banking services will eventually flourish again inside diversified financial conglomerates. Stripped of excess leverage and more tightly supervised by regulators, investment bankers may even rediscover the old-fashioned virtues of corporate finance. And small boutique firms will continue to offer trusted advice as of old. But the storied investment houses of Wall Street, trailing their glorious past, have now earned tombstone ads of a very different sort.

HEADLINE: What's Free About Free Enterprise?

BYLINE: By PETER L. BERNSTEIN. 
Peter L. Bernstein, a financial consultant and economic historian, is the editor of the Economics & Portfolio Strategy newsletter.

 BODY:
THERE was a time, in my childhood during the Great Depression, when the streets of Manhattan were filled with unshaven men in threadbare clothes, their coat collars turned up against the cold, their shoes stuffed with newspaper to plug holes in the soles. And there were bank failures. 
 A huge bailout plan is being hammered out in Washington precisely to avert this kind of economic calamity. The plan is needed, and it needs to be put in place quickly. But at the same time, we need to ask how the financial system came to require a rescue of this magnitude.
 This time around, assets are evidently so rotten in so many places that no financial institution wants to risk doing business with any other financial institution without a government backstop.
 Such fear recently threw a huge bucket of sand into the wheels of commerce, because business cannot function without credit and banks cannot function without the ability to draw on one another's resources as needed. Some radical, comprehensive step from government was necessary, or else outcomes as bad as -- and perhaps even worse than -- those of 1931 and 1932 would have been inescapable. 
 Naturally, a plan of this magnitude has stirred a storm of commentary, but two important potential results deserve more attention than they have received.
 The first is the risk of moral hazard within the bailout itself. That is, if government is going to make good so many losses throughout the system, why would anyone set limits on future risk-taking? The situation could turn into a free-for-all that makes the recent disregard of risk look like child's play.
 The second problem is more philosophical, involving what the bailout plan reveals about the functioning of the free enterprise system. This raises disturbing questions. Although I agree with President Bush's observation that ''the risk of not acting would be far higher,'' we should be aware of the secondary effects of what we are getting into.
 My position on government bailouts of institutions on the verge of failure has been clear ever since the procedure was formalized in the savings-and-loan crisis in 1989, under the first President Bush. I have favored these steps, even though such rescues reward those who took more risks than they should have and are ultimately paid for by those who were more prudent.
 FROM this viewpoint, government bailouts create moral hazard and therefore might seem a mistake. If the government always comes to your rescue when the chips are down, why limit your risks? Why not go for the gold every time? What does it matter if you put the system over the edge, so long as you have a chance to make money and Uncle Sam will take care of everything if you lose? How could any rational individual pass up those kinds of opportunities? 
 We could avoid this conflict of interests by refusing to bail out the risk-takers and letting the financial miscreants squirm in their own juice. That might provide satisfaction to moralists, but life is not so simple. An epidemic of unpaid bad debts would devastate lenders and ignite a conflagration that could pull down the economic and financial structure, ruining everybody. 
 We were on the verge of such an outcome in the last few weeks, as banks froze up in fear that every piece of paper was tainted. As a result, they refused to enter into the most routine kinds of transactions with one another. The choice is between two cruel outcomes: the high probability of an irreparably damaged financial system, or an overload of moral hazard. I prefer dealing with moral hazard later; preserving the system -- and society -- must now have top priority.
 My views have developed over the years, from the bailouts of single entities like Long-Term Capital Management or Bear Stearns, or small groups of companies like savings institutions. But these relatively simple transactions have only a distant family resemblance to the Paulson-Bernanke plan for a huge bailout of countless financial institutions, to say nothing of possible help to households that took on mortgages that would work out only if the home price kept rising. 
 There is an immense difference between a plan for a comprehensive bailout and the far simpler process of bailing out Bear Stearns or even a dozen or so Bear Stearnses. The justification is the same, but the grim consequences in terms of moral hazard are of an incomparably greater order of magnitude. 
 Once the federal government declares, ''Thou shalt not fail,'' there are no limits to how far future risk-takers will go. Who will see any need to pay attention to the possible consequences for the government's budget, the market for its bonds, the taxpayers, its creditors and, indeed, the whole economic structure?
 Furthermore, there are limits to how freely Washington can dispense largess. We no longer owe the national debt to ourselves, as we did in the 1930s, when deficit financing was first proposed as viable policy to overcome the Depression. Financing the government today depends heavily on foreigners' willingness to buy our bonds, but foreigners accept our obligations only when they see some kind of control over the volume of issuance. They will perceive very little control in plans whose limits are porous and uncertain.
 My second issue goes to the foundations of the economic system in which most Americans believe and take for granted. Though we sometimes give it more lip service than respect, it is rooted in individual decision-making in free markets. In theory, at least, the less government intervention, the better; the mantra is that markets know best.
 We often hear this refrain, and history confirms its importance in the most profound issues of economic policy. It justifies our revulsion with Communism, our philosophical distance from the current Chinese system, and our distaste when politicians, not markets, try to shape our system. 
 Faith in free markets made icons of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, who made deregulation a policy cornerstone. An echo in our own time was the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, legislated in 1933 to separate investment banking and commercial banks. Its repeal was a key contributor to the calamities now gripping the banking system.
 TODAY'S crisis thus emerged from a combination of disasters operating in free markets, but wreaking ruin as they developed. The subprime mortgage mess, the huge leverage throughout the system, the insidious impact of new kinds of derivatives and other financial paper, and, at the roots, the vast underestimation of risk could not have happened in a planned economy. A superjumbo bailout is the inescapable result, but at some point we must confront its more profound implications. 
 As we move into the future, and as the crisis finally passes into history, how will we deal with this earth-shaking blow to the most basic principle of our economic system? I do not know how to answer that question. But we need to ask it.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame the New Deal

 BODY:
This year's serial bailouts are proof of a colossal regulatory failure. But it is not ''the system'' that failed, as President Bush, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and others who are complicit in the calamity would like Americans to believe. People failed.
 For decades now, antiregulation disciples of the Reagan Revolution have eliminated vital laws, blocked the enactment of much-needed new regulations, or simply refused to exercise their legal authority. 
 The regulatory system for banks, securities, commodities and insurance is unwieldy and in need of modernization. The system has gaps, like the absence of regulation for ''innovations'' such as credit default swaps, the insurance-like contracts now valued at $62 trillion whose destructive potential prompted the bailouts of Bear Stearns and the American International Group. 
 But the failures that have landed us in the mess we are in today are not mainly structural. To assert that they are masks deeper failings and sets false terms for the upcoming debate on regulatory reform.
 Under a law passed in 1994, for example, the Federal Reserve was obligated to regulate banks and nonbank lenders to curb unfair, deceptive and predatory lending. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, ignored his responsibility, even as junk mortgage lending proliferated in plain sight. 
 Mr. Greenspan later said the law defined ''unfair'' and ''deceptive'' too vaguely. If so, he should have asked Congress for clarification. Instead, he did nothing -- and the Republican-led Congress did not question him. When Ben Bernanke took over as Fed chairman in early 2006, the negligence continued. It was not until mid-2007, after the housing bubble had begun to burst, that federal regulators offered guidelines for subprime lending.
 The systematic dismantling of laws that called for regulation also contributed to the current crisis. 
 In 1995, Congress passed a law that restricted the ability of investors to sue companies, securities firms and accounting firms for misstatements and pie-in-the-sky projections. That helped inflate the dot-com bubble and contributed to the Enron debacle. It also engendered a sense of impunity that helped to foster the excessive risk-taking so prevalent in the mortgage mess. 
 Then, in 1999, Congress dismantled the Glass- Steagall Act, a pillar of the New Deal, which separated commercial and investment banking. That enormous change was undertaken with no thought or effort -- or desire -- to regulate the world that it would help to create. Now we know that an entire ''shadow banking system'' has grown up, without rules or transparency, but with the ability to topple the financial system itself. 
 But perhaps no deregulatory effort had more catastrophic effect than the 2000 law that explicitly excluded derivatives, including those credit default swaps, from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. 
 And there is probably no greater missed opportunity than the reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac passed by the House in 2005. If the law had been enacted, the takeover of those companies may have been avoided. It failed in large part because President Bush wanted to fully privatize them and feared that if they were adequately reformed, privatization would lose steam.
 Indeed, it was in the Bush years that antiregulation and deregulation found full expression, fueled by an ideology that markets know best, government hampers markets, and problems will magically fix themselves.
 The nation is now painfully relearning that the opposite is true. Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, admitted on Friday that his agency's ''voluntary regulation'' of investment banks was a failure that contributed to the current crisis.
 That is a good starting point for a debate about how to get back on the road to sensible, responsible government regulation.

HEADLINE: Do We Need Another Golf Club in Eastern Long Island?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I read with great interest the article about harvesting methane gas from landfills to fuel electricity generation. 
 Former Vice President Gore has challenged the United States to switch to 100 percent electricity generation from clean, renewable sources within the next 10 years. To accomplish this, we must nurture the development of wind, solar and biomass sources, such as landfill methane recovery. Unfortunately, so-called green power offerings remain more expensive than fossil fuel or nuclear-generated electricity. Unless this changes, green power will likely continue to be just a boutique industry, catering only to well-off, environmentally concerned customers. 
 Until the price of green electricity attains parity with conventional electricity, I propose waiving the state sales tax on purchases of certified green power. Widespread enrollment in green power programs will only occur with a level economic playing field.

HEADLINE: Washington's Invisible Hand

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In 1999, Bill Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a bank deregulation bill that swept away a Depression-era law known as Glass-Steagall. The new law had such a chorus of bipartisan support that it passed the Senate 90-8. One of the few who raised a cry against it was Byron Dorgan. ''I think we will look back in 10 years' time and say we should not have done this, but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past,'' said Dorgan, a populist North Dakota Democratic senator, ''and that that which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010.'' Today, a few years earlier than he predicted, Dorgan looks prescient. The current financial crisis is frequently called the worst since the Great Depression. And Gramm-Leach-Bliley is often cited as a cause, even by some of its onetime supporters. 
 Yet the criticism is often vague, which means that anyone trying to understand the causal chain -- how the end of Glass-Steagall led to the end of Lehman Brothers -- will have a hard time doing so. To many banking experts, the reason is simple enough: namely, that the law didn't really do much to create the current crisis. It is a handy scapegoat, since it's easily the biggest piece of financial deregulation in recent decades. But one act of deregulation, even a big one, and the absence of other, good regulations aren't the same thing. The nursemaid of the current crisis isn't so much what Washington did, in other words, as what it didn't do.
 The point of Gramm-Leach-Bliley was to tear down the wall, built by Glass-Steagall, separating banks that did risky investing from those that did basic lending. (The mingling of those two helped create a cascade of bank failures during the Depression.) Thus were born Citigroup, Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase, behemoths that owned bank branches, bought and sold stocks and shepherded corporate mergers.
 But what else do those firms have in common today? They weren't the ones that imploded, at least not first. While hardly unscathed, some of them are emerging as survivors amidst the wreckage. The first fatalities were firms that didn't change all that much in the wake of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Until their dying day, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were both classic investment banks.
 They got in trouble by making a series of risky new bets while Washington did nothing new to stand in the way. ''What you've got,'' said Robert Barbera, a Wall Street economist, ''is a system that has gone wildly beyond the safety nets that were in place.'' Financial firms chopped bad mortgages into thousands of little pieces and deluded themselves into thinking that the sum of the parts was safer than the whole.
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley isn't entirely blameless. For one thing, the mergers it encouraged left banks with more capital to invest; some of the capital ended up in that deluded subprime mortgage market. But the law doesn't deserve the mythical importance it's now accumulating.
 Who, then, in Washington, is to blame? As it happens, it's many of the same people who were behind Gramm-Leach-Bliley. The Clinton administration and Congressional Republicans failed to create a strong framework in place of Glass-Steagall. Democrats pushed for riskier mortgage lending, in an effort to expand home ownership. But surely the bulk of the blame lies with the policy makers and regulators who were on duty while the housing bubble inflated and Wall Street went wild -- the Bush administration and Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve. Their near-religious belief in the powers of the market led them to conclude that the mere fact that a company was willing to make an investment made that investment O.K.
 One of the most influential members of this crowd was none other than Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican and former senator who
 helped bring down Glass-Steagall. For more than two decades in Congress he argued that the forces of the market had to be freed from
 government interference. Just a year after the passage of Gramm- Leach-Bliley, he was largely responsible for another bill -- the Commodity
 Futures Modernization Act -- that clearly did contribute to the current crisis. That law unleashed the derivatives market and
 paved the way for banks to become more aggressive about investing in mortgages. As recently as this summer, he was still saying that the
 biggest problem facing the American economy was excessive regulation. So the bill that bears Gramm's name may be getting a bad rap, but there is also a bit of justice in the misunderstanding.

HEADLINE: Whose Conservatism Is It?

BYLINE: By JACOB HEILBRUNN. 
Jacob Heilbrunn is the author of ''They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons.''

 BODY:
When President Bush went before the nation Wednesday evening to speak about the crisis on Wall Street, he declared that ''my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention.'' But his ultimate recommendation to the American people was the $700 billion bailout plan outlined by his Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 That proposal is seen by some as the latest evidence that the Republican Party has embraced the ''big government'' ideology of the Democrats. Unsurprisingly, there has been a revolt on the right. 
 On Sept. 18, a 100-plus-member group of conservative House Republicans sent a letter to Mr. Paulson and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, warning that ''federal investment in such large amounts of private company stock has the appearance of a socialist and not a free market approach to managing our economy.'' And on Thursday, House Republicans openly defied Mr. Bush in the Cabinet Room of the White House. 
 This reflects widespread confusion about Mr. Bush's brand of conservatism. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist and former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers (under Bill Clinton), put it most bluntly: ''If this isn't socialism,'' he recently said of the bailout package, ''then I don't know what is.''
 But Mr. Bush's break with traditional conservatism is not a sudden development. Some of his most far-reaching measures -- the Patriot Act, the No Child Left Behind education policy and, most emphatically, the costly Medicare prescription drug benefit -- cut against the grain of that orthodoxy. 
 To Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and author of ''Leviathan on the Right,'' Mr. Bush is not a conservative by any definition. ''Anybody would be more restrained than Bush,'' Mr. Tanner said. ''Bill Clinton was a more conservative president than Bush'' because Mr. Clinton ''balanced the budget.''
 Mr. Bush's thinking, it appears, is rooted in a rival conservative vision. In this view, big government is here to stay and the job of conservatives is to convert it to the proper uses. The most articulate proponents of this idea include thinkers like Irving Kristol, who as early as the 1970s identified a new mission for conservatives -- not to destroy government but rather to wrest control of it from a ''new class'' composed of professors, educators, environmentalists, city planners, sociologists and others trying to steer the economy toward a ''system so stringently regulated in detail as to fulfill many of the traditional anticapitalist aspirations of the left.'' 
 Mr. Kristol understood that Americans had grown accustomed to the services government provides. The conservative mission must be to transfer some of that power to private enterprise by slashing taxes while also fostering a religiously based moral vision for society. 
 And it is essentially this argument that has advanced throughout much of Mr. Bush's presidency. In the recent book ''Heroic Conservatism,'' Michael Gerson, Mr. Bush's former speechwriter, noted: ''Republicans who feel that the ideology of Barry Goldwater -- the ideology of minimal government -- has been assaulted are correct.'' 
 The change is most striking in foreign policy. Mr. Bush's call for ''the end of tyranny in our world'' echoes ambitions of Democratic presidents like Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy. Predictably, this mission has outraged many on the right. But the depiction of Mr. Bush as the betrayer of conservatism overlooks a salient fact: Every modern conservative presidency has more or less found itself at odds with the movement's doctrine. Richard M. Nixon, who entered office as potentially the most conservative president since Herbert Hoover, perpetuated the big-government policies of his Democratic predecessors. He established the Environmental Protection Agency, supported affirmative action in the form of the ''Philadelphia Plan'' and proposed a Family Assistance Plan to give cash to the poor. Intervening in the economy, he instituted wage-and-price controls in 1971.
 Even Mr. Reagan, the lodestar of postwar conservatism, strayed from its dogma. He never fulfilled his campaign promise to abolish the Department of Education. He reinstituted the sugar subsidy. And he chalked up budget deficits of $1.5 trillion over eight years. Mr. Bush has repeated this pattern almost to the letter. Like Mr. Reagan, he has delivered on tax cuts, but has not reduced the budget or the size of government. On the contrary, he has expanded it by creating a new layer of bureaucracy, the Homeland Security Department. 
 The rebellion of House conservatives this past week was a reminder, however, that more traditional conservatism hasn't gone away. Now its adherents are making Mr. Bush pay. As Mr. Tanner of Cato put it: ''Bush was never a conservative. He's the guy responsible for blowing up the movement.''

HEADLINE: Regulator in Chief?

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer to the magazine.

 BODY:
EitherBarack Obama or John McCain could well become the first U.S. president since John F. Kennedy to be elected during a recession, not to mention a financial crisis. What sort of nation will the winner inherit? Although the string of bank failures and panic on Wall Street has overtones of the 1930s, the risk is less a repeat of the Great Depression than that of another Japan, which, following a stock-market and real-estate mania that peaked in 1989, suffered through a so-called ''lost decade'' -- 10 years of economic stagnation and a seemingly unending cycle of falling asset values and government bailouts. 
 With that grim example very much in mind, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, a lifelong student of economic calamities, and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson are trying to walk a very fine line -- injecting hundreds of billions into the financial system while not propping up so much deadwood that the system can never recover. President Obama/McCain will face a similar tension -- how many failing mortgage holders to resuscitate, how much and what sort of fiscal stimulus? 
 But they also will have to deal with a knottier set of issues. What can Washington do to break the pathologic cycle of speculative boom followed by titanic bust? It is true that booms and busts are inevitable features of markets; to paraphrase a Wall Street truism, were it not for speculators perhaps neither the railroads nor Google would have been financed. 
 But when markets require bailouts of the two largest mortgage companies, an investment bank and a giant insurer in the space of six months -- with a general mortgage bailout in the works -- it is a sign that the system has stopped working. More explicitly, the system encouraged and permitted a degree of risk that has proved intolerable. 
 It is well to remember that A.I.G. once sported the tag line ''The biggest risk is not taking one.'' To investors raised on maxims of prudence, the slogan served as a dare. It meant that if your assets were safe, then you probably were not earning enough of a return and maybe did not deserve to invest at all. 
 The utter recklessness of this philosophy did not become fully manifest until the insurer was rescued with an $85 billion line of credit from the Fed. In the wake of that bailout, investors had so little appetite for risk that even the stocks of sound institutions were beaten to a pulp. So desperate were investors to unload risk that Treasury bills, the ultimate safe investment, were offering a null return. People were lending to the U.S. Treasury on the promise of zero interest -- merely knowing their capital was safe was profit enough. 
 As highly leveraged investment banks, derivatives traders and unregulated hedge funds were pummeled, regulated institutions like banks were relatively stable. A ruinous law seemed to be operating on Wall Street: Wherever the system was most fragile, and wherever the regulatory walls were least effective, the panic was greatest. Perhaps that wasn't an accident.
 A few years ago, in a paper titled ''Regulation and Reaction,'' David Moss and Sarah Brennan (of the Harvard Business School and Columbia University, respectively) recounted the telling experience of New York State banks in the mid-19th century. Banks in that era issued ''notes'' that served as currency. But when confidence ebbed and too many people tried to exchange their notes for gold, panic ensued and banks failed. So in the 1830s, New York instituted a primitive safeguard: it required banks to back their notes with high-grade government bonds. This reduced risk to the system, but it limited the banks' ability to lend. The law said nothing, however, about checking accounts. In due course, banks greatly expanded their use of such accounts, which soon became the dominant form of bank money in New York. Alas, in 1857, a crash in railroad bonds spurred a panic. Harper's reported that ''Wall Street was choked by thousands of people endeavoring to force their way to the banking houses to demand specie'' -- gold, that is -- for their checks. 
 The lesson, Moss told me, is that ''contagion is like a flood. It finds its way into the part you don't protect.'' In 1929 and its aftermath, that meant stocks purchased on credit and bank deposits. The protections added in the 1930s were remarkable, and their effect endures. Today, though banks are under pressure, their depositors sleep soundly. People lose jobs but they receive unemployment and continue to spend. 
 But those protections are hardly enough. Financial innovation ever seeks the freest terrain. The last generation has witnessed a hothouse of new financial products -- really a new, more supple notion of finance, and one that is incredibly complex. But the basic securities architecture from the New Deal remains unchanged and has even been loosened. 
 A generation ago, if you bought an insurance policy against a default, the insurer who sold it was required to maintain adequate capital. Today, you can enter into a credit-default swap (A.I.G. wrote billions of dollars worth) even if your capital is insufficient. Every derivative (thanks to Wall Street's successful lobbying) was declared to be not a security, and thus largely outside the sight of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our umpires have been watching the wrong field. 
 This is not to say that Washington is the main culprit. Markets were incredibly foolish. The dubious mortgages that were written, the credit ratings that blessed them and the trust that banks put in them were speculative and stupid. But we know that people do foolish things. Markets almost demand it. If you are Lehman Brothers and you do not borrow, you do not earn as much as your peers; then your stock falls and you get taken over. So you borrow. Only regulation can check this instinct. Investment banks should be subject to limits on leverage; hedge funds need scrutiny; and more. Alan Blinder, the former Fed vice chairman, says the next president and Congress will have to redraw the entire regulatory map, because ''it's been shown to be wanting.'' Amen.

HEADLINE: McCain Economics Adviser Has a Grandmaster's Rank

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB MCCLAIN

 BODY:
Could a grandmaster become a member of the next administration? Possibly. Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard, is an economics adviser to the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain. Rogoff is also a grandmaster.
Rogoff said that he has known McCain since meeting him at an economics conference years ago. ''One of the reasons that I think I got along with him was that I felt like I could say what I wanted even if it was not what he wanted to hear,'' Rogoff said.
He described his role in the presidential campaign as a fairly limited one. ''I speak to the other economic advisers once every week or two,'' Rogoff said. ''Occasionally I send in my ideas if I feel strongly about something.'' 
Rogoff said he was not ''a political animal'' or tied to one party. ''I have never associated myself with a candidate or administration before,'' he said, but ''I see Senator McCain as making important changes where change is needed.''In the months before the current financial crisis came to a head, Rogoff gave speeches and wrote articles in which he argued that the financial system in the United States had become bloated and that it was inevitable, even necessary, that some big banks would fail.
Rogoff said an understanding of chess helped him learn economics: ''The whole logic of game theory, which is a big part of economics, came easily to me.''
He also said his knowledge of chess had helped him in his career. ''I was the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003, and you are involved in a lot of high-stakes negotiations,'' he said, ''and chess teaches you to think about what the other person is thinking.''
He stopped playing competitively in 1980 because he found it too demanding to balance his chess schedule and his studies, and he had to make a choice. ''First, I wanted to do something more important with my life,'' said Rogoff, who is now 55. ''Second, I thought I was traveling too much playing chess. Third, I wanted to have a better social life.''
Yet, he said, he is traveling more than ever, and his social life is no better than when he was playing. ''I eventually realized it was me,'' Rogoff said. ''I could have had a perfectly reasonable life in chess.''
Rogoff was at one time one of the country's most promising players. He helped lead the United States to the World Student Team Championship and placed second in the national championship. That finish earned him a spot in the Interzonal Tournament in Biel, Switzerland, in 1976, an important qualifier on the road to the world championship.
Although he failed to get past the Interzonal, he said the game he played there against the Czech grandmaster Jan Smejkal was one of his favorites.
He said that Smejkal outplayed him in the opening. After 14 ... ed, he could not take the pawn with 15 Qd4 because 15 ... Ng4 wins his queen. White's pieces soon found themselves on awkward squares, but then Black became overly ambitious, recklessly pushing his kingside pawns forward .
Smejkal must have missed the point of 24 c5, freeing up the c4 square for White's knight. After 26 Nc4, 26 ... Bc1 27 Nd6 Qg6 28 Nc8 Rc8 29 Qc1 would have yielded White a nice advantage.
White was better anyway after 30 Qd2, but then Black made a mistake with 30 ... Kh7, putting his king on the wrong diagonal, and Rogoff took advantage of Black's overloaded queen with 31 d7.
Smejkal resigned because he could not stop mate (36 ... Rd7 37 Qh8).
Although he said he would consider taking a job in the administration if McCain is elected, Rogoff said: ''I really am very happy with what I am doing. For the foreseeable future, I think I want to stay in academics.''
Then, echoing Senator McCain's catchphrase, he added that he was not sure he would fit in at the White House. ''I am way too much of a maverick.''

MEASURE FOR MEASURE I got the idea for ''Tom's Diner'' in 1981, but I wrote it in the spring of 1982. When I was at Barnard College in Manhattan, I used to go to Tom's Restaurant for coffee, and after I graduated I also ate there before going to work. It was then a cheap, greasy place on 112th Street and Broadway, and it still is, in spite of its celebrity. And yes, it is the same one they use in the ''Seinfeld'' credits -- the neon sign that says ''Restaurant.'' I actually once saw Jerry Seinfeld right near there!
 The melody hit me as I was walking down Broadway, fast. I wanted something jaunty. I remember liking the near-rhymes of ''diner'' and ''corner,'' ''sitting'' and ''waiting.'' Although it is actually Tom's Restaurant I changed it to ''diner'' as it sings better. 
 I was imagining it as a kind of French film soundtrack, something vaudevillian on piano. But I didn't play piano and didn't know anybody who did. So I kept it a cappella, and began to sing it this way in my live show. This detail affected everything to come.
 I noticed right away at my shows that whenever I opened my mouth and sang, ''I am sitting, in the morning...'', people would stop drinking and talking, and immediately whirl around and stare at the stage. So I used it as an opening song. I can't think of a single time that this didn't work. Even at the Prince's Trust concert in 1986, in front of 10,000 people, I went onstage as the opening act and began the entire concert with that song -- and it worked!
 -- Suzanne Vega, ''Tom's Essay''
 Reader Comments:
 The first time I heard your song I was hooked. It was, in its simplicity, addictively persistent, and I wondered about the person who sang it (she just had to be a New Yorker) and the people she sang about. YouTube, of course, has sated much of that curiosity, but the evocative power of the song and the person continues.

 THE THROWBACK In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, my dad had other preoccupations besides the terrorist attacks. ''I got problems of my own,'' he often muttered. As a lifelong New Yorker, he felt the agony of the city he so very much loved. But he was dying of leukemia, the disease racing though his veins like a deadly flow of lava. He knew he was dying and I knew he was dying and I wish I had been a better son in those moments. But I shut down. I shut down terribly.
 The intense bond we had felt for one another all our lives disappeared. We became like strangers, except when the Yankees were on television in the playoffs. It gave us a sense of relief that we didn't have to say anything to each other in the sad darkness of the hospital room at Mount Sinai in New York, just watch the Bronx Bombers in their post-season march. Maybe it sounds silly, and maybe it's the kind of hyperbolic junk that sportswriters like to indulge in, but those games did bring us closer. They returned us to the 1964 World Series, his arm around my shoulder, a little boy and his dad. As we watched the exploits of Bernie Williams, Paul O'Neill, Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez -- because those were the Yankees back then, not the tired and frayed version put out for consumption today -- there was still music between us.
 -- Buzz Bissinger,
 ''When the Yankees Mattered ...''
 LESSON PLANS Solving our nation's urban education problems will take more than amazing teachers and competent administration. It will take more than policy changes from Washington that bring more resources. It will take more than cooperation from local police departments and social service agencies. It will take the involvement of businesses, museums, churches, and hospitals. It will take high-rise offices mingling with the gritty schoolhouses in their shadow. It will take small-business owners allowing 16-year-olds to file papers and answer phones.
 This must be uncomfortable to many people who have chased dreams that have nothing to do with education. They don't drag me into the board room when their sales are down, so why should I ask for their help when I struggle to reach my students? 
 I see and respect this point of view, but I'd like to pose a question: ''Who showed you what you could be?''
 For me, it was my parents -- aided closely by an extensive network of family, church members and attentive neighbors. I saw a good sampling of successful careers. There were independent businessmen, musicians and teachers. There were soldiers and preachers. Strings of bad luck had left some unemployed. Some were lazy and had no intention of finding honest work. I saw enough to know I had options.
 Personal success often begins with someone knowing that victory is a possibility. Many students only know the two or three generations of failure that are visible in their communities. If you have never seen an intellectual the likes of Cornel West, you likely won't aspire to be one. Youth who have never set foot in museums aren't likely to develop a taste for them. Unless a small-business owner sits a student down and relays her story of struggle, self-doubt and eventual success, that student may never learn that dedication can eventually bring rewards.
 -- Matthew Kay, ''The New Village''
 Reader Comments:
 For most of human history this is how we engaged in formal learning. Mentoring and apprenticeships have the potential to teach more powerfully than classrooms and to build social relationships that are the foundation of a strong and peaceful society.

HEADLINE: Tied to Wall Street, State Feels the Shock

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

DATELINE: Newark 

 BODY:
 WHEN economic spasms convulsed Wall Street earlier this month, New Jersey also shook.
 Not with the relatively mild aftershocks felt elsewhere in America, where people worried about what the financial crisis would do to their retirement funds or their total net worth.
 In New Jersey the impact was immediate, and not just among the young stock market professionals in Hoboken or the investment bankers living along Summit's storied lanes. Wall Street is only minutes from Exit 14C of the turnpike. But the ties run even deeper. 
 Thousands of New Jersey residents work in the region's financial services sector, earning salaries twice as high as the average worker's here and contributing to the state economy by sending a big chunk of their income to Trenton every spring. State labor officials say close to a million New Jersey jobs are directly or indirectly intertwined with Wall Street. And many of the state's decision makers came from Wall Street, including Gov. Jon S. Corzine, the former chief executive and chairman of Goldman Sachs.
 The governor has estimated that one-third of New Jersey's economy is tied to Wall Street. While some economists believe that is slightly overstating things, they do not put the impact much lower. 
 ''We estimate that financial services are about 25 percent of the state's real gross domestic product,'' said Sean Maher, New Jersey analyst for Moody's Economy.com. 
 David J. Socolow, the state's commissioner of labor and workforce development, said one job loss in the financial sector translates to the loss of 2.7 jobs in other segments of the economy.
 The state is already beset by a rising unemployment rate -- it hit a five-year high of 5.9 percent in August -- and slow job expansion. State officials expect 2009 tax collections to plummet, and are bracing for added pressure on the state's Unemployment Trust Fund. 
 New Jersey's pension funds have also been affected. During Wall Street's free fall, the state treasurer, R. David Rousseau, issued a statement saying the state's Division of Investment lost more than half of $200 million it invested in June with Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy two weeks ago.
 ''New Jersey is in for some difficult times,'' said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
 As the drama on Wall Street was unfolding, Mr. Corzine convened an economic forum, saying the upheaval could lead to job losses in New Jersey and affect the state's budget. 
 ''To stand still is to fall behind,'' the governor said in a statement. ''We need action, and we need it now.'' 
 He met behind closed doors with 27 business leaders at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark to brainstorm about strategies for bolstering the state's economy. 
 After two hours, the governor emerged and said the state needed to speed spending on public works projects like schools and mass transit. Mr. Corzine also said that executives at the meeting had suggested creating energy conservation jobs and bringing together community banks and the state's Economic Development Authority to channel loans to businesses. 
 ''The sooner we get shovels in the ground,'' he said, ''the sooner you get the multiplier effect'' benefiting businesses and people.
 New Jersey has 78,000 residents who commute to financial sector jobs in New York -- mostly New York City -- according to Commissioner Socolow. It also has 266,200 financial jobs statewide, and not just at the Jersey City waterfront, which some call Wall Street West. Merrill Lynch, for example, employs 6,000 workers in Hopewell Township. 
 Not all of those in financial jobs are part of the investment world. Some work in real estate and insurance. And not all are superrich. In 2007, 43,000 of about 4 million income tax returns reported earnings and capital gains of more than $500,000, putting them in the state's highest income tax bracket.
 New Jersey derives 40 percent of its income tax collections from 1 percent of its filers, according to Tom Vincz, a spokesman for the New Jersey Treasury Department. Last year the state collected $12.6 billion in income tax revenues, $8.4 billion in sales tax and $2.9 billion in corporate tax revenues, he said.
 In an interview on Sept. 19, Bradley I. Abelow, the governor's chief of staff and a former Goldman Sachs executive who served as New Jersey's treasurer in 2006 and 2007, said state income tax receipts could drop by as much as ''10 to 20'' percent because of the financial problems on Wall Street.
 Mr. Abelow said the earliest projections would not arrive until December or January. ''When we planned the budget, we assumed softness in the economy and planned it,'' he said. ''We felt pretty well positioned. But now, obviously, as we sit here and think about the world, it feels less good than it did.''
 Mr. Corzine himself predicted that ''broad, back-of-the-envelope cuts'' lay ahead.
 ''It's pretty simple,'' he said last week in a telephone interview. ''If people don't earn the same income, the state's going to receive lower tax receipts. Our budget is already stressed.'' 
 The current $32.9 billion state budget reduced spending $600 million below the 2007 budget, and was $100 million smaller than the budget Mr. Corzine proposed in February.
 Rich Yamarone, an economist with Argus Research Corporation in New York, said trickle-down effects are much broader than job losses.
 ''Fear has a tremendous, contagious power,'' said Mr. Yamarone, a New Jersey resident. ''The mere thought of job loss will force consumers to pull back the spending reins. That will hurt everyone.''
 In the best case, New Jersey could lose 45,000 private-sector jobs over the next year, said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Bloustein school. In the worst case, he said, twice as many jobs could disappear. ''It's going to be an era of lower returns, thinner profits and fewer jobs,'' Dr. Hughes said. He predicted the most vulnerable sectors would be financial services; warehousing, distribution and retailing; and pharmaceuticals. 
 IN Summit, a quiet, prosperous town favored by Wall Street titans, difficult times have already arrived.
 ''I see numerous families overwhelmed by the current crisis,'' said Sharon Shrensel, a Summit psychotherapist. ''Anxiety and panic disorder is at a high. Wives are disheartened, angry and nervous, exposed to house husbands for the first time, and husbands are vulnerable to humiliation and nervous disorders, as well as depression.''
 Lois Schneider, who owns a real estate agency in Summit, said two house purchases her firm had been brokering dissolved after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch agreed to be sold. Ten other potential homebuyers called to say that they had decided not to buy. 
 ''The Wall Street people are gun-shy right now,'' she said.
 That kind of confusion and paralysis is easy to understand, said Chip Dickson, a Summit resident and a former chief strategist for Lehman Brothers. He is now managing director of Community Bank Strategic Equity Fund, a private equity fund.
 ''This is not just a stock going down. People's lives are changing. They are shaken up,'' Mr. Dickson said. ''The kind of assumptions on which they based their future have changed. Trust has been broken. You ask yourself: What do I trust? What do I believe in?''
 Jersey City is home to 260 financial firms employing 24,000 people, including 1,700 at Lehman Brothers and 1,500 at Merrill Lynch, according to Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy.
 ''We're waiting for the whole thing to shake out, and trying to get a commitment from Barclays to maintain their presence here,'' Mr. Healy said. Barclays purchased some of Lehman's assets. ''If that fails, we'll go to Plan B, which is to market ourselves. We have a lot to tout -- easy access to Manhattan, light rail, world-class office space.'' 
 Mr. Socolow, the commissioner of labor, cautioned workers not to panic. Many of the 10,000 financial services workers who lost jobs in New Jersey in the past year received severance payments and eventually found new jobs. 
 ''People fear they'll go from making a really great salary to flipping burgers. That's not what happens. It's not wholesale misery,'' he said. 
 ''That does not in any way minimize the real, wrenching economic pain many people will go through, for some period of time.''

 ECUADOR'S PRESIDENT WINS
 Wide Support for New Charter
 Ecuador's leftist president, Rafael Correa, won easy approval of a new Constitution that enhances his power in the chronically unstable Andean country while introducing a range of other measures. The victory reflects both the festering resentment toward Ecuador's traditional political class and hopes that Mr. Correa, an American-educated economist, can broaden the reach of antipoverty programs. PAGE A7
 TOP FEMALE AFGHAN OFFICER KILLED
 Malahai Kakar, the most high-profile female police officer in Afghanistan, was shot and killed as she prepared to leave for work in the southern city of Kandahar. The Taliban claimed responsibility for her death. Officer Kakar was an iconic figure among women's groups in Afghanistan and abroad, and was a symbol of the wider freedoms gained by women when the Taliban were ousted from power. PAGE A9 
 GROUP AIMS TO STOP NUCLEAR THEFT
 There is currently no organization whose job it is to eliminate weak links in the global security chain of the expanding web of nuclear sites -- private and public, civilian and military. Sam Nunn, the former senator from Georgia, wants to change that, and is setting up the World Institute for Nuclear Security, to provide a forum where nuclear security professionals can meet and share information about how to keep dangerous materials out of unfriendly hands. PAGE A8
 DOUBTING STORY OF ATTACK IN CHINA
 In the days leading up to the Olympic games, Chinese officials described a terrorist attack by two ethnic Uighur separatists in the city of Kashgar, in which 16 paramilitary officers were killed. The government has said little about the matter since then, and three foreign tourists who happened to be in the area challenge the official Chinese version of the event. PAGE A5
 TENSIONS RISE OVER HIJACKED SHIP
 Pirates who hijacked an arms-laden Ukrainian ship that was bound for Kenya vowed to fight to the death, even as a hostage died and Somali officials urged the American Navy to send in commandos. The pirates on the ship, which is traveling off the coast of Somalia, continued to make demands, and Somali officials worry that the weapons could fall into the hands of rebel Islamist groups in the country. PAGE A9
 U.S. DEPLOYS RADAR IN ISRAEL
 The United States Army has rolled out an advanced American radar system on Israeli soil, according to an official. The system, which will be operated initially by an American crew, will allow early detection of incoming ballistic missiles and enhance Israel's defensive capability against any potential attack by Iran. The Pentagon has not made an official announcement on the system. PAGE A5
 NATIONAL
 INQUIRY INTO PROSECUTOR DISMISSALS
 Stops Short of Criminal Charges
 A Justice Department investigation offers a blistering critique of the political motivations that led to the dismissals of a group of United States attorneys in late 2006, but stops short of recommending criminal charges against former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales or others in the affair, officials said. The inquiry has sought to determine who in the Bush administration ordered the firings, whether the dismissals were intended to thwart investigations, and whether anyone had broken the law. PAGE A13
 THE LIMITS OF STANDARDIZED TESTS
 The main event for the more than 5,000 participants at the annual conference of the National Association of College Admission Counseling was William R. Fitzsimmons's first public presentation of a study on the use of standardized tests. He publicly affirmed what many of those present had been saying for years: The SAT and other standardized tests are ''incredibly imprecise'' when it comes to measuring academic ability and how well students will perform in college. PAGE A13
 MEDICAL COPTER CRASH KILLS 4
 A Maryland State Police medical evacuation helicopter crashed in foggy weather, killing four of the five people on board, including victims of a traffic accident. It was the eighth fatal crash nationwide of a medical helicopter in the last 12 months. PAGE A13
 PLAYING THE ECONOMIC CARD
 The union foot soldiers knocking on doors in battleground states like Wisconsin to promote Senator Barack Obama build their pitch largely around the message that with unemployment rising, the financial system reeling and gas and food prices soaring, the nation cannot afford to have another Republican in the White House. The effort appears to be easier this year than in the past. PAGE A17

 OSBORN ELLIOTT, 83

 NEW YORK REPORT 
 AT ORTHODOX SYNAGOGUE, 
 Traditional Meets Trendy
 Starting Monday evening with Rosh Hashana services, Rabbi Simon Jacobson, a Lubavitcher rabbi from Crown Heights and founder of a project known for blending religious teaching with tai chi, introductory kabbalah and Hasidic rap will become a kind of Jewish mystic-in-residence at the traditional Orthodox Community Synagogue on the Lower East Side. He hopes to create ''a spiritual Starbucks''; the synagogue hopes to add to its membership. PAGE B1 
 FROM POLITICS TO THE TV BENCH
 Jeanine F. Pirro removed her brassy, salty style from New York politics after her loss to Andrew M. Cuomo in the 2006 campaign for state attorney general. She has now taken it to television, where she is meting out comeuppances and some occasional sympathy on her new program on the CW network, ''Judge Jeanine Pirro.'' PAGE B1
 SPORTS
 COLLEGE FOOTBALL RETURNS
 To Unpredictability
 Except for the Mountain West's surprising transformation into a national player, which includes a 5-1 record against the Pac-10, the big boys essentially held serve for the first four weeks of the college football season. But the ghosts of the 2007 season emerged over the weekend, with six ranked teams, three of them in the top 10, losing to unranked opponents. ''I feel sorry for people who take pride in predicting,'' said Coach David Cutcliffe of Duke, who has led the Blue Devils to an unpredictable 3-1 start. PAGE D5
 MUSSINA REACHES MILESTONE
 On the last day of what could be his final season in the major leagues, Mike Mussina made it to the milestone that had eluded him for 18 seasons, earning his 20th victory as the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-2, at Fenway Park. He pitched six shutout innings, allowing three hits and two walks, with three strikeouts. Mussina, who turns 40 in December, finished at 20-9 and has 270 career victories. PAGE D4
 NEW WORLD RECORD IN MARATHON
 Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia broke his own world record in the marathon in Berlin and became the first person to run the 26.2-mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes. With a time of 2:03:59 on the accommodatingly flat course, he shattered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2:04:26 from last year in Berlin. At age 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of a career that has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon. PAGE D8
 BUSINESS
 A TRUE 'TABLOID GUY'
 Is Ending His Career
 In his heyday, he was the personification of Rupert Murdoch's brand of tabloid journalism, both in print for The New York Post and, for 10 years beginning in the mid-1980s, on television with ''A Current Affair.'' He tweaked the political landscape of the city, proving that populism in New York City could come from the right and not just from the left. But after 55 years in journalism, Steve Dunleavy is calling it quits. PAGE C1
 DARING TO QUESTION LOANS
 A variety of people in the news media were raising questions long before the recent calamities on Wall Street, David Carr writes in The Media Equation. ''After large-scale financial disasters, the press is usually criticized -- often justly -- for ignoring the problem,'' he says, ''but it's hard to make that case with the subprime mess. If no one saw this coming, they were not looking.'' PAGE C1
 THE TORAH'S KEYS FOR SUCCESS
 Mining the Torah and other Jewish holy texts to find secrets for success in business; The Wall Street Journal promoting itself through a mail-order wine club; and a difference of opinion on whether the government is offering Wall Street a ''rescue'' or ''asset relief program'' (President Bush and other officials) or a ''bailout'' (news media). Media Talk. PAGE C5
 MAD MEN AND CAVEMEN
 The fifth annual Advertising Week was deeply under the spell of ''Mad Men'' the AMC series about a fictional agency in the 1960s, as well as the Wall Street goings-on. But participants also took time to vote to add the Geico caveman and the Serta sheep as favorite characters for a ''Walk of Fame'' on Madison Avenue. The caveman joined his sibling, the Geico gecko, elected in 2005. PAGE C6
 PAYING FOR THE LAW
 No less an authority than the United States Supreme Court has said that the law and judicial decisions cannot be copyrighted, but in the real world, judicial decisions and laws and regulations can be exceedingly hard to find without paying for them, either in book form or online. For 15 years Carl Malamud has been trying to change that, using the Internet to liberate information that nominally exists in the public domain. PAGE C8
 TURNING TO TV FOR ANSWERS
 The meltdown in the financial markets has a lot of people turning to cable television in an effort to understand issues with which the best minds on Wall Street and in Washington were struggling, too. As one investment-company consultant put it in a blog post last week, the viewer impulse was perhaps ''the same basic instinct that attracts onlookers to a car crash.'' PAGE C9

 LOS ANGELES MUSEUM
 Receives Big Boost
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art plans to announce that it has received a $45 million cash gift and the promise of $10 million in artworks from Lynda and Stewart Resnick, a Beverly Hills couple. The cash gift, $25 million of which had been disclosed, will be used to finance a new 45,000-square-foot exhibition pavilion designed by Renzo Piano. It will be situated immediately behind the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, which opened in February on the museum's campus. PAGE E1 
 OSCAR HOPES FOR 'BENJAMIN BUTTON'
 If ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,'' Hollywood's take on a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is all that Paramount executives hope, the movie, which stars Brad Pitt, will be the birth of the next phase at the aging studio. Paramount's chairman, Brad Grey, has been eager to show that he can win Oscars without his DreamWorks partners -- Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Stacey Snider -- who are leaving to form a company of their own. PAGE E1 
 A MIGHTY WIND
 The Wanamaker organ, said to be the largest playable instrument in the world, was bought by John Wanamaker in 1909 for his Philadelphia store. Over the last century, as the building became a Lord & Taylor, then a Macy's, the organ fell into disrepair. Its 28,482 pipes are now fully functioning, and on Saturday the conductor Rossen Milanov led the Philadelphia Orchestra and the organist Peter Richard Conte in Joseph Jongen's ''Symphonie Concertante,'' creating a symphonic sound so huge and striking that it seemed as if it could shatter the glass jewelry cases, Vivien Schweitzer writes. PAGE E1 
 THARP BALLETS MOURN TRADITION
 Pacific Northwest Ballet was already a force on the national map when its artistic director, Peter Boal, decided to devote an entire program to the estimable Twyla Tharp. For the program, Ms. Tharp, now 67, worked intensely to create a pair of ballets studying and mourning the loss of tradition. ''All Tharp,'' which opened his company's 2008-9 season at Marion Oliver McCaw Hall in Seattle on Thursday, nailed the point, Gia Kourlas writes. PAGE E5 
 CRITICS' ROUNDUP OF NEW CDS
 Ben Ratliff writes that Pete Seeger's ''At 89'' is an antivirtuosic record; Jon Pareles writes that Ani DiFranco in ''Red Letter Year'' confesses uncertainties and pours out details that might embarrass others; and Jon Caramanica writes that Kellie Pickler's new self-titled album is a tepid and forgettable record, and that in ''Acid Tongue,'' Jenny Lewis's follow-up to her 2006 solo album, Ms. Lewis is emboldened in her songwriting and flexible in her voice.

HEADLINE: Study of Standardized Admissions Tests Is Big Draw at College Conference

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
For the 5,500 college admissions officials and high school guidance counselors who gathered here over the weekend, there were discussions, debates and analyses of things like the ethics of tracking student applicants on Facebook and ''Why Good Students Write Bad College Essays -- and How to Stop It.'' 
 But for this crowd, at the Seattle convention center for the annual conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, the main event was William R. Fitzsimmons's first public presentation of the findings of the Study of the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission.
 Mr. Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions at Harvard, led a commission of college admissions officials who drafted the study, which challenges colleges and universities to examine their use of the SAT and ACT and to consider whether the benefits outweigh the disadvantages or whether they can make the tests optional for admissions. 
 The line formed early for Mr. Fitzsimmons's panel, and with more than 1,000 people jockeying for a limited number of seats -- a scene that brought to mind the college admissions process -- the event was moved to the ballroom.
 ''It's electrifying to both sides of the desk,'' said Louis L. Hirsh, admissions director at the University of Delaware, ''to counselors who are worried about the stresses that the SAT places on the kids, and from the college end, the people whom all of us respect are looking at a test that all of us use and asking all of us to be more thoughtful about how they use it and what role it plays in our admissions.'' 
 Mr. Fitzsimmons, who took center stage along with the other members of the commission, tried to ease the fears of the ardent supporters of the standardized admissions tests, taking pains to say that the SAT had many advantages. 
 But he also affirmed what many of those present had been saying for years: that the SAT and other standardized admissions tests are ''incredibly imprecise'' when it comes to measuring academic ability and how well students will perform in college. He said colleges and universities needed to do much more research into how well the tests predict success at their individual institutions.
 Test prep can work, Mr. Fitzsimmons said, but he noted -- and the audience applauded -- that there was a difference between test prep that consists of studying on your own and $400-an-hour one-on-one tutoring that starts in the seventh grade. 
 ''There is no evidence on what the latter test prep does,'' he said. ''We know it's an advantage, but we don't have enough information.''
 There has been longstanding debate and concern about the impact of standardized testing on socioeconomically disadvantaged students, and the ballroom erupted in applause when Mr. Fitzsimmons called for an end to the use of ''cut scores'' to determine who qualifies for National Merit and other scholarships. The practice means that one student is rewarded while excluding another whose SAT score may be only a single point lower, Mr. Fitzsimmons said.
 What that single point differential fails to take into account, he said, is the context: The two students may have ''lived entirely different lives, had entirely different educational opportunities and entirely different access to test prep.'' 
 The audience also applauded Mr. Fitzsimmons's call for U.S. News & World Report to stop using SAT scores as part of its college rankings.
 ''At Harvard we get terrific students, and we turn out terrific students later on,'' Mr. Fitzsimmons said. ''Is that due to Harvard or is that due to the students to begin with? Who knows? There are fabulous institutions with relatively low test-score averages that are absolutely first rate, that take students from point A to point Z.''
 He continued, ''Educational quality has nothing to do, or very little to do, with actual average SAT scores.'' 
 Mr. Fitzsimmons called on colleges and universities to be more transparent about how they use standardized admissions scores, and more collaborative in terms of sharing research on the scores. He suggested that the National Association for College Admission Counseling assume more of a ''watchdog role,'' fighting against the misuse of standardized test scores. He said that what may be more helpful going forward are more tests based on high-school curriculum. 
 Many college admissions officials who were in the audience praised the study.
 Jeffrey Brenzel, the dean of admissions at Yale, said the report raised key questions for every college and university: ''Are you using the tests in a responsible manner and in the way they were intended? Is your use of the test relevant to your particular institution's mission? Are there alternatives?'' 
 The comment session that followed was lively, with audience members praising the study group's efforts, but also underscoring what they viewed as the deficiencies of standardized admissions tests. 
 A high school counselor from Chicago talked at length about the ''huge economic disparities'' that play out in standardized admission testing. She pointed out that while fee waivers are available, many low-income students do not know how the waivers work. Nor, she said, do low-income students know about the College Board's new ''score choice,'' which will begin in the spring, and will allow students who take the SAT multiple times to choose which combined scores to submit to colleges, without the colleges' knowing how many times they have taken the test. 
 ''There are kids who walk into the test who don't have calculators,'' she said. ''Forget about things we can't control -- like having to take two buses to the test, and it's cold. I've got kids in the Chicago projects who go to some free test prep place, and their scores might go up a point.'' 
 An audience member asked Mr. Fitzsimmons and the other college admissions officials on stage if any of them had changed their minds about the SAT and decided to go test-optional as a result of their participation in the study. 
 Steve Syverson, the dean of admissions at Lawrence University in Wisconsin, said dryly, ''We're test optional, and we weren't persuaded to change.''
 One by one, the other admissions officers gave variations of the same answer: We're concerned about the inequities and possible misuses of the test. We're going to keep studying it and talking about it, but the tests are useful for us, and we're not going test-optional. 
 Only Jeff Rickey, the dean of admissions at Earlham College in Indiana, gave an answer that implied that change might be possible in his office. The report had given renewed energy to Earlham's planned comprehensive review of the use of standardized admissions tests, he said. ''Stay tuned,'' he told the audience. ''A year from now we'll be able to inform you as to whether we're going test-optional or not.''

HEADLINE: Mussina's 20th Victory May Be His Last

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Mike Mussina is not a dreamer. He knows he has just spun a season unlikely to repeat itself. He is too much of a realist to believe that finally winning 20 games -- as he did Sunday on the last day of his 18th season in the majors -- means he can keep defying age until he reaches 300 wins.
 There is a very real chance that Mussina pitched the last game of his career when he beat the Boston Red Sox, 6-2, with six shutout innings at Fenway Park. His contract has expired, his 40th birthday awaits in December, and his family wants him to come home to Montoursville, Pa., for good. 
 ''I've been envious of every guy who's retired since I've been playing -- you've done what you wanted to do, and I still have to grind it out, that kind of thing,'' Mussina said, enjoying a soda in the manager's office between games of a doubleheader. ''You get to go home and relax, and you've played the game as long as you've chosen to play it. I've felt good for every one of them.''
 Mussina just may join them, though he would be the only pitcher in the last 100 years to voluntarily retire after a 20-win season. Elbow pain ended Sandy Koufax's career after he won 27 in 1966, and two Chicago White Sox players were barred in 1920 for conspiring to throw the 1919 World Series.
 It may be just like Mussina to walk away healthy and on top. He is not like other players, anyway. He graduated from Stanford with an economics degree in three and a half years. He almost never takes a vacation. He reads novels and collects tractors and vintage cars.
 Fortune never pulled Mussina from his hometown. He displays no family photographs in his locker, yet he always seems pulled toward Pennsylvania. 
 ''For him, it's not about selfish goals, or 'Where am I going to end up in the history of the game?' '' Manager Joe Girardi said. ''If he walks away, it's because he thinks it's time to be with his family.''
 Does Girardi think Mussina is capable of doing that?
 ''Oh yeah, I do,'' he said. ''I think Moose is capable of doing that, because I know what type of husband and father he is. Will he do it? I don't know.''
 Mussina needs 30 victories for 300, and he says that if he pitches one more season, he would have to pitch three to reach the mark. That is the decision he faces when he gets home.
 ''If the situation isn't ideal for me, or it's better to be coaching Little League, then it would be time,'' he said.
 Mussina has always maintained that good pitchers win half their starts. He has done that almost precisely, going 270-153 in 536 career starts. Only five pitchers have as many victories and a winning percentage as high as Mussina's .638: Grover Cleveland Alexander, Christy Mathewson, Roger Clemens, Lefty Grove and Randy Johnson.
 To some, Mussina's case for the Hall of Fame is compromised by never having won a World Series or a Cy Young Award. But this season, he passed greats like Bob Gibson, Bob Feller and Jim Palmer in career wins.
 ''There's a big list of names of pretty important people over the years,'' Mussina said. ''All I'm trying to do is get in the discussion. If you get in the discussion, people may take a closer look and think that maybe this guy did do something pretty good.''
 Until Sunday, Mussina had the most victories for any pitcher who had never won 20. With the Orioles in 1996, the bullpen blew the save in his last two starts, and he finished with 19. He did not have another chance for 12 years.
 Last Tuesday in Toronto, Mussina took a line drive off his pitching elbow and came out after five innings. He was efficient Sunday, getting two double plays and using only 73 pitches through six.
 But his elbow was tight, and with a 3-0 lead -- thanks to a home run by Xavier Nady that bounced off the top of the right-field wall -- Mussina turned the game to the bullpen.
 When the Red Sox rallied in the eighth, Mussina paced the clubhouse. He also checked on his wife, two sons and his mother, who all left early to get to the airport and beat traffic. There was one game to finish and another still to play, but it could not match the lure of Montoursville.
 Mussina stuck around, moving to the dugout to watch Mariano Rivera get the final three outs. One by one, teammates hugged Mussina, who got the game ball and a round of applause when he returned to the clubhouse.
 Waiting for Mussina in the equipment room was a bag from McDonald's. Someone had swiped his two cheeseburgers, but he was happy to chomp down a large order of fries.
 As a victory meal, it was classic Mussina: simple tastes for a simple man who just might have finished an extraordinary career.
 INSIDE PITCH
 Mariano Rivera has decided to have arthroscopic shoulder surgery on Oct. 6 to remove a calcification on the AC joint. Rivera is expected to be ready for spring training. ... The Yankees lost the final game of the season, 4-3, in 10 innings, and finished 89-73. ... Boston's Josh Beckett was pushed back to Game 3 of the American League division series after he strained an oblique muscle while throwing a bullpen session Friday. Jon Lester will start Game 1 on Wednesday against the Angels in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Seeks Signs Of Response In Markets

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Washington hopes its sweeping bailout plan will get credit flowing again.
 But will it work on Wall Street? 
 That is the $700 billion question swirling around the biggest financial bailout in American history. The first answer will come on Monday from the credit markets, where this crisis has unfolded for more than a year now. 
 As details of the plan trickled out on Sunday, few economists saw the rescue as a quick fix. Even if the frozen credit markets thaw a bit -- and many analysts say they will -- the good old days of easy money are over for now. The stock market, which has lost about 17 percent this year, is bound to remain volatile. To many, a recession seems unavoidable. 
 The first big question, however, is whether some semblance of calm will return to the credit markets. If the plan works as hoped, market interest rates that have been stuck at unusually high levels should start to ease. 
 If that happens, banks and corporations would be able to borrow money at lower rates than they have in recent weeks, said Mark Zandi, chief economist and founder of Moody'sEconomy.com. Since Lehman Brothers sank into bankruptcy, rates on short-term corporate i.o.u.'s have shot up. Investors have shunned all but the safest of investments, like Treasury bills and notes. Last week, prices of two-year Treasury notes rose for a fifth straight week, a run that has reduced their yield by about a third of a percentage point.
 ''The most important thing is to see money markets normalize,'' said Mr. Zandi, who has advised the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. ''If banks start lending to each other that would be a very positive sign and that would be key.''
 Many borrowers are being penalized in the bond markets, if they can borrow money at all. Credit spreads -- the premium investors demand to lend money to everybody but the federal government -- need to fall, said Jerry Webman, chief economist and senior investment officer for OppenheimerFunds. Last week, in a rare reversal that occurs only in times of extreme stress in the credit markets, tax-free municipal bonds were yielding more than Treasuries, which are not tax exempt.
 Many municipal and corporate borrowers were unable to borrow money in the credit markets last week. Mr. Webman said the economy could suffer if those tight conditions persist.
 ''Credit is man's confidence in man,'' Mr. Webman said. ''That confidence in the financial system needs to increase.''
 Analysts said the market would be watching closely how the Treasury Department structured its planned purchases of troubled assets from financial firms. The government has suggested it might use auctions to establish prices for the securities and loans it plans to acquire. Mr. Zandi said the Treasury should disclose more details in the next several weeks and conduct its first auctions soon after the presidential elections.
 Once investors have a better sense of what the troubled assets are worth, they will become more willing to invest in ailing financial firms that have not been able to raise capital because analysts fear they have not fully disclosed the quality of their assets.
 ''We need to get clarity with respects to which institutions need to write down their assets and which institutions are well-capitalized,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''That would provide solace to investors who would then provide capital to the system.''
 Furthermore, once financial firms have raised more capital, a crucial test will be whether they plow that new money back into the market through loans and investments in businesses, said Mr. Webman. If banks remain fearful and hoard cash instead, as they have done in recent months, the rescue effort will only have a modest impact on the economy and financial system.
 ''We need more capital coming into the market and actual investor money coming through the banks into economic activity,'' Mr. Webman said. ''That's what I would really like to see happen.''
 But even if the government intervention is successful, economists and investors said it would not restore the days of easy credit that prevailed during the recent housing boom. Mortgage rates should come down, but they are unlikely to return to the levels seen in 2003 and 2004. Also banks are unlikely to make many adjustable-rate loans without verifying the incomes and assets of borrowers.
 Furthermore, the rescue might not forestall a recession, said G. David MacEwen, chief investment officer for the bond department at American Century Investments. Though he thinks the rescue efforts will help the economy, Mr. MacEwen expects bankruptcies to spread, home prices to fall and unemployment to rise. 
 ''Having this plan contains the damage to some extent,'' Mr. MacEwen said. But, he added, ''I think we are going to see slowing in economic activity. This is like steering a battleship, you make course adjustment but they take time to take effect.''

HEADLINE: Mad Men, Cavemen and Other Denizens of Ad Week

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
HERE is a look back at some of the highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the fifth annual Advertising Week, which took place last Monday through Friday in New York.
 'MAD' ABOUT THOSE 'MEN' Advertising is always influenced by popular culture, and Advertising Week this year was deeply under the spell of ''Mad Men,'' the series on the AMC cable channel, now in its second season, about a fictional agency in the 1960s.
 The actor Jon Hamm, who portrays the lead character, Don Draper, spoke at a presentation sponsored by Yahoo. He helped draw a large audience for the introduction of a system to buy and sell display advertising online. 
 ''I have to say, I do feel a little strange talking about advertising without smoking nine cigarettes and drinking three or four glasses of Scotch,'' said Mr. Hamm, alluding to the lifestyle of his character, a creative director.
 In an interview after his speech, Mr. Hamm said it marked his first personal appearance for an advertiser. ''It made sense to me,'' he added, because there is ''a parallel with the 'Mad Men' era.'' Mr. Hamm compared the new media that transformed Madison Avenue in the '60s like color television to the ''brave new world'' of the digital media.
 Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group, invoked ''Mad Men'' in a celebration of its 60th anniversary and its founder, David Ogilvy. There was a screening of a documentary, ''David Ogilvy: Original Mad Man,'' that was broadcast in Britain last spring on the BBC Four network. The screening took place at the Paley Center for Media, where a video art installation saluting Mr. Ogilvy was on display for the week.
 And a haunt of the original mad men, the ''21'' Club, was the setting for a reception sponsored by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC Partners.
 ''I wanted to pick a spot that was old-school advertising,'' said Chuck Porter, chairman at Crispin Porter. ''It's all about 'Mad Men.' ''
 Although ''Mad Men'' wove itself into the fabric of Advertising Week, the organizers of a similar event in Washington outdid the New Yorkers. Advertising Week D.C. 2008 concluded on Sept. 18 with a ''Mad Men Wrap Party'' at which guests were invited to dress like their favorite characters.
 MONEY MATTERS As much as Advertising Week was meant to celebrate the industry -- as evidenced by the buoyant crowd for the opening reception at Rockefeller Center -- the turmoil on Wall Street cast its shadow.
 For instance, the moderator for one ''C.E.O. Summit'' panel was Maria Bartiromo of the CNBC business cable channel. She guided the panelists through a discussion of topics like consumer confidence.
 At another panel, Marc Goldstein, president and chief executive at the GroupM North America media division of WPP, said he believed that despite the tumult most marketers would ''stay the course'' on spending in 2009.
 Wenda Harris Millard, co-chief executive at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, told the audience at a ''Leadership Conversation'' panel that she believed ''a very, very tough 18 months or longer'' loomed.
 ''And I'm not usually a pessimist,'' she added.
 By the end of Advertising Week, the uncertainties had taken their toll on a large financial marketer, Washington Mutual, which spent about $100 million last year on advertising. Virtually all of the company was sold to JPMorgan Chase, which plans to operate Washington Mutual branches under the Chase bank brand.
 It was only in February that WaMu introduced an upbeat campaign that carried the theme ''Whoo hoo!'' -- from ''Whoo hoo!'' to ''Boo hoo'' in seven months. 
 DELIVER DE LETTER Since the first Advertising Week in 2004, consumers have been asked each year to vote for their favorite characters and slogans to join a ''Walk of Fame'' on Madison Avenue. The characters elected so far include the Kool-Aid Man and Mr. Peanut; the slogans include ''Where's the beef?'' for Wendy's and ''Can you hear me now?'' for Verizon Wireless.
 For 2008, voters added the Geico caveman and the Serta sheep to the ranks of characters. The caveman joined his sibling, the Geico gecko, elected in 2005. Someone wearing a Serta sheep costume celebrated the honor at a news conference on Monday, but the caveman was missing.
 ''They didn't call us till Friday afternoon to tell us he won, and our caveman was in Los Angeles,'' said Michele Barker, a spokeswoman for the Geico agency, which is the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 The slogans chosen for 2008 were both, coincidentally, for delivery services: ''We deliver for you'' for the Postal Service, and ''What can brown do for you?'' for United Parcel Service. They join the slogan of another deliverer, FedEx, which had a vintage line, ''When it absolutely, positively has to be there overnight,'' inducted in 2006.
 ADVERTISING WEEK, EH? Executives from Canadian agencies attended Advertising Week to publicize a decision by the Institute of Communication Agencies -- the Canadian ad trade association -- to mount the first Advertising Week in Canada.
 The executives said they hoped their counterparts from American agencies would attend the events, in six Canadian cities that are to include Montreal and Toronto. But when some Americans heard the dates selected by the Canadians, they were disappointed.
 The Canadian Advertising Week is scheduled for Jan. 26 to 30, 2009 -- just before Super Bowl XLIII, which will be played on Feb. 1. The Super Bowl is not only the biggest day of the year for American football, it is also the biggest day of the year for American advertising.
 SEE YOU IN SEPTEMBER? Organizers in New York have already chosen the dates for the sixth annual Advertising Week: Sept. 21 to 25, 2009.

HEADLINE: Regulators Push for Sale of Wachovia

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Sunday night were pressing for the sale of yet another troubled bank -- this time, the Wachovia Corporation -- in a move that would concentrate power within the nation's banking industry in the hands of a few giant lenders. 
 Wachovia, the nation's fourth-largest bank, was negotiating to sell itself to Wells Fargo or Citigroup. Although the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department were pushing for a sale, the government was resisting pressure to provide financial guarantees to the buyer. 
 A sale to either Wells Fargo or Citigroup would further concentrate Americans' bank deposits in the hands of just three banks: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and whichever bank acquired Wachovia would control more than 30 percent of the industry's deposits. 
 Together, those three would be so large that they would dominate the industry, with unrivaled power to set prices for their loans and services. Given their size and reach, the institutions would probably come under greater scrutiny from federal regulators. Some small and midsize banks, already under pressure, might have little choice but to seek suitors. 
 The talks intensified on Sunday after a weekend of tense negotiations in Washington over a $700 billion rescue for the banking industry. Only days earlier, federal regulators seized and sold the nation's largest savings and loan, Washington Mutual, in one of a series of important deals that have reshaped the financial landscape. 
 As the credit crisis has deepened, a consolidation in the financial industry that analysts have predicted for years seems to be playing out in a matter of weeks. 
 The impact will be felt on Main Street, Wall Street and in Washington. While the tie-ups may restore confidence in the industry, they also could leave a handful of big lenders to determine fees and interest rates on everything from home mortgages to credit cards to checking accounts. Some small and midsize banks may be unable to compete with these behemoths. 
 But a Wells-Wachovia deal also could shift the center of power in the banking industry further from New York. JPMorgan, which bought Seattle-based WaMu, is based in Manhattan. But Bank of America, which recently acquired Merrill Lynch, is based in Charlotte, N.C. And Wells, which is seeking to buy Charlotte-based Wachovia, is based in San Francisco. 
 Wells and Wachovia have been the subject of merger speculation for years. But Wachovia, like WaMu, has been hobbled by bad mortgages, making a merger more urgent and prompting federal regulators to push for a quick sale. Wachovia's share price has plunged nearly 74 percent this year. 
 In the last two weeks, Wachovia had entered into discussions with several possible suitors. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Wachovia held talks with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and put out inquiries to other banks, according to people close to the situation. 
 Last week, it held discussions with Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Banco Santander of Spain, before the foreign bank's interested cooled. 
 As lawmakers worked in Washington on the financial bailout this weekend, Wachovia executives huddled in the Seagram Building offices of Sullivan & Cromwell on Park Avenue.
 Robert K. Steel, a former top lieutenant of Henry M. Paulson Jr. at both Goldman Sachs and then the Treasury Department, who took over as Wachovia's chief executive in July, arrived in New York to handle the negotiations in person, along with David M. Carroll, the bank's chief deal maker. At 8:15 am. on Saturday, Citigroup and Wells took their first peek at Wachovia's books.
 Regulators pressed the parties to move quickly. Senior officials at the Federal Reserve in Washington, and its branches in New York, Richmond and San Francisco held weekend discussions with all the banks involved. Top officials at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Treasury were also in the loop.
 Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, personally reached out to executives involved in the process to assess the situation and spur it along. Citigroup and Wells pressed regulators to seize Wachovia and let them buy its assets and deposits, as JPMorgan did with WaMu, or provide some sort of financial guarantee, as regulators did with JP Morgan's acquisition of Bear Stearns, according to people briefed on and involved with the process.
 Both Citigroup and Wells Fargo are deeply concerned about absorbing Wachovia's giant loan portfolio, which is littered with bad mortgages, these people said. Bankers had little time to assess the risk.
 Citigroup and Wells Fargo were unlikely to bid more than a few dollars per share for Wachovia, substantially less than the $10-a-share price where its stock was trading on Friday, according to people briefed on the talks. For Wells Fargo, a deal would extend its branch banking network across the Mississippi River, creating a nationwide franchise that would compete with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.
 Citigroup executives consider Wachovia a make-or-break deal for their consumer banking ambitions. If Citigroup were to buy Wachovia, it would gain one of the preeminent retail bank operations after struggling to build one for years. It would also give Citigroup access to more stable customer deposits, allowing it to rely less heavily on outside investors for funds. If Citigroup fails to clinch a deal, its domestic retail operations would be far behind Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, was personally overseeing the talks.
 With a big presence in California, where home prices have fallen particularly sharply, Wells Fargo has suffered big losses on mortgages and credit card loans. But Wells, unlike many banks, maintained relatively high lending standards, so it has not been crippled by the bust like many of its big competitors. 
 Wachovia, by contrast, has been ravaged. Its 2006 purchase of Golden West Financial, a California lender specializing in so-called pay-option mortgages, has proved disastrous. The bank also faces mounting losses on loans made to home builders and commercial real estate developers, and its acquisition of A. G. Edwards, a retail brokerage firm, turned out to be problematic. In June, Wachovia's board ousted G. Kennedy Thompson, the bank's longtime chief executive.

HEADLINE: For Team and Fans, A Perpetual Sense Of Foreboding

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The melancholy preparations began one minute after the final out of the season. Mets fans, emotionally battered, stood at their seats, barely mustering a reflexive booing for the Florida Marlins, who had just put the Mets out of their misery by a 4-2 score late Sunday afternoon.
This was not nostalgia settling over Shea Stadium, which now awaits the final demolition. This was a bitter acceptance of what had been inevitable for weeks and weeks. 
The Mets have invoked ambiguity in this final September for Shea, as a bullpen full of latter-day Marvelous Marv Throneberrys -- but not nearly as amusing -- squandered one game after another.
Not to break a trend, the Mets' bullpen fell apart for the final time in the final game in Shea. And one minute later, stadium workers began decorating the field, where old Mets would soon assemble for one more appearance. But nobody's heart was in it, not after the end of this season, in heartbreaking Metsian fashion.
The Mets have often given their fans the general sense that they should not count on too much, that they are subject to forces beyond their control, as shown in the current financial crisis, where people are at the mercy of government and corporations that never had their best interests at heart.
Shea Stadium, 45 years old and never again to echo with chants of ''Let's Go Mets,'' has always reflected the lumpen outer-borough pride of the franchise. Mets fans never have high expectations or haughty entitlement, as do fans from certain teams we could mention.
Nobody has ever called Shea Stadium a cathedral. In style, it was more like the old warehouse or outdated movie theater that Korean worshippers have transformed into a church in the borough of Queens. Not a cathedral -- but a place where people go to be fulfilled, nonetheless.
The bittersweet duality began at the Polo Grounds in 1962, personified by the rubber-faced, nimble-witted Casey Stengel, who advanced the brand of Metsies. One cold night, in that first hopeful spring, I was a young reporter witnessing the horrible Mets and the horrible Cubs stumbling into extra innings, and I heard a fan say, ''I hate to go -- but I hate to stay.''
It has been that way ever since. And no doubt the remaining fans felt that way Sunday, standing in the aisles, booing as a few Marlins and Mets scooped souvenir dirt from around home plate. The fans were mad at everybody as a result of this September implosion.
Early Saturday morning, I got an e-mail message from a female Mets fan. It consisted of two words: ''I quit.'' But then Johan Santana pitched his masterful three-hit, 2-0 complete-game victory, after he had insisted on pitching on three days' rest, perhaps the best clutch game ever pitched for the Mets, given the circumstances.
On Sunday, I drove to the old ballpark. I had been there for the first game on April 17, 1964, when paint was still drying, usherettes wore flight-attendant-style uniforms, and the Mets lost, of course.
Nostalgia for the old place seemed pointless, really, since the Mets are moving directly eastward to a handsome new building. Nostalgia seemed pointless on this damp, miserable Sunday morning because the Mets still had a game to play that could bring delirious joy or abject misery.
As I drove, WFUV-FM was playing a Mets medley of farewell songs and upbeat songs, then made a segue into the voices of Lindsay Nelson, Bob Murphy, Ralph Kiner and Gary Thorne from the glory days of 1969 and 1986.
All of a sudden, as I pulled into the parking lot, Donn Clendenon was hitting home runs from memory, and Lenny Dykstra was running the bases in the midday sun, shouting, ''Whoopee! Whoopee!'' and Nolan Ryan and Sid Fernandez merged into one awesome long relief man, and I got caught up in 45 years of Shea memories, including my father, finishing out his career with The Associated Press at the ballpark, muttering, ''Turn down that blankety noise!'' at the obnoxious sound system. I could only laugh at what Pop would have said about the Mets' bullpen.
In the Shea parking lot, middle-aged parents who never saw Alvin Jackson or Ron Hunt were taking pictures of their children, who never saw Mookie Wilson or Bobby Ojeda. If the leaden skies cooperated, there was a chance for somebody else to become a Mets immortal. But it never happened, as the Mets' bullpen gave up two home runs in the eighth. None of this was the fault of Jerry Manuel, who has been managing this club since June and deserves a contract for next year.
All that was left to do was take a photo of the final out and boo in sullen fashion as the stadium was arranged for the ceremony. Civility took over at the introduction of honored guests -- Joan Hodges, Kiner and the old boys, wearing home jerseys. Some of them walked slowly, a reminder of how much time has passed, and fans worked up to cheer Yogi Berra and Willie Mays and all the old favorites as they touched home plate for the final time -- Tom Seaver was the last one, for the record.
The mood was far more than nostalgia. It was honor, it was respect, it was love. But it was tempered by the sad sense that sometimes, things don't work out. That was true at the Polo Grounds, true at Shea Stadium, and probably will be true at the new place, too.

HEADLINE: Astronauts Return Safely To China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Three Chinese astronauts returned safely to earth in their space capsule late Sunday afternoon after spending nearly three days in low orbit and completing the nation's first spacewalk, Chinese state television said. 
 The re-entry capsule of the Shenzhou VII spacecraft floated down by parachute and landed on the grasslands of northern China at 5:37 p.m. Beijing time. 
 The capsule was located about 10 minutes later by a search-and-rescue team, which helped the three astronauts climb out.
 The landing was shown on national television and the three astronauts appeared relatively well. 
 After emerging from a cramped, round capsule, they sat on what looked like lawn chairs, waved to the cameras and spoke briefly.
 ''It was a glorious mission, full of challenges, but the result is perfect,'' one of the astronauts, Zhai Zhigang, said after the landing, according to the state-run news media.
 On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Zhai completed the nation's first spacewalk, floating above an orbital module and waving a small Chinese flag.
 China called the mission, its third manned space launch, a complete success and a ''major breakthrough'' for the country's space program. 
 The government has said it hopes to establish a space station and eventually make a moon landing. 
 Beijing sees the space program as a major yardstick of the country's economic and technological development, and also a means to strengthening the country's image at home and abroad.
 China, which has spent billions of dollars building up its space program over the past decade, is only the third country, after Russia and the United States, to send humans into space with its own spaceship.

PERSON: William Woodruff 

HEADLINE: William Woodruff Is Dead; British Chronicler Was 92

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
It was a Dickensian beginning, William Woodruff's, to say the least. He was born on a heap of cotton in the mill where his parents worked and his grandfather died. Then, with a market crash in 1920, England's mills themselves died.
 His proud family sank into a poverty so profound that his grandmother starved to death rather than take welfare. His unemployed father sewed mailbags in a tiny kitchen -- the same work inmates did in the local jail. 
 And Mr. Woodruff, who later became an eminent historian, was haunted until his death, on Tuesday, by the journey he took at 6 with his mother to the seaside resort of Blackpool. During the day, his mother would tell him to sit on a bench. From there he watched men, far better dressed than any he had known, enter the hotel. Some came out with his mother.
 ''You're a grand lad,'' some said, tossing him a coin or two. Billy Boy, as he was known, wondered why. And why did his mother jolt awake crying?
 Almost eight decades later, Mr. Woodruff revisited these memories, or ''ghosts,'' he called them. He was by then a successful historian in the United States, but his late-in-life telling of the old tales in two best-selling books made him a celebrity in his native England and a living link to a vanished working-class Britain.
 Mr. Woodruff died at 92 on Tuesday in Gainesville, Fla., where he had taught at the University of Florida for 30 years. His scholarship included more than a dozen books and many articles, ranging from a history of the British rubber industry to ''a concise history'' of the world.
 Then came a success that stunned him.
 In 1993, Ryburn, a small British press, quietly published ''Billy Boy.'' In 2000, Eland, another British press, published it, changing the title to ''The Road to Nab End: A Lancashire Childhood.'' (Billy Boy, it turned out, is a brand of German condom.)
 The paperback version was published by Abacus in 2002. After the BBC made the work its bedtime book in its serialized radio program in January 2003, it became a No. 1 best seller in England, selling more than 250,000 copies.
 The second volume, ''Billy Boy II,'' was first published in Japan in 1997, and by Abacus in 2003 under the title ''The Road to Nab End.'' The books attracted little attention in the United States, but have been translated into 17 languages.
 ''They took upon them a life of their own,'' Mr. Woodruff said in an interview with The Times of London in 2003. ''What's the reason? I have no idea. It isn't good literature.''
 Most English critics disagreed, with The Times calling the books ''a national treasure.'' Many compared them favorably with Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Angela's Ashes.'' A few questioned specific facts, just as some had with Mr. McCourt.
 ''My people were very simple people,'' Mr. Woodruff said in an interview this year on This Is Lancashire, an Internet link to several newspapers. ''They often called things by the wrong name. I've stuck to what they said. I recalled those memories as an old man living 5,000 miles away.'' 
 Mr. Woodruff's works more directly recall George Orwell's study of the sad state of northern England in the 1930s that resulted in ''The Road to Wigan Pier'' (1937). In the present day, he sensed a deep desire to connect with a history that is less and less recent. ''It is a very British book,'' he declared.
 Early on the day William Woodruff was born, prematurely, on Sept. 12, 1916, in Blackburn, England, his distraught mother received a telegram saying that the bleak telegram she had received a week earlier was wrong: her husband had not been killed in World War I. She had kept working after the first message, because she already had four children to support.
 As a toddler, William stood on an orange crate next to his father to learn about weaving. At 10 he spent more time on paper routes than on school, and he dropped out at 13 to work in a grocer's store. At 16, he hitched a ride on a truck to London with only a watch, comb, handkerchief and knife -- and his first book, ''The Wonderland of Knowledge,'' a pictorial encyclopedia that he had acquired by saving up Lifebuoy soap coupons. He found work in an iron foundry.
 He was lifted from the seemingly inescapable prison of his low class and dearth of education by union leaders and Labor Party politicians, who steered him to night school. By equal good fortune, he made it to Oxford. Because he need so much remedial work, the university waived its entrance exam.
 In 1940, he volunteered to join the British Army, and fought in Italy. In 1970, he published ''Vessel of Sadness,'' an autobiographical novel of these experiences that J. B. Priestley said brought ''us close to the huge face of war.''
 Mr. Woodruff rejected an offer to run as a Labor candidate for Parliament and returned to Oxford, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees. He earned a doctorate from Nottingham University, where he lectured in economic history. He next taught and wrote at Harvard on a Fulbright scholarship, taught at the University of Illinois and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. He joined the faculty at the University of Florida in 1966.
 Mr. Woodruff is survived by two sons from his first marriage, to Kay Wright, who died in 1959, and four sons and a daughter from his second marriage, to Helga Gaertner.
 It is not only in his books that his childhood experiences in Blackburn live on: the city runs a bus tour of ''his hardships and joys.'' It includes St. Peter's School, where William was terrorized by the fearsome Sister Loyola and -- curiously, but perhaps predictably -- the ''Oswaldtwistle Mills Shopping Experience.'' 
 Like Orwell, Mr. Woodruff wrote a barnyard allegory. Called ''Paradise Galore'' (1985), it tells of an idealistic boar who leads a search for Happy Land, where pigs go when they are carted from the farm. An enchanted mouse teaches the lesson that true happiness lies in coming to terms with life.

HEADLINE: A Bill Encouraging to Distressed Homeowners, but Its Reach Is Unclear

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
The $700 billion bailout package developed by Congress is primarily intended to put financial institutions on a firmer footing. That, consumer experts said, can only be positive for most Americans.
 The package should ease tight credit, hold down interest rates and prevent a sharp rise in unemployment. But it does not go as far as some Democrats and consumer advocacy groups would have liked in helping distressed homeowners.
 The legislation does take steps to help some troubled borrowers modify their mortgages. As part of the package, the Treasury Department would purchase problematic mortgage-related assets. The bill would also set up a program to assist homeowners by encouraging the companies that service the mortgage-related assets the Treasury owns to take advantage of the Hope for Homeowners program. 
 That program was created as part of the housing bill signed into law in July and goes into effect on Wednesday. It will allow some borrowers to refinance their mortgages into fixed-rate loans with terms up to 30 years, among other things.
 The problem is that ''it is not at all clear how many loans the government will take ownership of,'' Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, said in an e-mail message. ''It depends if the government can successfully run auctions for whole mortgage loans, perhaps mortgage pools that back the mortgage securities. I am hopeful the government will succeed in doing this, but it is an open question.''
 Consumer groups and some Democrats had been pushing for a provision that would have given bankruptcy judges the ability to modify a troubled borrower's primary mortgage. Such a provision, its supporters argued, could have broken the logjam in renegotiating the terms of problem mortgages.
 Because mortgages were broken into pieces and sold to a variety of investors as securities, consumer advocates said in interviews, modifying the terms becomes tricky. For the government to effectively modify terms, the Treasury needs to have significant control over the loans. At this point, it is unclear how much control it will ultimately have.
 ''Keep in mind these loans were sliced into pieces and sold off,'' said Travis Plunkett, legislative director at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington. ''It's a bit like Humpty Dumpty, and it's hard to put it together again.''
 If bankruptcy judges had the power to modify mortgages, it would not matter who owned the pieces. It also would have helped homeowners in cases where the Treasury had not purchased their mortgages, experts said. 
 ''It takes the decision-making capacity away from the holder and servicer of the loan and gives the court leverage to make that decision and to give the homeowner access to better loan terms,'' said Alys Cohen, a staff lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center in Washington. 
 Under current law, bankruptcy courts cannot alter the terms of mortgages on a person's primary residence but can modify other secured loans, including those on second homes or boats. The financial industry has long opposed giving the courts this power for primary residences, which is known in industry parlance as a ''cram down.'' The industry says this gives lenders, and ultimately mortgage security investors, less confidence in the value of mortgages they make or buy.
 Still, Mr. Zandi said, ''The bailout package should result in measurably more mortgage loan modifications and will thus help forestall the surge in foreclosures.''
 Alan White, a law professor at Valparaiso University in Indiana, agreed that ''the structure being created is good,'' but added, ''It all depends on how it is implemented.''
 The problem with the Hope for Homeowners program, consumer advocates said, is that participation is entirely voluntary. 
 ''Despite widespread efforts to encourage voluntary loan modifications, it is clear that the financial services industry has failed to implement a loan modification strategy on a scale commensurate with the problem,'' said Tara Twomey, a lawyer with National Consumer Law Center, who recently critiqued the program before the House Financial Services Committee.
 The legislation also includes a provision to help tenants whose landlord's property is being foreclosed upon. ''If there is a bona fide lease and we take over that property, we have to honor that lease,'' said Steven Adamske, director of communications for Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Financial Services Committee.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Museum Receives Big Boost

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County Museum of Art plans to announce on Monday that it has received a $45 million cash gift and the promise of $10 million in artworks from Lynda and Stewart Resnick, a Beverly Hills couple who are longtime supporters of the museum.
The cash gift, $25 million of which had previously been disclosed, will be used to finance a new 45,000-square-foot exhibition pavilion designed by Renzo Piano. It will be immediately behind the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, which opened in February on the museum's campus. 
Construction of the building, which is intended to house special exhibitions and will bear the Resnicks' name, began earlier this year and is expected to be completed in 2010.
The gift comes at an uncertain time for the art world generally and for the museum, which has been moving quickly to overhaul itself since Michael Govan, who formerly led the Dia Art Foundation in New York, took over as museum director in the spring of 2006.
The museum has already raised the $201 million needed for the first phase of the rebuilding plan.
Cultural institutions have been left wondering in recent weeks what will become of some of their largest financing sources as a national economic crisis unfolds. Four prominent financial institutions that were significant contributors to museums and arts programs -- Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual -- have shut down, been acquired or seized by regulators.
In 2006, before Mr. Govan's arrival, the county museum announced that a new entrance pavilion, part of Mr. Piano's redesign of the campus, would be named for the Resnicks in recognition of their $25 million gift. But when the museum received a separate $25 million contribution last year from the oil company BP, the Resnicks agreed to let the company have naming rights instead to what is now the BP Grand Entrance, a new open-air entryway on Wilshire Boulevard between the Broad Contemporary and the museum's older buildings.
Mr. Govan said that the new building, to be known as the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pavilion, would free up more space to display the museum's permanent collection.
The Resnicks share the chairmanship of Roll International, a private holding company that owns Paramount Citrus, one of the country's largest citrus producers, and Paramount Farms, which distributes almonds and pistachios. The company also owns Teleflora, the flower-delivery service, and the consumer brands Fiji Water and Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice.
The glass-and-marble Resnick exhibition pavilion will be a large open-plan light-filled space with a concrete floor and sawtooth roof to complement the one in Mr. Piano's Broad building.
Details of the couple's $10 million art donation have not been revealed. The Resnicks are particularly known for their collection of old master paintings and sculpture. Mrs. Resnick, who has been on the museum's board since 1992, is chairwoman of the acquisitions committee. Museum officials declined to make the Resnicks available for comment before the announcement on Monday.
The new building is part of the second phase of the county museum's redesign, which includes the installation of several outdoor artworks, including Michael Heizer's ''Levitated/Slot Mass,'' a 400-ton boulder to be suspended on two concrete rails above a pit carved out of the earth, into which visitors are expected to be able to walk.
The museum has also embarked on a feasibility study for the installation of a Jeff Koons sculpture, ''Train,'' which consists of a 70-foot replica of a 1940s locomotive to be suspended from a 161-foot-tall crane over a plaza on the museum campus.
The second phase of the rebuilding plan is also to include the renovation and refurbishment of the former May Company department-store building, now known as Lacma West, at the southwestern corner of the 20-acre campus. That building will house flexible gallery space, education space, administrative offices, a new restaurant, a gift shop and a bookstore, as well as study centers for the museum's departments of costume and textiles, photography and prints and drawings.
Lacma West will also include a roof sculpture garden with two works by James Turrell, ''Missed Approach'' and ''Boullee's Boule,'' one of Mr. Turrell's ''skyscapes.''

Osborn Elliott, the courtly editor who revitalized Newsweek magazine in the 1960s before he went on to serve as a $1-a-year deputy mayor in charge of economic development for a financially desperate New York City, died at his home in Manhattan on Sunday. He was 83.
 He died of complications of cancer, said his daughter Dorinda Elliott. 
 When Mr. Elliott became Newsweek's managing editor in 1959, the magazine lagged appreciably behind its chief competitor, Time, in circulation and advertising, and aped the sort of terse and idiosyncratic writing that Time had introduced. 
 But Mr. Elliott, who rose to editor in 1961, was willing to experiment with formula and take a more ambitious journalistic path for Newsweek. The magazine began shunning the backward-running sentences that Time and its founder, Henry R. Luce, favored, and it started giving reporters bylines, breaking a long news magazine practice of anonymous writing.
 More substantively, it began producing in-depth polling on national issues. In cover articles, often to attract a younger readership, it examined the war in Vietnam and the mounting opposition to it, the civil rights movement, racial unrest in the cities, popular culture, and the counterculture. The perspectives were generally liberal, as had been the case from the beginning of Newsweek's rivalry with Time, which generally reflected the conservative outlook of Mr. Luce. 
 On Nov. 20, 1967, in a departure from its tradition of neutrality, Newsweek moved toward open advocacy with a 23-page section titled 'The Negro in America: What Must Be Done.'' In an editorial -- the first in what was then the magazine's 34-year history -- Newsweek offered a 12-point program on how to accelerate the passage of black Americans into all aspects of society. The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism recognized the series in giving Newsweek its Magazine of the Year Award.
 Newsweek also gave prominent coverage to the women's movement -- ''Women in Revolt,'' one cover said -- though in 1970 the magazine itself was the subject of a federal discrimination complaint by 46 young women on its news staff, most of them hired as researchers to check facts, saying they had been denied writing positions because of their sex.
 Mr. Elliott, defending the magazine, said that most researchers were women because of a ''news magazine tradition going back to almost 50 years.'' In a negotiated agreement, the magazine promised to accelerate recruitment and promotion of women.
 During Mr. Elliott's tenure, Newsweek's circulation, which stood at almost 1.5 million in 1961, rose to more than 2.7 million by 1976, the year he left, though even then it still trailed Time by nearly a million readers.
 Mr. Elliott reveled in the job. ''I had interviews with five presidents, audiences with two popes and the emperor of Japan,'' he wrote in 1977, reflecting on his career in an article in The New York Times Magazine, adding that he had ''spent the most interesting and moving week of my life living, and learning, in the black ghettos of America.'' 
 But he conceded that the pace in running the magazine was grueling and that he had promised himself to lessen his burden when men had landed on the moon. Thus, in 1969, he moved on to what he called the nonexistent job of editor in chief. He later had the titles of president, chief executive and board chairman.
 Mr. Elliott left Newsweek in 1976 to become New York's first deputy mayor for economic development. The year before, at the urging of Senator Jacob K. Javits, he had formed and led the Citizens Committee for New York City, a private group founded to organize volunteers for projects the city could no longer afford to finance. 
 The city was nearly bankrupt and had lost almost 650,000 jobs in the previous seven years. Its economic development administrator had resigned. Mayor Abraham D. Beame asked Mr. Elliott to take over the development agency and restructure it as the Office of Economic Opportunity. 
 In taking the job at $1 a year, Mr. Elliott said a nominal salary would put him above the political process and give him more credibility with businesses. Charged with attracting businesses to the city, he shifted the emphasis from large corporations to smaller enterprises with fewer than 100 workers.
 His turn as a public servant was brief. In 1977, he resigned to become dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, a position he held until 1986, when he stepped down, although he stayed on as the George T. Delacorte Professor until 1994. 
 With his liberal urban enthusiasms -- he helped organize a Save Our Cities march on Washington in 1992 -- his polka-dot bow ties and his conservatively cut suits, Mr. Elliott was a familiar, old-money figure in some of the city's citadels of power: the Century Association, the Harvard Club, the Council of Foreign Relations and the board rooms of the New York Public Library and the Asia Society. The composer Lukas Foss, a friend, occasionally tutored him in his piano playing at Mr. Elliott's Connecticut house. 
 In 1983, his hospitable nature was exploited in a bizarre encounter that was to help inspire John Guare to write his award-winning play ''Six Degrees of Separation.'' An engaging young man had approached Mr. Elliot claiming to be the son of the actor Sidney Poitier and a classmate of one of Mr. Elliott's daughters. When the young man said he had been mugged, Mr. Elliott invited him into his home and gave him money and clothes. It later turned out that the man was an imposter who had bilked other prominent New Yorkers.
 Osborn Elliott was born on Oct. 25, 1924, a descendant of Stephen Coerte van Voorhees, who came to New Amsterdam from Holland in the early 17th century. The boy grew up in a town house on East 62nd Street, where his parents, John Elliott, a stockbroker, and the former Audrey Osborn, a prominent real-estate broker who had campaigned for women's suffrage, entertained friends like the columnist Walter Lippmann and the author John Gunther.
 Mr. Elliott attended the Browning School in New York, St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and Harvard. In World War II, he saw combat in the Pacific aboard the heavy cruiser Boston. Discharged as a lieutenant, junior grade, in 1946, he considered pursuing a career in finance or following his elder brother, John, into advertising. (John, known as Jock, became chairman of Ogilvy & Mather. He died in 2005.)
 Instead, Mr. Elliott, who was known as Oz, chose journalism, joining The New York Journal of Commerce as a reporter. 
 He had been working there for three years when his first wife, the former Deirdre Marie Spencer, who was working in the personnel department of Time, urged him to apply for a job with the magazine. He joined the staff as a contributing editor specializing in business and advanced to associate editor.
 In 1955, Newsweek, historically the weaker of the two weeklies, asked Mr. Elliott to be its business editor, and he took the job, beginning his long association with the magazine. In 1959 he published a book, ''Men at the Top'' (Harper), examining the qualities that had propelled executives to the upper ranks of corporations.
 In 1961, Philip L. Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, bought controlling interest in Newsweek and promoted Mr. Elliott from managing editor to editor. He continued in the job when Katharine Graham assumed control after her husband's death in 1963.
 Mr. Elliott's first marriage ended in divorce in 1972. The following year he married the former Inger Abrahamsen McCabe, founder of China Seas, a fabric and carpeting importer. She survives him, as do three daughters by his first marriage, Diana Elliott Lidofsky of Providence, R.I.; Cynthia Elliott of Manhattan; and Dorinda, of Brooklyn; three stepchildren, Kari McCabe of Manhattan, Alexander McCabe of Brooklyn and Marit McCabe of Manhattan; 17 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. He is also survived by two foster sons, Samuel Wong of San Francisco and David Wong of St. Paul.
 ''I was hooked on journalism,'' Mr. Elliott wrote in his Times Magazine article, recalling his earliest days as a reporter and summing up his career. ''Impressed by its demands for compression and clarity. Enchanted -- mostly -- by its practitioners and their often feigned cynicism. Flattered by the access it offered to heads of state, artists and tycoons. Infuriated by its imperfections -- though as often as not, no doubt, blind to them as well. In love with its humor. Humbled, sort of, by its power.''

HEADLINE: No Sweat In Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
No Sweat
 In Silicon Valley
 Silicon Valley has been breathing a collective sigh of relief, albeit a cautious one. The crisis that has gripped the financial markets has not -- so far, at least -- hit the technology companies. 
 ''There is no visible impact of any significance on the technology community or the community of venture-backed companies in the United States,'' said Ken Wilcox, the chief executive of the SVB Financial Group, the parent of Silicon Valley Bank.
 The credit squeeze has not affected lending, Mr. Wilcox said. Silicon Valley Bank clients include venture firms in need of bridge loans, venture-backed start-up companies and the bigger companies that acquire them.
 ''There is adequate capital in the world,'' he said. ''Right now, it's probably scared to death and sitting on the sidelines for a bit, but the world has capital coming out its ears.''
 The financial crisis has had less of an impact in the technology capital in part because venture-backed companies are rarely dependent on the financial services or housing industries, he said. There have been a few instances in which the housing crisis has touched the tech sector, as when Internet advertising companies got much of their business from mortgage brokers.
 Some software companies that sell their products to financial services companies are feeling the pain, he said, either because customers are buying less or, in the worst cases, going out of business. Still, ''even amidst the turmoil, financial services companies are still buying the software,'' he said.
 Venture firms have continued to raise large amounts, including a $930 million fund raised by Sequoia Capital earlier this month. Of course, there are potential risks. The market for initial public stock offerings has been nearly closed for venture-backed companies this year, with only two so far. The financial crisis will not help.
 If the initial public offering drought continues, ''sooner or later, limited partners will say, 'Holy cow, this isn't working properly. We're not getting out of this what we wanted to,' '' Mr. Wilcox said. ''They will be less enthusiastic and put less money in.''
 For now, though, despite the difficulties, investors are sticking with venture funds. Mr. Wilcox attributed their persistence to venture funds being long-term investments and to ''good old-fashioned hope.''
 Still, those in Silicon Valley, for whom the memory of the dot-com collapse is all too fresh, should not forget how rapidly that crisis spread from Silicon Valley to Wall Street. As Mr. Wilcox put it: ''If this lasts long enough, there is not a soul on earth that won't be affected.''

HEADLINE: President Wins Support For Charter In Ecuador

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Maggy Ayala Sarmiento contributed reporting from Quito, Ecuador.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Ecuador's president, the leftist Rafael Correa, won easy approval of a new Constitution on Sunday that enhances his power in the chronically unstable Andean country while introducing a range of other measures, including raising pension payments for the poor and prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
 Following a huge spending campaign by Mr. Correa's government, voters approved the Constitution by 63 percent to 29 percent, according to early unofficial returns. 
 The victory reflects festering resentment against Ecuador's traditional political class and hopes that Mr. Correa, an American-educated economist, can broaden the reach of antipoverty programs. Repeated economic crises in Ecuador have prompted more than 10 percent of the population to emigrate. 
 ''I voted for the Constitution because of social benefits like the inclusion of housewives in social security,'' said Patricia Andrade Tenemaza, 26, a small-business owner in Quito. ''Better times are coming for the poor in this country.''
 In a sharp turn from a chaotic decade in which Ecuador had eight presidents before Mr. Correa took office in 2007, the Constitution creates the potential for uninterrupted rule. If his popularity holds, he could remain in office until 2017 by running for two more four-year terms, as permitted in the new charter. 
 Mr. Correa faced less resistance to constitutional changes than leftist leaders elsewhere in Latin America have, partly because his measures were considered less radical than overhauls in Venezuela, where voters rejected a proposal in December, and Bolivia, where the opposition is chafing at a proposed charter. 
 While cultivating ties to Venezuela, Mr. Correa has also kept its president, Hugo Chavez, at arm's length, avoiding large infusions of Venezuelan aid while showing an independent streak that has put him at odds with the hemisphere's largest countries, the United States and Brazil. 
 For instance, a ban on foreign military bases drafted into the Constitution effectively expels the American military from the coastal city of Manta, where it keeps a fleet of antidrug surveillance aircraft. 
 In the days before the vote, Mr. Correa stoked nationalist sentiment by sending troops to seize projects overseen by Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. The move came after a dispute between Mr. Correa's government and Petrobras, the Brazilian state energy company. 
 The new Constitution hands even greater power over economic policy to Mr. Correa, 45. Monetary policy shifts to the executive from the central bank, and while private property is protected, the government gains more expropriation powers. 
 Foreign investment plunged more than 30 percent last year, giving Ecuador the lowest level in Latin America after Venezuela. This decline has added to fears that the ambitious programs Mr. Correa laid out in the new Constitution could fail to alleviate poverty if revenue from oil, an important export, sharply declined.

HEADLINE: Competition Overshadows The Inventory At Food Mart

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Jefferson Market, a gourmet grocery on Avenue of the Americas, just north of 11th Street, opened in 1929, the year of the first great crash. It may not survive a second one.
 Already, late last week, the market had the depressing look of deprivation. The cheese counter was practically empty, lights throughout the store were dim, there were gaping vacancies where there should have been chicken, pork, lamb. Amid all the talk of imminent financial disaster, the store seemed to be portending tough times ahead: In places, the cupboards were literally bare.
 ''Boy, things are a little scary these days,'' said a man in a Yankees cap, looking around nervously at the nearly empty shelves as he stood in line at the meat counter. ''I'm looking at a place that used to look totally different. I can't believe this place.'' 
 Change is always unnerving, but never more so than when everyone is waiting with trepidation for the first signs that the sky really is falling, not just on paper, not just in exurb developments in Florida, not just for the bankers whose offices are closing. 
 In some ways, the reality of Jefferson Market's problems may be oddly comforting: it's a sad story, but it's our sad story, the kind we know by heart, not some new version that has endings we cannot yet fully anticipate. 
 Louis Montuori, one of the market's current owners and the son of the man who took it over in the 1960s, has been explaining, sometimes to 20 or 30 concerned customers a day, why he has not had the cash flow necessary to fully stock the store. To start, he has suffered from a huge uptick in competition, from Citarella, which opened a couple of blocks south in 2003; Whole Foods, which opened in Union Square in 2005; and from Trader Joe's, which opened there in 2006. 
 So it's a story of the big-fish markets eating the little-fish market. It's also a story about real estate, and how the West Village has changed. ''A lot of these new families, with all this money, they don't cook,'' said Mr. Montuori. ''People don't cook.'' And if they do, they already know how to shop at Whole Foods -- they don't have the decades of history with Jefferson Market that their predecessors in the neighborhood had.
 And it's a story, Mr. Montuori will acknowledge, of some bad management choices, like letting the staff get too big, and not wanting to let anyone go. ''We were running it like a mom-and-pop when we shouldn't have been,'' Mr. Montuori said. 
 For a long time, Jefferson Market felt like a throwback to another era, the kind of place where a kindly, rosy-cheeked butcher asked after your kids and taught you how to cook a roast. ''I used to place big orders, when I threw a lot of dinner parties,'' said Claudette Fink, who's lived on 12th Street since 1973. ''But I could also call at 6 o'clock and say 'Roger, Roger, Roger, I love you, you know what I need? Just a bit of parsley.' And he'd say, 'It's out the door as we speak, Mrs. Fink.' It was like living in a small village in Tuscany.''
 It is still the kind of mom-and-pop where the family runs the place -- not from afar, but up close and personal. When business was hopping, Mr. Montuori himself used to work behind the butcher counter (his father, legendary for his beef and poultry, trained him in the meat business). His uncle, Angelo Montuori, 82, still manages the inventory. And another uncle, Anthony Montuori, who's 87, still rises at 4:30 a.m. to come to the store from his home in New Jersey and deliver groceries, sometimes to customers he's been serving for 30 or 40 years. When there is nothing to deliver, he keeps busy squeezing oranges for juice.
 ''He never learned to read or write,'' Angelo said of Anthony. ''He's crazy about the store.''
 Back when the store opened (right across the street), it took its name from the original, 19th-century Jefferson Market, a cluster of individual proprietors selling ice, meat, dairy and vegetables that had been named for the country's third president.
 Now the store is one of the last of its kind in New York, a market with name recognition that isn't a chain, a place whose location is grounded in its specific history, not in a focus group or a financial analysis of the block's demographic and median income. It's not that the economy has not had an impact on business. That's part of it, Mr. Montuori said. Food costs have jumped, but he cannot raise his prices any more. And people are ordering less. ''We used to get consistent orders for $200 rib roasts, for parties,'' he said. ''Now that's very rare. That's just a holiday thing.''
 Mr. Montuori hasn't given up hope of reviving the store, but he knows it will take an infusion of cash, which he has started actively seeking. There has been some interest, he was relieved to report, but until a deal is sealed, he'll be waiting to see how the times treat him. 
 ''I picked the worst week in history,'' he said, ''to be looking for an investor.''

HEADLINE: Opening Step On Long Road

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The government's planned financial bailout is a significant if costly step intended to avert economic calamity, but it may not be the last one, according to economists and finance experts.
 The rescue plan would use taxpayer money -- $350 billion initially, and up to $700 billion with Congressional approval -- to buy mostly soured mortgage-backed securities from Wall Street firms and banks. 
 These arcane investment instruments, linked to home mortgages, have combined with falling housing prices to ignite the credit crisis, which in turn has dire potential for an economic contagion that threatens even sound businesses and secure jobs in industry after industry.
 By taking these securities off the banks' hands, the bailout plan seeks to restore confidence in the financial system and ensure that banks can still carry on their fundamental role of handling payments and offering credit to the masses. 
 ''Maybe they can restore confidence with the program,'' said Simon Johnson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 ''It may work, and it could get us through the election in November,'' he said.
 But Mr. Johnson, a former senior researcher at the International Monetary Fund, said further steps might well be needed, with much work remaining for the next administration. 
 The list, he said, includes overseeing the workings of the rescue plan, helping to guide the contraction and recapitalization of the banking industry, assisting homeowners who face mortgage defaults, and in general shaping policy for a nation that will be less accustomed to easy credit and overspending.
 ''Managing this issue is going to dominate the agenda of the next president for two years,'' Mr. Johnson said.
 Besides buying troubled mortgage securities, the main features of the bailout package include restraints on executive pay for companies that sell off weak assets; a shareholder stake for the government in firms that sell large amounts of distressed securities to the government; and a requirement that the government take more aggressive steps to prevent home foreclosures.
 The eventual price tag for the bailout is uncertain. It all depends on the price that the government pays for the troubled securities it buys from banks, and the price the government receives when it eventually sells them, years later. 
 To many, the weekend agreement on a plan is cause for a qualified sense of relief, even for many conservative policy makers and economists, despite qualms that it may be too generous to Wall Street bankers, too weak for struggling homeowners and too costly for taxpayers.
 ''By far, the most important way to help homeowners and taxpayers is avoid a serious economic recession,'' said Robert E. Hall, an economist and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group at Stanford.
 An abrupt downturn, Mr. Hall estimated, would reduce economic activity and opportunity in the United States by 5 percent to 10 percent in terms of production of goods and services, job creation and personal income. That total cost, he noted, would certainly exceed $1 trillion.
 ''A recession costs way more than $700 billion,'' Mr. Hall said.
 There was no assurance that the bailout plan would work as intended to ease financial turmoil and economic uncertainty.
 Indeed, the reckoning in the finance industry has a long way to go, said Nouriel Roubini, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University. 
 The $350 billion to $400 billion in bad credit reported by the banks so far could eventually exceed $1.5 trillion, he estimated, as banks are forced to write off more bad loans, not only on more housing-related debt, but also for corporate lending, consumer loans, credit cards and student loans.
 The rescue package, if successful, would make the recognition of losses and the inevitable winnowing of the banking system more an orderly retreat than a collapse. Yet that pruning of the banking industry must take place, economists say, and it is the government's role to move it along instead of coddling the banks if the financial system is going to return to health.
 Japan's experience in the 1990s is a cautionary example of the peril of propping up banks after a real estate boom ends. The Japanese government helped keep many troubled banks afloat, hoping to avoid the pain of bank failures, only to extend the economic downturn as consumer spending and job growth fell. 
 The Japanese slump continued for many years, ending only a few years ago, a stretch of economic stagnation known as Japan's lost decade.
 ''The lesson from Japan is that tough love for the banks is what's needed,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard. ''In the current crisis, you do want to get rid of the bad assets from the banks, to get markets working again. But the key is going to be in the details of how the bailout works. You don't want it to be a subsidy in disguise that keeps insolvent banks alive. That would just prolong the economic pain.''
 History's most sobering example, though, is the Great Depression. In that case, the government waited too long to do anything to aid the battered banks, and the economy cracked. 
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, a former professor at Princeton, has studied Japan's policy missteps and is also an expert on the Depression. ''The lesson of the Depression, failing to act soon enough, very much underlies the urgency behind the government's proposal,'' Mr. Rogoff said.
 Sweden in the early 1990s took a middle path, swiftly taking over many of its troubled banks. The American bailout plan, economists say, takes a page from the Swedish example by making the government a shareholder in banks participating in the program. But, they add, the American banking system is so much larger and diverse than Sweden's that the parallels are limited.
 The curbs on executive pay were an essential ingredient to gain political support for the United States rescue plan, blunting the criticism that a bailout would protect the suspect gains of wealthy Wall Street executives. For companies making substantial use of the program, the government would limit the tax deductibility of executive pay to $500,000, prohibit ''golden parachute'' payments to departing executives, and allow the recovery by the financial institution of bonuses from gains that later prove to have been based on false or inaccurate information.
 Earlier legislative efforts to curb executive pay have had little lasting effect, corporate governance experts say. In the early 1990s, curbs on the tax deductibility of executive salaries, they say, were sidestepped and even contributed to the generous grants of stock options, which helped drive executive pay to new heights.
 The provision to recover hefty bonus payments is problematic, the experts say. To make a recovery, they say, the government would have to show an executive had engaged in misconduct, not just poor judgment. 
 Yet by taking such action, combined with the provision to become a big shareholder in companies that take part in the bailout, the government moves could well have an impact on executive pay. 
 ''Even if these steps prove to be largely symbolic, it will influence practices,'' said Charles Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. ''The government has made a clear statement, and the boards of these financial companies will be under pressure to rein in compensation.''
 The bailout effort, economists say, underlines the pivotal role of the financial industry in the economy and the need for proportionate regulation. 
 When the Internet dot-com bubble burst at the start of the decade, investors suffered, employment dropped, companies went out of business and America slipped into a brief recession. But there were no calls, or need, for government rescue plans for the technology industry.
 ''Finance is so central and peculiar, so essential, and yet it carries a death threat for the economy,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, a professor of economics at Columbia. ''What we've seen, once again, is that finance is a very powerful instrument, but one that needs to be intensively watched.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths WOOD, WILLIAM HIRAM JR.

 BODY:
 WOOD--William Hiram Jr., 87, of Watertown, MA, died Friday, September 26 at Mt. Auburn Hospital, Cambridge MA. He was born July 6, 1921 in Boston to William Hiram Wood, Sr., born in Lawrence MA in 1895, and Dorothy Pushee, born in Antigonish, Nova Scotia in 1892. He was the grandson of John Thomas Wood, born in 1864 in Saddleworth, Yorkshire, who immigrated to Lawrence as a young boy with his adoptive father Samuel Butterworth. 
He was the great-great grandson of Nathan Pushee, born 1758 in Lunenburg, MA, trumpet-major of General Washington's staff in the Revolutionary War. He grew up in Canton MA and graduated from Phillips Academy in 1938; he received his SB in American History from Harvard College in 1942; he served in the US Army Signal Corps in the Pacific on Saipan and Guam; he continued his education after the war on the GI Bill; he received an MA from Boston University in 1947 and spent the next four years at Yale University pursuing an uncompleted Ph.D. He worked for the Air Force, the Institute for Naval Studies, the Sperry Rand Research Center, and the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics. From 1980 until his retirement in 1996, he was a technical writer with Intermetrics in Cambridge. He spent almost his entire life in Massachusetts, including many years in Framingham and Duxbury prior to finally settling in Watertown over 25 years ago. In 1942 he married the late Patricia Stevens, born in Newburyport, MA in 1922, and in 1997 he married the late Julie Owen, born in Concord, NH in 1926. He is survived by a son, William Hiram Wood of Watertown and a sister, Barbara Denton Wood Barnard, of Marstons Mills, MA and Melbourne, Florida. He was a lifelong lover of his country and the Democratic party; he was a passionate believer in equality of opportunity and economic justice. Gifts in his memory may be made to the Democratic National Committee. His cremated remains will be interred at the municipal cemetery in Canton. Atque in perpetuum pater, ave atque vale.

HEADLINE: How McCain Wins

BYLINE: By WILLIAM KRISTOL

 BODY:
John McCain is on course to lose the presidential election to Barack Obama. Can he turn it around, and surge to victory?
 He has a chance. But only if he overrules those of his aides who are trapped by conventional wisdom, huddled in a defensive crouch and overcome by ideological timidity.
 The conventional wisdom is that it was a mistake for McCain to go back to Washington last week to engage in the attempt to craft the financial rescue legislation, and that McCain has to move on to a new topic as quickly as possible. As one McCain adviser told The Washington Post, ''you've got to get it [the financial crisis] over with and start having a normal campaign.'' 
 Wrong.
 McCain's impetuous decision to return to Washington was right. The agreement announced early Sunday morning is better than Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's original proposal, and better than the deal the Democrats claimed was close on Thursday. Assuming the legislation passes soon, and assuming it reassures financial markets, McCain will be able to take some credit.
 But the goal shouldn't be to return to ''a normal campaign.'' For these aren't normal times.
 We face a real financial crisis. Usually the candidate of the incumbent's party minimizes the severity of the nation's problems. McCain should break the mold and acknowledge, even emphasize the crisis. He can explain that dealing with it requires candor and leadership of the sort he's shown in his career. McCain can tell voters we're almost certainly in a recession, and things will likely get worse before they get better.
 And McCain can note that the financial crisis isn't going to be solved by any one piece of legislation. There are serious economists, for example, who think we could be on the verge of a huge bank run. Congress may have to act to authorize the F.D.I.C. to provide far greater deposit insurance, and the secretary of the Treasury to protect money market funds. McCain can call for Congress to stand ready to pass such legislation. He can say more generally that in the tough times ahead, we'll need a tough president willing to make tough decisions.
 With respect to his campaign, McCain needs to liberate his running mate from the former Bush aides brought in to handle her -- aides who seem to have succeeded in importing to the Palin campaign the trademark defensive crouch of the Bush White House. McCain picked Sarah Palin in part because she's a talented politician and communicator. He needs to free her to use her political talents and to communicate in her own voice.
 I'm told McCain recently expressed unhappiness with his staff's handling of Palin. On Sunday he dispatched his top aides Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis to join Palin in Philadelphia. They're supposed to liberate Palin to go on the offensive as a combative conservative in the vice-presidential debate on Thursday.
 That debate is important. McCain took a risk in choosing Palin. If she does poorly, it will reflect badly on his judgment. If she does well, it will be a shot in the arm for his campaign.
 In the debate, Palin has to dispatch quickly any queries about herself, and confidently assert that of course she's qualified to be vice president. She should spend her time making the case for McCain and, more important, the case against Obama. As one shrewd McCain supporter told me, ''Every minute she spends not telling the American people something that makes them less well disposed to Obama is a minute wasted.'' 
 The core case against Obama is pretty simple: he's too liberal. A few months ago I asked one of McCain's aides what aspect of Obama's liberalism they thought they could most effectively exploit. He looked at me as if I were a simpleton, and patiently explained that talking about ''conservatism'' and ''liberalism'' was so old-fashioned.
 Maybe. But the fact is the only Democrats to win the presidency in the past 40 years -- Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton -- distanced themselves from liberal orthodoxy. Obama is, by contrast, a garden-variety liberal. He also has radical associates in his past.
 The most famous of these is the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, and I wonder if Obama may have inadvertently set the stage for the McCain team to reintroduce him to the American public. On Saturday, Obama criticized McCain for never using in the debate Friday night the words ''middle class.'' The Obama campaign even released an advertisement trumpeting McCain's omission.
 The McCain campaign might consider responding by calling attention to Chapter 14 of Obama's eloquent memoir, ''Dreams From My Father.'' There Obama quotes from the brochure of Reverend Wright's church -- a passage entitled ''A Disavowal of the Pursuit of Middleclassness.'' 
 So when Biden goes on about the middle class on Thursday, Palin might ask Biden when Obama flip-flopped on Middleclassness.

HEADLINE: The 3 A.M. Call

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
It's 3 a.m., a few months into 2009, and the phone in the White House rings. Several big hedge funds are about to fail, says the voice on the line, and there's likely to be chaos when the market opens. Whom do you trust to take that call?
 I'm not being melodramatic. The bailout plan released yesterday is a lot better than the proposal Henry Paulson first put out -- sufficiently so to be worth passing. But it's not what you'd actually call a good plan, and it won't end the crisis. The odds are that the next president will have to deal with some major financial emergencies. 
 So what do we know about the readiness of the two men most likely to end up taking that call? Well, Barack Obama seems well informed and sensible about matters economic and financial. John McCain, on the other hand, scares me.
 About Mr. Obama: it's a shame that he didn't show more leadership in the debate over the bailout bill, choosing instead to leave the issue in the hands of Congressional Democrats, especially Chris Dodd and Barney Frank. But both Mr. Obama and the Congressional Democrats are surrounded by very knowledgeable, clear-headed advisers, with experienced crisis managers like Paul Volcker and Robert Rubin always close at hand.
 Then there's the frightening Mr. McCain -- more frightening now than he was a few weeks ago. 
 We've known for a long time, of course, that Mr. McCain doesn't know much about economics -- he's said so himself, although he's also denied having said it. That wouldn't matter too much if he had good taste in advisers -- but he doesn't.
 Remember, his chief mentor on economics is Phil Gramm, the arch-deregulator, who took special care in his Senate days to prevent oversight of financial derivatives -- the very instruments that sank Lehman and A.I.G., and brought the credit markets to the edge of collapse. Mr. Gramm hasn't had an official role in the McCain campaign since he pronounced America a ''nation of whiners,'' but he's still considered a likely choice as Treasury secretary.
 And last year, when the McCain campaign announced that the candidate had assembled ''an impressive collection of economists, professors, and prominent conservative policy leaders'' to advise him on economic policy, who was prominently featured? Kevin Hassett, the co-author of ''Dow 36,000.'' Enough said.
 Now, to a large extent the poor quality of Mr. McCain's advisers reflects the tattered intellectual state of his party. Has there ever been a more pathetic economic proposal than the suggestion of House Republicans that we try to solve the financial crisis by eliminating capital gains taxes? (Troubled financial institutions, by definition, don't have capital gains to tax.) 
 But even President Bush has, in the twilight of his administration, turned to relatively sensible people to make economic decisions: I'm not a fan of Mr. Paulson, but he's a vast improvement over his predecessor. At this point, one has the suspicion that a McCain administration would have us longing for Bush-era competence.
 The real revelation of the last few weeks, however, has been just how erratic Mr. McCain's views on economics are. At any given moment, he seems to have very strong opinions -- but a few days later, he goes off in a completely different direction. 
 Thus on Sept. 15 he declared -- for at least the 18th time this year -- that ''the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' This was the day after Lehman failed and Merrill Lynch was taken over, and the financial crisis entered a new, even more dangerous stage. 
 But three days later he declared that America's financial markets have become a ''casino,'' and said that he'd fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission -- which, by the way, isn't in the president's power. 
 And then he found a new set of villains -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored lenders. (Despite some real scandals at Fannie and Freddie, they played little role in causing the crisis: most of the really bad lending came from private loan originators.) And he moralistically accused other politicians, including Mr. Obama, of being under Fannie's and Freddie's financial influence; it turns out that a firm owned by his own campaign manager was being paid by Freddie until just last month. 
 Then Mr. Paulson released his plan, and Mr. McCain weighed vehemently into the debate. But he admitted, several days after the Paulson plan was released, that he hadn't actually read the plan, which was only three pages long. 
 O.K., I think you get the picture. 
 The modern economy, it turns out, is a dangerous place -- and it's not the kind of danger you can deal with by talking tough and denouncing evildoers. Does Mr. McCain have the judgment and temperament to deal with that part of the job he seeks?

HEADLINE: President Bush Calls It a 'Rescue,' but Others Are Sticking With 'Bailout'

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The government's purchase of troubled assets may amount to a $700 billion bailout of financial institutions. But ''bailout'' is a word President Bush did not utter last week. 
 In a stark example of the way language is used as a public relations tactic, Mr. Bush and other government officials have characterized the measure in positive terms -- ''rescue plan'' and ''asset relief program'' -- thereby carefully avoiding more loaded words like ''bailout.''
 The media, by and large, did not follow Mr. Bush's lead. On Sunday, a Google News search conjured more than 157,000 results for ''bailout,'' and only 42,000 for ''rescue plan.'' Sunday's newspaper headlines reflected the preferred descriptive, from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette (''Tentative Bailout Deal Reached'') to The Richmond Times-Dispatch (''Bailout: Deal or No Deal?'') to The Wichita Eagle (''Americans Frustrated by Bailout''). 
 The terminology of the financial crisis is particularly important because of the emotions the words can stir in readers and listeners. The Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, suggested that the bailout label was a ''major reason why constituents flooded Capitol Hill offices with phone calls and e-mails, overwhelmingly urging lawmakers to reject it.''
 On Wednesday, in a prime-time address watched by 52 million Americans, Mr. Bush called on Congress to support his administration's ''rescue effort.'' On Saturday, in his weekly radio address, the president shifted his language somewhat, calling it a ''bipartisan rescue package.''
 During the presidential candidates' debate on Friday, the moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS alternated between calling it a financial rescue plan and a bailout. The two candidates both avoided the ''b'' word in their answers.
 But Steve Liesman, the senior economics reporter for CNBC, said that bailout is the more logical word. 
 ''You rescue the unwitting victims of a boat accident,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''You bail out an experienced captain who sailed knowingly into a storm. There are no innocent victims here except the American taxpayer. Wall Street, which should have known better, is getting bailed out.''

HEADLINE: The Richest Man and How He Grew (and Grew His Company, Too)

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
In 1940, 10-year-old Warren Buffett was taken to New York as a birthday gift from his father. Some kids yearn to see the circus and the zoo. Little Warren wanted to visit Wall Street. 
 While at the New York Stock Exchange he managed to meet Sidney Weinberg, senior partner of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, and engage him in conversation. At the end of their talk, Weinberg put his arm around the boy and asked, ''What stock do you like, Warren?'' People have been asking that question ever since. 
 Sixty-eight years later Mr. Buffett is said by Forbes to be the richest man in the world. He just announced a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs that should keep the company afloat and boost his own net worth. And his opinions are so hotly sought that ''The Snowball,'' a biography with which he has enthusiastically cooperated, would be of interest even if it answered only softball questions. It approaches him seriously, covers vast terrain and tells a fascinating story. 
 Mr. Buffett made a smart choice when he chose Alice Schroeder as his Boswell. Yes, he found an appreciative biographer with whom he seems to have a warm rapport. But he also found a writer able to keep pace with the wild swerves in the Buffett story and the intricacies of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway business empire. Ms. Schroeder is as insightful about her subject's precise anticipation of current financial crises as she is about his quirky personal story. And she is a clear explicator of fiscal issues. This sprawling, colorful biography will mesmerize anyone interested in who Mr. Buffett is or how he got that way. 
 A photo of Mr. Buffett at age 2 shows him grinning cryptically while clutching a toy tightly to his chest. It goes without saying that he was an unusual child. He was obsessed with numerical calculation and arcane research. In church in Omaha, he would calculate and compare the life spans of those who composed hymns. In a Roman Catholic hospital after a bout of appendicitis, he collected the nuns' fingerprints to save in case one ever committed a crime. 
 He began dreaming up money-making endeavors from the time he was 6, and he hoarded his earnings. He would look at a dollar, but see the $10 it would eventually become when compounded. (He held off on major philanthropy until late in his life, ostensibly for that reason.) At 14, he made enough money delivering newspapers to file a $7 tax return. He deducted his watch and bicycle as business expenses.
 Surely Mr. Buffett was the only student at his high school to own a tenant farm and earn more money than his teachers did. After that, ''college was only going to slow me down,'' he recalls. Nevertheless he attended Wharton business school at the University of Pennsylvania and was as notable for goofy pranks and slovenly habits as for precocity. 
 A turning point came when he was rejected by Harvard Business School and decided to attend Columbia. One professor there was Benjamin Graham, author of ''The Intelligent Investor.'' Graham became his mentor and role model. Exposed to Graham's idea of security analysis, ''Warren's reaction was that of a man emerging from the cave in which he had been living all his life, blinking in the sunlight as he perceived reality for the first time.'' 
 The superhuman tenacity that he brought to sniffing out undervalued companies also served him well in his personal life. Unable to win the interest of Susan Thompson, he chased her father instead; eventually, she became Susie Buffett. They had three children, to whom a distant yet manipulative Dad was ''the disengaged, silent presence, feet up in his stringy bathrobe, eyes fixed on The Wall Street Journal at the breakfast table.'' But Dad was putting his research to amazingly lucrative use. Only when Susie accidentally put dividend checks down an incinerator and scurried to retrieve them did she realize how much money her husband was making.
 ''The Snowball'' (with a title that refers to Mr. Buffet's way of making things get bigger and bigger) tracks his financial coups without becoming a string of ''and then he bought ...'' stories. Part of the book's liveliness comes from the feisty, penny-pinching characters with whom Mr. Buffett liked to lock horns. The story of Mr. Buffett's business rise is also a social climb of sorts, despite his cultivated folksy air. The book details his eyebrow-raising friendship with Katharine Graham of The Washington Post, an anomalous liaison since he claims that Daisy Mae of the ''Li'l Abner'' comics was his feminine ideal. In any case, Mr. Buffett required a constant supply of hamburgers and motherly care. He surrounded himself with Susie, a surrogate wife (Astrid Menks, whom he later married) and a close circle of other women.
 One of many priceless anecdotes here involves another Buffett female friend who happened to stay in Ms. Graham's guest room. When this friend called, shocked, to tell Mr. Buffett that there was a real Picasso in the bathroom, he replied that he had stayed in that guest room for years and never noticed it. What he noticed was that the bathroom contained free shampoo.
 ''The Snowball'' features equally good stories about power players, including Akio Morita, a co-founder of Sony, and Bill Gates, whom Mr. Buffett instantly recognized as a soul mate. There are many tales of triumph, like the one about how The Omaha Sun, while controlled by Mr. Buffett, blew the lid off fiscal improprieties at Father Flanagan's pious Boys Town. Then there are the business stories that make it shockingly timely. Ms. Schroeder reports in depth on Mr. Buffett's reluctant involvement in the 1991 near-meltdown of Salomon Brothers with lessons on the risks of deregulation, the precariousness of derivatives and the dangers of involving government in bailing out financial institutions. 
 In shaping its definitive portrait of Mr. Buffett, ''The Snowball'' need not make excessive claims of his importance. With story after story, Ms. Schroeder makes that self-evident. ''No group of shareholders in history,'' she writes, with one eye on her subject's life history and the other on his legacy, ''had ever missed their C.E.O. as much as Berkshire's shareholders would miss Buffett when he was finally gone.''

HEADLINE: Bush Sends His Negotiator For Talks in North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is dispatching its chief North Korea negotiator, Christopher Hill, to Pyongyang this week in a last-ditch effort to rescue what the White House had hoped would be a singular foreign policy achievement: an accord leading to the country's nuclear disarmament. 
 The rapid decision to send Mr. Hill to the North Korean capital, days after North Korea broke the seals that United Nations inspectors placed on its equipment and said it was restarting a facility to manufacture bomb-grade plutonium, seemed to underscore the administration's desperation to restore an accord that took most of President Bush's second term to negotiate and implement. Mr. Hill, one administration official said, is ''flying blind,'' hoping to get a previous agreement back on track.
 The fact that Mr. Hill is going to Pyongyang at all shows how much has changed in the administration. In his first term. Mr. Bush refused to talk to the country, and American strategy was to hasten North Korea's economic collapse. But the country refused to buckle, and sped ahead with its nuclear enrichment facility. In more recent years, the administration argued for months about whether to allow Mr. Hill to participate in direct talks with the North Koreans, particularly in Pyongyang. His efforts to go there were repeatedly blocked by hard-liners who argued that to show up in North Korea would be to reward the government there.
 But if there were any such arguments this time, they appear to have been brief. The United States must decide in the next month or two whether to continue sending oil shipments to North Korea; before it cuts them off, officials say, Mr. Hill wanted to make a direct appeal to the North Korean leadership. But it is not clear who is controlling the country, after reports President Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke.

HEADLINE: On Bailout, Candidates Were Surely Themselves

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
It was classic John McCain and classic Barack Obama who grappled with the $700 billion bailout plan over the last week: Mr. McCain was by turns action-oriented and impulsive as he dive-bombed targets, while Mr. Obama was measured and cerebral and inclined to work the phones behind the scenes.
 Mr. McCain, who came of age in a chain-of-command culture, showed once again that he believes that individual leaders can play a catalytic role and should use the bully pulpit to push politicians. Mr. Obama, who came of age as a community organizer, showed once again that he believes several minds are better than one, and that, for all of his oratorical skill, he is wary of too much showmanship.
 For Republicans, Mr. McCain's performance proved mixed, however. His quick call to fire the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, then his decision to suspend his campaign and return to Washington even though he lacked an alternative to the bailout, risked making him look impetuous in a moment of crisis. He comes out of this without an easily definable role or set of obvious results, though his top advisers said he had bought time for House Republicans to raise their own concerns. 
 On Capitol Hill, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader, said that Mr. McCain's support had been critical to bringing the Republicans into the negotiations. Mr. Boehner said that without him, ''They would have run over me like a freight train.''
 For Democrats, the episode was one more reminder that Mr. Obama was more analyzer-in-chief than firebrand -- though in this case, they gave him high marks for his style. Still, given concerns among Americans about the economy, Mr. Obama risked seeming too cool and slow to exert leadership.
 Aides and political allies to both men agreed Sunday that perhaps no episode thus far in the campaign better demonstrated how they would approach managing problems as president. Their instincts, temperaments, and leadership traits were in the spotlight in Washington, as well as their limitations and foibles -- characteristics that also showed through stylistically in Friday night's debate.
 Both candidates said on Sunday that they were inclined to vote for the bailout even though they were not completely happy with it. McCain advisers also began making the case that Mr. McCain had emerged as an important ally for House Republicans, while Mr. Obama criticized Mr. McCain for initially showing a ''Katrina-like response'' to the economic crisis when he said that ''the fundamentals of the economy are strong.''
 As Mr. McCain appeared as a man in motion last week, Mr. Obama's cautious side was on clear display. He loathes gambits as too unpredictable, which is why, aides say, he would have never suspended his presidential campaign like Mr. McCain did on Wednesday to join in the bailout negotiations in Washington.
 Mr. McCain, meanwhile, thrives in the fray, which accounts for his lead role in the Gang of 14 talks on judicial nominations and in legislative wrangling over campaign finance reform and immigration. Yet Republicans acknowledge that no McCain imprint appears to be on the final bailout package moving through Congress, and some of them were trying Sunday to put the best face on his role by casting him as a man of action. 
 ''By halting his campaign, he magnified just how important this bailout was to the nation, and showed that he would approach a crisis by locking everyone in a room and keeping them there until they had a solution,'' said Anthony V. Carbonetti, a Republican political adviser to former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.
 ''And with Obama, you saw a kind of laissez-faire attitude -- 'you guys know it's important, deal with it,' '' Mr. Carbonetti added.
 Yet many Democrats -- even some who have been critical of Mr. Obama in the past -- said they were impressed with his performance over the last week, and described Mr. McCain as substituting theatrics for leadership. Mr. Obama consulted with Bush administration officials and Congressional Democrats, emphasized his priorities for the bailout, and told both sides that he was willing to do whatever would be most helpful to reach a bipartisan bailout agreement.
 ''Obama's approach to this has been very Obama -- measured, cool and thoughtful, which I hope is what the country wants more than theatrical anger,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who had supported Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential candidacy.
 ''The more yelling and screaming you do, you get accused of grandstanding,'' Mr. Rendell said. ''Personally, I thought McCain looked bizarre when he came out of the box saying he wanted to fire the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.''
 Indeed, Mr. McCain's early call to replace Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, drew scathing reviews from some conservatives as brash and wrong-headed. He drew fire on Wednesday from one high-profile friend, David Letterman, for canceling a guest spot on Mr. Letterman's show that night because he had to rush to Washington -- even though Mr. McCain stayed in New York until Thursday for other media and public events.
 If Mr. McCain's moves were attention-grabbing, they also invited mockery: On ''Saturday Night Live'' this weekend, an actor portraying Mr. McCain proposed to Mr. Obama that they both suspend their campaigns and instead hold a series of pie-eating contests instead of debates.
 ''It's what, in my campaign, we call a stunt or a gimmick -- something to shake up the race,'' the McCain character said.
 Yet for Mr. McCain, a theatrical move in the short term has often proved to be the preferable strategy, even if the likely results were far from clear.
 He surprised many in August by choosing Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate -- a move that delighted conservatives at the Republican convention the next week but has raised concerns more recently as Ms. Palin has struggled to explain basic foreign policy views. Earlier that month, too, Mr. McCain sent envoys to Georgia to examine that nation's conflict with Russia -- a grand act that appeared to do nothing to affect the military action except to give Mr. McCain a platform on it.
 Mr. McCain's pronouncements on Georgia that week were in sharp contrast to Mr. Obama's choice to monitor the Georgian-Russian hostilities from his Hawaiian vacation spot. Neither Democrats nor Obama aides expressed concern that Mr. Obama appeared remote from the conflict; they simply said there was little concrete he could do to make a difference.
 Likewise, in their debate on Friday night, Mr. Obama chose at several points to express agreement with Mr. McCain on national security threats overseas, instead of counterpunching.
 Mr. Obama does not tend to take fiery or partisan swipes just for the sake of them. Yet it is unclear if this more serene style will ultimately excite or win over voters in swing states.
 Voters list the economy as a priority, and Mr. Obama's placid public approach may not mesh with the anger that many of them feel. But Democrats say that in the long run, Mr. Obama's approach will appear as an appealing alternative to President Bush and his choice as a successor, Mr. McCain.
 ''After eight years of Bush's cavalier attitude toward serious and complex problems, people are in the market for a more thoughtful approach,'' said Doug Hattaway, a Democratic communications consultant who was a spokesman on Senator Clinton's campaign. ''That's usually dangerous for a politician trying to get elected in a 'just do it' culture. But the time seemsto be right for Obama's more cerebral style.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Would Emerge With Vast New Power

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
During its weeklong deliberations, Congress made many changes to the Bush administration's original proposal to bail out the financial industry, but one overarching aspect of the initial plan that remains is the vast discretion it gives to the Treasury secretary.
 The draft legislation, which will be put to a House vote on Monday, gives Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and his successor extraordinary power to decide how the $700 billion bailout fund is spent. For example, if he thinks it wise, he may buy not only mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, but any other financial instrument. 
 To be sure, the Treasury secretary's powers have been tempered since the original Bush administration proposal, which would have given Mr. Paulson nearly unfettered control over the program. There are now two separate oversight panels involved, one composed of legislators and the other including regulatory and administration officials.
 Still, Mr. Paulson can choose to buy from any financial institution that does business in the United States, or from pension funds, with wide discretion over what he will buy and how much he will pay. Under most circumstances, banks owned by foreign governments are not eligible for the money, but under some conditions, the secretary can choose to bail out foreign central banks.
 Under the bill, the Treasury is to buy the securities at prices he deems appropriate. Mr. Paulson may set prices through auctions but is not required to do so.
 Rarely if ever has one man had such broad authority to spend government money as he sees fit, with no rules requiring him to seek out the lowest possible price for assets being purchased.
 The secretary is supposed to do what he can to maximize the profit or minimize the eventual loss to the federal government as a result of its purchase of mortgages and other financial instruments. But in the case of mortgages controlled by the government, he is required to approve ''reasonable requests for loss mitigation measures, including term extensions, rate reductions, principal write-downs'' and other possible changes. Such requests could help homeowners at the expense of the government.
 Congress forced the Bush administration to agree to a provision requiring financial institutions that sell securities to the program to give an equity or debt stake to the government. But Mr. Paulson will have wide latitude in deciding how large a stake is needed. His discretion in setting those limits could have a major impact on how many institutions choose to participate.
 The limits on executive pay in the bill, also added in response to pressure from legislators, appear unlikely to be used very often. The secretary could take such steps if he bought substantial assets ''from an individual financial institution where no bidding process or market prices are available.'' 
 Presumably, if there is some kind of bidding process, those limitations, over which the secretary also has considerable discretion, will not apply. However, institutions that receive $300 million or more from the program would face limitations on executive pay. 
 One of the most important decisions the secretary will make is the price the government pays for securities. Here again, there is wide discretion. He is directed to ''make such purchases at the lowest price'' that is ''consistent with the purposes of this act.''
 Those purposes, however, are expansive and leave him room to pay well over the lowest price available if he wishes to do so. The act is designed to ''restore liquidity and stability to the financial system of the United States'' and protect homeownership, home values and economic growth. If he concludes that a higher price is needed to provide stability in the financial markets, that is evidently acceptable.
 When the Bush administration submitted its original proposal, there was an uproar over the lack of oversight of the secretary's actions. This bill requires frequent reports to Congressional committees, including a Congressional oversight panel; audits by the comptroller general; and appointment of an inspector general for the program.
 The bill also sets up an oversight board, which is directed to ''ensure that the policies implemented'' by Mr. Paulson are proper. Mr. Paulson is to be one of the five members of the board watching over his actions, joined by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Housing Secretary and the director of the Federal Home Finance Agency.
 If Mr. Paulson wishes to use his authority to buy financial assets not linked to mortgages, he can do so after consulting the Fed chairman. But he does not need the approval of the Fed chairman or the oversight board.
 The bill does allow legal challenges, but attempts to assure they are quickly handled and that the most important decisions can be challenged only on constitutional grounds, not on the ground that they conflict with some other law.
 While the bill does not drop the accounting rule that requires banks to report on the market value of their assets -- a rule that some banks believe has forced them to report excessive losses -- it gives the S.E.C. permission to suspend the rule for any individual company if it thinks that is in the public's interest. That is likely to lead to intensive lobbying of the commission.

HEADLINE: European Regulators Move Swiftly to Rescue Two Lenders

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Just days after the United States government brokered the sale of the nation's largest savings and loan, Washington Mutual, regulators in Britain and Belgium swooped to engineer emergency rescues of two leading banks with heavy exposure to soured mortgages. 
 In the latest sign of trouble to hit Europe from the global credit crisis, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments announced a partial nationalization of the troubled Belgian-Dutch financial conglomerate Fortis, involving a combined injection of 11.2 billion euros from the three governments. 
 Prime Minister Yves Leterme of Belgium, who was joined Sunday by the European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet in an unprecedented appearance, unveiled the accord after a weekend of emergency talks in which the governments had tried to broker a whole or partial sale of the bank to private bidders. These talks fell apart after BNP Paribas of France pulled out of the bidding, according to reports. 
 Less than 200 miles away, British regulators prepared to seize the mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley -- the third British bank to tumble this year -- after no private buyers emerged. The government held marathon meetings over the weekend to try to broker a deal to sell assets to various bidders or sell the bank to a rival, much as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation did when it took over Washington Mutual and sold it to JPMorgan Chase on Thursday. 
 The collapse of several European banks, and the problems in the property and mortgage markets, have raised questions about whether Europe should come up with a shadow version of the bailout agreed to Sunday by American lawmakers of the hobbled financial system. Europe and Japan rejected such a notion last week, although some economists say Europe may eventually be forced to take sweeping action. 
 In Britain, Bradford's demise is expected to heighten pressure on the government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown to step in with its plan to buy sickly mortgage securities from financial institutions, although Mr. Brown had said Britain would not pursue such a program. A senior executive at a large British bank said that no big British banks had pushed such a proposal. 
 The expected seizure of Bradford, which specialized in loans that made it easy for landlords to flip houses as the now-teetering British housing market soared, came after months in which the share price eroded on fears it would be the next victim of the spectacular downturn in the British housing market. 
 While Bradford's failure might be expected, the liquidity problems and loss of confidence in Fortis have raised concerns that the panic that led to the demise of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and the government takeover of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the American International Group in the United States might spread to large European banks, many of which bought financial products packaged with now-toxic American mortgages. 
 For the moment, large European banks like Barclays and HSBC of Britain, ING and BNP Paribas have yet to record the devastating subprime write-offs on the scale of their American counterparts. Nor have they experienced investor attacks or a major loss in confidence, because they are broadly diversified. 
 After the controversy surrounding the slow demise of the mortgage lender Northern Rock, pressure has grown for the government to take a more forceful and proactive stance on Bradford, especially in light of the uncertainty over the $700 billion bailout plan in the United States. 
 In Britain, a Treasury minister told BBC News the government would ''make sure that depositors, that ordinary savers, are properly protected, but also that we can support the financial stability of the banking system as a whole.'' 
 Marianne Thyssen, chairwoman of Mr. Leterme's Christian Democrats, told Belgian television that it was important that the public knew their savings were safe at Fortis, which has 2,500 branches across Europe. 
 Shares in Fortis have fallen by a third in two weeks and plunged 20 percent on Friday on concern over its ability to raise funds and remain solvent after an ill-timed, costly purchase of ABN Amro with a consortium of other banks. 
 In its emergency meetings, the government had been assessing interest for the largest bank in Belgium and Luxembourg from BNP Paribas and Dutch rival ING. But as was the case with buyouts arranged by the American government for Bear Stearns and, to some degree, Washington Mutual, these banks were demanding state guarantees, according to Belgian media reports. 
 Fortis joined with Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander to take over the Dutch bank ABN Amro last year before the credit crisis emerged, paying 24 billion euros -- an expensive price that has since hobbled its balance sheet. In June, Fortis announced it would try to raise 8.3 billion euros to maintain solvency targets as it absorbed the ABN Amro units it acquired.
 The bank on Friday replaced its chairman, who hours earlier pledged it would not go bankrupt. Belgian media reported that other potential buyers were circling the bank, including Santander of Spain, Deutsche Bank and HSBC.
 In Britain, regulators were unable to find buyers to keep Bradford & Bingley afloat. The lender's shares are down 90 percent from the peak, touching new depths Friday as an already skittish market punished the company, prompting the talks. Telephone messages left for the Treasury and Bradford & Bingley were not returned. 
 This year, TPG, the private equity giant headed by David Bonderman that lost a large investment in WaMu when the government seized it Thursday, backed out of plans to invest in Bradford and take two seats on the board. 
 Mr. Brown, who remains under fire within his own party, has latched onto the turmoil as a way to regain some political ground. He played an active role in brokering the takeover of HBOS, Britain's largest mortgage lender, by Lloyds TSB this month, and has added his voice to the already to those calling for changes in how bankers are compensated for the risks that they take on.

HEADLINE: A Cure for Greed

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Of course, it's all Gordon Gekko's fault! ''Greed and irresponsibility,'' blasted Barack Obama. ''Greed and excess and corruption,'' charged John McCain. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva could tell from as far away as Brazil that the ''boundless greed of a few'' blew up the American financial system. Why didn't I think of that? 
 With the eureka moment behind us, I would suggest that this insight offers a way to try to restore the abused financial markets to health. If greed is to blame, the question is whether we can line up a reasonable array of alternative incentives -- and disincentives -- to do away with greed for good.
 This will be no easy task. From populist opprobrium to elitist disdain -- standard social behavioral devices have proved unable to dent humanity's greedy nature. 
 The Soviet Union deployed the entire power of the state to stamp out greed -- and ensured that the state was the greediest actor of all. Even religion's not insubstantial powers of persuasion (think Hell) and coercion (think Inquisition) have proved insufficient to blot out this insidious sin. 
 The free market, it should be obvious by now, hasn't been up to the task either. Capitalism, in all its cleverness, decided that what you can't beat, you should use. It worked to harness greed. To be able to discuss it in polite company, economists renamed it ''maximization of utility,'' and built a theory of the world that everyone benefits when we seek to maximize our own individual welfare. 
 Greed reached its zenith in the 1980s, when the Reagan Revolution brought us supply-side economics and its bedrock belief that the path to prosperity for all required removing every obstacle to utility maximization, including most regulations and taxes. Then financial markets crashed. On the campaign trail, the Rev. Jesse Jackson lambasted America's greedy corporations. And one survey found that 83 percent of Americans blamed ''unmitigated greed'' for the financial crisis. A few years later the markets were again soaring; greed was back in style. 
 Yet despite the consistent failure to temper our greedy nature, I still have hopes. Because there is a crucial brake that has been missing from the edifice of high-tech financial capitalism -- a counterbalance at the other end of the scale from where utility gets maximized. That piece is fear. My suggestion, then, is to put fear back in the picture. When the banker who loses his or her bank also loses his or her shirt, greed will be tempered. At least for a while.

HEADLINE: Bailout Plan Is Set; House Braces for Tough Vote

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Reporting was contributed by Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong and Robert Pear from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House braced for a difficult vote set for Monday on a $700 billion rescue of the financial industry after a weekend of tense negotiations produced a plan that Congressional leaders portrayed as greatly strengthened by new taxpayer safeguards.
The 110-page bill, intended to ease a growing credit crisis, came after a frenzied week of political twists and turns that culminated in an agreement between the Bush administration and Congress early Sunday morning.
The measure still faced stiff resistance from Republican and Democratic lawmakers who portrayed it as a rush to economic judgment and an undeserved aid package for high-flying financiers who chased big profits through reckless investments.
With the financial package looming as a final piece of business before lawmakers leave to campaign for the November elections, leaders of both parties in the House and Senate intensified their efforts to sell reluctant members of Congress on the legislation. 
All sides had to surrender something. The administration had to accept limits on executive pay and tougher oversight; Democrats had to sacrifice a push to allow bankruptcy judges to rewrite mortgages; and Republicans fell short in their effort to require that the federal government insure, rather than buy, the bad debt.
Even so, lawmakers on all sides said the bill had been significantly improved from the Bush administration's original proposal.
The final version of the bill included a deal-sealing plan for eventually recouping losses; if the Treasury program to purchase and resell troubled mortgage-backed securities has lost money after five years, the president must submit a plan to Congress to recover those losses from the financial industry. Presumably that plan would involve new fees or taxes, perhaps on securities transactions.
''This is a major, major change,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday evening as she declared that negotiations were over and that a House vote was planned for Monday, with Senate action to follow.
The deal would also restrict gold-plated farewells for executives of companies that sell devalued assets to the Treasury Department.
President Bush called the measure ''a very good bill'' and praised Congressional leaders. ''This plan sends a strong signal to markets around the world that the United States is serious about restoring confidence and stability to our financial system,'' Mr. Bush said in a statement. ''Without this rescue plan, the costs to the American economy could be disastrous.''
House Republicans had threatened to scuttle the deal, and proposed a vastly different approach that would have focused on insuring troubled debt rather than buying it. In the end, the insurance proposal was included on top of the purchasing power, but there is no requirement that the Treasury secretary use it, leaving them short of that goal.
It is virtually impossible to know the ultimate cost of the rescue plan to taxpayers, but Congressional leaders stressed that it would likely be far less than $700 billion. Because the Treasury will buy assets with the potential to resell them at a higher price, the government might even turn a profit.
That provision, pushed by House Democrats, was the last to be agreed to in a high-level series of talks that had top lawmakers and White House economic advisers hustling between offices just off the Capitol Rotunda until midnight on Saturday, scrambling to strike an agreement before Asian markets opened Sunday night.
The bill calls for disbursing the money in parts, starting with $250 billion followed by $100 billion at the discretion of the president. The Treasury can request the remaining $350 billion at any time, and Congress must act to deny it if it disapproves.
The agreement on a bailout plan was greeted with subdued optimism in early Asian trading on Monday. But shares sank by late Monday morning on renewed worries about the credit crisis, with a decision by HSBC to raise lending rates by 0.5 percent in Hong Kong triggering a drop of 2 percent in the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong and 0.9 percent in the Kospi Index in Seoul.
The stock market in Taiwan is closed on Monday as Typhoon Jangmi passes over Taipei.
The dollar also strengthened in Asia and was worth 106.485 yen by midmorning on Monday after trading at 106.01 late Friday in New York. The euro weakened to $1.4506 on Monday from $1.4614 in late New York trading on Friday.
Ms. Pelosi, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and others taking part in the talks announced that they had clinched a tentative deal at 12:30 a.m. Sunday, exhausted and a little giddy after more than seven hours of sparring. There were several tense moments, none more so than when Mr. Paulson, a critical player, suddenly seemed short of breath and possibly ill. He was tired, but fine.
Trying to bring around colleagues who remained uncertain of the plan, its architects sounded the alarm about the potential consequences of doing nothing. Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee and the lead Senate negotiator, raised the prospect of an economic catastrophe.
''If we don't pass it, we shouldn't be a Congress,'' Mr. Gregg said.
Both major presidential candidates, Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, and Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, gave guarded endorsements of the bailout plan. Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama had dipped into the negotiations during a contentious White House meeting on Thursday.
On Sunday evening, both parties convened closed-door sessions in the House to review the plan, and conservative House Republicans remained a potential impediment.
But the party leadership was circulating information aimed at refuting some of the main criticisms of the bailout, indicating they were poised to support it. ''I am encouraging every member of our conference whose conscience will allow them to support this bill,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader.
A series of business-oriented trade associations with influence with Republicans also began weighing in on behalf of the plan.
The United States Chamber of Commerce issued a statement on Sunday night that said it ''believes the legislation contains the necessary elements to successfully remove the uncertainty and stem the turmoil that has plagued financial markets in recent weeks.''
Members of the conservative rank and file remained unconvinced.
''While it creates a gimmicky $700 billion installment plan, attempts to improve transparency, and has new provisions cloaked as taxpayer protections, its net effect is still a huge bailout of the financial sector that will snuff out the free market system,'' said Representative Connie Mack, Republican of Florida.
Some Democrats bristled that they were now being called on to do the financial bidding of an administration they had viewed as previously uncooperative in dealing with executives who had performed irresponsibly or worse.
''Financial crimes have been committed,'' said Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio. ''Now Congress is being asked to bail out the culprits.''
Throughout Sunday, small groups of lawmakers could be found around the Capitol exchanging their views on the plan. Some said they were willing to take a political risk and back it.
One, Representative Jim Marshall, a Georgia Democrat facing a re-election contest, told colleagues in a private meeting that he would vote for the measure to bolster the economy. ''I am willing to give up my seat over this,'' Mr. Marshall said, according to another person who was there.
The architects of the plan said they realized they were calling on Congress to cast a tough vote since lawmakers might not get credit for averting a financial crisis since some constituents will not believe one was looming.
''Avoiding a catastrophe won't be recognized,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate banking committee. ''This economy is not going to have a blossoming on Wednesday.''
But he and others said the support from the two presidential contenders, Senators McCain and Obama, should provide some comfort to nervous lawmakers.
While the House was planning to act Monday, the Senate schedule was uncertain. A vote might not occur until Wednesday or later because of the Jewish holidays and possible procedural obstacles. But Senate vote-counters were confident they could get the needed support.
One of the more contentious issues was how to limit the pay of executives whose firms seek government aid, a top priority for Democrats and even some Republican lawmakers. But it was a concern for Mr. Paulson, who worried about discouraging firms from participating in the rescue plan, which seeks to convince companies to sell potentially valuable assets to the government at relatively bargain prices.
In the end, they settled on different rules for different companies depending on how they participate in the bailout. Firms that sell distressed debt directly to the government will be subject to tougher pay limits, including a mechanism to recover any bonuses or other pay based on corporate earnings that turn out to be inaccurate or fraudulent, and a ban on so-called ''golden parachute'' severance packages as long as the government has a stake in the firm.
Companies that participate in auctions, or other market-making mechanisms, and sell more than $300 million in troubled financial instruments to the government, will be barred from making any new employment contract with a senior executive that provides a golden parachute in the event of ''involuntary termination, bankruptcy filing, insolvency or receivership.''
While some critics said the limits did not go far enough, lawmakers described the provision as a historic first step by Congress to limit exorbitant pay of corporate titans. ''I think we wrote it as tight as we can get it in here,'' Mr. Dodd said.
Congressional staff from both parties and Treasury worked through Friday night and into the predawn, before heading home for some sleep. They resumed work late Saturday morning, and Mr. Paulson arrived at the Capitol to join top lawmakers in Ms. Pelosi's suite for a meeting at 3 p.m. At least a dozen major differences remained.
The meeting was initially described as a gathering of the five chief negotiators, Mr. Paulson, and a Democrat and Republican each from the House and Senate. But additional Democrats piled into the talks, angering Republicans who accused Democrats of packing the sessions.
For a brief, nerve-fraying moment at the outset, one administration participant said, Mr. Paulson surveyed the circus-like scene and wondered if everyone was committed to reaching a deal. It was quickly clear that they were -- but not before so much information starting leaking out that the BlackBerrys of staff members were confiscated and collected in a trash bin.
At one point, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, was thumping the table, demanding to release the $700 billion in installments. At another point, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, was shouting at Mr. Paulson, accusing him of trying to undermine the limits on pay for executives.

HEADLINE: An Arms Race We're Sure to Lose

BYLINE: By GARY MILHOLLIN. 
Gary Milhollin is the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control and the executive editor of the Web site Iran Watch.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE coverage of the latest bombastic tour of Manhattan by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran may have obscured the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency has released its latest report on Tehran's nuclear program, and it contains some unpleasant news: By the time we inaugurate our next president, Iran is likely to achieve ''virtual'' nuclear weapon status. This means that it will be able to produce, within a few months of deciding to do so, enough weapon-grade uranium to fuel a bomb. 
 But how is that possible? After all, about the only thing the Bush administration and our European allies seem to agree on regarding Iran is that there is a lot more time for diplomacy and sanctions to work before the ayatollahs can cross the nuclear line. Unfortunately, that's no longer the situation. 
 Since last December, Iran has been feeding uranium into its bank of rapidly spinning centrifuges at an increasing clip. Out has come a growing stockpile of what scientists call ''low enriched'' uranium, which is ideal for fueling a reactor. However, if you re-circulate this material through the centrifuges, it becomes highly enriched bomb fuel. By Aug. 30, according to the atomic agency's Sept. 15 report, Iran's stockpile had reached 1,060 pounds of low-enriched uranium hexafluoride, and it was producing a little more than 100 pounds a month. 
 At this rate, Iran will have produced at least 1,500 pounds by mid-January. Re-circulated, this could produce 35 pounds of weapon-grade uranium, enough for a bomb. (In fact, this was about the amount called for in the implosion device that Saddam Hussein's scientists were trying to perfect in the 1980s; according to intelligence sources, the Iraqi design has circulated on the nuclear black market and could well be in Iranian hands.) It would take about two to three months to raise the enrichment level to weapon-grade -- meaning Iran could potentially present the world with a bomb by Easter.
 There is a ray of sunshine here. Experts and diplomats have long assumed that no country would want just one bomb. It would want a first bomb to test (proving its nuclear capacity) and three or four more to deter attack. If Iran follows this line of thinking, it pushes the magic date farther down the road, but not much. Iran is adding centrifuges, so it could probably produce enough highly enriched uranium for a second bomb within a year from now. By February 2010, it should have enough for a third, and the rate will only increase as the number of centrifuges goes up.
 Nonetheless, simply having enough material on hand to make a single bomb is bound to make a difference in how Iran sees the world. Our new president and his allies will be trying to negotiate with a country that could decide at any time to escalate its nuclear threat. In effect, Iran can say, ''If you don't like what we're doing now, how would you like it if we kicked out the international inspectors and made a few bombs' worth of weapon-grade material?'' This threat alone would put the West into a diplomatic corner. 
 This holds true even though no one knows for sure whether Iran has the rest of the components needed for a bomb, or whether the bomb would work. Making these components is far easier than making the fuel, and there is a lot of evidence that Iran has been working on them. It would be dangerous to assume that the other components would not be yet available by the time enough fuel for a bomb had been produced.
 The best time to stop the Iranian nuclear program was from 2002 to 2006, after its illicit nature was discovered but before it gained its present momentum. But the Bush administration, paralyzed by the war in Iraq, mounted only a haphazard and absent-minded policy. At first, it refused to back Europe's negotiations with Iran, without offering any viable alternative. Then, when the administration finally joined Europe's effort, it was too late. 
 Now, it will be necessary to perform a diplomatic miracle. Just as Iran is about to reap the fruits of its nuclear program, America and its allies must convince the mullahs that they would be better off without it. This will require more than the weak sanctions achieved so far. No less than a credible threat of international economic and diplomatic isolation -- of making Iran a pariah state -- will cause Iran to blink. It's still worth a try, but time is shorter than we thought.

HEADLINE: Union Leaders Confronted by Resistance to Obama

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: NEENAH, Wis. 

 BODY:
When Mike Pyne and other union foot soldiers knock on doors to promote Senator Barack Obama, they often confront a tricky challenge: how to persuade union members to vote on the basis of their wallets rather than on issues like abortion, gun rights and race. 
 In battleground states like this one, union voters could be vital to the outcome of the election, and the labor movement has mounted a huge push on behalf of Mr. Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee, built largely around the message that with unemployment rising, the financial system reeling and gasoline and food prices soaring, the nation cannot afford to have another Republican in the White House.
 The labor effort appears to be making headway. Social issues have moved to the background while the economy is foremost in the minds of many voters, and Mr. Obama appears to be benefiting politically. People like Tom Crooks, an electrician at a paper company's research center, are telling union canvassers that they are ''definitely leaning'' toward Mr. Obama because they are worried about their financial well-being. 
 Four years ago, it was not so, Mr. Crooks said. He voted for President Bush, partly because guns were a significant issue for him. (Helped by labor support, John Kerry won Wisconsin by less than one-half of 1 percent of the votes.) 
 ''But this year the economy is very important,'' said Mr. Crooks, an Air Force veteran. ''My wife is out of work. My son has a job with no medical. My 401(k) is going down.''
 His wife's telemarketing job was outsourced to the Philippines. ''A lot of jobs are being lost to foreign countries,'' Mr. Crooks said, adding that he disliked the economic ideas of Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee. ''I think he's just out of touch.''
 Yet union canvassers are also confronting an unprecedented factor in this election -- Mr. Obama's race -- making the effects of their door-to-door appeals less predictable.
 MacDavis Slade, a political activist with the painters' union, said that was why ''some people are having a hard time seeing things for what they are or hearing what he has to say.''
 ''I think race is playing a major part,'' Mr. Slade said. ''I think that's why some people say, 'Isn't he a Muslim?' ''
 Other union leaders said that some members had acknowledged opposing Mr. Obama because he is black, and that canvassers had heard racial slurs against him.
 To increase Mr. Obama's chances of winning, labor's field marshals have sought to make sure that canvassers, when distributing fliers and visiting union members, focus on economic issues, like Mr. Obama's calls for cutting taxes on the middle class and repealing tax breaks for companies that invest overseas. The canvassers also emphasize protecting Social Security, problems with trade agreements and the need for change.
 ''We've lost something like 600,000 jobs so far this year,'' said Anthony Rainey, president of U.A.W. Local 469, which represents workers at Master Lock in Milwaukee. 
 Mr. Rainey said his wife had warned him that Mr. Obama would lose if voters were not able to distinguish his economic policies from Mr. McCain's. ''There hasn't been anything on the issues and it's going to be crunch time,'' Mr. Rainey said, ''and people have to understand where these presidential candidates stand on economic issues.'' 
 But many union members have a history of basing their votes on noneconomic issues, giving Mr. McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, a shot at winning their support. Mr. Pyne, who knocks on doors wearing a Steelworkers for Obama T-shirt, witnessed that firsthand while visiting Scott Siegel, a union plumber, and his wife, Amy. 
 ''We basically vote pro-life,'' said Ms. Siegel, a mother of five. ''As a 'little person,' I don't feel that any of these candidates have our best interests in mind. So if there's a specific thing that sways our vote, it would be abortion.''
 Union strategists say that if Mr. Obama is to win Michigan, Wisconsin and other Midwestern swing states, he will probably need a hefty margin of victory among union households there, because they expect that a majority of voters in those states who are not from union households will vote for Mr. McCain. Two weekends ago, Mr. Pyne was one of 200 union activists who knocked on some 10,000 doors throughout Wisconsin, in Waukesha, Eau Claire, Madison, Cudahy, Appleton and other communities. It is all part of labor's ground game to focus on three million union voters in 17 swing states, with the emphasis on getting out the vote and moving undecided voters into the Obama column, in part through ''member-to-member visits.'' 
 ''Union voters are going to decide this election,'' Doug Burnett, the Wisconsin political director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told union canvassers at a training session on a recent Saturday morning at the Radisson Paper Valley Hotel in Appleton. ''We were the force that made the 2004 election so close, and we will be the force that wins this election. Without union members we would have lost Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania in 2004.''
 The union canvassers said that they were up against formidable obstacles, but that the economic slowdown and financial crisis were making a difference.
 ''In 2000, after eight years of a good economy and eight years of raises and not having to go to war, it was easy to focus on wedge issues,'' said the deputy political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mike Podhorzer. ''It is less easy now. Today it's an entirely different ballgame.''
 In a region known as Paper Valley -- which includes Neenah and Appleton -- the shutdown this month of the 600-employee NewPage paper mill in Kimberly has pushed trade to the top of some voters' concerns.
 ''Abortion is an important subject,'' said Mike Rosselle, a FedEx driver who supports Mr. Obama, ''but with this election, I feel that abortion is not as big because of what has happened with the war and the economy.'' 
 Still, Mr. Obama's race has complicated labor's efforts. When canvassers knock on doors, some voters do not acknowledge race explicitly, said Mr. Rainey, the U.A.W. leader. ''The main reason you get is, 'I don't trust him because I don't know him.' ''
 Karen Ackerman, political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: ''We're very conscious of the fact that many voters have never voted for an African-American for any office. For some voters, including union voters, particularly older voters, there is a reluctance.''
 Ms. Ackerman said Mr. Obama was also new to the political scene, so people have not had time to get used to him. ''We are trying to peel away what obstacles people have, union member by union member,'' she said.
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. says its nationwide campaign effort will involve knocking on 10 million doors, making 70 million phone calls, distributing 20 million leaflets and 25 million pieces of mail, and sending out more than four million e-mail messages. The nation's unions talk of spending more than $300 million in the campaign, including $85 million by the Service Employees International Union.
 Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said he did not think labor's efforts would be enough to win the state.
 ''Democrats here are not New York- or California-type Democrats,'' Mr. Priebus said. ''These labor Democrats are conservative people to begin with, and John McCain is the perfect candidate to put up in a state like Wisconsin because he has this independent streak and is a maverick Republican.''
 Mr. Obama, he said, is not their kind of candidate.
 ''I don't think race is an issue at all,'' Mr. Priebus said. ''A bigger problem is that Barack Obama has a sort of show pony style. The speeches and the classic double speak and being a great orator, that kind of thing doesn't play well in Wisconsin.''
 But for many union members, Mr. Obama's promise to bring economic change trumps all other issues. ''I think a black person can run the country as well as a white person can,'' said Leona Franzen, a sales representative for L'Oreal. She complained that her family was struggling with its home and car payments.
 Leone Brickler, a ''coater'' at the Kaukauna Cheese factory -- she puts the nuts on cheese balls -- said she supported Mr. Obama because of his plans to revamp health care.
 ''I think Obama will do good if he is given a chance,'' Ms. Brickler told two canvassers from Unite Here, a union of hotel, restaurant and apparel workers. ''I hear people say he's all for the black people, but I think he will do what's right for the Chinese, the whites, the Hispanics, for everyone.'' 
 Ms. Brickler told the canvassers that her husband, however, remained undecided, ever since his preferred candidate, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, withdrew from the Democratic race.
 That prompted one of the canvassers, Josh Smith, to suggest that union campaigners should knock on the Bricklers' door another day to try persuading her husband.

HEADLINE: Oil Falls Below $100 On Economic Worries

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil prices slumped below $100 a barrel on Monday as the House of Representatives voted down a $700 billion bailout plan for the financial markets, raising the prospect of slower economic growth and depressed demand for petroleum products. The House leadership, however, plans a second attempt to pass the bill later this week.
 Crude oil futures fell $10.52 to settle at $96.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. After an erratic and confused week, oil prices have lost nearly $25 since Sept. 22. 
 Commodity markets have been shaken by the turmoil on Wall Street while still recovering from two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching $145.29 a barrel in July, prices slumped to nearly $90 a barrel this month as the nation's economic prospects dimmed. But in a wild market, they spiked back up last week because of deep uncertainty in the financial markets. 
 But anxiety once again gripped investors on Monday after a stunning failure of the House to pass the compromise bailout agreement drafted over the weekend. The plan, the biggest bailout in history, would have allowed the Treasury Department to buy back troubled assets held by banks and other financial institutions. It was unclear when the House would schedule a new vote on the bailout, or whether it would pass. 
 Before the vote, investors were also reminded that the financial crisis was far from over. In the latest episode, the government said Monday that Citigroup would buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation. Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis, another sign that the crisis instigated by soured home mortgages in the United States could be spreading. 
 As the economic situation deteriorated, the demand for commodities, including oil, was expected to slow. 
 ''The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate markets has become increasingly uncertain,'' analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors. ''We believe commodities will be unable to escape the contagion. From a commodity perspective our most pressing concern is to what extent the U.S. virus spreads globally and specifically to China.'' 
 The bank's analysts pared their expectations for next year as oil consumption falls because of slowing economic growth, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
 Concerns that the crisis might be spreading to Europe helped push down the value of the European common currency. The euro dropped against the dollar to $1.43 on Monday, from $1.46 on Friday. 
 Experts say that it is becoming increasingly likely that the turmoil will spread to developing countries, like China, which have long sustained high oil prices even as developed economies weakened. 
 ''Things have changed mightily in a very short time, and this crisis has engulfed all markets,'' said John Kilduff, senior vice president for risk management at MF Global in New York. ''It is harder to envisage a scenario where China can go it alone when the rest of the world plummets economically.''
 The darkening economic outlook could further push down oil prices in the coming months if demand for oil in developed countries were also to keep falling, according to Ben Dell, an analyst at Bernstein Research. He said oil consumption could fall by 1.3 million barrels a day, or 2.6 percent, in the fourth quarter this year. That is much more than the drop of 470,000 barrels a day forecast by the International Energy Agency.
 ''This dynamic is similar to that of the 1980s and suggests that investors should be increasingly concerned with the slowdown in Europe, Japan and the U.S.,'' he wrote in a note to clients.

HEADLINE: Reaching for the Right Levers to Ease an Anxious Situation

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, the crisis continues.
Without the broad bailout plan they invented and lobbied hard for, the two agencies are once again forced to careen from one desperate path to another, and to dig deep into their toolkits to rescue the global financial system. Even before the House stunned the world on Monday by rejecting the Bush administration's bailout bill, the Fed was already resorting to the oldest action in its book: printing money.
With money markets around the world seizing in fear, the Fed on Monday announced that it would provide an extra $150 billion through an emergency lending program for banks, and an additional $330 billion through so-called swap lines with foreign central banks to help money markets from Europe to Asia.
It was an extraordinary display of financial power, and it reflected acute new anxiety at the Fed and central banks around the world that the crisis of confidence in American financial markets had metastasized to money markets everywhere. 
That was on top of the $230 billion the Fed borrowed last week so it could finance its previous efforts to prop up the American International Group and other institutions. But these are only the latest in a long series of jaw-dropping departures from normal policy that the Fed has undertaken this year as it seeks to inject vast amounts of capital into the financial system. And they are unlikely to be the last.
Even if Congress refuses to pass the bailout measure, there is more money where that came from. The Treasury Department has already created a series of ''supplemental'' Treasury securities to finance the Fed's activities, and there is no limit to how many more it can issue and sell.
Treasury and Fed officials made it clear after the House vote on Monday that they still had a wide range of tools at their disposal. But most of the remaining options are ad hoc, rather than systemwide. The Fed, for example, can lend money to any company it deems too dangerous to fail by invoking the same Depression-era law it has already used to deal with failing firms like Bear Stearns and A.I.G.
The Treasury Department, meanwhile, has already vowed to buy up billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities under the authority it received in the housing bill that Congress passed in the summer.
The bad news is that those attempts have done little or nothing to bolster confidence in the financial markets. Yields on three-month Treasury bills shrank to just 0.29 percent on Monday, a sign that investors were fleeing from any kind of risk, even if it meant earning a return far lower than the inflation rate.
Interbank lending rates climbed to new highs on Monday, as banks became even more fearful about lending to one another than they were last week.
''The liquidity measures are a stopgap,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. ''You're funding the banks' balance sheets, but nobody wants to lend money to them because they're all afraid of insolvency.''
Administration officials were shocked at the House's refusal to approve their bailout plan but are still hoping to rescue the plan later this week, by offering some modifications that will win over rebellious House Republicans without losing crucial Democratic votes.
''We need to put something back together that works,'' said Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. Though he promised to ''use all the tools available to protect our financial system,'' he warned that ''our toolkit is substantial but insufficient.''
In the absence of broader authority, Treasury officials are reviewing the options for creatively using the same kinds of case-by-case actions they have taken over the last six months -- taking over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bailing out A.I.G., and arranging shotgun marriages between failing institutions and healthy ones.
Robert A. Dye, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, said those efforts amounted to patchwork solutions and had thus far failed to bolster confidence in credit markets.
''The problem is that these are just a series of ad hoc solutions on a business-by-business basis, and they aren't addressing the systemic problems in any basic way,'' Mr. Dye said.
But other analysts said that credit markets around the world were almost entirely dysfunctional on Monday morning, when political leaders and investors alike assumed that Congress had reached a firm deal and would easily approve the bailout.
''It's our view that this package, in a fundamental sense, will not solve the problem,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Johnson said that he had been hoping that the bailout plan would simply stabilize the markets through the presidential elections in November, but that he was now pessimistic about even that.
Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., said the Treasury's bailout plan might have even unnerved many investors.
''I don't see how it can help banks unless it's clear that the government is going to buy these assets for substantially more than they are worth right now,'' Mr. Darda said. ''It's such a big step in terms of government influencing the private sector, and it's hard for investors to take a leap like that overnight, especially when they don't know what's going on.''
The Federal Reserve has stretched its resources to the limit. Before the crisis began in August 2007, the Fed had about $800 billion in reserve, nearly all in Treasury securities.
But because of all the new lending programs for banks and Wall Street firms, analysts estimate that the Fed's balance sheet now has less than $300 billion in unfettered reserves.
The central bank can expand its reserves at will, because it controls the money supply and can create more to buy things like Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities.
''We have a lot of money to play with,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, an international economist at Harvard. ''As long as foreigners have a lot of confidence in our ability to solve our problems, we can borrow the $1 trillion to $2 trillion we need to solve it.''
But Mr. Rogoff cautioned that the real limitation for American policy makers is whether they can maintain the government's long-term credibility. ''The real constraint is not a bookkeeping one,'' he said. ''It is a sense of faith on the part of foreigners that the U.S. government will repay its debt. Our most precious asset is that credibility.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Weakens

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Consumer spending in August turned in the weakest performance in six months, underscoring the threat the economy faces as the government's stimulus program runs its course.
 The Commerce Department reported Monday that consumer spending was unchanged in August, even worse than the small 0.2 percent gain economists had expected. It was the weakest showing since February, when spending was also flat. 
 Personal incomes were up a better-than-expected 0.5 percent, a rebound after a 0.6 percent drop in July. After-tax incomes, which felt the impact of the stimulus program to a greater extent, dropped by 0.9 percent, however.
 The government sent out the bulk of $92 billion in stimulus payments from late April through mid-July. An additional $1 billion in payments were made in August but this was far below the monthly peak of $48.1 billion in payments made in May.
 Analysts are concerned the economy could falter now that the government's stimulus payments have ended. Democrats have pushed for a second stimulus program. The Bush administration, worried about the impact of the stimulus on the budget deficit, has resisted that effort.
 The overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the April-June quarter, bolstered by the stimulus payments.
 But economists noted that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity, had slowed markedly in the current July-September quarter. Some analysts say they believe consumer spending will decline for the entire quarter, the first time that has occurred since 1991.
 Many analysts think the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, will slow to growth of around 1.5 percent in the current quarter and will turn negative in the final three months of this year and the first quarter of 2009, meeting the classic definition of a recession.
 There is a growing expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting, in late October, in an effort to prop up the economy as spending sags.
 The report on personal spending and incomes showed that a price gauge tied to consumer spending was unchanged in August while prices, excluding energy and food, rose 0.2 percent. Excluding energy and food, core prices are up by 2.6 percent in the last year, the biggest increase since a similar 2.6 percent rise in the 12 months ended in January 1995.
 Economists say they believe that the Fed will discount this jump in inflation when it meets in October to debate the next move on interest rates, given that most signs indicate that inflation pressures are peaking and starting to abate.

HEADLINE: 7% DROP IN DOW

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Eric Dash and Ben White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Even before the opening bell, Monday looked ugly.
But by the time that bell sounded again on the New York Stock Exchange, six and a half frantic hours later, $1.2 trillion had vanished from the United States stock market.
What had started 24 hours earlier, with a modest sell-off in stock markets in Asia, had turned into Wall Street's blackest day since the 1987 crash. The broad market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, plunged almost 9 percent, its third-biggest decline since World War II. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 778 points, or 6.98 percent, to 10,365.45.
Across Wall Street, no one could quite believe what was happening on the floor -- the floor of the House of Representatives, not the New York Exchange.
As lawmakers began to vote on a $700 billion rescue for financial institutions, the Voyageur Asset Management trading desk in Chicago went silent. Money managers gaped at a television screen carrying news that seemed unthinkable: the bill was not going to pass. Shortly after 1:30 p.m., the rescue was rejected. 
''You just felt like the world was unraveling,'' Ryan Larson, the firm's senior equity trader, said. ''People started to sell and they sold hard. It didn't matter what you had -- you sold.''
Frustration, and then panic, coursed through the markets. Investors feared the decision in Washington would imperil the financial industry, as well as the broader economy.
At the Federal Reserve and other central banks, policy makers were also anxious. Even before the vote on Capitol Hill, central bankers tried to jump-start the credit markets. They offered hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to banks around the world because banks and investors were unwilling to lend to each other. But neither the stock market nor the credit markets appeared to respond.
Just 24 hours earlier, few imagined Monday would play out this way. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced Sunday afternoon they had agreed on terms of a bailout.
But while Congressional aides and lawmakers worked on the details, the credit crisis that began more than a year ago in the American mortgage market was setting off new alarms in Europe.
Shortly before 6 p.m. New York time on Sunday, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg agreed to invest $16.2 billion to rescue a big bank, Fortis. A few hours later, the German government and a group of banks pledged $43 billion to save Hypo Real Estate, a commercial property lender. At 2:50 a.m., news came that the British Treasury had seized the lender Bradford & Bingley and sold the bulk of it to Banco Santander of Spain.
''We will continue to do what is necessary,'' a somber Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, told reporters at 10 Downing Street in London.
In Tokyo, where stocks had opened higher in early trading on Monday, worries quickly set in. Traders returned from lunch to reports suggesting the financial crisis was taking a toll on the global economy. Markets across Asia began to sell off.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 sank 1.5 percent. In India, stocks fell nearly 4 percent. In Hong Kong, where a big bank, HSBC, raised key lending rates because of the credit market turmoil, the Hang Seng tumbled nearly 4.3 percent.
As events unfolded in Asia, a major American bank was in trouble. Regulators in Washington were rushing to broker the sale of the Wachovia Corporation to Citigroup or Wells Fargo.
At about 4 a.m., Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, called Citigroup executives to say Wachovia's banking business was theirs.
On Monday morning, before financial markets in the United States had opened, Federal Reserve officials were alarmed that credit markets in Europe and Asia had spiraled even deeper into crisis on Monday.
Fed officials could see that money markets were freezing up in every part of the world, even though the Fed and other central banks had expanded their emergency lending programs last Thursday. This time, Fed officials felt compelled to provide a true show of force by expanding their existing loan arrangements by an unprecedented $330 billion.
As investors in New York were getting up, the credit markets were again flashing red as banks reported higher borrowing costs. Investors continued to seek safety in Treasuries. The yield on one-year Treasury bills, for instance, fell to almost zero, meaning investors were willing to accept no return just for the assurance that they would get their money back.
When trading opened on the New York Exchange at 9:30 a.m., stocks immediately fell 1 percent.
Worried officials at the Fed announced at 10 a.m. that the central bank would increase to $620 billion its program to lend money through foreign central banks, up from $290 billion, to keep credit flowing. The central bank also said it would double the money it lends out domestically through an auction program to $300 billion.
Many eyes on Wall Street turned to National City, the Cleveland-based bank, which has a $20 billion portfolio of troubled loans it is trying to sell. National City's shares plummeted 50 percent to $1.50 in early trading, prompting Peter E. Raskind, the bank's chief executive, to assert that the bank was sound.
''It's not overly dramatic to say that investors are panicking. You can see it in the market and we can feel it,'' Mr. Raskind said in an interview.
In New York, 10 executives at an investment firm, Bessemer Trust, huddled to discuss the markets. A question arose: What would it take to restore confidence to the credit markets? There were few upbeat answers, though one said Citigroup's takeover of Wachovia could pave the way for more consolidation in banking. ''It is the type of solution that makes good sense in these challenging times,'' Marc D. Stern, Bessemer Trust 's chief investment officer, said as he recounted the meeting.
But Mr. Stern and his group would soon be dismayed by what was happening in Washington.
At 1:30 p.m. the House began to vote on the rescue package that Mr. Paulson and Congressional leaders negotiated over the weekend. About 10 minutes later, when it became clear that the legislation was in trouble, the stock market went into a free fall, with the Dow plunging about 400 points in five minutes.
At his home office in Great Neck, N.Y., Edward Yardeni, the investment strategist, received terse e-mail messages from clients and friends. ''Is this the end of the world?'' one asked. Another sent a simple plea: ''Stop the world, I want to get off.''
Mr. Yardeni and other analysts said the action in Washington left many investors discouraged and feeling powerless. ''You can come into the office and spend a lot of time researching companies, trying to understand them. You've got a portfolio that you think should do well,'' he said. ''And none of that matters.''
Marc Groz, chief executive of Topos Partners, a hedge fund in Stamford, Conn., put it this way: ''It's frustrating for someone like me because I don't have a pipeline to what is happening in Washington, D.C.''
The stock market briefly rallied, then slowly lost ground in the afternoon. A flurry of sales minutes before the close sent the Dow down another 200 points, to its lowest level for the day.
Shortly after the closing bell rang on the floor of the Big Board, Mr. Paulson, looking exhausted, spoke to reporters at the White House. He lamented the vote, but vowed to keep pressing Congress for a broad rescue plan to help ease stress in the credit markets.
Correction: October 1, 2008, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the New York Stock Exchange's reaction to the Congressional defeat of a financial rescue package misstated the length of a trading day. The N.Y.S.E. is open six and a half hours, from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., not seven and a half hours.

PERSON: Margot Gayle 

HEADLINE: Margot Gayle, Urban Preservationist And Crusader With Style, Dies at 100

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Margot Gayle, who marshaled shrewdness, gentility and spunk to save the Victorian cast-iron buildings of New York -- using a little magnet as a demonstration device -- in a crusade that led to the preservation of historic SoHo, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.
 The death was announced by her daughter Carol. 
 Ms. Gayle began her mission in the late 1950s, when a group of neighbors gathered in her Greenwich Village apartment to plot how to save the Victorian-Gothic curiosity that was the Jefferson Market Courthouse around the corner.
 A half-century later, not only was the courthouse preserved (as a library), but so were scores of iron-framed buildings, Bishop's Crook lampposts, stately public clocks and many other wisps of a past that Ms. Gayle had deemed worth keeping.
 ''Why not let people in the future enjoy some of the things we thought were extremely fine?'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1998.
 Ms. Gayle's crowning achievement was helping to win the establishment of the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District, encompassing 26 blocks in what was originally an industrial quarter known as Hell's Hundred Acres. The designation not only preserved important buildings and artifacts, it also saved SoHo from the kind of large-scale urban renewal that occurred north of Houston Street.
 ''It would be hard to find a district that was so single-mindedly engineered and promoted as that district was by Margot,'' Harmon H. Goldstone, a former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, said in an interview with The Times in 1988.
 The writer Brendan Gill said in a speech in 1997, ''She badgered everyone in and out of government until it became a protected place.''
 Ms. Gayle combined the skills of an author (she wrote four books), Democratic Party activist, city bureaucrat, newspaper columnist and tour guide to forge such a distinctive public personality that Mayor Edward I. Koch called her the queen of New York. 
 She started organizations like the Victorian Society in America and Friends of Cast Iron Architecture. When she went to Albany to lobby for preservation concerns, she took Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to pose with flattered legislators. 
 People were charmed by her use of a magnet to offer proof positive that a building was, in fact, made of iron. And they could be equally charmed when, in a soft cadence, she sprinkled her conversation with old-fashioned expressions like ''nifty,'' ''gosh-darned'' and ''goodness knows.'' But the soft coating disguised a steely persistence.
 ''Heaven help the person she gets her teeth into,'' Gene A. Norman, another landmarks commission chairman, once said.
 Margot McCoy was born in Kansas City, Mo., on May 14, 1908. Her father was in the automobile business, and the family moved frequently. She attended a different school every year, including one in London.
 After graduating from the University of Michigan, she went to Atlanta and got a job as a social worker, earned a master's degree in bacteriology from Emory University and married William T. Gayle, an accountant. During World War II, she did volunteer work publicizing civil defense efforts.
 After moving to New York, she had a stint as a script writer for CBS Radio, became a freelance magazine writer and started a public relations business. She later held public relations jobs in city government and for 16 years wrote an architecture column for The Daily News.
 In 1957, having joined the Samuel J. Tilden Club, a Democratic Party reform group, she ran unsuccessfully for the City Council under the slogan, ''We need a woman in City Hall,'' campaigning with her two daughters in suffragist costumes.
 That year, she began inviting friends to meet in her living room to discuss the stalled clocks on the four sides of the Jefferson Market Courthouse, at Avenue of the Americas and West 10th Street. A brick-and-stone edifice built in the 1870s, it had had been going unused by the city, and the hands of its clock had been stuck at 3:20 for two years.
 The group's stated agenda was to fix the clock, but Ms. Gayle's real purpose was to save the building from the auction block. Since the clock needed the building for support, the building's preservation was presented as a necessary afterthought. Even Ms. Gayle's friends called the courthouse ''that ugly old pile.''
 At Christmas 1959, her committee sent Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. a telegram saying they did not want ''two front teeth'' but rather a working clock. The mayor took the building off the auction block. Ms. Gayle enlisted more supporters, including the writers Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford and the poet E. E. Cummings, and by 1961, the group had raised enough money to restart and illuminate the clock. (They succeeded in having the courthouse reopened as a public library in 1967.)
 Ms. Gayle soon became a strong voice in lobbying for a landmarks preservation law, which the city did enact in 1965, in response in part to the outcry over the destruction of Pennsylvania Station and Alan Burnham's seminal study of New York landmarks.
 Ms. Gayle founded the Friends of Cast Iron Architecture in 1970, a propitious time for opponents of an expressway that would have sliced through SoHo along Broome Street. Her arguments about preserving cast-iron architecture helped kill the freeway plan in 1971.
 Two years later, the center of what had become SoHo was named a historic district, preserving its low-rise character and bringing back features like cobblestone streets.
 Ms. Gayle's marriage ended in divorce in 1957. In addition to her daughter Carol Gayle, of Lake Forest, Ill., survivors include another daughter, Gretchen Gayle Ellsworth, of Washington; six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
 Ms. Gayle went on to fight to preserve specific cast-iron buildings around the nation, as well as antique street clocks in Manhattan and Brooklyn. She never shied from a cause. When SoHo's new residents wanted to plant street trees, she opposed them as historically inaccurate in a manufacturing district. 
 Ms. Gayle had not been entirely thrilled with SoHo's transformation into a chic shopping center but had conceded that it was probably necessary.
 ''That's the price of getting something saved,'' she once said. ''There's got to be money in it for someone.''

HEADLINE: Authorities Aid Banks In Europe

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The turmoil that has rocked the United States banking system spread to Europe on Monday, buffeting institutions in at least four countries with a chain of new failures. 
 At the same time, new economic data also hinted that a recession in Europe could be near, intensifying the sell-off and sending the euro lower against the dollar. 
 Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg came up with 11.2 billion euros, or $16.2 billion, to rescue the retail bank Fortis. The British Treasury said it had seized the lender Bradford & Bingley, after no private buyer emerged. Germany and its banks promised 30 billion euros to save Hypo Real Estate, a commercial property lender. 
 Investors pounded the shares of Commerzbank, a German bank with operations that resemble those of Hypo Real Estate, while Royal Bank of Scotland suffered because it was part of a banking consortium with Fortis that bought ABN Amro last year. Shares of Dexia, a French-Belgian bank that lends heavily to municipalities, plunged on rumors of an impending capital increase.
 With tight credit markets, the race to find affordable credit sank Glitnir Bank of Iceland, which sold a 75 percent stake to its government. The bank said the cost of its short-term financing had risen to unbearable levels in the last two weeks, since the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers.
 The latest turn of events dealt a blow to European bank executives and politicians who had suggested in recent months that the worst was over for Europe. 
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, crowed last week about the end of American dominance in finance, and the validation of Germany's more conservative banking system.
 That may still be true, but European officials left little doubt Monday that they were unnerved as credit markets pummeled institutions that betrayed even a whiff of weakness.
 ''I can only hope that confidence will come back,'' said Jean-Claude Juncker, who is prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg, ''and that this casino game that's going on independently from the good fundamentals stops.''
 The European Central Bank, which has stepped in repeatedly to ensure adequate overnight cash for banks, went even further Monday. It granted banks in the 15-nation euro area a 150 billion-euro loan for 30 days and promised more to head off the end-of-the-year cash squeeze that is normal in good times, and will probably be intense this year.
 But a systemic bailout along the lines of what Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. proposed to Congress still seemed unlikely in Continental Europe, analysts said. The proposed United States plan was prompted by the housing market, which shows few signs of recovery. That is not the case in Europe, which gives experts confidence that case-by-case rescues can do the job here.
 ''It's completely unnecessary to do a Paulson-style plan in Europe,'' said Sylvester Eijffinger, a professor of European financial economics at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. ''These are isolated problems.''
 The exception may turn out to be Britain, analysts said, where a housing crisis similar to the one in the United States is feeding the banking crisis.
 Bradford & Bingley lost it all because it gave mortgages to landlords who used rental income to repay the loans. But a British economy that is poised for a painful recession on the back of a near-dead real estate market proved a merciless environment for the lender.
 The main source of nervousness in financial markets is still the United States. But European banks -- some of which also indulged in the global borrowing binge -- are finding no relief from the jarring and persistent tightening of credit.
 On Monday, executives pinned the downfall of Fortis squarely on its involvement in a bid for ABN Amro. Fortis paid 24 billion euros as part of the consortium that took over ABN Amro, and will now sell its part of that bank, a Dutch retail business, to recapitalize itself.
 Filip Dierckx, who recently became chief executive at Fortis, attributed the cruel turn of events Monday to the borrowing Fortis undertook to be part of that record-breaking deal.
 ''If you look at some of the decisions that were taken in the past, then you can say that probably they were done at the wrong moment,'' Mr. Dierckx said. ''If you want me to say that some of the decisions were not the best, I will indeed confirm that.''
 But growing doubts about Europe's macroeconomic direction amplified a rising sense of unease on a continent accustomed to regarding the financial crisis as a primarily American problem.
 A survey published by the European Commission showed business and consumer confidence in September -- even before the latest turmoil -- dipped almost to the level it registered after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
 Many economists now expect the economy of the euro area to contract in the third quarter, for the second three-month period in a row, meeting a common definition of a recession.
 That would be a setback for the optimists, the European Central Bank among them, who had forecast the economy would shrug off rising credit market turmoil and bounce back strongly.
 ''The problem now is that the recovery looks like it's going to be very slow,'' said Aurelio Maccario, chief euro zone economist at UniCredit in Milan. ''The financial crisis is taking a huge toll on that process in Europe.''
 The European Central Bank is expected to leave its key interest rate at 4.25 percent when it meets Thursday, and most analysts are still leery about predicting a quick cut in borrowing costs. The bank is still focused strongly on inflation, which is running at nearly double its 2 percent target.

HEADLINE: For Two G.M.'s, Payoffs Come Without Playoffs

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The season was over, and Omar Minaya had some explaining to do. He walked into the interview room Monday afternoon in the now-retired Shea Stadium, wearing a dark gray suit with a white shirt, open at the top, and proceeded to espouse an imperious baseball philosophy more closely identified with the Bronx. 
 ''There's only one winning product in New York -- winning the championship,'' he would say, in summary of a discourse of what went wrong for the Mets, again. ''If you don't win the championship, you didn't get the job done.'' 
 Something tells me the Wilpon family could have lived with a sweep of the Marlins last weekend, the guarantee of one measly division series game at home. But in the wake of another late September collapse, we can also understand the need to resort to Steinbrenneresque cliche. 
 Brian Cashman's Yankees didn't make the playoffs either, with the same 89-73 record as the Mets, but Minaya's team has in consecutive seasons now turned late-season failure into utter fiasco. A general manager in New York City just may find himself adding to the growing ranks of the unemployed after such a repeat performance. Not Minaya, who according to recent reports and in apparent contradiction of his aforementioned Big Apple commentary is on the verge of receiving a new four-year deal.
 In this heated election season, there were no chants of ''four more years'' at Shea during the final days of what the fans correctly feared was a dying season. At this point, they would probably cheer the demolition of the Minaya regime along with the ballpark. But far beyond the visceral reaction to another weekend of despair, the debate on Minaya could also begin with the question, ''Are the Mets better off than they were four years ago?''
 He inherited a team that won 71 games in 2004 and drew roughly 2.3 million fans. By 2006, the corresponding numbers were 97 and nearly 3.4 million, at that time a team attendance record. This season, the attraction no doubt enhanced by Shea's date with the wrecking ball, the Mets announced a gate of just over four million.
 Add it all up -- on the business side, certainly -- and it is difficult to counter a claim that Minaya has done for the Wilpons what they hired him to do. Starting with little more than the left side of an infield, he benefited from increased payroll but made the Mets a marketable commodity in a Yankee-dominated city. Right on accelerated schedule, in conjunction with the start of their cable TV network and as Citi Field rose next door. 
 Given that mandate, there was bound to be higher risk versus reward. Hence, Pedro Martinez, Minaya's first major signing, may have begot Carlos Beltran and others, but he didn't last long enough as a quality starter, much less a dominant one. 
 There were others brought to Shea by Minaya years past their primes, setting off a domino effect that probably cost the Mets at least one more playoff run. Minaya, along with Jeff Wilpon, panicked early last season and damaged Willie Randolph's clubhouse authority by firing his handpicked hitting coach, Rick Down, and then Minaya botched Randolph's firing in June. 
 His bullpen blew up again in August as soon as Billy Wagner broke down. And as Minaya acknowledged Monday, after a new and more popular manager failed to get the Mets into the playoffs, the team dynamic is a serious issue when a three-game series against an inferior divisional opponent produces five runs with the season in the balance.
 ''Bottom line, we're not playing this week,'' he said, forecasting change that must begin with the addition of a key position player with a strong personality to provide the daily leadership role not suited to the current core talent. 
 Nor will we see any more of the team Cashman built for more than $200 million, its payroll ever rising during an eight-year fade from World Series champion to wild-card contender. Like Minaya, Cashman is an earnest, likeable man. Unlike Minaya, he seldom seems to be called out or held publicly accountable for mistakes -- and there have been enough in recent years that would have devastated franchises with lesser payrolls, including the Mets.
 Cashman, of course, gets credit for presiding over three championship teams -- probably more credit than he deserves given that he inherited the players central to the Yankees' 1998-2000 success. He gets sympathy points for having to deal with the impetuousness of the Steinbrenners, George to Hank. But granted autonomy on the Johan Santana call last winter, he decided to pass, and that probably doomed Yankee Stadium to a silent final October.
 Through it all, the Yankees appear to want Cashman back and he may be sitting pretty, with options elsewhere. Meanwhile, Minaya gets a lucrative new deal, an opportunity to fill in the positional blanks, rebuild the bullpen. 
 ''I believe in this town; fans give guys second chances,'' Minaya said. Or three, if they are counting by collapses.

HEADLINE: The Banking Crisis Trickles Up

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Ben White contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The crisis gripping the nation's banks took a troubling turn on Monday as investors' confidence in even the largest and strongest institutions spiraled lower.
 Financial shares plunged 16 percent on one of the darkest days for the American stock market since the 1987 crash.
 After the House of Representatives rejected a rescue for the financial industry Monday, fears grew that more banks, particularly small and midsize lenders, could run into trouble unless a new plan emerged quickly. 
 Even shares in the three banks that have survived the crisis as the largest in the industry -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- fell more than 10 percent Monday as anxiety gripped markets. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which transformed into bank holding companies last week, fell more than 12 percent.
 Regional banks were punished even more severely as investors scrambled to figure out which of them might fall next in the absence of a bailout plan. National City Corporation, Downey Financial Corporation and Sovereign Bancorp, lenders pressured by substantial exposure to soured mortgages, were especially hard-hit, falling 63 percent, 48 percent and 36 percent respectively on the heels of the government's seizure Thursday of Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan. 
 ''With the credit markets drying up and bank-to-bank lending rates through the roof, the ability of these banks to weather the storm is being called into question,'' said Jim Eckenrode, a banking analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services consulting firm. 
 Wachovia plunged more than 70 percent after it was sold to Citigroup on Monday. Citigroup will pay $1 a share, or about $2.2 billion, for Wachovia's banking operations. Citigroup will assume the first $42 billion of losses from Wachovia's riskiest mortgages and transfer to the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants. In exchange, the F.D.I.C. will absorb all losses above that level.
 The reshaping of Wall Street since the collapse of Lehman Brothers just two weeks ago has also touched off a wave of shotgun mergers among the nation's commercial banks. Those with relatively deep pools of financing are scouring the landscape for weak targets that they believe can give them a more dominant position in the marketplace when the dust from the present financial crisis settles. 
 ''What we have gotten is 10 years of consolidation in the last 10 days,'' said Michael Poulos, a partner at Oliver Wyman, a financial services consulting firm. ''The current situation has created opportunities for acquirers that are really unprecedented.''
 The past decade, in many ways, has been a golden age of banking. Profits were high, buoyed by fat lending margins and relatively few loan losses. Plenty of money was sloshing around in the financial system. And Wall Street's loan packaging machine helped ensure it would not go dry. 
 Now, that has all changed. Only the strongest banks are bound to survive. ''Over the next two years, we are going to see a lot of consolidation,'' said Jimmy Dunne, the senior managing principal of Sandler O'Neill & Partners in New York. ''There will be the forced consolidation that we are seeing. There will be bank failures that will follow it up. And then, after a while you will see a large amount of consolidation among smaller and midsize banks.''
 Bankers say that the industry is quickly headed to a new era dominated by two types of banks. On the one hand, there will be small community banks and credit unions that offer personalized service and take advantage of their local ties. On the other, there will be behemoths like Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase that compete on the breadth of their products and potential cost savings from their size.
 But the towering presence of the biggest banks brings heightened concerns. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup now sit on more than 30 percent of the industry's deposits. For consumers, that may turn out to be good news. ''They can afford to pay higher rates for deposits and be more aggressive on going after business,'' said John Kanas, the former chief executive of North Fork Bank, which he sold to Capital One Financial in 2006. And the bigger the balance sheet, analysts say, the safer customers' deposits are, because the government will be less likely to allow the institution to fail.
 Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College, said that belief was now firmly embedded in the financial culture. ''Bank of America, Citi, and JPMorgan are going to be quasi-state entities now. They will never be allowed to fail, and they will be closely monitored,'' he said. ''They are surrogates for the American economy.'' 
 Americans have long had deep reservations about a concentration of corporate power, and for decades reined in banks for just this reason. The McFadden Act of 1927 permanently established the Federal Reserve system, but in a political compromise, imposed a ban on banks opening new branches across state lines. As a result, retail banking was fragmented across the nation.
 That remained the case until 1994, when banks won a battle to change the law to permit the creation of national franchises. The result was a wave of consolidation in the late 1990s, paving the way for the formation of the banking industry's current giants and a handful of big regional lenders. 
 At a state level, the same thing had occurred in Texas's banking industry in the late 1980s which, in many ways, may turn out to be a model for today's nationwide mess. For years, Texas banks lent aggressively to oil and gas partnerships and real estate developers on the belief they would always get paid back. But with a sharp decline in oil prices and a sudden change in the tax laws, the market collapsed. 
 The result was that virtually all of the largest banks in Texas -- names like Republic Bank, InterFirst Bank, First National City Bank, and Texas Commerce Bank -- either failed or were snapped up by bigger, out-of-state institutions. Crippled by their widening losses, they pulled back on the amount of money they lent. North Carolina National Bank, which acquired several ailing Texas banks during this period and was Bank of America's predecessor, earned the nickname ''No Cash for Nobody'' for its reputation as a stingy lender. 
 But as the economy rebounded, the bigger banks began gaining a bigger share of the Texas market. Community banks, offering personalized service, saw an opening as a popular alternative. Today, the Texas market is dominated by Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase. But Frost Bank of San Antonio is the only midsize Texas bank left standing, along with a number of smaller lenders.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers at Impasse on Incentives for Renewable Energy

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The House and the Senate conceded Monday that they were in a stalemate over proposals to provide tax incentives for the production and use of renewable energy, leaving the future of the nascent industry in limbo.
 Tax credits for investing in solar energy and producing wind energy will expire at the end of the year unless Congress resolves the impasse, and lawmakers said they saw no immediate prospect of an agreement.
 The deadlock comes at a time when economists and politicians of all stripes are saying the United States must rapidly develop solar, wind and other energy sources as alternatives to oil. 
 ''Congress is furthering our dependence on foreign sources of energy -- dirty, polluting sources of energy,'' said Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. ''It's scaring away investment, just as our industry is beginning to get a toehold. Solar projects are already being delayed.''
 Gregory S. Wetstone, director of government affairs at the American Wind Energy Association, another trade group, said the tax legislation had broad bipartisan support in the House and the Senate, but had been ''caught in a crossfire on unrelated issues.''
 The National Association of Home Builders, the Sierra Club and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association are among the many groups that have urged Congress to extend and expand the energy tax breaks, scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
 ''We are down but not out,'' Mr. Wetstone said Monday. ''If Congress fails to act, it's a real blow to renewable energy. It means that fewer wind turbines will be used to generate pollution-free power in the United States.''
 The legislation would also provide tax credits for homeowners and home builders to make their properties more energy efficient.
 ''Our members build homes that are significantly more energy efficient than those of a generation ago,'' said Jerry M. Howard, executive vice president of the National Association of Home Builders. ''But in today's economic climate, home builders need incentives to spur them to even more action.''
 The House and the Senate are caught up in a bitter fight over legislation to extend various expiring provisions of federal tax law. The tax breaks for renewable energy are not controversial. But in the current debate, they are tied to many other tax breaks for businesses and individuals, including an extension of the tax credit for research and development, expansion of the child tax credit and relief from the alternative minimum tax, which threatens to snare millions of middle-income families next year.
 The two chambers are at loggerheads over the question of whether and how to offset the cost of extending and expanding the business and individual tax breaks, with House Democrats insisting that the costs should be fully offset. That position is opposed by many Republican senators.
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, tried on Monday to call up a House-passed bill to expand tax credits for renewable energy. Republicans objected, in part because the bill would offset more of the cost than they are willing to accept. 
 Representative Mike Ross of Arkansas, a co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative House Democrats, said, ''Senate Republicans are threatening to stop American investment in affordable, renewable energy.''
 Senate Republicans contend that Congress should not have to offset the cost of legislation that continues existing tax breaks beyond their scheduled expiration date.
 ''Simple extensions of existing tax policies should not be held hostage to the demand by some for ever-greater tax collections,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee.
 The dispute is a kind of proxy battle for a much bigger fight looming in the next Congress over whether to preserve tax cuts enacted under President Bush in 2001 and 2003. 
 Many Democrats want to scale back the tax benefits that go to higher-income people. If Republicans have to cover the cost of extending those tax breaks beyond 2010, they will need to find hundreds of billions of dollars in offsets or savings, a formidable challenge.
 House Democrats also bristle at what they see as the Senate's insistence that the House accept the tax legislation in the form approved by the Senate, without changes.
 The House Democratic leader, Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, complained Monday that the Senate version of the tax legislation came ''with a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum.'' 
 The Senate tax package, approved last week by a vote of 93 to 2, deals with issues addressed in four separate bills passed by the House.
 Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, pleaded with the House on Monday to accept the Senate version of the legislation.
 ''The House-passed bills cannot pass'' in the Senate, Mr. Baucus said.

HEADLINE: Promotions Hurt Walgreen's Revenue

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: DEERFIELD, Ill. 

 BODY:
The Walgreen Company reported disappointing quarterly revenue on Monday, citing promotions that failed to pay off.
 Walgreen said cost cuts and greater sales lifted its profit 12 percent for the quarter. But its revenue fell short of expectations, and the company said it had engaged in too many discounts and promotions as it tried to increase sales in the face of difficult economic conditions. 
 Profit increased to $443 million, or 45 cents a share, from $396.5 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the fourth quarter of Walgreen's fiscal year, rose 9 percent to $14.6 billion from $13.42 billion last year.
 Sales in stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 2.6 percent during the quarter, including a 3.7 percent rise in nonprescription sales. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 2 percent.
 Excluding a one-time gain, profit per share fell short of Wall Street forecasts, as did sales, and stock in Walgreen fell $1.73, or 5.3 percent, to $31 a share.
 Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it had engaged in ''too many promotions'' during the quarter, as it increased promotions and discounts to counter economic weakness. The company said it would reduce promotions in coming quarters.
 Walgreen's chief executive, Jeffrey A. Rein, said prescription drug growth was the weakest in 47 years. He said economic conditions were the largest cause for the slowdown, with drug safety concerns and use of generic drugs as contributing factors.

HEADLINE: Flying the Silk Road

BYLINE: By PERRY GARFINKEL

 BODY:
Seven hundred years after the Venetian merchant Marco Polo plied the Silk Road, Western business travelers are discovering new routes -- all involving airlines, of course -- to expand trade with the East. 
 Consider Zhihang Chi, the vice president and general manager for Air China's North America office in El Segundo, Calif., who often takes his own carrier's 13-hour nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Beijing and back. 
 He does not even need to book a hotel room. He leaves Los Angeles at 1:40 a.m. local time, attends meetings in Beijing over the next 10 hours the next day, leaves Beijing at 9 p.m. and lands back in Los Angeles by 6 p.m. the same day. 
 Gary Peterson, executive vice president for Protiviti, an audit and risk advisory company, uses United's Circle Pacific program to fly from San Francisco to Sydney, then on to any of several Asian cities, for less than he would pay to fly business class round-trip to Tokyo.
 And Ganjun Bagla, a Cerritos, Calif., management consultant and author of ''Doing Business in 21st Century India'' (Hachette, 2008), usually takes a plane out of Los Angeles to India but now will take a shuttle to San Francisco to fly Jet Airways, the first India-based airline to fly from San Francisco to Mumbai
 These business travelers provide a ray of hope for profit in the cloudy airline industry skies.
 According to Air Transport Association analyses compiled for The New York Times, 996 nonstop flights a week were scheduled in the third quarter of 2008 from the United States to Asian countries, more than ever before. Los Angeles is the most popular departure city from the United States, with 180 flights a week. Narita Airport in Tokyo is the most frequent destination, with 380 arrivals a week.
 American Airlines reported that revenue for flights to and from Japan and China grew 12.8 percent for the first three months of 2008, greater growth than in any other region. That region also saw the biggest growth in average fares paid, 12.2 percent.
 Smaller airlines are also profiting from business travel to Asia. Talon Air, the Long Island-based luxury private jet charter company, showed a 50 percent increase of bookings to Asian cities for each of the last three years, according to its owner, Adam Katz.
 Experts attribute this growth to several factors. The economic boom in Asian countries, particularly China and India, translates to more business travel between East and West.
 Also, the new bigger planes used for long-haul flights of 12 to 17 hours can carry more fuel, said Mary Tabacchi, a Cornell University associate professor who has tracked airline trends for 15 years. This eliminates the need for extra landings and takeoffs, which use more fuel. 
 ''Major airlines hemorrhaging money due to rising fuel costs are looking for ways to increase these fairly lucrative routes,'' said Gary Dorman, an airline expert and senior vice president with NERA Economic Consulting. Therefore, he said, they are asking the Department of Transportation to negotiate with Asian countries to open traditionally restricted rights to sky routes in the East. Asian businesses are doing the same from their side with their own government transportation authorities.
 In the meantime airlines are investing in added routes to and from Asia.
 ''If they can establish brand dominance now, they will be one step ahead of their competition as conditions improve,'' Mr. Dorman said.
 As a result, airlines are aggressively vying to lay claim to the fastest, first, only, most direct and highest-quality service flights to major Asian cities. Here are some of the claims:
 Finnair claims that the shortest flight distance from New York to New Delhi is via its hub city of Helsinki -- 11,853 kilometers, or 7,365 miles. 
 Cathay Pacific claims the most connections to Chinese cities through its Hong Kong hub. This year Cathay has added 28 new flights a week to India. 
 Singapore Airlines started the first all-business-class flights from North America to Asia in May, from Newark International Airport in New York to Singapore.
 Northwest Airlines (which dropped the ''Orient'' from its official title in 1986) has operated the longest uninterrupted service between North America and Asia of any airline. It is the leading American carrier serving Japan with the most flights, capacity and passengers. It was also the first to introduce hot oshibori towels in flight, in 1940. 
 Airlines also compete to provide the most Asian ambience, authenticity and comfort for Asian-born travelers and those who appreciate Asian cuisine.
 For flights to India, Lufthansa commissioned Hemant Oberoi, executive chef for Taj Hotels, to develop traditional curried meals and select teas. 
 EVA Air offers selections from the Taiwanese restaurant chain Din Tai Fung -- items like braised lamb chop with shiso prune sauce or sauteed tiger prawns in a green tea sauce.
 Such amenities and increased routes are a vast improvement for those who have long been flying between the East and the West.
 Brian Williams, the managing director of Swire Hotels, has been commuting for 20 years from offices in London and Hong Kong to Beijing, where his company has several properties. 
 ''I am quite happy as a clam flying business class on Cathay Pacific, slurping roast duck noodle soup, sipping a French claret then getting a good solid sleep,'' Mr. Williams said. ''It's all so civilized now.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Itineraries pages on Tuesday about an increase in airline service and amenities on Asian routes misidentified, in some editions, the airport used by Singapore Airlines for its all-business-class flights from North America. It is Newark Liberty International Airport, not Kennedy International Airport in New York. The article also misspelled the given name of a California management consultant who has begun flying Jet Airways, the first India-based airline to fly from San Francisco to Mumbai. He is Gunjan Bagla, not Ganjun.

HEADLINE: The Swill Is Gone

BYLINE: By BEE WILSON. 
Bee Wilson is the author of ''Swindled: The Dark History of Food Fraud From Poisoned Candy to Counterfeit Coffee.''

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 THE milk was marketed as pure and wholesome, and it looked fine to the naked eye. How were the mothers to know they were poisoning their babies? They had paid good money for it on the open market. It would take thousands of sick children before lawmakers did anything to stop it.
 China in 2008? No, New York City in 1858. Missing from the coverage of the current Chinese baby formula poisoning, in which more than 53,000 babies have been sickened and at least four have died, is how often it has happened before. 
 The disaster unfolding now in China -- and spreading inevitably to its trading partners -- is eerily similar to the ''swill milk'' scandal that rumbled on in New York for several decades of the 19th century. 
 In a city growing fast, but lacking refrigeration, it was hard to provide sufficient milk. Fresh milk was brought in from Westchester and Orange Counties, but not enough to meet demand. In 1853, it was found that 90,000 or so quarts of cow's milk entered the city each day, but that number mysteriously increased to 120,000 quarts at the point of delivery. 
 Some of the increase was due to New York dairymen padding their milk with water, and then restoring its richness with flour -- just like their latter-day Chinese counterparts, who increased the protein levels in watered-down milk by adding the noxious chemical melamine. But the greater part was swill milk, a filthy, bluish substance milked from cows tied up in crowded stables adjoining city distilleries and fed the hot alcoholic mash left from making whiskey. This too was doctored -- with plaster of Paris to take away the blueness, starch and eggs to thicken it and molasses to give it the buttercup hue of honest Orange County milk. This newspaper attributed the deaths of up to 8,000 children a year to this vile fluid.
 In China, journalists have known of the poison milk for months, but weren't allowed to spread the news because of the Olympics. Even worse, it has been only four years since China's last baby formula scandal, when fraudsters in Anhui Province manufactured fake formula from sugar and starch, killing at least 13 babies. In the case of swill milk, the New York dairymen had been informed for decades that their milk was unsafe. 
 As early as 1842, a temperance crusader named Robert Hartley warned that city milk could be catastrophically tainted. Throughout the 1850s, newspapers published exposes of the distillery dairies and called for the city to close them. Some of the cows were so diseased from their alcoholic diet that their teeth rotted and their tails fell off. Their udders were frequently ulcerated, but they would be milked regardless. 
 Finally, in 1858, Tammany Hall sent Alderman Michael Tuomey to ''investigate'' a notorious swill milk dairy on West 16th Street. Tuomey sat down with the dairy owners and drank a glass or two of whiskey. He concluded that swill milk was just as good for children as ordinary milk, and anyone who refused to drink it simply had a ''prejudice.''
 Again, there are echoes with China. The Chinese government had exempted several of the nation's biggest dairies from inspections, one of the reasons the scare was allowed to spread unchecked from baby formula to yogurt to the whole of the Chinese dairy industry and its exports. (The British candy maker Cadbury announced yesterday, for instance, that it had discovered melamine in some of its Chinese-made milk chocolates.) This isn't just laissez-faire -- it's an approach to the food supply that is so deliberately hands off that it amounts to an invitation to swindling. Heads are rolling now, but too late for the sick babies.
 The similarities between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't come as a great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government unable or unwilling to regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's not always easy for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored -- particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.
 Such scandals are not bad luck. They are symptomatic of a deep failure of politics. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's hasty gestures -- punishing the dairies, forcing the head of the food quality agency to resign -- have done nothing to deal with the underlying regulatory vacuum. 
 In the end, New York milk was cleaned up. It took stronger food laws, better policing, the advent of pasteurization and the passage of the Food and Drug Act in 1906, 50 years after the worst of swill milk. Above all, it took decades, not months or years. China faces many more food scandals -- to add to recent alarms like pesticide-laced dumplings and lard made from sewage -- before it reaches the point where its citizens can routinely trust what they eat.
 The American food supply is still flawed, as this year's panic over salmonella in produce showed. But it's worth remembering that it has been far worse. China's present is America's past.

HEADLINE: Central Banks Move to Loosen Credit Squeeze

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve and other countries' central banks announced new steps Monday that make billions of dollars available to squeezed banks here and abroad to battle a worsening credit crisis that threatens to unhinge the United States economy. 
 The Fed said in a statement that the action was intended to ''expand significantly'' the availability of cash available to financial institutions in an effort to provide relief to the worst credit crisis since the Depression. In taking the action, the Fed cited ''continued strains'' in the demand for short-term financing.
 Central banks will continue to work closely and are prepared to take ''appropriate steps as needed'' to stem the fallout, the Fed said.
 Under one new step of relief, the Fed will bolster the amount of 84-day cash loans available to American banks. The Fed is increasing the amount to $75 billion, up from the current $25 billion starting on Oct. 6. Banks bid on a slice of the loans at an auction.
 All told, the move will triple the supply of 84-day loans to $225 billion from $75 billion, the Fed said.
 The Fed also said it would supply $330 billion to other central banks, expanding continuing currency ''swap'' arrangements with them where dollars are traded for their currencies.
 The move comes as the United States financial meltdown's tendrils have ensnared banks in Britain, the Benelux and Germany.

HEADLINE: 'Is My Money Safe?' and Other Questions for a Nervous Time

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
For all of you on Main Street who have been watching the turmoil on Wall Street for the last few weeks, Monday's shockwaves rattled even the most steadfast.
The day began with the announcement that another big bank -- Wachovia -- had been taken over, just days after Washington Mutual collapsed and was sold. In early afternoon, the House rejected the bailout package for the financial industry. Stocks plunged, with the Dow ending the day down nearly 778 points in the worst single-day drop in two decades.
What is a regular investor to make of it all? What about people who have money in bank accounts? Below are some answers to questions that are probably on your mind.
Q.Why did the stock market fall so far so fast on Monday? 
A. The element of surprise surely didn't help, since everyone was expecting the bailout bill to pass. There may have been a bit of investor disgust thrown in, too, a sense that our representatives in Washington just don't get it.
Fear may be the biggest driver, however -- the worry that it may be weeks or longer before companies can get the affordable, short-term loans they need to finance their operations. Without easy access to that money, it's hard to run a profit-making operation on a day-to-day basis, let alone grow over the long haul. The professional investors who often drive big market moves don't want to hold onto stocks to see if things will really get that bad.
Q.What's likely to happen in the markets over the next few days?
A. It's possible that Monday's market moves will spook members of the House of Representatives enough that they will be willing to change their votes with only a modest amount of compromise. Or, there may be hasty efforts to write a new bill from scratch. This will take days, however, not hours, since Tuesday is the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana. Stocks may rebound, at least somewhat, if another similar bill emerges. But much will depend on the revisions.
Q.Is any investment truly safe right now?
A. As long as you trust the United States government, sure. Plenty of banks, like HSBC Direct and Capital One are offering online savings accounts paying more than 3 percent. These accounts have all the normal Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protections of at least $100,000. Also, the Treasury Department is currently insuring investors who had holdings in money market mutual funds as of Sept. 19, as long as the fund company pays to participate.
Q. What about Treasury bills?
A. Treasuries are issued and backed by the United States government. But since throngs of investors have rushed into these investments, it has pushed their yields down. Way down. Some Treasuries, with maturities in the one-week to three-month range, are yielding less than 1 percent, anywhere from 0.10 percent to 0.50 percent. Clearly, many investors are willing to accept paltry yields as long as they know their money is secure.
Another government offering is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, which protect investors against rising inflation. That may be one result of any big government bailout.
Q. My retirement portfolio has been wrecked by this. How should I respond?
A. Continue to save. Big losses mean you'll need that much more time, or good news, to bring your balances back to where they need to be for you to retire comfortably. If your employer matches your contributions, this is a great time to take advantage of the largess.
As for whether you should pile into beaten down stocks, no one knows how much further the markets will fall or how long they'll take to bounce back. But people who move their savings to ultrasafe investments and then leave them there usually miss out on the gains when the markets come back. If you need to do that to sleep at night or avoid stomach ulcers, then do what you have to do. But it may cost you in quality of life come retirement time.
Q. But what if I am about to retire? Then what?
A. Leaving the work force at a time like this creates big problems. Not only is your portfolio down, but you need to start withdrawing from it. So you are essentially locking in your losses.
If your portfolio has taken a big hit, it may be time to seriously consider delaying retirement. Working just a few years more can make a big difference. Or, a part-time job may keep you from having to dip into your portfolio before it recovers. To get a better idea of how much you can afford to withdraw, you can test different amounts with a retirement income calculator on the Web, like T. Rowe Price's.
Q. With things looking increasingly gloomy, though, why not allocate extra cash to other types of savings or paying down debt?
A. If you're saving for a downpayment, you could put enough money in your retirement account to match any employer contribution. Then, use whatever money you have left for the downpayment fund, which should be in an ultrasafe account. The same logic goes for a teenager's college fund, which ought to be mostly in steady investments by now. There are nice tax breaks on 529 college savings accounts, too.
Yes, paying down debt, especially high-interest credit card debt, is always a good idea, though it's probably best to take advantage of employer matches on retirement savings first.
Q. Is it time to buy stocks?
A. Like gambling? This is a great time to make bets on the wide price swings that we're seeing in some stocks and entire sectors of the market. Just be prepared to lose big, as plenty of professionals have done of late.
Q. I'm worried sick about my parents, who rely on stock dividends for their income. What will happen to them?
A. It's not a great time to be relying on dividends. We've seen plenty of companies cut them. (Citibank did so on Monday as part of its acquisition of Wachovia's banking operations.) Still, if your parents were planning all along to keep their shares until they die and live only off the dividends and Social Security, perhaps now is the time to encourage them to be selfish. They could sell some shares and live well now, even if it means you'll get less later when they pass on.
Q. I'm a long-term investor and prefer not to see my retirement balances as real numbers for now. So the crisis doesn't feel like it has hit me financially yet. Should I be doing anything defensively?
A. It's not yet clear how much more the crisis will affect employment levels. Still, this seems like the best moment in years to have a few months of cash set aside in one of those online savings accounts just in case you lose your job or face some large expense that you haven't predicted.
Q. What's the next shoe to drop?
A. It seems certain that it will be harder for consumers to borrow money in the next year or two than it was earlier this decade. How much harder isn't clear yet. It will be more difficult for people who need jumbo mortgages than for those whose lenders can simply sell off their loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Home-equity lenders are already cutting plenty of people off, while credit card companies are lowering credit limits on others.
Q. What about more bank failures?
A. They will happen. In recent days, we've seen the F.D.I.C. getting out in front of troubles at big banks like Wachovia and Washington Mutual, by arranging for other banks to take over their consumer accounts. What's less clear, however, is how many healthy institutions are left to take in other big banks that may run into trouble.
As always, stay within F.D.I.C. deposit limits. Then, the worst-case scenario is that it will take a couple of days to extract your funds from a failed bank.

BAILOUT PLAN IS REJECTED In a blow to both political parties and the president, the House of Representatives voted to reject the $700 billion rescue of the financial industry. ''Our strategy is to continue to address this economic situation head on,'' Mr. Bush said after the vote. 
 STOCKS PLUNGE Shares dropped almost 9 percent, the worst one-day drop in two decades. [A1.] 
 WHAT WENT WRONG A failure of political leadership is a major reason the rescue plan failed, just when the world's financial markets needed the United States to lead the way out of crisis. [A1.] 
 ADVICE FOR INVESTORS What is a regular investor to make of it all? What about people who have money in bank accounts? Questions asked and answered. [A1.]
 ALTERNATIVE RESCUE PLANS Many economists and bank executives say lawmakers should consider new and perhaps more palatable alternatives to prevent the financial crisis from spreading. [C1.]
 SOME IMMEDIATE ACTION Despite the rescue plan's failure, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve have substantial power they can use to ease the anxiety in the markets. [C1.] 
 BIG HIT ON FINANCIAL SECTOR On the day Citigroup agreed to buy Wachovia for $2.2 billion, shares in the financial sector fell 16 percent over all and no big bank was immune. [C1.]
 BEST FACE ON BAD SITUATION? Why is it that chief executives always put a happy face on their companies just before their fall? It happened with Wachovia. DealBook: Andrew Ross Sorkin. [C1.]
 CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS HURT Several foundations have been hurt by the recent collapse of investments banks and the difficulties of the American International Group and that may mean less money for charities. [C1.]
 MORE TURMOIL IN EUROPE The financial crisis is spreading to Europe and new evidence is emerging that Europe is on the verge of recession, sending the euro lower against the dollar. [C1.]
 DROP IN OIL PRICE Oil prices fell below $100 a barrel after the bailout vote, indicating that investors expect slow growth. [C7.]
 CAPITAL FOR MORGAN STANLEY Morgan Stanley has completed a deal to raise capital with the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which will get a 21 percent ownership stake. [C9.] 
 LEHMAN SELLS PRIZED UNIT Lehman Brothers will sell its highly respected Neuberger Berman asset management unit and other assets to Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman. [C9.]
 MORE TRIPS TO ASIA An analysis shows more flights than ever were scheduled in the third quarter from the United States to Asia. [C5.]
 T.S.A. PLANS CRACKDOWN The Transportation Security Administration has said it plans to crack down on airline employees misinforming passengers that they are on the terrorist watch list. On the Road: Joe Sharkey. [C5.]

HEADLINE: Letter to a Rookie

BYLINE: By DOUG GLANVILLE

 BODY:
Will Venable PETCO Park 100 Park Blvd San Diego, CA. 92101
 Dear Will,
 The other day I received an e-mail from a writer who had interviewed me a couple of years ago for Black History Month. We'd kept in touch, and he was writing to inform me of your promotion to the major leagues.
 He also told me that you are the second African-American Ivy Leaguer to make it to that level. And he confirmed something I had suspected but had never fully explored: I was the first. 
 Putting aside our nasty Penn-Princeton rivalry, I want to congratulate you on your big-league call-up. I remember my first game, in 1996 with the Cubs. It is something you never forget.
 I hope you don't mind me sharing with you a little of what this experience has meant to me.
 For the whole of my career, I knew that being an Ivy League graduate in major league baseball made me something of an anomaly. Certainly there have only been a handful of Ivy League baseball players of any culture or race. In the minor leagues, that pedigree wasn't considered a badge of honor, or even much of an asset. Quite the opposite. The fact that I'd gone to a school like Penn caused question marks to swirl about my ''focus'' and my ''commitment'' to the game. After all, I was seen as someone who could walk away at any time (as one of my teammates who'd gone to Stanford did after a demotion). 
 I had critics say in print that I was ''too smart for my own good'' or that I ''spent more time philosophizing than working.'' I recognized that I often asked a lot of questions to get a deeper understanding of some techniques, but I always found it curious that I was accused of thinking I had all the answers and asking too many questions at the same time. I suspect that your path wasn't a rose-petaled stroll in the park, either. A writer friend of mine, describing how my Ivy league degree was perceived in my minor league experience, referred to my experience coming up in minor league baseball as ''Poison Ivy.''
 But, unlike the minors, the major leagues can be a great equalizer. Unique backgrounds are seen as points of interest and color that stand out from the usual package. In marketing-friendly America, unique can be a great selling point. I don't know much about your road to San Diego, but if you carry any resentment at all about being isolated in the minor leagues because of the simple reality of who you are, I hope you can keep that in mind. It got a lot better for me as time went on.
 When I was in the thick of feeling alone, I focused on the common path of what we all as players were trying to achieve: loving to play this game and a dream of the major leagues. And despite everything, there was a lot more that brought us together as players than not. I also needed to believe that performing well can trump everything.
 Somehow, the bookend of your achievement makes my own experience more tangible. I no longer feel like this phantom of impossibility, as I did from the day I was drafted and signed as a junior in June of 1991. (I did go back to school to get my degree, much to the consternation of some of the powers that be.) What seemed at times to be the equivalent of lightning striking twice has finally happened.
 In some ways, embarking on a baseball career is a lonely walk for all players -- young men who are often leaving home for the first time -- but I knew from the moment I showed up for my first professional game, in Niagara Falls, N.Y., that there weren't a lot of people who shared my particular experience. I was fortunate to have been raised in a town (Teaneck, N.J.) that embraced ethnic, religious and economic diversity. Otherwise it would have been much more challenging for me to find common ground with my teammates and coaches outside of that ball with the red stitches.
 My minor league outfield instructor was the retired major leaguer Jimmy Piersall, and it took the two of us years to figure out how to deal with each other. He would tout his ''painter's son'' background while referring to college graduates like me with a word I'd rather not put in this letter. But we found a space where we could connect: in the work ethic required to make it to the top of the profession we both loved. In the end, he became my number-one advocate, despite our diametrically opposed experiences.
 I also spent a lot of my minor league career shaking off the exhausted ''black athlete'' labels of laziness, natural talent and nonchalance. I could only turn to mentors, my family and history to find my path, because there was no one else around who had my specific kind of challenge: bridging diversity, race . . . and academia. So I tapped the same source of strength that helped get my mother and father out of bed every day: they expected a degree of unfairness but knew that the people who had paved the way carried bigger burdens in much more difficult circumstances, enduring challenges just to find a job or to be able to vote.
 It was a lot to juggle, but the saving grace was that, in the end, we all had to try to hit that baseball. We all had to perform. In some ways, that is what makes our game so great, it begs people to look beyond certain things because when they don't, they miss some of its beauty.
 I cannot close this letter without emphasizing that we must remember that our Negro League predecessors set the stage, turned on the lights and paid the bill, and now we were able to enjoy performing in the theater they constructed. We need to always keep alive their precious story -- which is about baseball, for sure, but also about sacrifice and humility, patience and faith, forgiveness and perseverance. They represent everything baseball should want to be. Everything America should want to be. We are part of their legacy.
 Sincerely,
 Doug Glanville

HEADLINE: Diverse Ideas From Outside Experts Share a Theme: Urgent Action Is Needed

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
With a bank rescue package stalled in Congress, many economists and bank executives said Monday that lawmakers should consider new, and perhaps more palatable, alternatives to prevent the financial crisis from spreading. 
 Their proposals range from the modest, like expanding limits on federal deposit insurance, to the far-reaching, like having the government invest directly in financial companies. Like the plan that was voted down, their ideas would use taxpayer money to expand the government's role in financial markets.
 These economists and financial executives concede their proposals have serious flaws, and some of the ideas, not surprisingly, are self-serving. But with the financial crisis worsening, they said Washington should act quickly with some plan to bolster public confidence. 
 Scott A. Shay, chairman of Signature Bank, said Congress needed to head off any panic among bank and money-market fund depositors. He suggested that the government announce that it would insure all deposits of any sort, including money market accounts, and up to any amount, for 180 days. During that time, the government would investigate both large and small banks to determine which should be closed.
 ''Some banks are so wounded that they will ultimately need to be shot,'' said Mr. Shay, whose company operates in the New York metropolitan area. ''So shoot those banks during that 180 days. I really think that the crisis will not end until we go through a period where the system can be cleansed without panicking the public.''
 The plan voted down Monday would have given the Treasury the authority to buy bad loans directly from banks as a way to inject new money into the financial system. It drew criticism from conservatives, who argued that it gave government too much power over banks, and liberals, who said it did not help people facing foreclosure and was a mammoth subsidy to Wall Street.
 Mr. Shay also suggested that the government directly assist the housing market, rather than just buying bad loans from banks that might not need new capital. 
 Others see helping homeowners as a quicker and more effective solution. 
 ''The government should directly purchase housing assets, not real estate bonds,'' John Allison, the chief executive of BB&T, a large regional bank in North Carolina, wrote in a letter to members of Congress last week. ''This would include lots and houses under construction.''
 But with credit markets tightening sharply every day, a promise to fix housing will not contain the mushrooming crisis, said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington.
 ''I don't think we have time for that,'' he said. ''I don't think we can treat the cause. I think we have to treat the symptom.''
 Instead of buying bad loans from banks, as the Treasury proposed, Congress should consider investing directly in financial companies, Mr. Bernstein said. The government would simply invest money directly into banks by buying new shares, he said. 
 He said Warren E. Buffett provided the template last week when he agreed to buy $5 billion in preferred shares from Goldman Sachs and received the rights to buy an additional $5 billion in common shares at a set price.
 ''The direct-equity buy, it's like the Buffett play,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''I'm fairly confident that would be a better bang for the buck.''
 But Mr. Bernstein acknowledged this proposal would leave the government even more deeply intertwined with financial institutions than the Treasury's current plan. And it would put the government in the position of picking winners and losers -- any bank denied a government capital infusion would probably face an instant crisis of confidence.
 Another proposal comes from investors who say the government should lend money to them and others to help them buy troubled assets, rather than making taxpayers assume the full risk. 
 ''The idea here is that if the government provides this funding, then asset managers who really understand the assets the best would have the opportunity to bid more aggressively for them,'' said Matt Chasin, formerly of the mortgage desk at Bear Stearns and now the chief operating officer of Sorin Capital Management, a hedge fund in Stamford, Conn. 
 But the proposal may face skepticism from lawmakers who say the idea is self-serving, especially because it comes from investors with ties to banks that took huge mortgage losses.
 William Isaac, who headed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the early 1980s and is now chairman of the Secura Group, a finance consulting firm in Virginia, said he thought that any government bailout package needed to be paired with changes in accounting rules that would relieve the pressure on banks to mark down assets that have fallen in value.
 The rules could be changed so banks do not necessarily have to use market prices when they estimate the value of mortgages they own. That change would relieve the pressure on banks to raise capital, which they might have to do if they write down the value of mortgage-related assets. 
 But changing the accounting rules carries its own risks. It could lead to even more uncertainty about banks' balance sheets, and worsen the crisis of confidence.
 Deborah Lucas, finance professor at the Kellogg School of Management, said government examiners should rapidly examine the books of every major financial institution involved in this crisis, including insurers, pension funds and banks, and determine which are weakest and which can survive. Ms. Lucas said she was glad that the Treasury's proposal had failed. The core problem now is a crisis of confidence, which can be resolved only with increased transparency, not a government bailout, she said.
 ''I don't think piecemeal guaranteeing assets is that valuable,'' Ms. Lucas said. ''They need to do the harder thing, which is to really have a direct discovery process, where they figure out who they're going to shut down, what it's going to cost.''
 Ms. Lucas says she believes that the Federal Reserve and F.D.I.C. are already addressing the crisis, pointing to deals like Citigroup's takeover of Wachovia on Sunday, which was backstopped by the F.D.I.C. More and similar deals are likely, she said.
 Ms. Lucas said that she did not believe the markets were near panic and that Congress should move slowly before it passes any legislation that would leave taxpayers directly bailing out financial institutions. But on Monday afternoon, at least, her view was in the minority.
 ''This was a big deal and it's a big deal that it did not go through,'' said Ed Fredericks, a finance professor at Pepperdine University. ''Now that it failed we'll have to look at some other things.''

HEADLINE: Concerns About Palin's Readiness Emerge as Major Test Nears

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Elisabeth Bumiller and Patrick Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A month after Gov. Sarah Palin joined Senator John McCain's ticket to a burst of excitement and anticipation among Republicans, she heads into a critical debate facing challenges from conservatives about her credentials, signs that her popularity is slipping and evidence that Republicans are worried about how much help she will be for Mr. McCain in November.
 Ms. Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, flew to Mr. McCain's ranch in Sedona, Ariz., on Monday for three days of preparation with a team of his aides -- a sharp contrast to the less structured preparation that led up to the senator's first debate. 
 The amount of time and staff power being devoted to this was evidence of concern among Mr. McCain's associates that Ms. Palin's early triumphs -- a well-received convention speech, her drawing of big crowds -- has been overtaken by a series of setbacks, creating higher stakes for her in the debate Thursday with the Democratic nominee for vice president, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. 
 ''I think she has pretty thoroughly -- and probably irretrievably -- proven that she is not up to the job of being president of the United States,'' David Frum, a former speechwriter for President Bush who is now a conservative columnist, said in an interview. ''If she doesn't perform well, then people see it. 
 ''And this is a moment of real high anxiety, a little bit like 9/11, when people look to Washington for comfort and leadership and want to know that people in charge know what they are doing.''
 Ms. Palin, of Alaska, continues to draw large crowds, is helping Mr. McCain with fund-raising and drawing volunteers, and is drumming up support among base Republican voters who were once skeptical of his candidacy, party leaders said in interviews. Yet these rough two weeks have led some Republicans to reconsider their initial assessment that she would sharply increase Mr. McCain's appeal among women and independent voters.
 Her halting interview with Katie Couric on CBS News alarmed many Republicans and gave fodder for a devastating parody on Saturday Night Live. 
 ''I think the Katie Couric interview shows that she needs to be briefed more on certain aspects,'' said Jim Greer, the Republican chairman in Florida. ''She continues to be viewed very positively by the base of the party, but she needs to demonstrate that she's got the knowledge and ability to be president should the need arise.''
 Polling suggests that the number of Americans who think she is not fit to be president has increased since her introduction to the country last month. A number of conservative columnists and thinkers have publicly turned against her, or criticized Mr. McCain for choosing her, including George Will, David Brooks and Kathleen Parker, who wrote a column entitled ''She's Out of Her League'' for the National Review Online.
 Mr. Frum noted the difficulty that Dan Quayle, who was elected vice president in 1988, had in recovering from an early set of mistakes that led him to be ridiculed as an intellectual lightweight. ''The story of Dan Quayle is he did probably 1,000 smart things as vice president, but his image was locked in and it was very difficult to turn around,'' he said. ''And Dan Quayle never in his life has performed as badly as Sarah Palin in the last month.''
 Several Republicans said that all of this could ultimately play to Ms. Palin's benefit, lowering expectations for her so much that a mediocre performance in the debate could be hailed as a success.
 ''Thanks to the mainstream media, quite a low expectation has been created for her performance,'' said Ron Carey, chairman of Minnesota's Republican Party. ''The style of Sarah Palin is going to amaze people. She is going to be able to amaze people with the substance she is going to deliver.''
 And Mr. McCain's aides disputed the expressions of concern and said that if anything, the barrage of criticism and the performance in the few television interviews she has done gave her a low bar to clear in the debate. ''I seriously hope that people continue to underestimate the most popular governor in America and a woman who speaks to the heart of America's economic angst,'' said Nicolle Wallace, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain.
 And Mr. McCain, appearing with Ms. Palin in another interview with Ms. Couric on Monday night, offered a hearty endorsement. ''I've seen underestimation before,'' he said. ''I'm very proud of the excitement that Governor Palin has ignited with our party and around this country. It is a level of excitement and enthusiasm, frankly, that I haven't seen before.''
 Ms. Palin is getting ready for the debate at a time of enormous uncertainty about a highly complicated issue, the unfolding crisis on Wall Street, which makes preparing for the face off especially hard.
 And the McCain campaign appears to be leaving nothing to chance. Ms. Palin will spend her preparation time at Mr. McCain's vacation compound in Sedona, with her husband and children. She is practicing for the debate with Steve Beigun, a former staff member of Mr. Bush's National Security Council; Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain's chief foreign policy aide; Mark Wallace, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign; and Ms. Wallace, who was a communications director in the Bush White House.
 ''This debate will probably determine her political persona for the rest of the campaign,'' said Saul Anuzis, the Republican chairman of Michigan. ''I expect Palin to show the country she is capable, articulate and has the leadership skills necessary to serve.''
 Katon Dawson, the Republican chairman of South Carolina, said the debate was important to clear up what he described as misapprehensions about her created by ''a pile-on by the media elite.''
 ''You don't have this kind of negative, media attack without a question mark being put up,'' he said. ''She's going to have a chance to erase that question mark.''
 But Mike Murphy, who used to work as a senior adviser to Mr. McCain, said Ms. Palin's performance in the campaign had underlined his argument that she was a bad choice for Mr. McCain. Mr. Murphy said he was skeptical that she could turn it around in one debate. 
 ''She has the opportunity to undo some of the damage with a very strong debate performance,'' he said. ''That's plausible. We'll just have to wait and see.''
 The rapid change in fortunes has led some Republicans to question the decision by Mr. McCain's advisers to restrict her exposure to unscripted settings -- town-hall-style meetings, news conferences or interviews -- saying such events would have helped her prepare her for such high-profile interviews as the one with Ms. Couric, and the debate.
 ''I disagree with the campaign's approach,'' said Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant. ''I think they ought to toss her into the deep end from the outset; let her get it over quickly. Everything else after that is, you've seen the elephant.'' 
 Ms. Palin has traveled with a briefing team since Sept. 10. Two people close to the campaign, addressing her difficulties, said she had been stuffed with facts as if preparing for an oral exam and had become nervous and unnatural in the few interviews.
 Advisers said she was a diligent worker and was frequently up until the small hours of the morning in her hotel room trying to cram as much information as possible before the debate. 
 ''I think she has to be careful not to be overprogrammed for the debate,'' said Robert T. Bennett, the Ohio Republican chairman. ''I think she's a lot brighter than people are giving her credit for.''

HEADLINE: Misleading Claims by McCain on Obama's Tax Plans

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
One of the sharpest exchanges Friday night in the presidential debate between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama came on the issue of taxes. When Mr. McCain charged that his opponent had ''voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year,'' Mr. Obama replied: ''That's not true, John. That's not true.''
 ''That's just a fact,'' Mr. McCain responded. ''Again, you can look it up.'' 
 So what does the record say when you look it up? Is one candidate right and the other wrong, or are both exaggerating?
 In the past, Mr. McCain has characterized Mr. Obama's position on taxes in ways that proved to be demonstrably inaccurate. His remarks on Friday night, which he amplified on the campaign trail on Monday, seemed to be an effort to shift him away from that shaky ground. However, they too contain assertions that are misleading or overstated. 
 Mr. McCain's campaign has made it clear that he intends to portray Mr. Obama as an advocate of tax increases in the home stretch of the presidential race. Appearing Sunday on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, Mr. McCain's senior strategist, Steve Schmidt, said Mr. Obama's voting record on taxes was ''different from what he says out on the campaign trail'' and was ''a recipe for disaster for the economy.''
 The basis of Mr. McCain's accusation is that Mr. Obama has voted twice this year for Democratic-supported resolutions on the budget for the 2009 fiscal year, which begins Wednesday. In those nonbinding resolutions, Mr. Obama and others, including two Republicans, voted to allow the tax cuts that President Bush pushed through Congress in 2001 and 2003 to expire at the end of 2010, as envisioned in the original legislation. 
 The budget resolutions are merely a blueprint and do not have the force of law. But even if they indicate a propensity by Mr. Obama to vote to raise taxes -- something he and his campaign would fiercely dispute -- there is a question of whether the vote would raise taxes at all. 
 ''It strikes me as a bizarre proposition and a false premise to argue that you are voting for a tax increase by not voting to cut taxes,'' said Bob Williams, senior research associate at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. ''Not voting in favor of extending something into the future does not seem to me to be voting for a tax increase.''
 Mr. Williams, formerly the assistant director of tax analysis at the Congressional Budget Office, attributed Mr. McCain's claim to what he called ''the silly season'' of the presidential campaign. ''They are both so anxious to find something to make the other guy look wrong,'' he said. 
 Mr. Williams pointed out that Mr. Obama had ''pushed the same kind of demagoguery as regards Social Security'' by falsely accusing Mr. McCain of wanting to cut benefits in half.
 The bottom line is that if passed into law without accompanying tax relief measures, the budget resolutions that Mr. Obama endorsed would raise taxes for some individuals making $42,000 a year. But it would not raise taxes for all of them. For a single taxpayer with no dependents, the amount of that increase would be $15. A single taxpayer with one child earning $58,000 or less, however, would not pay additional taxes. 
 In his presidential platform, Mr. Obama has also proposed several measures to mitigate the impact of letting the Bush tax cuts expire. Under his plan, only individuals making $200,000 or more and families earning more than $250,000 a year, accounting for less than 2 percent of the population, would pay additional taxes, and more than 90 percent of the population would receive a tax break of some sort.
 ''It is our position that if in 2011 the Bush tax cuts expire, we would define that as a tax increase,'' said Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser, Jason Furman. ''The Obama plan is designed to prevent a tax increase that George Bush signed into law.''
 In remarks on the campaign trail on Monday in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. McCain broadened his accusations, saying that Mr. Obama had ''never voted to cut your taxes'' and was ''always cheering for higher taxes or against tax relief.'' 
 Mr. McCain himself originally opposed the Bush tax cuts, saying they were a fiscally irresponsible gift to the wealthy ''at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief.'' But he now favors extending them permanently. 
 Mr. McCain's accusations on Friday and Monday are the latest iteration of a line of attack that his campaign has been employing for several months, after an earlier claim that Mr. Obama was proposing ''the largest single tax increase since World War II'' was debunked by economists and tax experts. 
 The McCain campaign originally maintained that Mr. Obama's support of the nonbinding budget resolution meant he would raise taxes on those making as little as $32,500 a year. That failed to distinguish between total income and taxable income.
 But even after adopting the $42,000 figure as his benchmark, Mr. McCain went on to misrepresent his opponent's position. In a Spanish-language advertisement, for example, the McCain campaign has said that Mr. Obama favors raising taxes on ''families'' making $42,000 a year.
 That figure is incorrect as well. In reality, a family of four with annual income of up to $90,000, to take one example, would not have been affected even in the unlikely event that the Democratic budget resolution were to be enacted with no accompanying tax relief for the middle class.
 In an English-language Web advertisement issued in August, Mr. McCain also claimed that Mr. Obama favored ''a tax increase for everyone earning more than $42,000 a year.'' That statement is patently false. Under Mr. Obama's tax proposal, those in the middle of the middle class -- people earning $37,000 to $66,000 a year -- would receive a tax cut of more than $1,000 a year, more than three times what Mr. McCain is proposing in his tax platform.

HEADLINE: Buffett Invests in Chinese Battery Maker

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The investor Warren E. Buffett announced on Monday that he had agreed to buy a 9.89 percent stake in a Chinese battery manufacturer that plans to sell electric cars in the United States by 2010.
 The MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, will pay 1.8 billion Hong Kong dollars -- about $230 million -- for the stake in the battery maker, the BYD Company. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns 87.4 percent of MidAmerican.
 Based in Shenzhen, a mainland Chinese city adjacent to Hong Kong, BYD is one of the world's largest makers of rechargeable batteries for cellphones and other uses. The company also has a fast-growing auto-making unit that accounts for nearly a third of its revenue and makes fuel-efficient compact and subcompact cars for the Chinese market. 
 The president of BYD, Wang Chuanfu, said that the alliance with Mr. Buffett was not just about raising capital for the manufacturer, which relies heavily on short-term debt.
 ''If BYD were to enter the North American market, Mr. Buffett's investment would enhance the BYD brand name,'' Mr. Wang said at a news conference in Hong Kong late Monday.
 He added that BYD would sell cars in the United States and might even move up its plans for entering the market in 2010, by using Berkshire's money to accelerate research.
 David Sokol, the chairman of MidAmerican, said at the news conference with Mr. Wang that Berkshire Hathaway wanted to address climate change and considered electric cars as a way to do so. ''This is a technology that can really be a game changer if we're serious about reducing'' emissions of carbon dioxide, the main gas associated with manmade global warming, Mr. Sokol said.
 MidAmerican, a collection of electric utilities in the Midwest and West, sees plug-in electric cars as the best approach because the United States already has the infrastructure to supply electricity for recharging almost anywhere, Mr. Sokol said. By contrast, plans for hydrogen-fueled vehicles would require the installation of many hydrogen-fueling centers. 
 MidAmerican also sees promise in BYD's battery technologies for storing wind energy and solar energy, Mr. Sokol said. Difficulties in storing energy for when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining have limited the deployment of these renewable energy technologies.
 More broadly, Berkshire Hathaway wants to tap into China's engineering talent and is doing so through BYD, which has 11,000 engineers and technicians among its 130,000 employees.
 Mr. Buffett did not attend the news conference, but said in a statement that he was impressed with Mr. Wang's record as a manager.
 BYD cars on display at auto shows in China have tended to buttress the notion that the company's expertise lies more in batteries than automotive design.
 Gasoline-powered BYD models already sold in China are unmemorable economy cars with little of the styling flair on which Western automakers pride themselves. The uneven purple paint on one BYD car displayed at a recent Chinese car show drew a gaggle of amused American auto executives who made derisive remarks.
 But expertise in automotive design and manufacturing is easy to acquire. Other Chinese automakers have hired Italian designers, while layoffs at Western automakers mean that many talented engineers are available.
 Battery expertise is much harder to find. Mastering battery technology is regarded in the auto industry as the linchpin to the production of electric cars with the range, horsepower and torque needed to compete with gasoline-powered cars.
 Mr. Sokol said that MidAmerican was impressed by BYD's ability to produce electric cars that have a range of almost 190 miles on a single charge, and can be 80 percent recharged in 15 minutes. BYD plans to start selling electric cars in China at the end of this year.
 BYD is working on all-electric cars, in which all of the power to move the vehicle comes from a series of batteries attached to an electric motor. That distinguishes them from hybrids like the Toyota Prius, which use an electric motor and battery to supplement the power from a gasoline engine.
 General Motors plans to introduce in 2010 its electric car, the Chevrolet Volt, which is designed to be plugged in for recharging like the forthcoming BYD car. The Volt will also carry a 1.4-liter engine fueled by gasoline or a blend of ethanol and gasoline to recharge the battery when it starts to run low, a feature that BYD has not yet accepted as necessary.
 BYD is using lithium-ion batteries. Japanese automakers have struggled to make sure that such batteries do not overheat and cause fires, an extremely rare occurrence but one with potentially deadly implications.
 Mr. Wang said that his company's batteries had a singular design that would not cause problems. ''Even after a collision, it will not explode,'' he said.
 While Mr. Wang did not mention it, BYD may also have an advantage by starting with sales of electric cars in China. Unlike in the United States, automakers have very little financial liability for defective products in China, although the government does require recalls when products are demonstrably unsafe.
 Mr. Sokol said that Berkshire Hathaway first became interested in BYD on a suggestion from Charles T. Munger, a longtime adviser to Mr. Buffett who is also the chairman of the Wesco Financial Corporation, another Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary.
 Mr. Munger has invested his own money in a diversified fund, which he does not manage, that has owned shares in BYD for years. He was impressed by BYD and suggested to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Sokol that Berkshire Hathaway should take a stake, but then Mr. Munger recused himself from any further consideration of the possible investment, Mr. Sokol said.

HEADLINE: With Brokaw as Elder Statesman, NBC Plans Future of 'Meet the Press'

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Sometime between Election Day and early December, NBC News will make a final decision about who will replace Tim Russert and his interim successor, Tom Brokaw, at the helm of ''Meet the Press,'' Steve Capus, the president of NBC News, said in an interview.
Mr. Capus refused to characterize the network's intentions. But it is leaning toward an ensemble of hosts that would be led by Chuck Todd, NBC's political director, and include David Gregory, a correspondent and MSNBC anchor, according to a person who had been briefed on the proposal but was not authorized to comment, partly because the plans were not set. Like the turnover of anchors at all three network newscasts, the process of choosing a successor for Mr. Russert has been closely watched in media and political circles.
In the meantime Mr. Brokaw has been given an unexpected encore. Since taking over for his close friend Mr. Russert following his death, Mr. Brokaw has lent on-camera stability to ''Meet the Press,'' which continues to be the most watched of the network Sunday public-affairs programs. He has also appeared in guest spots on ''Today'' and on MSNBC that might have otherwise gone to Mr. Russert. 
But less widely known is that Mr. Brokaw has also played a pivotal role out of public view, both within NBC and in its dealings with the campaign of John McCain in particular.
In an interview here after Sunday's broadcast, Mr. Brokaw said that over the summer he had ''advocated'' within the executive suite of NBC News to modify the anchor duties of the MSNBC hosts Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews on election night and on nights when there were presidential debates. Their expressions of strong political opinions from the MSNBC anchor desk has run counter to the more traditional role Mr. Brokaw played on ''NBC Nightly News'' for more than two decades. NBC said earlier this month that the two hosts would mostly relinquish their anchor duties to Mr. Gregory, while being present as analysts.
''Keith is an articulate guy who writes well and doesn't make his arguments in a 'So's your old mother' kind of way,'' Mr. Brokaw said. ''The mistake was to think he could fill both roles. The other mistake was to think he wouldn't be tempted to use the anchor position to engage in commentary. That's who he is.''
Mr. Brokaw said he had also conducted some shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks between NBC and the McCain campaign. His mission, he said, was to assure the candidate's aides that -- despite some negative on-air commentary by Mr. Olbermann in particular -- Mr. McCain could still get a fair shake from NBC News. Mr. Brokaw said he had been told by a senior McCain aide, whom he did not name, that the campaign had been reluctant to accept an NBC representative as one of the moderators of the three presidential debates -- until his name was invoked.
''One of the things I was told by this person was that they were so irritated, they said, 'If it's an NBC moderator, for any of these debates, we won't go,' '' Mr. Brokaw said. ''My name came up, and they said, 'Oh, hell, we have to do it, because it's going to be Brokaw.' ''
Mr. Brokaw will moderate the second debate, on Oct. 7, in Nashville.
Last week during the Clinton Global Initiative in New York, Mr. Brokaw said, he spoke briefly with Mr. McCain, who has not appeared on ''Meet the Press'' since Mr. Russert's death. While Mr. Brokaw said he and the Republican nominee are not personal friends, he did say they are ''friendly'' and ''always had a great relationship.''
Of the prospects for a potential booking, Mr. Brokaw said: ''We're going to get him. I don't know exactly where or when.''
As for Sarah Palin, the Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential nominee, thus far she has passed over ''NBC Nightly News With Brian Williams'' in favor of interviews with ''World News With Charles Gibson'' on ABC and the ''CBS Evening News With Katie Couric.'' She has also yet to accept an invitation to appear on ''Meet the Press,'' a point Mr. Brokaw said he raised with her when they met for a moment at the Clinton Global Initiative.
''I told her, 'I'm the only one in this business who ever had Susan Butcher as a house guest,' '' Mr. Brokaw said, referring to the Iditarod champion, who died in 2006. ''Susan Butcher is to Alaska what Cal Ripken is to Baltimore.''
For Mr. Brokaw, who will mark the fourth anniversary of his departure from ''Nightly News'' in December, the work of the last four months has interrupted a life in which he had balanced outdoor recreation in and around his Montana ranch with long-form journalism, including books, magazine articles and documentaries.
Instead, on Sunday, he presided over a mini-debate between David Axelrod, the top strategist to Senator Barack Obama, and Steve Schmidt, Mr. McCain's top aide. Asked where he would have otherwise been, Mr. Brokaw, said, ''I would have been watching 'Meet the Press,' '' probably from Montana.
Last week, he interviewed former president Bill Clinton in New York and then traveled to Mississippi to watch the first presidential debate and provide on-camera analysis. In the preceding weeks, he reported from Beijing, London, and Denver and St. Paul, the sites of the two party conventions.
Mr. Brokaw is 68 now, and the strain of a frenetic travel and work schedule appears to show in ways it did not before. At times on ''Meet the Press'' or on ''Today'' in recent weeks, Mr. Brokaw's eyes have appeared to be mere slits and he has seemed short of breath.
Relaxing in the green room of the NBC Washington bureau, as his taped interview with Mr. Clinton played on a monitor at the end of the broadcast, he pointed to the screen and worried aloud.
''My daughters will say I look tired,'' he said.
Asked if he was exhausted, he said: ''Yeah, a little bit. Who wouldn't be?''
If the way he presided over the Axelrod-Schmidt joint interview is any indication, Mr. Brokaw will pick his shots at the debate on next Tuesday. He is often a lenient moderator, who prefers to let the participants fight things out. At times he also seems reluctant to ask a second follow-up question, to say nothing of a third or fourth, when he does not get an answer.
On ''Meet the Press'' on Sept. 21, for example, he asked Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York if he would seek a third term if the current two-term limit were eased. Mr. Bloomberg answered that he was thinking instead of hosting ''Meet the Press.'' Mr. Brokaw moved on.
At other moments, though, Mr. Brokaw can evoke Mr. Russert's prosecutorial style. Throughout his interview with Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Axelrod, he interjected the kinds of provocative quotations from others that were a Russert trademark.
One, from The Wall Street Journal, and another, from Robert L. Bixby, a nonpartisan fiscal analyst, were critical of the economic approaches of both Senators McCain and Obama. Two other quotations cited by Mr. Brokaw, though, singled out Mr. McCain for criticism.
Asked if time he had spent with Mr. McCain -- as contrasted with Mr. Obama, whom he does not know socially -- would be of any help to Mr. McCain in the debate, Mr. Brokaw promised it would not. Indeed, after Sunday's broadcast he expressed frustration with both candidates, particularly when it came to their comments in Friday's debate on the economic crisis.
''They didn't come very prepared on the economy,'' he said. ''They're both trying to give the impression they're involved, but plainly they're not.''
''I was interested in how the two of them stuck by their budget programs,'' he said. ''There was nothing that Obama has proposed that he's willing to cut. McCain insisted he could balance a budget with spending cuts. Give me'' -- and here he paused for emphasis -- ''a break. Nobody believes that, in either case.''
Mr. Brokaw's obvious engagement left a visitor to wonder whether, come November, he would be reluctant to relinquish his ringside seat at one of the more important junctures in the nation's history. He insisted he would be ready to step aside.
''This is not like wading into a trout stream,'' he said.

HEADLINE: When Madmen Reign

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Madness.
 I'm not holding my breath, but I would like to see the self-proclaimed conservative, small government, anti-regulation, free-market zealots step up and take responsibility for wrecking the American economy and bringing about the worst financial crisis since the Depression.
 Even now, with the house on fire, the most extreme among them won't pick up the fire hoses and try to put it out. 
 With the fate of the Bush administration's desperate $700 billion bailout of the financial industry hanging in the balance, Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, stuck to his political playbook like a man covered in Krazy Glue. He pronounced himself ''resolute'' in his opposition to the bailout because to be otherwise would amount to a betrayal of party principles. 
 To deviate from those principles, in Mr. Issa's view, would be like placing ''a coffin on top of Ronald Reagan's coffin.''
 We are in very strange territory here. 
 George H.W. Bush warned us about ''voodoo economics'' in 1980, but the ideologues clamped a gag on him and put him on the Gipper's ticket. For much of the time since then, the madmen of the right have carried the day. They were freed of their remaining few restraints with the ascendance of George W. Bush in 2000. 
 These were the reckless clowns who led us into the foolish multitrillion-dollar debacle in Iraq and who crafted tax policies that enormously benefited millionaires and billionaires while at the same time ran up staggering amounts of government debt. This is the crowd that contributed mightily to the greatest disparities in wealth in the U.S. since the gilded age.
 This was the crowd that cut the cords of corporate and financial regulations and in myriad other ways gleefully hacked away at the best interests of the United States.
 Now we're looking into the abyss.
 When President Bush went on television last week to drum up support for the bailout package, he looked almost dazed, like someone who'd just climbed out of an auto wreck. 
 ''Our entire economy is in danger,'' he said.
 He should have said that he, along with his irresponsible Republican colleagues and their running buddies in the corporate and financial sectors, put the entire economy in danger. John McCain and his economic main man, Phil (''this is a mental recession'') Gramm, were right there running with them.
 Credit markets have frozen almost solid, banks are toppling like dominoes and brokerage houses are vanishing like props in a magic act. And who was one of the paramount leaders of the manic anti-regulatory charge that led to this sorry state of affairs? None other than Mr. Gramm himself, a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. 
 Where is Mr. Gramm now? Would you believe that he's the vice chairman of UBS Securities, the investment banking arm of the Swiss bank UBS? Of course you would. A New York Times article last spring noted that the ''elite private bankers'' of UBS ''built a lucrative business in recent years by discreetly tending the fortunes of American millionaires and billionaires.''
 Toadying to the rich while sabotaging the interests of working people was always Mr. Gramm's specialty. He was considered a likely choice to be treasury secretary in a McCain administration until he made his impolitic ''mental recession'' comment. He also said the U.S. was a ''nation of whiners.''
 The tone-deaf remarks in the midst of severe economic hard times undermined Senator McCain's convoluted efforts to reinvent himself as some kind of populist. But they were wholly in keeping with the economic worldview of conservative Republicans.
 The inescapable disconnect between rhetoric and reality is often stark. Senator McCain has been ranting recently about the excessive pay and ''bloated golden parachutes'' of failed corporate executives. And yet one of his closest advisers on economic matters is Carly Fiorina, who was forced out as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Her golden parachute was an estimated $42 million.
 Voters have to shoulder a great deal of the blame for the economic mess the country is in. Too many were willing, for whatever reasons, to support politicians who spat in the eye of economic common sense. Now the voodoo that permeated conservative economic policies for so many years has come back to haunt us big-time.
 The question voters should be asking John McCain is whether he has stopped serving his party's economic Kool-Aid, which has taken such a toll on working families, and is ready to change his ways. Is his sudden populist transformation the real thing or just a mirage?
 In the gale force winds of a full-fledged economic hurricane, it's fair to ask Senator McCain whether he still considers himself a conservative, small government, anti-regulation, free-market zealot. Or whether he's seen the light.

HEADLINE: City Sues Reservation's Cigarette Stores

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Plunging headfirst into a delicate issue that has long bedeviled New York State and Long Island's Indian tribes, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg criticized Gov. David A. Paterson on Monday for not enforcing cigarette tax laws, which the mayor estimated had deprived the city of up to $195 million a year in revenue.
 Residents of Indian reservations -- like the 50-acre Poospatuck reservation in Mastic -- are entitled to buy cigarettes tax free for their own use. 
 But in a federal lawsuit filed on Monday, the Bloomberg administration accused eight stores on the reservation in Suffolk County of breaking state and federal law by selling cigarettes in bulk to bootleggers. The bootleggers, the lawsuit said, then shipped the cigarettes into the city.
 At a news conference in City Hall, Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that the practice had existed for years. But he said the city's lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, would not have been necessary if the state had been enforcing the law.
 Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg said, the state also would have benefited with $525 million a year in tax revenue. 
 ''I think the governor should go to the reservations and say, 'As of tomorrow morning, stop this practice,' '' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And if it requires law enforcement, that's what the governor has the State Police for -- to enforce the law.''
 To reinforce just how prevalent the practice was, Mr. Bloomberg stood next to a table stacked with packs of cigarettes and said that each of the 279 residents of the Poospatuck reservation -- every man, woman and child -- would have to smoke 960 packs, or 19,200 cigarettes, a day to account for the millions of cigarettes sold there in 2007. 
 The mayor framed the lawsuit in the context of the global financial crisis, noting that the city was trying to slice $500 million from this year's budget, and was likely to propose raising property taxes by 7 percent to generate an additional $600 million starting in January. ''This one step alone could go a long ways in closing our budget gap,'' he said.
 When asked about Mr. Bloomberg's criticisms, Errol Cockfield, a spokesman for Mr. Paterson, said the governor was involved in discussions with the state's Indian nations, those recognized by the state or the federal government, ''to preclude the need for more endless litigation.''
 Harry Wallace, who is a lawyer and the chief of the Unkechaug Indian Nation, which is on the Poospatuck reservation, said in a telephone interview that he had not heard about the lawsuit.
 ''Before we get a lawsuit, before we even get served, he serves the media first,'' Mr. Wallace said of Mr. Bloomberg. ''This debate has reached fanatical levels, where we are being scapegoated from everything from the fiscal crisis in New York to the mortgage crisis. I assume that at some point we'll be blamed for global warming.''
 The lawsuit is part of a broader strategy by Mr. Bloomberg to tackle cigarette bootlegging as well as reduce smoking in New York. Earlier this year, the city won a couple of legal victories: cigarette wholesalers were found potentially liable for violating a federal law, and the city was allowed to proceed with racketeering lawsuits against out-of-state Internet cigarette retailers.
 The latest move seeks to go after cigarette retailers, but it could also entangle issues of Indian sovereignty, said Kathryn R. L. Rand, a law professor at the University of North Dakota who is an expert on Indian gambling.
 ''It has legal merit, but I think it's pushing the envelope a little bit,'' she said.

HEADLINE: With Deal's Collapse, the McCain Camp Attacks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and JEFF ZELENY; Michael Cooper reported from West Des Moines, Iowa, and Jeff Zeleny from Westminster, Colo.

DATELINE: WEST DES MOINES, Iowa 

 BODY:
Besides stockholders whose portfolios were ravaged Monday afternoon, the one person with the most riding on the bailout bill that collapsed in Congress may have been Senator John McCain. 
 Mr. McCain had announced last week that he was suspending his presidential campaign to work to ensure the legislation's passage, even at the risk of skipping the first presidential debate unless a deal was locked down. (He later relented, debating without a deal.) He had called for the high-level White House meeting that some participants later called unhelpful. And after some initial hesitation, he had allowed himself to be identified with a bill that he thought necessary even if unpopular.
 So when the deal fell apart on the House floor Monday, in no small measure because most of the chamber's Republicans balked at voting for it, the McCain campaign worked to contain the potential for damage. The first defense was to go on offense. 
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a senior McCain adviser, said ''partisan attacks'' by Senator Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress had caused some Republicans uncertain about the legislation to turn against it and so had ''put at risk the homes, livelihoods and savings of millions of American families.'' The Obama campaign immediately dismissed that response as ''angry and hyperpartisan.''
 Then, after Mr. Obama had urged Americans and the financial markets to ''stay calm'' in the wake of the rescue plan's collapse, while prodding Congress to ''get this done,'' Mr. McCain hastily called a news conference here in which he, too, seemed to place some blame on Mr. Obama.
 ''Senator Obama and his allies in Congress infused unnecessary partisanship into the process,'' Mr. McCain said, before adding in almost the same breath: ''Now is not the time to fix the blame. It's time to fix the problem.''
 Both campaigns pledged to support efforts to resolve the situation, though they were short on details. Mr. McCain's campaign said he would continue to monitor developments closely to see whether more House Republicans could now be persuaded to vote for the bill, or whether it had to be amended to address their concerns. But his aides said there did not appear to be a need to return to Washington immediately, since Congress had recessed for Rosh Hashana.
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin, the campaign's senior economic adviser, told reporters that ''we don't have a specific proposal that we believe is the magic bullet.''
 ''Having failed to have that bill passed through the House,'' he said, ''I think it's time to regroup and see whether it's the content, whether it's the nature of the debate that went on on the floor of the House today, or whether people really just need to take one look around the financial markets and have a wake-up call and do the right thing.''
 Mr. Obama had said he was inclined to support the bill that failed Monday. But it remains an open question how much political capital he will seek to expend, or how invested he wants to become, in helping Democratic leaders win passage of a bill. 
 The failure of the measure took both camps by surprise. Mr. Obama, who was campaigning Monday in Colorado, had already sent reporters the advance text of a speech he planned to give lauding the agreement. And Mr. McCain, at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, seemed to be taking some credit for the bill.
 Democrats had said all along that by inserting himself into negotiations, Mr. McCain had brought presidential politics to a delicate situation and could wind up hurting more than helping. After the House vote, his aides bristled at the suggestion that his involvement had in fact been a drawback, saying he had been instrumental in getting House Republicans a seat at the negotiating table and helping bring in more of their votes.
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin said Mr. McCain had made ''dozens of calls'' on the bill, some to House Republicans who opposed it.
 Aides to Mr. Obama said he had not directly reached out to try to sway any House Democrats who opposed the measure. But where Mr. McCain had accused Mr. Obama of taking a hands-off approach to the financial crisis, Democratic advisers said they believed that Mr. McCain now had a role in the legislation's failure. 
 As aides to both campaigns pointed fingers, Mr. Obama sought to stay above the fray and maintain a steady demeanor that advisers maintain has set him apart throughout the financial turmoil. 
 ''One of the messages that I have to Congress is, Get this done,'' he said in Colorado after the House vote. ''Democrats, Republicans, step up to the plate and get this done. Understand even as you get it done to stabilize the markets, we have more work to do to make sure that Main Street is getting the same kind of help that Wall Street is getting. We cannot forget who this is for. This is for the American people. This shouldn't be for a few insiders.''

HEADLINE: A Squeeze On Giving Is Expected

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
To the list of big losers in the turmoil on Wall Street, add these: some big foundations.
 Several prominent foundations in the New York area have been particularly damaged by the recent collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and the difficulties of the American International Group. The biggest among them is the Starr Foundation, which held 15.5 million shares of A.I.G. in May. Its assets have fallen by at least $1 billion since the end of 2006, or by nearly one-third of its total value at that time. The 2006 figures are the most recent data available.
 Some personal foundations of Bear Stearns executives have been hurt as well, because they held Bear stock. In addition, Bear's corporate culture, where each year 1,000 senior managing directors gave away 4 percent of their compensation to charity, has disappeared. 
 The Lehman Brothers Foundation has $28 million in assets, and a spokesman said the foundation's holdings were diversified. Still, there is no certainty that the foundation will get any new contributions. Some of Lehman's operations have been acquired by Barclays Capital. Generally when companies merge, the foundations also merge. 
 Some of Lehman top executives, too, had foundations that played a role in New York philanthropy. A foundation set up by Richard S. Fuld Jr., Lehman's chairman and chief executive -- the Kathy and Richard S. Fuld Jr. Family Foundation -- gave away about $5 million in 2006. The Fulds are still on the philanthropy scene, and are among the co-chairmen at the New York Public Library's annual gala on Nov. 3. But it is too early to forecast their future role, given the changing economic environment.
 What this all means to the recipients of those foundations' largess is still largely unknown. Foundations are required by law to give away at least 5 percent of their assets a year. But when their assets shrink, their donations tend to shrink as well. Gathering enough money to return to their previous level is often hard. 
 At the same time, individual and corporate gifts to foundations and other charities generally slow during hard times. According to research prepared by Giving USA, donations did not keep pace with inflation for three consecutive years around two economic slumps, in 1973 and 2001. 
 ''The long and the short of it is that most foundations pay out what they have to, and if the 5 percent is a percentage of a lower amount, they will pay less,'' said Joel L. Fleishman, author of ''The Foundation: A Great American Secret'' (Public Affairs, 2007). ''To be sure, some foundations would rather dip into capital than cut back on commitments. They rarely do that. But in terms of new commitments, that is where the brunt of the problem will be felt.''
 Florence A. Davis, president of the Starr Foundation, said she expected that the foundation would ''be making smaller grants going forward.'' She added: ''At least for the time being, some of the initiatives will be put on the back burner. That is unfortunate because more than half of our giving over our 53 years has been in the city of New York: well over $1 billion.'' 
 She was quick to add that the foundation was still large and ''we have a lot of cash,'' and that it would honor all its existing commitments.
 The charities are clearly nervous. ''We are getting a lot of calls from institutions,'' said one foundation director, who asked for anonymity because the calls were private. ''They are polite, but they are clearly worried.'' 
 Phyllis Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Hospital for Special Surgery, said the institution received money from both the Starr Foundation and the Lehman Brothers Foundation. ''We got a $1 million grant last year from Lehman Brothers when we honored Richard Fuld,'' she said. ''We got $400,000 so far. We don't know what will happen.''
 Randolph Peers, executive director at Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow, which helps disadvantaged youths and adults learn skills to get jobs, got $75,000 a year from the Starr Foundation for five years but will not get money this year. ''We were told that the foundation was focusing on other priorities,'' he said. Mr. Peers said he was grateful for the help, but ''it hurts to lose $75,000.'' 
 He predicts that the fallout from Wall Street ''will impact us all.'' As a result, he said, ''We have to tighten out budgets. We won't see such generous philanthropy coming our way, and people in my field are going to have a harder time finding jobs for disadvantaged adults when the job market is tightening.''
 To be sure, foundations generally try to make sure that gifts do not drop precipitously. Starr appears to be planning to give away more than 5 percent of its assets this year, and it says it is completing its planned gifts. The foundation has pledged $7.5 million over five years beginning in 2006 to the New York Public Library, for example, and a library spokesman said it was on track to meet its pledges.
 Starr remains one of the largest foundations in the country. It gave away $198 million in 2006, much of it in New York. The donations ranged from a three-year commitment totaling $50 million to a stem cell research project involving Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital and Rockefeller University to a $600,000 grant to train New York state teachers who work with the visually impaired. 
 Among the things that will be shelved for the future are efforts to fight childhood obesity and teacher training for math and science, Ms. Davis said. 
 The Starr Foundation is named for Cornelius Vander Starr, who founded A.I.G. in 1919 and later hired Maurice R. Greenberg, who would one day succeed him as chief executive and build the company into an insurance colossus. Mr. Greenberg, who was pushed out of A.I.G. in an accounting scandal in 2005, remains chairman of the foundation and is still embattled in lawsuits surrounding his role at the company. 
 His role at the foundation, too, has been an issue. There have long been questions about whether Mr. Greenberg used the foundation to further his own goals. 
 While the real sting of the Wall Street fallout has yet to be felt, some charities are at least trying to tighten their belts. Last spring, a breakfast honoring the veteran hedge fund manager John M. Angelo of Angelo, Gordon & Company raised a record $2 million for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation. 
 But the foundation's executive director, Lorraine W. Egan, said, ''Many people have lost a lot of their wealth.'' Among the donors to the breakfast was Lehman Brothers, she said, ''which gave us $25,000.'' She added: ''I think all charities are inevitably going to be hit. We have built up an endowment over 60 years, so we can dip into it. But the bad economy will definitely take a toll.''
 Ms. Egan said she decided against hiring more staff at the foundation in an effort to control costs. 
 Some charities are already instituting new programs to raise larger amounts from existing donors who may have adequate financial resources.
 ''I think there is clearly an impact on philanthropy,'' said Paul M. Cane, a senior vice president at UJA-Federation New York. ''At UJA, for those who can't make a gift now because of their jobs, we have asked the big givers to do more to offset those who can't give. We are creating a challenge pool for the leadership that will match a percentage of any new gift as well as any increase in this year's giving from existing donors.'' 
 Even those who are still working are likely to watch their wallets in such uncertain times. ''The wild swings create uneasiness in terms of what the future holds for individuals,'' said Douglas Rothermich, vice president for estate planning and trust consulting at TIAA-CREF. ''It is going to cause them to slow down in giving.''
 Laurance R. Hoagland Jr., chief investment officer of the $8.5 billion William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, noted that foundations must pay out 5 percent. Accounting for inflation, he said, ''You need an 8 percent nominal return to maintain your giving power.'' But, he said, ''Most foundations will have a negative return, so that is the decline in giving power. If it goes on for several years, that is a real dent in the giving power of the sector.''

HEADLINE: An Alternative to Armageddon

 BODY:
It is easy to see why investors freaked out when the House of Representatives drove a stake through the Bush administration's $700 billion plan to re-animate the banking industry. The demise, at least for now, of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's Troubled Asset Relief Program is certain to cause more pain -- and not just for Wall Street fat cats.
The failure of the United States government to emerge as a willing buyer for hundreds of billions of dollars of toxic assets will accelerate the painful process of deleveraging, bringing with it more bank failures. That, in turn, will shrink the size of the private sector balance sheet that consumers and companies have come to rely upon. 
Monday's whopping 7 percent collapse in the Dow Jones industrial average and a spike in equity volatility, among other signs of market distress, suggest that investors fear this could spell financial Armageddon. But it doesn't have to. The last week's rescues of the banking industry's two biggest problem children -- Washington Mutual and Wachovia -- offer hope that some combination of free-market capitalism and existing mechanisms for government assistance will provide solutions to the crisis.
That may not offer bank shareholders much comfort. They will probably suffer from the lack of the Treasury's plan, which helped them by offering banks a way to offload troubled assets for more than they were valued by the market. Reducing the banks' losses would have indirectly lifted the capital of the banking system.
But the plan did not specifically address the root cause of the crisis -- declining housing prices. Mr. Paulson might be right in arguing that it was needed to keep the credit system humming along, and with it the United States economy. But Democrats struggled to persuade their constituents, who saw it as a bailout of Wall Street, that it would help them much. Republicans, meanwhile, saw the program as a violation of the free-market principles on which the party once stood.
Yet there may be a way forward. Take the way government agencies engineered the rescue of Wachovia over the weekend. Citigroup is paying $2.1 billion for the bulk of Wachovia's businesses and taking on its $700 billion in assets. For a bank with its own difficulties, this might seem foolhardy.
So to grease the wheels, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has essentially given Citi an insurance policy against outsize losses on the $312 billion of Wachovia's mortgage-related and other assets regarded as dicey. The F.D.I.C. will be on the hook for the rest.
That's sort of what Mr. Paulson's plan was supposed to do. And as he proposed in the Tarp, the F.D.I.C. is getting a mix of preferred stock and warrants worth $12 billion that allows it to benefit from any increase in Citi's value, while also increasing the bank's capital ratios. Citi is also raising $10 billion from its own shareholders to finance the deal. The end result is a hybrid of risk-taking by the American taxpayer and Citi's shareholders.
Of course, Citi's chief, Vikram Pandit, might have struggled to sell the Wachovia deal to his board without the government's bailout plan on the horizon. But it would equally have been irresponsible for Citi -- or for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested respectively in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in the last week -- to have agreed a deal predicated on Congressional approval.
These deals -- along with JPMorgan's acquisition of Washington Mutual in another F.D.I.C.-brokered deal on Thursday -- show that willing buyers can be found for distressed institutions with the government mechanisms that are already available. The more the government helps, up front or through some sort of insurance, the less risible the price a savior will offer.
Whether or not Mr. Paulson's Tarp comes back to life, there will be more pain, particularly on Wall Street, but also on Main Street. As the credit spigot dries up further, it will be harder for companies to borrow and invest in their businesses, despite the Federal Reserve's separate efforts to flood the system with money. It will cost more for consumers to mortgage their homes or gear up their car purchases. But the additional pain of living without the Tarp could be beneficial in the long run, if it brings more reliance on sound market principles. ROB COX

HEADLINE: A Leadership Breakdown

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Jeff Zeleny, Michael Cooper and Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The collapse of the proposed rescue plan for the teetering financial system was the product of a larger failure -- of political leadership in Washington -- at a moment when the world was looking to the United States to contain the cascading economic crisis.
From the White House to Congress to the presidential campaign trail, the principal players did not rally the votes they needed in the House. They appeared not to comprehend or address in a convincing way an intense strain of opposition to the deal among voters. They allowed partisan politics to flare at sensitive moments. 
If there was any doubt that President Bush had been left politically impotent by his travails over the last few years and his lame-duck status, it was erased on Monday when, despite his personal pleas, more than two-thirds of the Republicans in the House abandoned the plan.
While there were lawmakers who opposed the package on the merits, with Election Day just five weeks away, substantial numbers decided that to favor the bill would be to imperil their own political futures. And once the vote was under way and so few Republicans were voting aye, Democrats were disinclined to force more of their members to help pass the unpopular plan.
The leaders of both parties failed, many analysts agreed, in bringing the measure to the House floor without knowing whether it had the votes to pass -- a bad move at any time, but especially so in this case given the risk of the markets and the badly weakened financial system reacting badly.
Representative John A. Boehner, the House Republican leader, became emotional as he urged his party to muster the will to approve the package. After his members overwhelmingly voted against it, he tried to shift the blame to a partisan speech delivered on the floor just before the vote by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker.
Ms. Pelosi delivered the Democratic votes she had promised, but could not muster enough of them to avert a defeat that could long be remembered.
The candidates to replace Mr. Bush, Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama, were far from Washington, bit actors at best in helping to resolve a crisis that one of them will inherit.
The breakdown, even if temporary, pointed up the difficulties of dealing with fast-moving emergencies through the slow-moving and inherently political legislative process. And despite rare bipartisan agreement among party leaders in this case, the gulf between what lawmakers were hearing in Washington and what they have been hearing from home proved too vast for many people, particularly Republicans, to jump.
As a study in his prospective leadership, the role of Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential nominee, has done him no political good. After suspending his campaign last week and vowing to work with Republicans until a resolution was in hand, Mr. McCain was campaigning in Ohio on Monday with his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, as the House vote commenced. There he implicitly took credit for the compromise bailout that Congressional leaders had negotiated over the weekend, even as it was going down to defeat.
On his plane before takeoff to Iowa, Mr. McCain spoke by phone with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. With no credit to claim in the bill's defeat, he flew to Iowa without making a statement to reporters on board. In Iowa, he criticized Mr. Obama, his Democratic rival, before adding, ''Now is not the time to fix blame.''
Even before the vote, House Republicans had trouble pointing to any contributions from Mr. McCain to their deliberations since late last week, when he and they forced the administration officials and Congressional leaders to reopen negotiations and alter the package to impose some safeguards for taxpayers' billions.
Mr. Obama, campaigning in Colorado, also was taken by surprise. He quickly revised his speech, which announced the bipartisan agreement, to instead call for Congress to ''step up to the plate and get this done.'' While Mr. Obama had tepidly endorsed the plan and kept in daily touch with Mr. Paulson and Congressional leaders, aides said he did not twist Democrats' arms to support it.
At the White House, aides described the president as working the phones to lobby a dozen Republicans. Vice President Dick Cheney, a former No. 2 House Republican leader, pitched in, with no better luck. ''I think everyone with a phone is calling to see if we can shore up a member who may be skeptical of the proposal,'' Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said before the vote.
But numerous other Republicans, including lawmakers and veterans of past administrations, complained that it was too little, too late. They said Mr. Bush should have summoned lawmakers to the White House and gone to the Capitol to personally plead his case -- as other presidents including Mr. Bush have done in the past to sell their highest priorities. ''Reagan did it!'' one said.
''There probably could have been an outreach that began earlier than in just the last couple of days,'' said Representative Adam Putman of Florida, a member of the Republican leadership, who supported the bailout. ''But it is very difficult to deal with an outgoing administration''-- its leverage waning -- ''than one that's early in its term.''
The episode underscored that Mr. Bush's credibility and political clout, long gone among Democrats, is lacking among Republicans as well. ''There is a fair number of people who believe we're not staring into the abyss as has been represented,'' Mr. Putnam said. ''And some people do believe we are facing a market collapse and something needs to be done, but they would rather not be the ones who have to vote for it.''
Mr. Putnam, who lobbied colleagues opposed to the plan, said they were reporting that calls against the bailout were pouring in at the rate of several hundred to every one supporting it.
Both parties agreed the bailout would easily pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate, with support from most of the Republicans there. So the House Republicans made the difference. Their mutiny captured just how much the Republican Party has changed from its 19th-century roots as the party of business and economic stewardship.
''I don't think this was a failure of leadership so much as a failure of followership,'' said Thomas Mann, a scholar on Congress at the Brookings Institution. ''This is a function of a group of House Republicans who are philosophically opposed to doing anything like this bailout and are prepared to take the risk.''

HEADLINE: Transcript of Speaker Pelosi's Speech

 BODY:
Text of a speech given by Speaker Nancy Pelosi before the House vote on the bailout plan on Monday.
 Madam speaker, when was the last time anyone ever asked you for $700 billion? It's a staggering figure. And many questions have arisen from that request. And we have been hearing, I think, a very informed debate on all sides -- of -- of this issue here today. I'm proud of the debate. 
 $700 billion. A staggering number. But only a part of the cost of the failed Bush economic policies to our country. Policies that were built on budget recklessness. When President Bush took office, he inherited President Clinton's surpluses -- four years in a row, budget surpluses, on a trajectory of $5.6 trillion in surplus. And with his reckless economic policies, within two years, he had turned that around. 
 And now eight years later, the foundation of that fiscal irresponsibility, combined with an anything goes economic policy, has taken us to where we are today. They claim to be free market advocates, when it's really an anything goes mentality. No regulation, no supervision, no discipline. And if you fail, you will have a golden parachute, and the taxpayer will bail you out. 
 Those days are over. The party is over in that respect. Democrats believe in a free market. We know that it can create jobs, it can create wealth, it can create many good things in our economy. But in this case, in its unbridled form, as encouraged, supported, by the Republicans -- some in the Republican Party, not all -- it has created not jobs, not capital, it has created chaos. 
 And it is that chaos that the secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the Fed came to see us just about a week and a half ago -- seems like an eternity, doesn't it, so much has happened, the news was so bad. They described a very, very dismal situation. A dismal situation describing the state of our economy, the fragility of our financial institutions and the instability of our markets, our equity markets, our credit markets, our bond market. 
 And here we were listening to people who knew of what they spoke. Secretary of the Treasury brings long credentials and knowledge of the markets. More fearful, though, to me, more scary, was the statement -- were the statements of Chairman Bernanke [Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve], because Chairman Bernanke is probably one of the foremost authorities in America on the subject of the Great Depression. I don't know what was so great about the Depression, but that's the name they give it. And we heard the secretary and the chairman tell us that this was a once in a hundred year phenomenon, this fiscal crisis was so drastic. Certainly once in 50 years, probably once in a hundred years. 
 And how did it sneak up on us? So silently, almost on little cat feet. That they would come in on that day -- and they didn't actually ask for the money, that much money that night. It took two days until we saw the legislation that they were proposing to help calm the markets. And it was on that day that we learned of a $700 billion request. 
 But it wasn't just the money that was alarming. It was the nature of the legislation. It gave the secretary of the Treasury czar-like powers, unlimited powers, latitude to do all kinds of things and specifically prohibited judicial review or review of any other federal administrative agency to review their actions. 
 Another aspect of it that was alarming is it gave the secretary the power to use any money that came back from these infusions of cash to be used at the discretion of the secretary. Not to reduce the deficit, not to go into the general funds so that we could afford other priorities. To be used at the discretion of the secretary. It was shocking. Working together in a bipartisan way, we were able to make major improvements on that proposal, even though its fundamental basis was almost arrogant and insulting. 
 The American people responded almost immediately. Overwhelmingly, they said they know that something needs to be done. Say 78 percent of the American people said Congress must act. Fifty-eight-some percent said, but not to accept the Bush proposal. And so here we are today, a week later and a couple of days later, coming to the floor with a product -- not a bill that I would have written, one that has major disappointments with me, beginning with the fact that it does not have bankruptcy in this bill -- and we will continue to persist and work to achieve that. 
 It's interesting, though, to me that when they describe this, the magnitude of the challenge and the precipice that we were on and how we had to act quickly and we had to act boldly and we had to act now, that it never occurred to them that the consequences of this market were being felt well in advance by the American people. And unemployment is up, and therefore we need unemployment insurance. That jobs are lacking, and therefore we need a stimulus package. So how can on the one hand could this be so urgent at the moment, and yet so unnecessary for us to address the effects of this poor economy in the households of America across our country? 
 We'll come back to that in a moment. Working together, we put together some standards -- and I am really proud of what Barney Frank did in this regard. The first night, that night, that Thursday night, when we got the very, very dismal news, he immediately said, if we're going to do this -- and Spencer Bachus was a part of this as well -- in terms of if we're going to do this, we must have equity for the American people. We're putting up $700 billion, we want the American people to get some of the upside. So equity, fairness for the American people. 
 Secondly, if they were describing the root of the problem as the mortgage-backed securities, Barney insisted that we would have forbearance on foreclosure. If we're now going to own that paper, that we would then have forbearance to help responsible homeowners stay in their home. 
 In addition to that, we have to have strong, strong oversight. We didn't even have to see the $700 billion or the full extent of their bill to know that we needed equity and upside for the taxpayer, forbearance for the homeowner, oversight of the government on what they were doing, and something that the American people understand full well, an end to the golden parachutes and the -- a -- review and reform of the compensation for C.E.O.'s. 
 Let's get this straight. We have a situation where on Wall Street people are flying high, they are making unconscionable amounts of money. They make a lot of money, they privatize the gain, the minute things go tough, they nationalize the risk. They get a golden parachute as they drive their firm into the ground, and the American people have to pick up the tab. Something is very, very wrong with this picture. 
 So just on first blush, that Thursday night, we made it clear, meeting much resistance on the part of the administration, that those four things, equity, forbearance, oversight, and reform of compensation. Overriding all of this is a protection of the taxpayer. We need to stabilize the markets. In doing so, we need to protect the taxpayers. 
 And that's why I'm so glad that this bill contains a suggestion made by Mr. Tanner [Representative John Tanner, Democrat of Tennessee] that if at the end of the day, say in five years, when we can take a review of the success or whatever of this initiative, that if there is a shortfall and we don't get our whole $700 billion back that we have invested, that there will be an initiative to have the financial institutions that benefited from this program to make up that shortfall. 
 But not one penny of this should be carried by the American people. People asked, and Mr. Spratt [Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina] spoke with great knowledge and eloquence on the budget and aspects of the budget. $700 billion, what is the impact, what is the opportunity cost for our country of the investments that we would want to make? 
 O.K., now we have it in place where the taxpayer is going to be made whole and that was very important for us. But why on the drop of a hat can they ask us for $700 billion, and we couldn't get any support from the administration on a stimulus package that would also help grow the economy? 
 People tell me all over the world that the biggest emerging market, economic market in the world, is rebuilding the infrastructure of America. Roads, bridges, waterways, water systems in addition to waterways. The grid, broadband, schools, housing, certain schools. We are trillions of dollars in deficit there. 
 We know what we need to do to do it in a fiscally sound way, in a fiscally sound way that creates good-paying jobs in America immediately. Brings money into the treasury by doing so, and again does all of this in an all-American way. Good-paying jobs here in America. 
 We can't get the time of day for 25, $35 billion for that, which we know guarantees jobs, et cetera, but $700 billion. So make no mistake, when this Congress adjourns today to observe Rosh Hashanah and have members go home for a bit, we are doing so at the call of the chair. Because this subject is not over, this discussion about how we save our economy. 
 And we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street. And as Congresswoman Waters [Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California] said, Martin Luther King Drive, in my district Martin Luther King Drive, and Cedar Chavez Road and all of the manifestations of community and small businesses in our community. We must insulate them from that. And so we have difficult choices, and so many of the things that were said on both sides of this issue in terms of its criticisms of the bill we have and the bill that we had at first, and the very size of this, I share. You want to go home, so I'm not going to list all of my concerns that I have with it. 
 But it just comes down to one simple thing. They have described a precipice. We are on the brink of doing something that might pull us back from that precipice. I think we have a responsibility. We have worked in a bipartisan way. I want to acknowledge Mr. Blunt and Mr. Boehner, the work that we have done together, trying to find as much common ground as possible on this. 
 But we insisted the taxpayer be covered. We all insisted that we have a party-is-over message to Wall Street. And we insisted that, that taxpayers at risk must recover -- that any risk must be recovered. I told you that already. So, my colleagues, let's recognize that this Congressional -- this legislation is not the end of the line. 
 Mr. Waxman [Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California] will be having vigorous oversight this week, hearings this week on regulatory reform and other aspects of it. I hope you will pursue fraud and mismanagement and the rest. Mr. Frank and his committee will continue to pursue other avenues that we can stabilize the markets and protect the taxpayer. For too long, this government, in eight years, has followed a right-wing ideology of anything goes, no supervision, no discipline, no regulation. 
 Again, all of us are believers in free markets, but we have to do it right. Now, let me again acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of Mr. Frank. He has been an exceptional leader in the Congress, but never has his knowledge and his experience and his judgment been more needed than now. And I thank you, Mr. Frank, for your exceptional leadership, Mr. Chairman. 
 I also -- so many people worked on this, but I also want to acknowledge the distinguished chair of our caucus, Mr. Emanuel. His knowledge of the markets, the respect he commands on those subjects, and his boundless energy on the subjects served us well in these negotiations. But this, this is a bipartisan initiative that we are bringing to the floor. We have to have a bipartisan vote on this. That is the only message that will send a message of confidence to the markets. 
 So I hope that -- I know that we will be able to live up to our side of the bargain. I hope the Republicans will, too. 
 But my colleagues, as you go home and see your families and observe the holiday and the rest, don't get settled in too far, because as long as the American -- this challenge is there for the American people, the threat of losing their jobs, the credit, their credit, their jobs, their savings, their retirement, the opportunity for them to send their children to college. 
 As long as in the households of America, this crisis is being felt very immediately and being addressed at a different level, we must come back, and we will come back as soon and as often as it is necessary to make the change that is necessary. And before long we will have a new Congress, a new president of the United States, and we will be able to take our country in a new direction.

HEADLINE: DEFIANT HOUSE REJECTS HUGE BAILOUT; STOCKS PLUNGE; NEXT STEP IS UNCERTAIN

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Robert Pear, Steven Lee Myers and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Defying President Bush and the leaders of both parties, rank-and-file lawmakers in the House on Monday rejected a $700 billion economic rescue plan in a revolt that rocked the Capitol, sent markets plunging and left top lawmakers groping for a resolution.
The stunning defeat of the proposal on a 228-205 vote after marathon talks by senior Congressional and Bush administration officials lowered a fog of uncertainty over economies around the globe. Its authors had described the measure as essential to preventing widespread economic calamity.
The markets began to plummet even before the 15-minute voting period expired on the House floor. For 25 more minutes, uncertainty gripped the nation as television showed party leaders trying, and failing, to muster more support. Finally, Representative Ellen Tauscher, Democrat of California, pounded the gavel and it was done.
In the end, only 65 Republicans -- just one-third of those voting -- backed the plan despite personal pleas from President Bush and encouragement from their presidential nominee, Senator John McCain. By contrast, 140 Democrats, or 60 percent, voted in favor, many after voicing grave misgivings. Their nominee, Senator Barack Obama, also backed the bill. 
By the end of day, the Dow had fallen almost 778 points, or nearly 7 percent, to 10,365. Credit markets also remained distressed, with bank lending rates rising and investors fleeing to the safety of Treasury bills.
Among opponents of the rescue plan, some Republicans cited ideological objections to government intervention, and liberal Democrats said they were of no mind to race to aid Wall Street tycoons. Other critics complained about haste and secrecy in assembling the plan.
But lawmakers on both sides pointed to an outpouring of opposition from deeply hostile constituents just five weeks before every seat in the House was up for election as a fundamental reason that the measure was defeated. House members in potentially tough races and those seeking Senate seats fled from the plan in droves.
''People's re-elections played into this to a much greater degree than I would have imagined,'' said Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, a former member of the Republican leadership who is retiring this year and voted for the plan. Congressional leaders in both parties said they did not know how they would proceed but were examining options, including having the Senate, where there was more support for the bailout, advance a bill after the Jewish New Year on Tuesday. Congressional leaders said any doubt about the need for action should have been removed by the market fall.
''We're not leaving town till we get it fixed,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
At the White House, Mr. Bush met with his economic advisers as well as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to discuss next steps. ''I was disappointed in the vote,'' Mr. Bush said, appearing in the Oval Office with President Viktor A. Yushchenko of Ukraine. ''Our strategy is to continue to address this economic situation head on.''
The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who was the main architect of the financial rescue plan, said he would continue to work with Congressional leaders ''to find a way forward to pass a comprehensive plan to stabilize our financial system and protect the American people.'' He added, ''This is much too important to simply let fail.''
Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama renewed their calls for swift action, though each campaign sought to partly blame the other for the defeat.
At the Capitol, Democrats accused Republicans of failing to deliver enough number of votes. ''Sixty-seven percent of the Republican Conference decided to put political ideology ahead of the best interest of our great nation,'' the Democratic whip, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, said after the vote.
Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the Republican whip, said that before the vote he had tallied 75 votes in his conference in favor of the plan. By the time the votes were cast, the Republicans could deliver only 65 of them.
Other top Republicans pointed at what they saw as a partisan speech by Speaker Nancy Pelosi in advance of the vote as a factor -- a charge Democrats derided.
Republicans said they had alerted Democrats they might not have the numbers required. But they never recommended the legislation be put off and in the end they were unable to win any last-second converts to change the votes that would have been necessary to turn defeat into victory.
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, said he tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to sway a handful of holdouts, but eventually gave up.
''You can't break their arms, you can't put your whole relationship on the line with them and ask them to do something they do not want to do and have that member regret that vote for the rest of their life,'' said Mr. Boehner, who said he could not remember a time when the muscle of both parties and the White House failed to produce a victory.
The outcome after a slightly more than 40-minute vote on the House floor left lawmakers almost speechless. Even the strongest opponents of the measure did not expect to prevail, and the leadership of both parties, while increasingly nervous, figured they would squeak out a victory despite a parade of Republicans and Democrats to microphones to assail the measure. At the White House, the deputy press secretary, Tony Fratto, said just before the vote: ''We're confident that it will pass.''
Under the proposal, the Treasury Department could tap up to $700 billion in taxpayer money in installments to buy troubled debt from financial firms, in the hopes of freeing up credit to fuel normal economic activity.
In the final stages of negotiations, new provisions intended to recoup taxpayer losses were added. They helped the measure win support from Mr. Boehner and some other House Republican leaders, who had strongly opposed an earlier version of the bill. But they did not put the package over the top.
In impassioned speeches on the House floor, Democrats and Republicans alike vented their frustration over the nation's perilous economic condition and the uncomfortable position they were in, facing pressure to approve an unpopular bailout package during an election year, with no guarantee that it would work.
''This is a huge cow patty with a piece of marshmallow stuck in the middle of it and I am not going to eat that cow patty,'' said Representative Paul Broun, Republican of Georgia.
''Nobody wants to do this,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who nonetheless voted for it. ''Nobody wants to clean up the mess created by Wall Street recklessness.''
In the speech that Republicans said infuriated them, Ms. Pelosi accused Mr. Bush of squandering the budget surpluses of the Clinton years. ''They claim to be free-market advocates, when it's really an anything-goes mentality,'' she said. ''No supervision. No discipline. And if you fail, you will have a golden parachute and the taxpayer will bail you out.''
Democrats later said that if her speech truly cost votes, then Republicans, in the words of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, were guilty of punishing the country because Ms. Pelosi had hurt their feelings.
As the voting time expired on the floor, party leaders realized they were coming up far short. At 1:49 p.m., it was 205 for and 228 against. At 1:54 p.m., they inched closer: 207 to 226, as some representatives changed their votes. What followed was a remarkable stalemate on the House floor, with top lieutenants in both parties clutching lists of votes, as they clustered in the well and made unusual forays into what is normally enemy territory across the aisle.
''I was asking where the hell their votes were,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the No. 4 Democrat.
Mr. Blunt said he told Democrats he thought he could flip five votes, if Democrats could do the same. Democrats had warned that the Republicans that they would need to produce 80 to 100 votes to adopt an unpopular plan championed by the Republican White House. Ultimately, the Democrats decided the votes were not there and they allowed the gavel to come down. Opponents of the measure said they expected the administration and Congressional leaders to try again on a rescue proposal and were not worried about being held responsible for the stock decline or other economic uncertainty.
''I think we will be back in a couple of days with a proposal more palatable to more members,'' said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who voted against the plan. ''You don't make the biggest financial decision in the history of this country in a few days' time without hearings.''
But Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who is retiring from Congress and who backed the proposal, said those who opposed to the measure might be hearing a different message from their voters if economic conditions worsen. ''The members who voted no will have some culpability,'' he said.
The House leadership said Monday night that the House would reconvene at noon Thursday, though it was not known if another economic plan would be on the table.
''Stay tuned,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who seemed physically drained. But she added: ''What happened today cannot stand. We must move forward, and I hope that the markets will take that message.''
Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who supported the bailout, said lawmakers may quickly discover ''whether this is as dire a situation as we were told.''
''This is playing with fire,'' Mr. Walden said. ''It's very, very dangerous.''

HEADLINE: Come to Think of It, We Have a Foreign Policy, Too

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Pumping up her foreign-policy credentials as the Republican nominee for vice president, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska asks people to look at a map. Her state is a short boat ride from Russia, and it sits next to Canada. In an interview that has caused eyes to roll, even those of conservatives predisposed to her, Ms. Palin all but suggested to Katie Couric that she goes nose to nose with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia when he ''rears his head and comes into the air space of the United States of America.''
 Here in New York, we don't have much to do with Russia, unless maybe you count Brighton Beach in Brooklyn and blini eaters at the fancy tea room near Carnegie Hall. But we do have Canada next to us, right there on our northern doorstep. 
 So what's our foreign policy? New York State may not have as much territory as Alaska, but we have something like 30 times as many people. Surely, if Alaska has a foreign policy in regard to Canada, we need one as well, eh?
 Goodness knows, New York City mayors reserve a right to stake out positions all their own.
 Edward I. Koch used to thunder against the United Nations, calling it a ''cesspool.'' Rudolph W. Giulianiupset the State Department in 1995 when he ordered that the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat be bounced from a Lincoln Center concert. A year earlier, Mr. Giuliani bestowed City Hall honors on Gerry Adams, the Irish Republican Army political spokesman, even though the State Department considered the I.R.A. a terrorist group. (Seems the old line is true: One person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter.)
 Sometimes, the city conducts diplomacy through street signs. The State Department may not have accepted Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, but New York did by designating a stretch of East 70th Street to be United Jerusalem Place.
 City Council members swim at times in muddy international waters, as some did in 2002 when they invited Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, to City Hall despite his miserable human rights record. State lawmakers, too, flex their muscles on occasion. Three years ago, to show their distaste for the United Nations, they blocked a plan to make sorely needed repairs at the world organization's headquarters building.
 Given all that, it would seem not out of line to ask what New York State policy is toward the behemoth to the north and, by Palinian extension, the rest of the world.
 Aides to Gov. David A. Paterson deflected an attempt to solicit his views on Canada. The most they did was point to a speech that the governor gave in New York City last week to the Foreign Policy Association, in which he applauded an increase in the state's trade with Quebec. ''We won't always agree, and we'll always be competitive,'' Mr. Paterson said, ''and yet at the same time the success of each of us is interrelated to the success of all of us.''
 Officials in cities along the northern border were less reticent about Canada. You bet those relations are important, they said.
 Buffalo has a maritime border with Canada, as Ms. Palin noted Alaska has with Russia. A huge issue involves the Great Lakes, including Lake Erie near Buffalo. The Great Lakes Compact, which was approved by Congress and is expected to be signed by President Bush, would prohibit almost any water from being siphoned off and diverted to places outside the lakes' basin. A similar arrangement has been adopted by the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which also border the lakes. 
 ''It's a significant issue for us for a lot of reasons -- environmentally, economically,'' said Peter Cutler, a spokesman for Mayor Byron W. Brown of Buffalo.
 Trade with Canada looms large. So does the strengthened Canadian dollar, which has sent many Canadians flocking across the border to shop. Sales taxes that they pay have helped New York localities erase budget deficits.
 ''We have very close relationships with the neighbors in Canada because we share a lot of issues and we share a lot of business with the folks in that section up in Quebec,'' said Mayor Donald M. Kasprzak of Plattsburgh, which is about 15 miles from Canada in eastern New York.
 PASSPORT controls are tighter than they once were, and of course, border security is a dominant concern in the post-9/11 era. ''There have been instances in the past where the borders needed tightening up,'' Mayor Kasprzak said. ''We do have meetings on that. There's a concern lately about the problem of drug traffic going back and forth.''
 So does all this mean that he indeed has a foreign policy?
 ''Yes, we do,'' Mr. Kasprzak replied, pointing out that Plattsburgh, with about 19,000 people, is twice the size of Wasilla, Alaska, where Ms. Palin used to be the mayor.
 He did not, however, suggest that this necessarily qualified him for an office that would put him a proverbial heartbeat from the presidency.

HEADLINE: Revolt of the Nihilists

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt inherited an economic crisis. He understood that his first job was to restore confidence, to give people a sense that somebody was in charge, that something was going to be done.
 This generation of political leaders is confronting a similar situation, and, so far, they have failed utterly and catastrophically to project any sense of authority, to give the world any reason to believe that this country is being governed. Instead, by rejecting the rescue package on Monday, they have made the psychological climate much worse. 
 George W. Bush is completely out of juice, having squandered his influence with Republicans as well as Democrats. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is a smart moneyman, but an inept legislator. He was told time and time again that House Republicans would not support his bill, and his response was to get down on bended knee before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. 
 House leaders of both parties got wrapped up in their own negotiations, but did it occur to any of them that it might be hard to pass a bill fairly described as a bailout to Wall Street? Was the media darling Barney Frank too busy to notice the 95 Democrats who opposed his bill? Pelosi's fiery speech at the crucial moment didn't actually kill this bill, but did she have to act like a Democratic fund-raiser at the most important moment of her career?
 And let us recognize above all the 228 who voted no -- the authors of this revolt of the nihilists. They showed the world how much they detest their own leaders and the collected expertise of the Treasury and Fed. They did the momentarily popular thing, and if the country slides into a deep recession, they will have the time and leisure to watch public opinion shift against them. 
 House Republicans led the way and will get most of the blame. It has been interesting to watch them on their single-minded mission to destroy the Republican Party. Not long ago, they led an anti-immigration crusade that drove away Hispanic support. Then, too, they listened to the loudest and angriest voices in their party, oblivious to the complicated anxieties that lurk in most American minds.
 Now they have once again confused talk radio with reality. If this economy slides, they will go down in history as the Smoot-Hawleys of the 21st century. With this vote, they've taken responsibility for this economy, and they will be held accountable. The short-term blows will fall on John McCain, the long-term stress on the existence of the G.O.P. as we know it. 
 I've spoken with several House Republicans over the past few days and most admirably believe in free-market principles. What's sad is that they still think it's 1984. They still think the biggest threat comes from socialism and Walter Mondale liberalism. They seem not to have noticed how global capital flows have transformed our political economy. 
 We're living in an age when a vast excess of capital sloshes around the world fueling cycles of bubble and bust. When the capital floods into a sector or economy, it washes away sober business practices, and habits of discipline and self-denial. Then the money managers panic and it sloshes out, punishing the just and unjust alike. 
 What we need in this situation is authority. Not heavy-handed government regulation, but the steady and powerful hand of some public institutions that can guard against the corrupting influences of sloppy money and then prevent destructive contagions when the credit dries up.
 The Congressional plan was nobody's darling, but it was an effort to assert some authority. It was an effort to alter the psychology of the markets. People don't trust the banks; the bankers don't trust each other. It was an effort to address the crisis of authority in Washington. At least it might have stabilized the situation so fundamental reforms of the world's financial architecture could be undertaken later.
 But the 228 House members who voted no have exacerbated the global psychological free fall, and now we have a crisis of political authority on top of the crisis of financial authority.
 The only thing now is to try again -- to rescue the rescue. There's no time to find a brand-new package, so the Congressional plan should go up for another vote on Thursday, this time with additions that would change its political prospects. Leaders need to add provisions that would shore up housing prices and directly help mortgage holders. Martin Feldstein and Lawrence Lindsey both have good proposals of the sort that could lead to a plausible majority coalition. Loosening deposit insurance rules would also be nice.
 If that doesn't happen, the world could be in for some tough economic times (the Europeans, apparently, have not even begun to acknowledge their toxic debt) -- but also tough political times. 
 The American century was created by American leadership, which is scarcer than credit just about now.

HEADLINE: An Alternative to Armageddon

BYLINE: By ROB COX

 BODY:
It is easy to see why investors freaked out when the House of Representatives drove a stake through the Bush administration's $700 billion plan to re-animate the banking industry. The demise, at least for now, of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's Troubled Asset Relief Program is certain to cause more pain -- and not just for Wall Street fat cats.
The failure of the United States government to emerge as a willing buyer for hundreds of billions of dollars of toxic assets will accelerate the painful process of deleveraging, bringing with it more bank failures. That, in turn, will shrink the size of the private sector balance sheet that consumers and companies have come to rely upon. 
Monday's whopping 7 percent collapse in the Dow Jones industrial average and a spike in equity volatility, among other signs of market distress, suggest that investors fear this could spell financial Armageddon. But it doesn't have to. The last week's rescues of the banking industry's two biggest problem children -- Washington Mutual and Wachovia -- offer hope that some combination of free-market capitalism and existing mechanisms for government assistance will provide solutions to the crisis.
That may not offer bank shareholders much comfort. They will probably suffer from the lack of the Treasury's plan, which helped them by offering banks a way to offload troubled assets for more than they were valued by the market. Reducing the banks' losses would have indirectly lifted the capital of the banking system.
But the plan did not specifically address the root cause of the crisis -- declining housing prices. Mr. Paulson might be right in arguing that it was needed to keep the credit system humming along, and with it the United States economy. But Democrats struggled to persuade their constituents, who saw it as a bailout of Wall Street, that it would help them much. Republicans, meanwhile, saw the program as a violation of the free-market principles on which the party once stood.
Yet there may be a way forward. Take the way government agencies engineered the rescue of Wachovia over the weekend. Citigroup is paying $2.1 billion for the bulk of Wachovia's businesses and taking on its $700 billion in assets. For a bank with its own difficulties, this might seem foolhardy.
So to grease the wheels, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has essentially given Citi an insurance policy against outsize losses on the $312 billion of Wachovia's mortgage-related and other assets regarded as dicey. The F.D.I.C. will be on the hook for the rest.
That's sort of what Mr. Paulson's plan was supposed to do. And as he proposed in the Tarp, the F.D.I.C. is getting a mix of preferred stock and warrants worth $12 billion that allows it to benefit from any increase in Citi's value, while also increasing the bank's capital ratios. Citi is also raising $10 billion from its own shareholders to finance the deal. The end result is a hybrid of risk-taking by the American taxpayer and Citi's shareholders.
Of course, Citi's chief, Vikram Pandit, might have struggled to sell the Wachovia deal to his board without the government's bailout plan on the horizon. But it would equally have been irresponsible for Citi -- or for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Mitsubishi UFJ, which invested respectively in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in the last week -- to have agreed a deal predicated on Congressional approval.
These deals -- along with JPMorgan's acquisition of Washington Mutual in another F.D.I.C.-brokered deal on Thursday -- show that willing buyers can be found for distressed institutions with the government mechanisms that are already available. The more the government helps, up front or through some sort of insurance, the less risible the price a savior will offer.
Whether or not Mr. Paulson's Tarp comes back to life, there will be more pain, particularly on Wall Street, but also on Main Street. As the credit spigot dries up further, it will be harder for companies to borrow and invest in their businesses, despite the Federal Reserve's separate efforts to flood the system with money. It will cost more for consumers to mortgage their homes or gear up their car purchases. But the additional pain of living without the Tarp could be beneficial in the long run, if it brings more reliance on sound market principles. ROB COX
