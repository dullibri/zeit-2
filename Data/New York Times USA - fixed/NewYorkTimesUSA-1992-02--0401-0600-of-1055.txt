HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Bush Steps Up Campaign as Buchanan Lays Out an Agenda

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Criticized by his opponent in the Republican primary for supposedly ignoring New Hampshire's economic problems, President Bush today sought to make his presence felt in the state through long-distance interviews on Manchester radio and television stations.
In telephone interviews from the White House on two morning radio programs, Mr. Bush promoted his economic and health-care plans.
He was also critical of proposals put forward by some Democrats, as well as by his Republican challenger, the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan, for broader tax reductions for the middle class. The President said the country "doesn't need these broad proposals to cut everybody's taxes at a time when we've got these enormous deficits." 
 Though he did not mention Mr. Buchanan by name, the President told reporters at WGIR-AM, a news-talk radio station, that "it would be nice not to have to be attacked from the right."
 
Send a Message
 Taking note of his challenger's call to "Send the President a message," Mr. Bush said the state's Republican voters ought to direct their anger toward Congress.
"But my view is, look, let's take a message and send it to the United States Congress to get something done; that's where the message should be sent," the President said.
 
Expanded Exposure
 With only eight days left before the primary here, the Bush campaign has stepped-up its efforts, making the President available for the radio interviews and a taped interview tonight with WMUR-TV, the state's largest television station. He said the endorsement two days ago of his re-election by former President Ronald Reagan would "resonate" with the state's voters. The President and his wife are expected to visit the state on Wednesday to address the state legislature.
"He must be nervous," deadpanned Mr. Buchanan, when asked about the President's interviews today.
For its part, the Buchanan campaign began several new television commercials today laying out what Mr. Buchanan would do if elected President and showing he had been moved by the suffering he has seen in the state.
In one, he ticks off a seven-point program that he says would revive the economy. Included in his menu of proposals are items like a freeze on Federal hiring and spending, cuts in foreign aid, term limits on members of Congress and a middle-class tax cut.
In another, he speaks of "women who break down as they talk of how their husbands have lost their jobs, how they can't meet the mortgage, how they're about to lose their homes."
"And until I came up and announced my candidacy, those people in Washington behaved as if they did not care," Mr. Buchanan says. "Well, I care."
The advertisement appears to be an attempt to soften Mr. Buchanan's image as a flinty conservative.
Aides to Mr. Buchanan said the commercials would replace those attacking the President for breaking his pledge not to raise taxes. The advertisements have blanketed the state and their constant repetition, by some accounts, has begun to irritate some voters.
Public opinion surveys taken over the last few days show the President with a commanding lead over Mr. Buchanan, though a recent poll by The Boston Globe indicates some erosion in support for Mr. Bush. In the telephone poll of 440 likely Republican voters conducted over the weekend, 51 percent of those surveyed said they favored the President, compared to 27 percent who said they would vote for Mr. Buchanan. A similar poll conducted by The Globe last month found Mr. Bush leading his rival by 58 percent to 28 percent.

HEADLINE: CPC Earnings Climb by 8.5%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J., Feb. 10

 BODY:
The food giant CPC International Inc. reported today that fourth-quarter net income rose 8.5 percent, to $110.1 million, or $1.43 a share, from 101.5 million, or $1.32 a share, in the comparable quarter in 1990. Sales increased 1.6 percent, to $1.55 billion.
For the full year of 1991, CPC reported an increase in earnings per share from continuing operations of 8.1 percent, to $5.22, compared with $4.83 in 1990. This excludes a special charge of 42 cents a share for environmental costs relating to discontinued non-food businesses, taken in the third quarter of 1991. 
 Including the environmental charge relating to discontinued operations, earnings per share for 1991 were $4.80, or six-tenths of 1 percent lower, and net income was $372.7 million, or three-tenths of 1 percent lower.
Worldwide sales for 1991 were $6.19 billion, 7.1 percent above their 1990 level of $5.78 billion. Higher volumes were chiefly responsible for the gain, the company said.
"The recessionary environment in the United States, as well as very difficult conditions in some countries of Latin America, continued to constrain our progress in the fourth quarter, as they did throughout the year," said C. R. Shoemate, chairman and chief executive officer.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Democrats' Hopes Fade As Front-Runner Slips

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Only a couple of weeks ago, senior people in the Democratic Party were telling each other that this time they would not waste their energies squabbling. This time they would choose a nominee early. Then they could unite, plot the strategy and raise the money needed to beat President Bush.
That soothing vision was fading fast today as the Iowa caucuses took place and the New Hampshire primary campaign entered its final week. 
 The people of this state are as proud of their predilection for surprising the experts as they are of their low-tax government. They have a habit of making up their minds who to support very late in the game, as they did with George S. McGovern in 1972 and then with George Bush four years ago.
This time, they seem determined to wait until the last minute once again. Of 58 Democratic voters questioned in this city in the southwestern part of the state over the last few days, only 18 said they had decided who to back, and of those 5 said they might still switch before voting on Feb. 18.
In that kind of situation, today's conventional wisdom can be tomorrow's misapprehension. But the professionals, at least, see Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas slipping, day by day. They see former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts gaining. They see the rest of the field still scrambling for a foothold. And it adds up, in their view, to trouble.
Their view is a pragmatic one, which is why the word "electability" buzzes through Democratic circles these days the way "momentum" used to. Many party leaders and many voters in New Hampshire have backed Mr. Clinton in large part because they thought that he, as a telegenic Southern moderate capable of articulating economic and social policies in sharp contrast to Mr. Bush's, would have the best chance of winning in November.
But in recent days that argument seems to have been working against Mr. Clinton. In the wake of charges of marital infidelity and manipulation of his draft status, both of which the Governor has denied, some voters here and many influential people in Washington seem to be edging away from him not so much because of his alleged transgressions but because they fear that the charges would make him a sitting duck for the Republicans later in the year if he can still win the nomination.
The New Hampshire electorate has it in its power either to confirm or overturn that view. A solid victory would quiet the talk; a narrow one might turn the volume down. But a loss, when a big victory had seemed so likely only two weeks ago, would be terribly damaging, even if Mr. Clinton could recover his balance in the South, his home base where many states hold primaries on March 10.
Only Mr. Tsongas, it is widely believed here, is in a position to defeat Mr. Clinton. If that happened, the party would be left with a wounded former front-runner, a victor who has done no organizing to speak of outside New England, and three also-rans whose reputations have not been enhanced very much by the New Hampshire campaign -- Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.
Not a happy prospect for the Democrats, especially with Mr. Bush apparently headed for a relatively comfortable win over Patrick J. Buchanan.
Mr. Clinton is expected to open a new television campaign in the next few days, intended to make voters think twice about how to beat Mr. Bush and improve their economic lot -- in other words, to persuade them once again, as he did earlier this year, that he is the only electable Democrat. His aides are talking about the primary as if it were Armageddon, considering attacks on Mr. Tsongas and preparing to deal more directly with the attacks on Mr. Clinton's own character if need be.
Mr. Tsongas has drawn the support of liberals like Dudley Dudley, a power in New Hampshire politics for decades, as well as those with fresh doubts about Mr. Clinton, though the former Senator from Massachusetts is no knee-jerk liberal. For example, he backs nuclear power, opposes tax cuts and favors only limited gun control.
Confident that the tide is running with their man, his strategists foresee a final week devoted to countering the notion that he cannot win by emphasizing how far he has come since his forlorn beginnings here.
In 1976, when the previously unknown Jimmy Carter won in both Iowa and New Hampshire, money and support in states where he had done little organizing rapidly flowed to him. But he had shown strength in two parts of the country not his own, the Midwest and Northeast, and the next stops on the political calendar were in the South.
Even if he wins next Tuesday, Mr. Tsongas will have won only at home.
Few pros believe that both Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey will do well enough here to raise the money to compete in other states, although both speak of fighting on to the convention. Both made biting comments about their rivals last week, and either might decide this week to turn to negative commercials in a last-ditch bid for survival.

HEADLINE: Global Plan To Rescue Species Set For Release

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Moving beyond a "Save The Panda approach," an international team plans to make public here on Tuesday a comprehensive strategy to protect the world's diversity of plant and animal species and to tap this diversity for human benefit.
The fruit of a three-year effort involving 500 advisers around the world, the "Global Biodiversity Strategy" addresses growing concern that the extinction of species will deprive future generations of new medicines and new strains of food crops. 
 With as many as 50 plant species disappearing each day, scientists calculate that the planet's biodiversity could be reduced by 10 percent by the year 2015.
"We have got to realize that next to the human mind, the earth's biological wealth is the greatest thing about this planet," said James Gustave Speth, president of World Resources Institute, a Washington organization that was one of the sponsors of the 244-page report.
 
A Guide for Policy Makers
 Sponsors hope the report's 85 recommendations will guide world environmental policy makers who are to meet next June in Rio de Janeiro for the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, a once-a-decade gathering.
Recommendations involve human actors ranging from the United Nations down to forest tribes.
On the international level, the report recommends the establishment of an early warning network to identify and protect ecosystems around the world that suddenly become threatened. The report calls on governments and multilateral development agencies to devote at least $1 billion a year to conserving endangered ecosystems.
On the national level, countries are being encouraged to assert control over their genetic resources and to exact royalties for their commercial uses.
In one pioneering effort, the recently formed National Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica has started to conduct an inventory of that Central American nation's plant and animal species. Merck Pharmaceutical has signed a contract to pay the institute 2 percent royalties on sales of any new medicines developed from the institute's samples.
One-fourth of all prescriptions now dispensed in the United States contain active ingredients from plants. The number of plant species used in traditional medicine is 2,000 in northwestern Amazonia, 2,500 in the area of the former Soviet Union and 5,100 in China.
To preserve and to promote such traditional knowledge, the Global Strategy recommends furthering recognition of local lore and local use of wild products.
Recognizing the development needs of third-world countries, the report steers away from sentimental appeals for conservation. Instead, it repeatedly underlines the economic value to genetic diversity.
"A wild tomato, found only in the Galapagos Islands, can grow in sea water and possesses jointless fruit stalks -- a trait that has been bred into domesticated tomatoes to make them easier to harvest mechanically," reads the report, which was also sponsored by the World Conservation Union of Switzerland and by the United Nations Environmental Program of Kenya.
Noting crop gains in the United States, the report said, "An estimated $1 billion annually has been added to the value of U.S. agricultural output by the widened genetic base."
In another example, wild species of rice give the world's rice crop its resistance to two of the four major rice diseases.
 
Threats to Gene Pool
 Threats to the world's gene pool come from headlong expansion of human activity. These threats include: unsustainably high rates of population growth, a narrowing spectrum of trade products from farms, fisheries and forests, ignorance of the value of threatened ecosystems, and legal systems and economic policies that promote development that is destructive to the environment.
Sponsors hope the report, which is to be issued in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, will influence thinking and action at the United Nations conference in Rio.
"The Global Diversity Strategy is an important contribution to the formulation of concrete measures to protect our natural heritage," Maurice F. Strong, Secretary General of the United Nations environmental conference, said of the new study. "The conservation of biodiversity is one of the key issues for the United Nations conference."

HEADLINE: The Talk of Hollywood;
Though a Year Old, Disney Memo Still Provokes Gossip

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 10

 BODY:
One year ago, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of the Walt Disney studios, wrote the memo that rocked Hollywood.
Not that Mr. Katzenberg said anything startling or even surprising. Far from it. But the 28-page document, which criticized the movie industry's "tidal wave of runaway costs and mindless competition" and chastised his own company for making the big budget, low-profit "Dick Tracy," served for months as a source of anger, resentment, debate and jokes within Hollywood. Mr. Katzenberg may have stated the obvious but -- like so much else in a world of fantasy, hype and vast wealth -- his comments stirred an outsize reaction. 
 And it's still going on.
Mr. Katzenberg, who doesn't often refrain from expressing his views, routinely declines to discuss the memo, largely because it set off such a storm. His supporters say that he was not only prescient about Hollywood but that he also seemed to anticipate the current wave of cost cutting that has seized most of the film studios as movie-theater audiences decline. But his critics say the studio chief winked and acquiesced in the leaking of the memo to the trade paper Variety to signal, less to Hollywood than to Wall Street, that the Disney Company would make cheaper movies after such critical and financial duds as "V. I. Warshawski," "Billy Bathgate," "The Marrying Man" and "Scenes From a Mall."
In his memo, Mr. Katzenberg singled out Disney's own "Dick Tracy," starring Warren Beatty and other stars. The movie grossed just over $100 million in the United States, but cost just about that to film and market. " 'Dick Tracy,' " he added, "made demands on our time, talent and treasury that upon reflection may not have been worth it."
In a comment that ruptured his relationship with Mr. Beatty, Mr. Katzenberg said "Bugsy," the actor's planned project with director Barry Levinson, was precisely the kind of risky movie Disney would not make, largely because of its $40 million cost.
Echoing the view of several other movie executives, Mike Medavoy, the chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, which produced "Hook" and "Bugsy," said in a recent interview: "There's nothing in that memo other than self-serving palaver. Everyone else is thinking about cutting back and cutting costs. What he was saying is, 'I'll never do "Dick Tracy" again.' That's ridiculous. To try to establish rules and say, 'I'll never make a movie over $12 million or $15 million or $20 million is ridiculous. It's just a silly statement."
But Robert A. Daly, the chairman of Warner Brothers, observed: "It was a good memo. It affected the way Disney did business, but I don't think it affected the industry itself because we all, more or less, came to the same conclusion. The reality is, you can't survive if costs were going up the way they were going up. Things had to change."
In some ways, Mr. Katzenberg has had the last laugh on his critics. His studio's flops last year left him vulnerable to attack in such magazines as New York and Vanity Fair, which cited his obsessive meddling in the writing, production and editing of his movies. But Mr. Katzenberg's luck has turned.
Disney has had the most successful start of any studio in 1992 after a tepid 1991. Its major successes include "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," a scare film released through its subsidiary Buena Vista about a nanny from hell, which cost $12 million and has so far grossed $51.4 million; "Beauty and the Beast," the sophisticated animated musical, which has so far grossed about $106.4 million, and "Father of the Bride," the remake of the M-G-M classic, which is a surprise hit at about $72.3 million. And this week, Disney's "Medicine Man," also released through Buena Vista, is No. 1 at the box office.
"Bugsy" has received dazzling critical reviews, but has so far grossed a somewhat disappointing $39.5 million. The film will probably eke out a profit if it fares well at the Academy Awards.
Several studio executives said that for all the attention it received in Hollywood, the Katzenberg memo had far less impact than the near-collapse of Carolco, the independent company that paid some of the highest prices in town for actors, writers and directors. The company produced the No. 1 film of 1991, "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," but many of its other films have failed, and Carolco has been riven with internal strife.
An example of Carolco's extravagance was the $15 million it paid Michael Douglas to appear in its newest film, "Basic Instinct," which was made before the company began to shrivel. In contrast, 20th Century Fox paid Mr. Douglas about $5.5 million for "Shining Through."
With Carolco laying off employees and in financial crisis, rival studio executives say, the huge prices that drove up costs across Hollywood have already begun to shrink. Disney and other studios have scaled back on the amounts spent on high-priced talent. Although a handful of stars -- including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts and Harrison Ford -- still receive enormous sums, other well-known actors have been forced to dramatically lower their $3 million to $5 million salaries because their presence alone in a movie is not enough to lure big audiences. They include Bill Murray, Richard Dreyfuss, John Candy, Jeff Bridges, Tom Hanks and Dennis Quaid.
After his appearance in the disastrous "Havana," Robert Redford agreed to a gross percentage deal -- and no fee -- to work on a caper film, "Sneakers." Other actors in the film, including Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix and Sidney Poitier, are also working for less money.
Two other stars, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, are believed to be receiving about $3 million each -- as opposed to their customary $5 million -- to star in a new Robert Zemeckis comedy, "Death Becomes Her," which is being produced by Universal. When Kevin Kline also sought $3 million for the picture, film executives said, he was promptly dropped in favor of Bruce Willis, who actively sought out the part and accepted a gross percentage deal favorable to the studio. Such deals and fee reductions for these actors would have been improbable last year.
Mr. Daly of Warner Brothers said: "In some cases we're telling people: 'This is what we're spending, and this is what we'll pay, and if you like it, fine, and if not, we'll get someone else. No hard feelings.' "
Senior executives, not only at Disney and Warner Brothers, but also at such studios as Universal, 20th Century Fox, Columbia and Tri-Star, said that in his memo Mr. Katzenberg had simply tapped early into a mood that seized Hollywood, only partly because of the recession.
"Look, the movie business slipped because bad movies were made," said Barry Diller, the chairman of Fox. "Jeffrey's memo was an internal memo to his people. But since then, every birdbrain in town has made comments about the recession, the economy, other entertainment alternatives. All these reasons were not as good as looking at ourselves in the mirror and saying we made turkey movies. Suddenly a few movies, hardly great, came out over Christmas and the audience came flooding back. You make good movies, people come."
But other executives and producers said the industry itself was in the grip of more turmoil and fear than it had faced for decades, largely because of high costs, declining audiences and the national economic torpor.
Steve Tisch, a producer, said: "The town is running on fear now: it's the currency of the business. Studios that once had 300 projects in development have now cut back to 120. The talent agencies are cutting back. Studios are saying to stars and directors and writers, 'Take it or leave it.' Jeffrey's memo is looked on as a kind of historical document. As if he were looking into the future like the Dead Sea Scrolls."
Another producer, Bob Rehme, who, with his partner, Mace Neufeld, is making "Patriot Games," based on the Tom Clancy thriller, with Harrison Ford, said: "There's enormous belt-tightening now. All over the industry you see layoffs, cutbacks, a serious attempt to control costs, more of a mix of low-budget with high-budget movies."
At the time the memo was leaked, Mr. Katzenberg's boss, Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of the Disney Company, was known to be furious about the content of the document and the hoopla that surrounded it. But now Mr. Eisner speaks of Mr. Katzenberg in glowing terms. Mr. Eisner said the "period of constriction" now engulfing the movie industry was anticipated in the memo.
"The fact that Jeffrey placed his thoughts on paper -- whether every sentence is appropriate or not -- forced him to come to grips with theproblem," Mr. Eisner said. "Then he did something about it. I loved that. Whether I would have changed a sentence here or there, yes. But the memo he wrote was a kind of map. An internal map that was followed. Jeffrey may not have acted in a popular way. He may not have been lauded in the circles of people trying to sell him product.
"But he acted in a way that we think is the absolute appropriate way. He's done a spectacular job."

HEADLINE: Review/Television;
Castro's Road of Economic Failures

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"The Last Communist" is an unsparing account of the rapid rise and long decline of Fidel Castro and his romantic revolution. The "Frontline" documentary, at 9 tonight on Channels 13 and 49, uses veteran Castro watchers like Tad Szulc and Georgie Anne Geyer and former Cuban and American officials to explore the qualities that made the dictator an enduring hero of his country and a faded favorite of left-wing intellectuals around the world.
An acquaintance tells of the young Castro's admiration for Mussolini -- not his Fascism but his emotion-stirring Latin style -- and newsreel clips capture resemblances of arm-flailing speechifying. Mr. Castro's great years came early, when he led the revolt that toppled Fulgencio Batista, the corrupt Cuban dictator who long enjoyed the support of Washington and accommodated American business interests like the United Fruit Company and the shady characters who ran the country's casinos and brothels. 
 In this plausible analysis, Mr. Castro's understandable anti-Americanism turned Cuba into a cold-war client of the Soviet Union and pushed the United States into such ill-conceived ventures as the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and assassination attempts. Mr. Castro used Washington's campaign against him to justify authoritarian rule at home and adventures abroad that made him a leader in the third world. (There he is, embracing the ever embraceable Yasir Arafat.) He blamed the American trade embargo, imposed after he nationalized American businesses, for most of Cuba's economic ills, to which the maximum leader himself is shown to have contributed generously.
Credit is given to Mr. Castro for significant improvements in literacy, medical care and housing. But, as reported here, his nutty schemes for the Cuban economy resulted in failure after failure. The stories of the destruction wreaked on the land by his determination to raise farm production by a far-fetched 15 percent a year, the investments that produced sour grapes, tasteless strawberries and a glut of sugar and the crossbreeding of cattle that gave neither milk nor meat might be funny if they did not mean sustained deprivation for the Cuban people. Former Castroites tell of the luxury goods and privileges available to the country's high-ups, while the masses are fed nine-hour speeches.
Even as sympathizers in the United States and Europe were paying celebrity visits to the island and returning with raves about Communism with a human face, Mr. Castro was cracking down on intellectual freedom and throwing what he called antisocial elements, like political opponents and homosexuals, into prison. "So what we're really talking about here is one single word," says Mr. Szulc, "which is control, control, control of everything everywhere."
The advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev sped the Cuban calamity. "Castro hates Gorbachev," says Ms. Geyer, who observes that the Cuban dictator is determined to be "the last Communist even though he never was a Communist." Mr. Szulc calls Mr. Castro, for whom he and other observers seem to retain residual affection, "the greatest victim of the end of the cold war." Today, he says, "he is zero as an international player." And with the former Soviet republics having troubles enough without worrying about subsidies for a distant client, the ordinary Cuban's life is harder than ever.
Tonight's PBS documentary and this Thursday night's fair-minded treatment of black American conservatives should appease the right-wingers in the Senate who are trying to hold back Federal money for public broadcasting on the ground that leftism is running rampant. More to the point, they are both illuminating programs.

HEADLINE: Not So Fast, Mr. Fernandez

 BODY:
Give the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph Fernandez, a B for Bravado. With Mayor David Dinkins's new budget proposal not even due until April, Mr. Fernandez made a pre-emptive strike, seeking about $50 million a year from the city and the Municipal Assistance Corporation. He would use the money for new and enhanced programs, including innovations like a longer school day and longer school year for some students.
Mr. Fernandez, as usual a forceful advocate for the schools, knows how to capture the imagination. And no New Yorker can object to his desire for more and better instruction. But recession-pressed City Hall must weigh the relative importance of education against many other worthy services, like keeping libraries open or providing better foster care and drug treatment. The Chancellor will have to justify his provocative ideas with a full-scale proposal and details on cost. 
 From what Mr. Fernandez has revealed so far, he wants more money for three purposes: to expand computer-assisted learning programs, to introduce reforms in special education that would save money in the long run, and to improve science and math instruction in the middle schools.
Students in enhanced math and science classes would go to school an additional hour four days a week, and attend a 25-day summer session. Of 250,000 middle school students, the number who would participate in the science and math programs depends on the money available, according to Deputy Chancellor Stanley Litow.
Mr. Fernandez said he'd like up to $250 million out of an expected $900 million -- $700 million from refinancing city bonds and $200 million from the M.A.C. But he has not spelled out how he would spend the funds.
The officials shaping the stringent budget have a responsibility to focus first on restoring or at least maintaining deteriorating services. They must make government more productive before considering bold initiatives. Mr. Fernandez needs to persuade the public that the schools are performing as well as they can with the time and resources already available before claiming additional resources.
If Mr. Fernandez's ideas would ultimately cut costs and add productivity, as he suggests, then they warrant serious consideration. But he bears the burden of demonstrating, in a detailed proposal complete with cost implications, that his interesting ideas will not put the city deeper in the hole.

HEADLINE: Side With Refugees, Not Thugs

 BODY:
Even now, knowing that the United States has slammed its doors on their outstretched fingers, desperate Haitians flee their homeland in rickety boats. With seeming similar desperation, the Bush Administration forces them onto Coast Guard cutters and drags them back home.
How are Americans to account for this cruelty? Surely not out of any misunderstanding of the facts. If there were any doubt, it has now been put to rest by interviewers for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. They tell of "double-backers" who fled a second time after being jailed, beaten and threatened with death after the U.S. forcibly returned them to Haiti last year. 
 Many Haitians, fearful of starvation, may nonetheless be economic refugees not entitled to sanctuary. Many others legitimately fear political persecution. In either case, the Haitian boat people are desperate about survival.
But there's no explaining the Administration's ugly desperation. In six months, Washington has moved from enlightened engagement with a radical but democratic government to shameful complicity with a murderous dictatorship.
U.S. law permits a more worthy response to today's Haitian refugee problem. It's called "temporary protected status" and it provides interim sanctuary until a short-term crisis is resolved. The President can grant it on his own. If he won't, Congress can enact it by statute. Either way, it needs to be activated fast.
As regional efforts to negotiate a return to democratic rule have foundered, the Bush Administration has seemed mesmerized by fear that an unending flow of poor black Haitian refugees would lose votes in Florida. That's strange, since polls indicate Floridians support compassionate treatment of Haitians and Florida's conservative Republican Senator, Connie Mack, has spoken out forcefully in the refugees' behalf.
Nevertheless, the Administration decided to insist harshly on forcible repatriation. State Department officials began describing Haitian conditions more positively, as if to mitigate the appearance of what diplomats call, evocatively, refoulement. There's little evidence to justify the rosy Administration view. Indeed, the U.N. reports about double-backers undermine that expedient optimism.
An extraordinarily high proportion of Haitian boat people have a well-founded fear of political retribution. Even under a technical reading of U.S. law, the Administration finds that nearly a third qualify for political asylum. Thousands of others have been turned back because they could not demonstrate that the thugs who lead the new military regime had targeted them personally for abuse. Many nevertheless face mortal danger.
In the long term, Haitian refugees are no more entitled to permanent admission than are desperate, destitute Africans, or Asians or survivors of Communism. Long term, the Administration is right to try discouraging purely economic migrants. But that imperative gives no excuse for short-term cruelty. Before forcing Haitians out of the frying pan, the Administration has a duty first to help put out the fire.

HEADLINE: An Overdue Correction for Real Estate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Tinkerer: Mr. Bush's New War, and Paper Sword," your Jan. 30 lead editorial, I believe you are inaccurate and misleading in your comments concerning the portions of President Bush's State of the Union Message that deal with real estate.
You state that "Mr. Bush proposes lavish tax breaks on real estate investors." You state furthermore that "the tax code already subsidizes real estate." 
 A casual, let alone a careful, reading of Mr. Bush's proposal makes it clear that, far from a lavish tax break, what Mr. Bush is proposing is a correction of a significant inequity that has existed since the enactment of the 1986 tax reform.
Mr. Bush is proposing to allow real estate developers and others who are active in the real estate business to offset losses from real estate activities against income from real estate activities.
This ability to offset gains and losses in one's business is available to every type of business other than real estate. This correction is more than five years overdue and can hardly be characterized as either lavish or a tax break.
It should be obvious to everyone that since 1986, real estate is no longer subsidized by the tax code and in fact represents an industry that is suffering disproportionately in the United States today.
This is particularly serious because so many economists now agree that it will require a healthy real estate industry to lead us out of our recession.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton Says He's Victim of G.O.P. 'Attack Machine'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton rolled back into New Hampshire today with a full-scale political attack: He presented himself as the victim of a "Republican attack machine," asserted that the relentless focus on his character was cheating the voters and promised to "fight like hell" in the last eight days of this primary campaign.
Mr. Clinton, who returned from a weekend in Arkansas to a suddenly tight Democratic race with former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, delivered his speech on a snowy hill in a suburban subdivision, and he sought the high ground in more ways than one. He tried to present himself as the candidate rewarded by the voters for his emphasis on "the real problems of real people," who had then paid a heavy price for his success. 
 "The Republican attack machine went into action," said Mr. Clinton, who was flanked by his wife, Hillary. "We know their game plan. They've run it against me for years in Arkansas. We've seen it in this country before. Define and destroy before people really get to know the candidate."
 
No New Evidence
 Mr. Clinton offered no new evidence at his news conference today that connected the national Republican Party to the recent series of stories that have buffeted his campaign: the accusations printed by a supermarket tabloid that he had a 12-year sexual affair with a cabaret singer or the suggestions in other publications that he had sought to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. Mr. Clinton has denied both accusations, but in the view of many political professionals here, they have taken a heavy toll.
Asked for evidence for Mr. Clinton's assertions, the campaign provided a collection of previous reports suggesting that Arkansas Republicans had encouraged rumors about infidelity and Mr. Clinton. Gary Koops, the spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said, "This is nonsense."
Throughout the furor of the past few weeks, the Clinton campaign has clearly hoped to capitalize on a backlash against the news media and its probing of candidates' personal lives. After a weekend when campaign advisers clearly realized that Mr. Clinton needed to escalate his counteroffensive, Mr. Clinton tried to broaden the debate, asserting that the tenor of the past few weeks represented a dangerous return to the negative politics of 1988, and that the voters would be the losers.
"There's just too much at stake this time around," Mr. Clinton said. "The past few weeks of this campaign have descended into a bizarre series of diversions that don't have anything to do with the hopes and dreams, crises and fears of the people of New Hampshire or this country."

New Spotlight on Tsongas
Special to The New York Times
MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 10 -- Mr. Tsongas is experiencing a sea change in his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
Polls released over the weekend showed him pulling even with Mr. Clinton. After weeks of being relatively neglected by the press, Mr. Tsongas, who was the first Democratic candidate to challenge Mr. Bush last April, today found himself the subject of much media attention. Mr. Tsongas was philosophical about this newfound visibility.
"This too will pass," he said as he sat in a car signing copies of his economic plan, "A Call to Arms," before his next appearance. "I didn't get depressed over the hard times and I'm not going to get euphoric over the good times."

HEADLINE: Digging for Ore Still Pays; Should Miners Pay, Too?

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARLIN, Nev.

 BODY:
Like the wizened old prospectors with a pick, a shovel and a dream, today's gold miners search for treasures in the public lands of the West. But they use explosives rather than picks, carve holes 600 feet into the earth and haul ore on trucks so huge the tires are 13 feet tall.
Using the latest technology, the Barrick Gold Strike Mine here in the foothills of the Tuscarora Mountains recovered about 500,000 ounces of gold last year. But like its pick-and-shovel forebears, Barrick did not pay a cent in Federal royalties on the $175 million worth of gold it took from public land.
 
An 1872 Law Endures
 While mining has changed substantially, the 1872 Mining Act has not. Under the law, which was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant to encourage settlement of the West, prospectors who stake a mineral claim are not required to pay for using the land or to pay royalties on the minerals it takes. 
 The Mining Act, which is headed for a showdown in Congress, has become the latest battleground in the debate over the best use of public lands in the West. Like earlier battles over grazing fees and logging rights, the mining issue tends to pit environmentalists against Westerners who work the land. And it raises the question of how much of the Old West culture and economy is appropriate for the New West.
Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, has called the Mining Act "a license to steal." He has sponsored a bill, which has been through subcommittee hearings, that would impose a 5 percent royalty on minerals. That would bring $200 million a year to the Federal treasury, based on Government estimates of $4 billion worth of minerals removed from Federal land every year.
The bill would set aside a third of the money for environmental cleanup of old mines and would establish stiffer standards for reclamation, the practice of returning mined land to its original condition. The measure would also grant broader discretion to officials in the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to reject unsuitable efforts to mine public lands. A similar bill, sponsored by Representative Nick J. Rahall 2d, Democrat of West Virginia, would not impose royalties.
The Mining Act has remained intact as politicians in Western states have joined forces with conservatives in other parts of the country to beat back efforts to change it. "But this year, we feel we have the best shot at completely rewriting this law that we've had in a long time," said Katherine Holmann, a lawyer with the Sierra Club, who says there is now enough support in Congress to pass the Bumpers bill.
The mining industry says that provisions in that bill would be crippling, resulting in a loss of 30,000 jobs in Western states. They say the proposal would simply spur mining companies to move to other countries with looser restrictions. State governments that rely heavily on local taxes on mining companies would see their treasuries dwindle; in Nevada alone, mining companies paid $78.6 million in state taxes in 1990. And rural economies in the West, the miners say, would become even more dependent on jobs in tourism, which rarely pay anywhere near the $15-an-hour wages that the average mine worker earns.
 
Growth in Elko
 The mining industry says the proposal would hurt communities like Elko, which is about an hour away from the Barrick mine. Because of the mine, Elko has grown to about 22,000 from 12,000 in the past six years and its main strip is lit with neon and dotted with bars, casinos and pawn shops.
This arid, desolate stretch of northeast Nevada is the ancient homeland of the Shoshone Indians, and many members of the tribe now work for the mine. Most of the mine workers live in Elko, where Barrick has subsidized the construction of more than 100 homes. The company, which has about 1,200 workers, contributes $3,000 toward the college or trade school education of each employee's child.
"Before the mines got going big, it was like a permanent recession around here," said Christine Curnow, who had been earning about $3 an hour as a waitress in an Elko coffee shop, and now earns $13 an hour working for Barrick.
 
Hard Hats and Explosives
 Wearing a hard hat and steel-toed boots, Ms. Curnow works on a survey crew that marks the spots in the pit bottom where holes are to be drilled and plugged with explosives.
After the daily 2 P.M. blasting here, the loosened dirt, rock and gold residue is scooped by huge, automated shovels into giant trucks that grind their way up from the depths of the pit bottom.
If they have any significant amount of gold,, the rocks are taken by the trucks to a processing mill, where they are ground to the fineness of talcum powder; rocks with a lower gold content are put on a "heap leaching" pile. The leaching process, a new method of using chemicals to soak the gold from the ore, has vastly increased the amount of gold that can be recovered, and Barrick has emerged as one of the most productive mines in North America.
The gold leaves here in bricks that are 85 percent pure, and goes to a refinery before making its way onto world markets, where it is now selling for about $350 an ounce.
 
20 Acres for $5
 Under the Mining Act, anyone who finds commercial minerals on public lands must establish a claim with the Federal Government to obtain mining rights. And if a mining company wishes, it can "patent" 20-acre tracts for $5 or less, transferring ownership to private hands. Up to now, some 3.2 million acres of public land, an area about the size of Connecticut, have been sold under this patenting process. In some cases, the law has allowed people to buy Federal land and make millions of dollars in profits by converting the property to ski resorts, golf courses and condominiums.
Mining officials denounce such abuses. But they contend that the Government could stop such scams, which have been well-publicized, without drastically changing the 1872 Act. They also say they would not oppose the payment of holding fees on public lands. But 5 percent royalties on the selling price of the gold, as called for in the Bumpers bill, would put many mines out of business, they contend.
"The mining industry doesn't have any philosophical problems with paying a royalty; they just can't afford it," said Steve Alfers, a Denver lawyer who worked on a study of the potential effects of proposed mining law changes. "They just don't have those margins. Look at the arithmetic. The average cost of producing an ounce of gold is $317. The finished price of gold is $350. With a 5 percent royalty, you're talking about 50 percent of that margin. It's just too high."
Oil and gas producers pay leasing fees of 12.5 percent. Coal producers pay an 8 percent royalty. But mining officials say the cost of mineral exploration is much higher. Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars in exploration before finding a rich lode, they say. The mineral mining endured hard times in the 1970s and 1980s, when employment fell nearly 30 percent. Experts on Western economy say another severe blow would be devastating.
And John Knebel, president of the American Mining Congress, argues that changes in the law "wouldn't just hurt mine workers in the West."
"If we have to cut projects, and stop buying machinery, then the guy on the line at the Caterpillar plant in Illinois, where they make the tractors, he goes out of a job," Mr. Knebel said.
 
Environmental Costs
 Critics of the 1872 Mining Act say they finally have an unbeatable alliance: environmentalists and fiscal conservatives. Both argue that taxpayers are being saddled with huge costs to clean up abandoned mines. The U.S. Bureau of Mines has estimated that 10,000 miles of rivers have been poisoned by mine wastes. Acid from metal residue continues to seep from old pits into streams and rivers.
"The environmental costs of cleaning up these mines is running at $880 million a year," said Phil Hocker, head of the Minerals Policy Center, a mining policy research group with an environmentalist perspective. "Until we get this law fixed, the taxpayer is going to bear those costs."
In many cases, environmentalists say even huge amounts of money cannot correct problems caused by mining. They now fear efforts to open a large mine just two miles from Yellowstone National Park. Canada's Noranda Minerals Corporation plans to mine gold, silver and copper near the tiny tourist town of Cooke City, Mont.
The project would employ 140 people in an area that, supporters say, sorely needs the jobs. But environmentalists say the acid drainage from the project could flow into the park through Soda Butte Creek, and ultimately threaten the survival of the endangered Yellowstone Cutthroat fish.
"It's all the worst elements conceivable," said Louisa Wilcox, a spokesman for the Greater Yellowstone Coaliton, an environmental group. "It's near the park. It's in grizzly bear habitat. It's going to be a major pollution source forever because of the acid mine drainage."
But the mining industry has accused its critics of dishonestly blurring the line between past and present. They concede that ecological concerns were sometimes cast aside in the past. But nowadays, they say, mining must conform to strict standards imposed by a host of state and Federal environmental laws like the Clean Water Act.
Barrick is bonded for more than $20 million to pay for reclamation in case the company went defunct, said John McDonough, the general manager of the mine here. Until now, the Barrick mine has not patented the public land it uses, saying that the bureaucratic hassles involved in securing a patent would outweigh the benefits. But as Congress considers changing the Mining Act, the company said it was considering applying for such a patent.
As for changes in the old law, "Mining people are pretty nervous about these proposals, which are pretty draconian," said Pat Garver, a lawyer for Barrick. "Some companies will move to foreign markets, like Mexico, where there are almost no environmental restrictions."
That might be bad news for Ms. Curnow, who is 29 and has three children. "My husband works at the mine, and so does my mom and my brother," she said. "It's given us a good, solid middle-class life."

HEADLINE: Rights Leader Urges Blacks Not to Buy Japanese Autos

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The head of the N.A.A.C.P. urged blacks today not to buy Japanese cars because he said Japanese auto makers were reluctant to establish dealerships owned by blacks and unwilling to build plants in inner cities.
"This is not Japanese bashing, said Benjamin Hooks, the group's executive director. "We don't hate anybody. But we want to take care of our own." 
 Mr. Hooks made the statement during the 83d anniversary celebration of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He added that blacks had a big stake in the survival of the United States Big Three auto makers, which have treated them far better than their Japanese counterparts.
More than 140,000 black Americans are employed by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, in the plants where the cars are made and in the corporate offices, Mr. Hooks said.
 
Disappointment From Talks
 "I just resent people saying that we don't make a good product," he said. There were 259 dealerships owned by members of minorities among those of American auto companies last year, as against 11 dealerships among those of the Japanese companies, he said.
Mr. Hooks also said that recent talks between his group and Japanese officials have been disappointing. He said the idea his organization was getting was that the Japanese would not go out of their way to promote blacks or build plants in inner-city areas.
Bob Butorac, a spokesman for American Honda Motor Company in Torrance, Calif., said the Japanese car manufacturer had made progress in hiring and promoting members of minorities and would continue to do more. He said about 3.7 percent of Honda's dealers were members of minorities.
Edd Snyder, a black who owns who is black and is the owner of Mid-State Toyota in Delaware, Ohio, said Toyota had treated him very well when he wanted to becaome a dealer. He added that that Mr. Hooks's statement was simplistic. "I operate in a worldwide economic community," he said adding that he had cars on his lot built in Kentucky.

New Hampshire Voters Taking the High Road

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 11

 BODY:
Voters have kept telling pollsters that they care about substantive issues, not tabloid sex stories. But the experts have been skeptical, because people often give falsely virtuous answers on delicate subjects.
This "social-desirability effect," as pollsters call it, prompts people in surveys to hide their racial animosities, exaggerate how regularly they vote, and underreport their interest in pornography. From what people tell interviewers, you might conclude that one peculiar recluse somewhere is buying all 1.6 million copies of Penthouse magazine every month. 
 But some new data here suggest that New Hampshire voters might be telling the truth after all. Contrary to the expectations of some social scientists, politicians, journalists and tabloid distributors, the public has shown more interest in obtaining Gov. Bill Clinton's "Plan for America's Future" than in buying Gennifer Flowers's account of "My 12-Year Affair with Bill Clinton."
The distributors of the tabloid Star, who braced for sell-outs at the supermarket after the extraordinary publicity for Ms. Flowers' cover story, report only a small increase in sales across New Hampshire. People's failure to buy the tabloid, of course, doesn't necessarily mean that they're indifferent to the accusations. They may be disgusted and decide to shun both the tabloid and Mr. Clinton, or they might have satisfied their curiosity through news reports about the accusations.
 
Surprisingly Small
 But the modest increase in sales does seem surprising, especially considering how many journalists and campaign professionals were here to boost sales. In Manchester, the only outlets in need of extra copies were at the airport and in a downtown hotel filled with journalists.
The number of extra purchasers of Star, whose cover headlines promised "Mistress Tells All" and "The Secret Love Tapes That Prove It!" was much smaller than the number of people who called Mr. Clinton's headquarters asking for a copy of his plan, whose cover promised to "restore our economic leadership."
Moreover, -- and this may be the most startling tribute of all to voters' high-mindedness -- it appears that people here were more likely to borrow Mr. Clinton's 44-page plan from their local library than to buy Star for Ms. Flowers' story.
James R. Beniger, an expert in public-opinion research, was intrigued by Star's sales. Dr. Beniger, a sociologist at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California, said the sales seemed to provide a rare bit of hard evidence comparing people's actions with their words -- and possibly an even rarer demonstration of their honesty on a subject like this.
 
Sick of Sex Scandals?
 "The received wisdom may be wrong about the voters this election," Dr. Beniger said. "We didn't want to believe the polls when people said they were interested just in the issues, because we assumed that they wouldn't want to tell a stranger that they're actually interested in cheap tabloid stories about sex. But if there's independent evidence that they didn't buy the tabloid, then maybe they really are sick of sex scandals. Or maybe economic conditions have made those scandals seem unimportant."
The editor of Star, Richard Kaplan, who was perhaps unmindful of his tabloid's uplifting contribution to social science, declined to discuss sales figures for the issue. But a picture emerged from interviews with the five companies that distribute nearly all Star copies sold in the state. Their combined reports indicate Star's sales were about 13 percent above normal for the Feb. 4th issue, which featured Ms. Flowers on the cover.
It is impossible to say exactly how many extra copies of the 95-cent issue were sold in New Hampshire, because some of the companies' figures include sales in border regions of neighboring states, but the distributors said that the figure for New Hampshire was well under 3,000. By comparison, the Clinton campaign reports that more than 7,000 people called to get a free copy of Mr. Clinton's plan, which was advertised on television and distributed to libraries.
Sales of Star were relatively high in Manchester, where most journalists and campaign staffs are based, but even here the increase amounted to only 20 percent above normal, or 500 extra copies. Betty Carr, a librarian at the Manchester City Library, estimated that 600 people have come in and checked out Mr. Clinton's plan.
The state's magazine distributors had expected great sales after all the free publicity on front pages, "60 Minutes," and network and local news.
"I was expecting anguished calls from sold-out stores," said Sam Winebaum, the executive vice president of Winebaum News in Portsmouth, "because with a hot magazine you can double your normal sales. But nothing happened. People didn't care about the Clinton story. In a way I'm pleased with the people of New Hampshire, because they went against the grain. Maybe it shows the seriousness of the political process here."
Dr. Beniger noted that there were a couple of other possible explanations for the sales figures. It could be argued, for instance, that people didn't need to buy the tabloid after hearing so much about it on the news. But the tabloid did offer color pictures and additional details, and the magazine distributors said that publicity usually only spurred sales.
It could also be argued that many voters actually did go out and buy the issue at the same time that the tabloid's regular readers deserted it because the cover featured a politician instead of a Hollywood celebrity. But covers about television stars traditionally sell well, and nobody is a bigger television star here these days than Mr. Clinton, whose commercials are on all day long.
Dr. Beniger was inclined to conclude that voters really don't care about Ms. Flowers. "My sense is that the press embarrassed itself by trying to lead a parade that nobody was following," he said. He noted that Mr. Clinton's standing with the voters was not greatly affected during the week following Ms. Flowers's revelations.
Mr. Clinton's standing in the polls did decline after a second character issue arose last week, the question of how he got a draft deferment in 1969. This might mean that voters care more about military records than marital fidelity. But some voters say that they are deserting Mr. Clinton not because they necessarily believe the charges but merely because of the continuing negative press coverage makes him less "electable."
All of which could logically lead to this conclusion, if you can follow it: Although people here personally don't care about all these personal allegations, as long as the press keeps reporting that they care, they will worry that other people care about the allegations, and so therefore they themselves will eventually start caring about the allegations. Democracy marches on.

HEADLINE: INDIA IS PRESSED ON ATOM PROJECT

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Strategically adrift after the collapse of the Soviet Union and in need of economic and technical assistance from industrial powers, India is coming under increasing international pressure to place its nuclear program under comprehensive safeguards.
An announcement by officials in Norway last week that they had finally obtained documentary evidence of secret Indian purchases of Norwegian heavy water from Romania in 1986 is expected to touch off new interest in India's nuclear program, which is now assumed by arms experts to have a large military component despite New Delhi's assurances to the contrary. 
 Norway's Foreign Minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg, said in Oslo last week that it would be "legitimate" to re-examine aid to a developing country when that country is spending its money on a questionable nuclear program. Japanese officials have given New Delhi similar warnings. Indian publications say Russia has also told India to rethink its opposition to arms control.
 
An Area of Danger
 India's reluctance to sign the 1968 treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons has given neighboring Pakistan a longstanding excuse to refuse also, making South Asia the last major area where there is no prospect for progress in nuclear arms control.
Pakistan, which is now under an American aid embargo because of its nuclear program, acknowledged last week for the first time that it is capable of producing bombs. India set off a nuclear explosion in 1974 and is thought by arms experts to have produced enough plutonium in unsafeguarded reactors for 100 to 200 weapons.
Both India's nuclear program and concern over human-rights violations in India, are likely to be raised in Congress this year. They are already being discussed in British and European Parliamentary committees. India's hopes for aid and investment could be affected, European diplomats say.
Stephen Philip Cohen, co-director of the University of Illinois program in arms control and international security, and a former member of the State Department's policy planning staff, advocates linking India's request for a permanent seat on an expanded United Nations Security Council with greater cooperation on nuclear controls.
 
Regional Talks Sought
 Since last June, Pakistan and the United States have been trying to manuever India into agreeing to regional talks on nuclear weapons. When Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, with American backing, first proposed a five-nation conference involving his own country, India, China and what was then the Soviet Union, India rejected the idea with scorn. But second thoughts followed, as prominent Indians began to ask if an uncooperative attitude at this juncture might not be damaging to Indian interests.
"At least they are listening now," a senior Bush Administration offficial said recently, acknowledging that India's new isolation in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Union was beginning to be felt in New Delhi.
Another Administration official said the strongest argument for pressing India now was that New Delhi was out of line in an age of "competitive disarmament," when former Soviet republics were abandoning arsenals and nations like North Korea and Argentina were signing inspection agreements. China also says it will sign the accord on the spread of nuclear arms.
"We have the best chance we've ever had to move the Indians, and moving the Indians is indispensible to progress on proliferation," said Gary Milhollin, a University of Wisconsin law professor and director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.
 
Diversion Through Romania
 It took more than five years of investigations, and the collapse of the Ceausescu Government in Romania, for Norway to find what it considers indisputable evidence that Romania diverted to India about 14 tons of heavy water, a spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry said Monday.
"For the first time we have solid proof -- real evidence -- because we have been allowed to investigate directly in Romania in the Ceausescu archives with the help of the Romanian police," Bjorn Blokhus, the spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Oslo. "The findings are quite impressive. The documents show that the destination was India, and the address to which the shipment was sent."
Last week, Norway confronted the Indians with its new evidence, Mr. Blokhus said.
"We sent them the material and asked for comments from them," he said. On Friday, India at first said it had never received shipments of Norwegian heavy water, but later agreed to examine the Norwegian documents.
The 1986 shipment was the second the Norwegians say was sent to India in defiance of Norwegian agreements. The first, diverted through a German company in 1983, involved about 17 tons of heavy water.
Experts say that the two shipments diverted from Norway were only part of the substantial tonnage of heavy water India bought "under the table" in the 1980's, much of it from China and the Soviet Union. Moscow also openly sold safeguarded heavy water to India, which apparently went to reactors that are open to inspection.
"India had made well over a ton of unsafeguarded plutonium by 1990," Mr. Milhollin said in an interview Monday.

OLD QUERIES GREET TSONGAS ON CLIMB

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 11

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas barely had time today to savor his surprise front-runner status before facing a round of renewed questioning about his health, his political strength outside New Hampshire and his ultimate ability to be elected.
At a news conference here, where a group of women endorsed him because of his support for the right to choose an abortion, the former Senator from Massachusetts joked about the sudden increase in his press coverage and about his climb in the polls. 
 "I'm not used to this situation," he said at the Y.W.C.A., where journalists outnumbered the women making the endorsement. "But I like what I have."
There was laughter all around, but the ensuing dialogue underscored the political reality that when candidates move out in front of the pack they face a renewed need to deal with questions they have already answered.
He was asked, for instance, what made him different from the other Democrats and from President Bush?
 
'Fundamentally 'Pro-Business'
 Mr. Tsongas said he was different because "my economic issues are fundamentally pro-business." He noted he was in favor of a capital gains tax but not in favor of a tax cut for the middle class. "I'm not trying to play Santa Claus," Mr. Tsongas said, repeating what has become one of his more popular lines. "You don't build the economy with a tax cut."
He was asked whether his health was still fragile after his successful fight against cancer eight years ago, whether it was the reason he had scheduled so few public events each day.
No, he replied, he just liked to swim and have lunch with friends out of the spotlight of television cameras. His health is fine, he said, except that as a result of his treatment for cancer he has lost hearing in his left ear.
Did some of his work for corporate clients in the last eight years as a member of a law firm constitute lobbying?
He said he represented a number of business clients as well as the Sierra Club and the Humane Society of the United States.
Mr. Tsongas answered every question with self-deprecation and patient, plainspoken answers.
"The only poll that counts is what happens Election Day," he said. "The worst thing that can happen to a candidate is to become obsessed with polls."
"I would have been for 10 months in the fetal position," he said, speaking of his early popularity showings.
 
Cautious About Polls
 The latest Boston Globe and CNN-USA Today Gallup polls show Mr. Tsongas ahead of his rivals, but he appeared cautious about his new status. He said that in previous campaigns where he had been the underdog he had always thought a time would come when he would pull ahead, as he has now done. He said he had begun to doubt that until recently.
Mr. Tsongas, who recently borrowed $45,000 from his daughters' college fund to finance his campaign, said that in financial and organizational strength Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was the front-runner in the Democratic race.
"Bill Clinton has raised three times as much money as I have," he said, and "gotten endorsements from governors, senators, congressmen."
Asked how he planned to get through the Southern primaries on March 10, Mr. Tsongas said he could offer no detailed strategy beyond an intent to "just be the last man standing." He said he would campaign in the South.
He said his message that the country must pull itself up by its economic bootstraps would do well in states where manufacturing jobs have dwindled and added."My strength will be in states that have an industrial base."
 
A Clinton Friendship
 Mr. Tsongas refused to join in criticism of his rivals, saying he and Mr. Clinton had become friends and that the Governor's record, which other candidates have criticized, was something Mr. Clinton could be proud of.
Mr. Tsongas was repeatedly asked whether his battle with cancer had left him more susceptible to illness and whether it was responsible for his cough. He said the cough came from talking for long periods.
"Bill Clinton has the same throat problems I do," he said. "And, as you know, he canceled appearances because he was sick. He can do that and there is never a question because there is no reason to question it. I cannot do that. I cannot do that because there is always this lingering doubt."
Mr. Tsongas predicted that his health would be a continuing area of inquiry. He said he had made his doctor available to answer any questions about his health.
Mr. Tsongas said he was increasing his swimming to show he is healthy and would be competing in two national swimming tournaments this year.
He said that he swam the breaststroke on his college swimming team but that during this campaign year he would be doing the difficult and highly aerobic butterfly stroke to show his endurance.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Bush Ready to Step Up His Attacks on Buchanan

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
In a sign of lingering concern over Patrick J. Buchanan's Presidential challenge, President Bush's announcement of his candidacy on Wednesday will kick off a sharply accelerated New Hampshire campaign in which the Bush camp has added events and laid plans for an attack on Mr. Buchanan if it proves necessary.
Initially hoping to reduce the importance of Mr. Buchanan by ignoring him, the Bush organization had planned to keep the President's visits to the state to a minimum and to rely primarily on surrogate campaigners, like his wife, Barbara, as well as television advertisements and interviews conducted by satellite from the Oval Office. 
 But opinion polls showing that Mr. Bush enjoyed a surge in popularity after his last visit on Jan. 15, and then slumped again during his absence of more than three weeks, prompted the campaign to expand Mr. Bush's personal schedule in New Hampshire.
 
Bush Weekend Anticipated
 The President will spend the entire weekend there before Tuesday's vote, instead of the one-day trip on Saturday that was scheduled. Mr. Bush will announce his candidacy to about 1,000 supporters at a Washington hotel and an appearance before the New Hampshire Legislature on Wednesday.
As Mr. Bush prepared for his visit to New Hampshire on Wednesday, his efforts were complicated by a new series of television advertisements by Mr. Buchanan, a conservative columnist, that strike Mr. Bush on the same weak flank that the Democrats have made a target, painting him as indifferent to everday concerns.
"Until I came up and announced my candidacy, those people in Washington behaved as if they did not care," Mr. Buchanan says in a new television commercial. He adds: "Those who did this to you have forgotten you and walked away from you. Together, you and I can take America back and make her great again."
Even if Mr. Buchanan is not a serious threat to Mr. Bush's re-election, as the Bush campaign believes, his new attack on the President highlights the way his challenge vexes Republican strategists: it only serves to reinforce the Democrats' arguments.
 
Hoping to Inflict a Wound
 Instead, the Bush campaign has been forced to confront Mr. Buchanan, developing a strategy that Bush aides described as an effort to wound Mr. Buchanan as much as possible in New Hampshire and then to eliminate him entirely in the next big day of contests, on March 3, in the Georgia and Maryland primaries.
Bush aides hope to be rid of Mr. Buchanan well before the June 2 primary in California. They believe a contest could complicate Mr. Bush's position in the nation's most populous state, which Republicans fear the President could lose in the general election.
Appearing before the New Hampshire Legislature today, Mr. Buchanan delivered the sort of tough, protectionist message that the Bush campaign hopes will prove unappealing to voters.
"I don't want, and no American wants, a trade war," Mr. Buchanan said. "But we Americans have got to stop being trade wimps."
With Mr. Bush publicly saying he wants to avoid a negative campaign, the Bush camp hopes to avoid having to attack Mr. Buchanan directly in New Hampshire. "I really would like to get through this primary without going after another Republican," Mr. Bush said in an interview on Monday with WBZ-TV news of Boston.
 
From the Oval Office?
 But the campaign has prepared outlines for ads attacking the challenger if they are needed in the final weekend, the period when Mr. Bush went on the offensive against Senator Bob Dole of Kansas when it appeared that Mr. Dole might win the 1988 primary. The Bush team also has collected quotations from Mr. Buchanan's prolific writings that could be used to paint him as anti-Semitic, anti-feminist and isolationist.
There will be at least one more Bush advertisement on New Hampshire airwaves by the weekend, which a senior campaign aide described as a "last-minute appeal for votes from the President, delivered from the Oval Office or some other spot in the White House."
But beyond that, the campaign plans to focus on more small-scale, personal events in which Mr. Bush will mingle with voters as much as his security cordon will permit.
Responding to New Hampshire supporters who complained that Mr. Bush did too many set-piece events, the campaign added two stops in shopping malls in Nashua and Bedford to Wednesday's schedule.
The purpose of these efforts is to get Mr. Bush past the stage at which he is apologizing for the state of the economy and promising that he cares and on to a new phase in which he can talk of his own vision.
 
'An Amazing Country'
 "The long-term theme is going to be that this is an amazing country," said Victoria Clarke, Mr. Bush's campaign press secretary. "We have done remarkable things, we have changed the world, and we have to take all that talent and all that energy and all those resources and change America."
Mr. Bush's efforts at long-distance campaigning in New Hampshire have been intensive. On Monday, his voice filled the airwaves and newspaper pages of New Hamsphire and Massachusetts with several "exclusive" interviews for local television and newspaper reporters.
Surrogates like Mrs. Bush, who will follow her own schedule during her husband's visits this week, also have kept the President's campaign going.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Old Tactics Failing, a Handful of Lawmakers Hustle to Block Pentagon Cuts

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The military threat from what was once the Soviet Union has all but vanished. The Pentagon has grudgingly pointed its spending plans downward. Opinion polls show strong popular support for diverting military dollars to domestic programs. The question now is whether Congress will accept the change.
Or more precisely, whether a handful of lawmakers, following a familiar political script, can block proposed cuts in the Pentagon budget favored by most of their colleagues to protect particular districts and states from threatened economic losses. 
 The outcome will not be clear until final bargaining over the Pentagon budget is completed in the fall. But there are already several signs that some lawmakers hope to restore money for weapons made in their districts -- and that they face a harder sell than in past years.
Representative Pete Geren is mustering labor unions and civic groups to save the F-16 fighter jet program that employs 16,000 General Dynamics workers in his district in Fort Worth, Tex.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, is enlisting support from influential colleagues who control the military's checkbook to spare the cancelled Seawolf submarine, assembled by Electric Boat in Groton, Conn.
Representative Thomas J. Downey is rallying the powerful Long Island Congressional delegation to salvage financing for the Grumman Corporation's F-14 fighter plane that the Navy has stopped.
But there are early indications that some of the old strategies might not work this year. Lawmakers say their lobbying tactics are not budging colleagues who are eager to cash in on the Soviet Union's demise.
"No, it can't be business as usual," said Mr. Downey, a veteran of several successful fights to win financing for Grumman, Long Island's largest private employer, with a large plant in Bethpage. "Where in the past members were sympathetic to you, now defense dollars stand in way of highway improvements or education."
So lawmakers have taken a different tack, pushing their interests by wrapping them in the broader mantle of national security priorities like preserving "industrial base," the factories that build certain crucial weapons, or equations that say it is cheaper to keep building a weapon than to pay contractors cancellation fees. In some cases that is true.
At a recent hearing, for example, Senator Dodd said the Pentagon's plan would close America's "only yard capable of producing a ballistic-missile submarine capability." Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney acknowledges that and has expressed concern over the nation's ability to manufacture nuclear submarines.
Many of those strategies are not new and some reflect genuine concerns. But rarely have they been used with such zeal. In an election year in the middle of a recession, a lawmaker's ability to save jobs could spell the margin of victory or defeat at the polls.
 
Cuts and the Jobless
Recognizing that, lawmakers are more willing to compromise than they have been in the past. Mr. Dodd, for example, has written off hopes to regain the submarine-a-year building pace the Navy had planned for the Seawolf.
The Connnecticut and Rhode Island delegations are just trying to recoup financing for two of the $2-billion submarines on order that Mr. Cheney rescinded. The Pentagon plans to buy only one Seawolf.
Ultimately, the something-is-better-than-nothing approach could work. Congress will almost certainly make additional cuts beyond the $10 billion reduction the Bush Administration proposed in its $281 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
Some cuts could come from slightly deeper troop cuts or by cancelling the four B-2's the Pentagon wants to buy in the fiscal 1993 budget. But few on Capitol Hill want to cut deep enough to lengthen the unemployment lines in an election year.
"With the economy is such bad shape, Congress is more inclined to slow down the pace of defense reductions and try to save some of these jobs, at least in short term," said Bernard L. Weinstein, an economist at the University of North Texas.
 
Formula for Arms Cuts
 In recent years, lawmakers had relied on a proven formula to restore weapons that the Pentagon said it did not want or need.
First, line up support with a member on one of the four key Senate and House committees dealing with the military. Better yet, enlist Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin or Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, who head the armed services committees. Or Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania or Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, chairmen of the lesser known but equally powerful military appropriations subcommittees, which actually disburse funds.
Second, organize letter-writing campaigns by workers and civic groups aimed at influential lawmakers and the Administration.
It's a political game that the Pentagon complains about but plays regularly.
 
Past Bargaining Chip
 "The Pentagon says zero and Congress puts it back; it's been a bargaining chip in the past," Representative Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat, said of new engines that a Boeing plant in his district installs on KC-135 fuel-tanker planes.
The old strategies have worked in the past. Mr. Downey, who helped Mr. Aspin regain the committee chairmanship a few years ago, capitalized on their close relationship to have F-14 funds restored.
The Osprey, an aircraft that takes off and lands like a helicopter and flies like a plane, has survived several Pentagon cuts thanks to the powerful delegations from Texas and Pennsylvania, where the aircraft is built.
On the other hand, the B-2, or Stealth, bomber has been cancelled despite having subcontractors in nearly all 50 states.
"Basically, the smaller and less visible the program, the easier it is for a lobbying effort to work," said John Isaacs, legislative director for the Council for a Livable World, an arms control lobbying organization here.
So what about some of the Pentagon's cuts in the proposed 1993 budget?
General Dynamics has already slashed its Fort Worth work force to 21,000, from 31,000 two years ago, and economists say thousands more will lose their jobs if the Air Force stops buying F-16's after next year, as planned.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
Cuomo Backers Plan Late TV Drive

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 11

 BODY:
With as many as half the potential voters in the Democratic Presidential primary here describing themselves as undecided, supporters of Mario M. Cuomo said today that they would launch a sizable television campaign on Thursday following a speech by the New York Governor on economic issues at Harvard University on Wednesday.
Mr. Cuomo's long-scheduled speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government has attracted widespread attention because of the unsettled political situation here and the write-in campaign being waged on his behalf. 
 "I'm not running for President," Governor Cuomo said again this week in Buffalo. But in an allusion to the growing write-in effort, he added: "I wouldn't presume to interfere with the good people of New Hampshire. Who am I to tell the people of New Hampshire, 'You shouldn't do that'?"
In Washington and elsewhere in the country, Democratic elders continue to talk about a late entry by Mr. Cuomo or some other candidate, although the impediments to such an action -- early filing deadlines, lack of time to raise money and so on -- are acknowledged by everyone to be formidable.
 
What Boston's Mayor Wants
 Mayor Raymond Flynn of Boston said on Sunday that he hoped the Governor would decide to run, despite his announcement on Dec. 20 that he would not seek the Democratic nomination because of state budget problems.
Elated by Mr. Cuomo's refusal to disavow the write-in effort, Philip Krone, the Chicago real estate and public relations consultant who started the national Draft Cuomo for President Committee, said that television commercials would start running today, on WMUR, New Hampshire's most important television station, and continue for the next five days. The committee also plans radio and newspaper advertisements in the days leading up to the voting here on Feb. 18.
Tom Bonnar, an official of the station, said said the Cuomo campaign has contracted to have commercials on several times a day, in what he described as "a very significant buy."
 
A 'Common Sense' Platform?
 According to those involved in preparing the commercials, they show someone writing in Mr. Cuomo's name and give instructions on how to do it. The Governor is described as "the candidate of common sense" -- an attempt to capitalize on voter dissatisfaction with the quality of the field.
Mr. Krone's goal has been to get at least 15 percent of the total vote, which under the party rules would entitle Mr. Cuomo to some of New Hampshire's delegates to the Democratic National Convention. If the turnout totals 130,000 to 135,000, as predicted by experts, Mr. Cuomo would need at least 20,000 votes next Tuesday.
In polling by The Boston Globe on Sunday and Monday evenings, for which voters were not told of the write-in campaign, 6 percent of the respondents volunteered their intention to vote for Mr. Cuomo, up from 2 percent late last week. American Research Group, a New Hampshire polling concern, puts Mr. Cuomo's current total at 8 percent, using a slightly different question.
"The Cuomo people have the potential to get 20 percent," said Dick Bennett, the president of American Research Group, which is working for none of the candidates. "He could be a viable alternative for an awful lot of people going in to the ballot box full of doubts and indecision. Their campaign is a lot more sophisticated than a lot of what's going on here."
The five active Democratic candidates have begun to take notice of Mr. Cuomo's potential as a spoiler in the hard-fought contest, though some specialists consider the mechanical complexity of write-ins an impediment.
One of the leaders, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, acknowledged at a news conference today that at one stage he had favored the entry of Mr. Cuomo, with whom he agrees on many economic questions. Asked whather he would still welcome a candidacy by the New Yorker, he replied, "Hell, no."
The Cuomo campaign, which is run by Mr. Krone and Don Rose, a Chicago political consultant, has raised about $90,000 so far, including $19,000 on Monday, the best day to date, officials said. Mr. Krone said his major concern was persuading voters who had developed doubts about Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the early front-runner, that Mr. Cuomo could beat President Bush and that Mr. Tsongas could not.

HEADLINE: A Texas-Size Battle to Teach Rich and Poor Alike

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
The scenario has become annoyingly repetitive: The Texas Legislature devises a school financing plan that tries to close the spending gap between rich school districts and poor ones, only to have the State Supreme Court declare the plan unconstitutional.
It happened again last month, for the third time in three years, in a battle that reflects not only the politics of one state but also the difficulty in overhauling school finances. 
 Like Texas, 22 other states are in court over the way they finance public schools. And like Texas, 12 of them have seen financing plans reopened by new lawsuits, which contend that the original plans do not equalize the spending on pupils in poor school districts with those in rich districts. But unlike any other state, Texas has been forced to go back to the drawing board a fourth time.
"Texas certainly is not the norm, but it's also not unique," said David Hornbeck, a former Maryland Education Commissioner who is now a school consultant to several states. "Texas has had more plans that have been overturned."
 
State Provided Formula
 The latest Texas plan declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court was a so-called Robin Hood approach to school aid that was created by the Legislature in special session last March. The plan carved out 188 education districts, formed basically along county boundaries, and allowed the districts to set their property tax rates under guidelines provided by the Legislature. Each district was able to determine the formula for sharing the money among its schools.
The court, voting 7 to 2, said the plan was unconstitutional because it amounted to a statewide property tax and was levied without voter approval.
Two previous plans approved by the Legislature also generated lawsuits contending that school financing was inequitable. Those plans were rejected by the Supreme Court in 1989 and 1991 because they did not raise enough state taxes for the schools. The disparity in spending for each pupil between rich and poor districts in Texas is the greatest of any state. Spending for each pupil ranges from $3,190 in the poorest schools to $11,801 among the richest schools, according to the Equity Center, a Texas education research organization in Austin. The Department of Education estimates that the average for the United States in the current school year is $5,400 to $5,500.
The repeated failures of financing plans in Texas, which has the second largest student population after California's, mirror problems found in other states to a degree: political resistance to new or higher taxes and an inability to sell voters on the need for changes in school finances.
The political pressure on the Legislature against higher taxes is enormous. Texas is just one of five states that does not have a personal or corporate income tax, a distinction the Legislature wants to preserve. One of the others, New Hampshire, is also battling over equitable distribution of school funds among poor and rich school districts.
 
Failure on Two Fronts
 That Texas has gone so long without an income tax is a testament to an era when the state was awash in oil money. The state's wealth allowed the Legislature, which meets every two years, to address school financing inequities by giving poor districts slightly more state money, which comes primarily from a sales tax. This practice not only failed to give poor schools significantly more money but failed to create a more equitable way of financing the schools.
The state's economy changed with the collapse of oil prices in the mid-1980's. But the mentality in the pink granite statehouse in Austin and among voters has not. In the last legislative session, for example, there was sentiment to pass legislation barring a state income tax. So lawmakers, citing pressure from voters, argue that it is political suicide to vote for more taxes.
"The big road block is that to provide a truly equitable solution, we need substantially more state money," said Craig Foster, executive director of the Equity Center.
In an analysis, the center determined that to achieve true equity, state aid should average 55 percent to 60 percent, instead of the 47 percent to 48 percent the state now contributes to the mix of Federal and local property tax money on which the 1,050 school districts operate.
The Legislature has been among its worst enemies in selling the school financing plan to the public. In virtually all of the other 22 states sued over the problem, new financing plans were combined with educational improvements to make higher taxes more palatable to voters. Not in Texas.
 
Facing Court Deadline
 "They haven't comprehensively or strategically connected the financing piece to an education plan," said Mr. Hornbeck, the school consultant who redesigned the Kentucky education system two years ago. "As a consequence, it is not clear to people what the extra money will buy."
As the Legislature faces a June 1, 1993, deadline imposed by the Supreme Court to come up with a new plan, there is little consensus on how to proceed. The current taxing law will remain in effect until the deadline, unless the Legislature comes up with a new one before then.
One solution under consideration is a constitutional amendment that would give the Legislature final authority over financing schools, in effect blocking the courts from having any further say in the matter. Another idea would be to close the spending gap between rich and poor districts by consolidating districts.
"There isn't anything close to an agreement," said Al Kauffman, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which represents poor schools in the Texas lawsuit. "This is a very tough battle and it's going to be very difficult."

HEADLINE: Is Brushing Up and Down a Drudge? Try Brushing Upscale

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
AND now, at a specialty store near you, regard the leading-edge indicator of consumer chic in America, the brilliant new vehicle for environmental correctness, health consciousness and graphic self-expression: toothpaste.
Toothpaste? 
 O.K., this is not just toothpaste; this is status toothpaste. A rainbow coalition of imported and domestic varieties, offering everything in the way of ingredients like birch extract and anise oil, is nibbling its way to the front of the shelves at drugstore boutiques, upscale health-food emporiums, carriage-trade purveyors and department stores with an attitude.
"It's definitely a trend," said Joyce Bresa, the general manager of Caswell-Massey's flagship store at Lexington Avenue and 48th Street in Manhattan. Sales of specialty toothpaste "are at least 25 percent higher than a year ago," she said.
Toothpaste is no longer, as inventory professionals might put it, just an oral-cleansing product. As Mrs. Bresa sees it, America is reeling from all the bad news, hiding out at home from the economic crisis. "People are looking for the reassurance of simple pleasures these days," she said. "They're spending money on simple luxuries they can afford, instead of all the luxuries they can't."
Like toothpaste. You know, instead of the trip to Kitzbuhel.
To be sure, some people are buying specialty toothpastes out of an abiding commitment to health consciousness or a real concern for the environment. Many nontraditional pastes advertise that they contain no harmful chemicals or whiteners, that they are not tested on animals and that their packaging is made of recyclable materials. Other consumers "are tired of typical American toothpaste," said Giorgio DeLuca, a founder of Dean & DeLuca in Manhattan, which, despite its mission as specialty food purveyor, has been selling imported toothpaste of late.
"American brands are too sweet and too pepperminty," Mr. DeLuca said. "People are switching to toothpastes that might more delicately round out a good meal." Aha: toothpaste as digestif.
Things have come a long way from the Eisenhower days of Bucky Beaver in the "brush-a, brush-a, brush-a, brush-with-new-Ipana" era. Back then, a good bourgeois tube of Ipana or Colgate had the sanctioned cultural inevitability of a 1956 Dodge with tail fins. To Americans reared on minty flavors, the new toothpastes offer anise-flavored accents (think of Sambuca or licorice), or those of sage, arnica or thyme. Be warned, though, that some exotic toothpastes may be under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration. Toothpastes that use F.D.A.-approved ingredients can be marketed as cosmetics without elaborate oversight. But others, which make health claims based on fluoride compounds or whitening agents, are considered over-the-counter drugs, and may need approval before they can be marketed, said Sharon Snider, a spokeswoman for the agency.
The imported and health-food toothpastes have not won the Seal of Acceptance of the Council on Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Association. Dr. Kenneth H. Burrell, director of the council, said the 140,000-member association has not issued warnings against foreign or health-food toothpastes but none have earned the seal, which has been given to 25 American toothpastes for their decay-fighting properties.
Supplying the long-range clinical studies required by the association can cost $100,000 to $1 million and approval can take 6 to 18 months, Dr. Burrell said, and many foreign and health-food makers do not have the resources, or see the need, to apply.
He said that although fluoride toothpastes offer the best decay prevention, even nonfluoride imports and health-food pastes can reduce plaque and gum disease. But many buyers have a different point-of-sale motivation. For them, it all comes down to . . . well, decorating.
For those to whom toothpaste is as much a life-style statement as the Lexus in the driveway or the Swiss coffee grinder on the kitchen counter, the trusty standup Crest pump has gotten a bit long in the tooth. You are what you brush. Or at least you are what you exhibit on the sink by the medicine chest.

HEADLINE: ALBERTVILLE;
No Longer Soviet Skaters, But They Are Still the Best

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBERTVILLE, France, Feb. 11

 BODY:
For all the political changes and economic deprivations that have recast the Soviet Union into a Commonweath of Independent States, one constant remains: However the remaining republics are aligned and whatever they call themselves for the moment, they still produce the world's best pairs in figure skating.
As Natalya Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriyev performed a glorious free-skate program, rich in emotion, power, grace and elegance, they became the eighth consecutive couple from what was once the Soviet Union to win the gold medal in the Winter Olympics. 
 In so doing, they followed a tradition of pairs who have been proving their superiority in the Olympics since 1964, just the third year in which the Soviet Union participated in the Winter Games. And with another former Soviet couple, Yelena Bechke and Denis Petrov, winning the silver medal, the former Soviet athletes also showed just how far behind they have left the best from so many other countries, including the United States.
 
Solid, but Uninspiring
 The leading Americans were Natasha Kuchiki and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa, Calif., national champions in 1991, who skated a solid, but uninspiring program to finish sixth. Another couple that trains in the same rink with them, Jenni Meno and Scott Wendland, finished 11th. The sentimental American favorites, Calla Urbanski and Rocky Marval, who won the national title last month, were 10th, falling from seventh after the original program.
Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada, who finished second to Mishkutienok and Dmitriyev at the world championships last year, were third.
For these Albertville Olympics, the former Soviet athletes are representing an amalgam known as the Unified Team. Five republics have contributed athletes to the Unified Team, including Russia, which is Dmitriyev's homeland, and Belarus, which is Mishkutienok's.
The roots of both pairs are deep in Soviet tradition, as discovered and nutured by Tamara Moskvina, the coach and former Olympic pairs skater who brought Mishkutienok and Dmitriyev together more than six years ago, and Bechke and Petrov in 1987.
She was particularly fascinated by Dmitriyev's strength and Mishkutienok's delicateness, and as they grew and matured, Moskvina played on those assets. With Aleksandr Matveyev, the choreographer for both couples, she created the program Mishkutienok and Dmitriyev first used two years ago and truly mastered tonight, fairly floating above the ice -- he in lavender, she in pink, both in emotional union -- to "Dreams of Love" by Franz Liszt. Apart from her failure to complete a double axel jump, they were flawless, and the audience embraced them with a standing ovation.
Their success is all the more impressive, given the political landscape in which it
continues. Late last year, what was once the national sports committee in the Soviet Union disbanded, leaving federations for each sport in each republic to its own devises to support athletes.
 
Alarming Increase in Training Costs
 The skaters were far enough along in their training for Albertville, but costs continue increasing at alarming rates. So tonight Moskvina deflected questions relating to the future, beyond a decision to have a glass of champagne and some cavier as soon as possible.
"Our customary celebration," she said, before adding, "Truthfully, these changes have not affected the preparation of these couples greatly. We have extra expenses than previous years, but the federation and myself try to make everybody safe and stable so they can prepare properly.."
For the Americans, the standings were especially disappointing because the United States had a modest streak of its own, with medals in the last two Olympics -- Jill Watson and Peter Oppegard, the bronze in Calgary four years ago; and Kitty and Peter Carruthers, the silver in Sarajevo in 1984.
Urbanski, the 31-year-old waitress from Delaware, and Marval, the 27-year-old trucking company owner from New Jersey, had carried the highest hopes into the Games, for winning their first national title and generating waves of spiritual and financial support simply by capturing imaginations.
 
Costly Mistake Ruins Routine
 But 30 seconds into their program they became tangled when Urbanski landed too close to Marval after he threw her into a triple twist, and her left skate caught his. They nearly toppled, and the mistake threw off the rest of their 4-minute-37-second routine. After a succession of more awkward maneuvers, they finished without a smile.
Speaking to reporters later, Urbanski blamed the early mistake for the problems. "It was a mess after that," she said. "It's not up to our standards and it's not acceptable."
All the Americans said they would likely stick around for another two years for a chance at the next Winter Games, in Lillehammer, Norway. Moskvina was asked if her skaters would be there. She hedged her reply, saying: "Our country just broke down. Nobody has future plans for individuals like us."
But then she smiled, a telling sign. If this group of former Soviet skaters doesn't get there, in all likelihood others will, and everybody knows what that means.

HEADLINE: British Air's Earnings Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
British Airways P.L.C. said today that its net profit soared in the last three months of 1991 because of a one-time gain. But the company said recession continued to trouble its main markets in the United States and Britain.
 British Airways said net profit for the three months ended Dec. 31, which is the third quarter of the company's fiscal year, rose to $415 million, from $26 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 18 cents from 3.6 cents. 
 Sales rose 5.6 percent, to $2.45 billion from $2.32 billion.
The latest figure includes a $262 million one-time gain from the sale of British Airways' engine overhaul business to the General Electric Company of the United States.
The carrier said results for the most recent quarter were also able to outpace those from a year earlier in part because the airlines had been suffering in late 1990 from high fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis.
Lord King, chairman of British Airways, said in a statement: "We are positioning ourselves well to take advantage of economic recovery when it happens in our major markets. Meanwhile, in these uncertain conditions, it is essential to seek further cost savings."
British Airways converted its results from pounds to dollars at the Dec. 31 rate of $1.87 to a pound.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
$500 Billion Here, $500 Billion There

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHEN accountants talk about the cost of the savings and loan debacle, they mean the budgetary cost -- the money Uncle Sam must borrow to pay off every insured depositor. But when economists talk about the cost, they mean something else.
The act of shuffling funds from taxpayers to depositors, they note, does not create or destroy tangible wealth. The real costs, they argue, are the losses in past and future output, the decline in national income from the diversion of savings from productive capital into everything from see-through office buildings in downtown Los Angeles to unrentable shopping malls in yet-to-be-built suburbs of Dallas. 
 And thanks to the intrepid number-crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office, this economic cost has now been estimated. Their recent report reckons the loss through the year 2000 adds up to a whopping half-trillion of today's dollars.
This year Washington will spend an estimated $96 billion to cover failed savings and loans' liabilities to insured depositors. That is a jaw-dropping number, a sum as large as the G.N.P. of Norway. But most analysts agree that the outlay itself will have little direct macroeconomic effect.
The transfer of funds should not change depositors' behavior because they were never given reason to believe their nest eggs were in jeopardy. Nor should interest rates be affected, since the dollars borrowed to make the payoff will flow back into the lendable funds of the banking sector. Indeed, many economists argue that the bailout money does not belong in the budget because it will have virtually no impact on national spending or saving.
This hardly means, though, that the savings and loan meltdown has been costless. The budget office points out that deposit insurance created an enormous interest subsidy for investors in speculative projects, allowing them to borrow at rates close to those offered to blue-chip corporations. And the resulting misallocation of capital -- the spectacular overbuilding in commercial real estate -- reduced the capacity of the economy to produce what people really want to buy.
To calculate the amount of capital that went astray, the researchers worked back from the deposit insurance claims against failed savings and loans. They estimated that on average these claims represented 51 percent of the loss in the market value of real estate projects built with borrowed funds. The rest was borne by the equity investors in bankrupt projects, along with the shareholders in now-insolvent savings and loans.
Budget office analysts then used a computer model designed by Warwick McKibbin of the Brookings Institution and Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard to simulate the effects of the the lost capital resources on national income. The economic effects are first felt in the early 1980's, long before the regulators understood that something had gone badly wrong in the once-sedate savings and loan industry. But the impact is most dramatic in the early 1990's, with a loss of about $40 billion in the gross national product. It diminishes thereafter, as "above the baseline" rates of investment slowly return the economy to the baseline growth path.
The researchers identify two other potential effects that could change G.N.P. Deposit insurance, they note, made depositors feel richer and taxpayers feel poorer. The resulting impact on private savings should largely be self-canceling -- the depositors' gain, after all, is the taxpayers' loss. But the public's long delay in recognizing the potential liability to taxpayers does imply a delay in taxpayer response, and therefore a slower accumulation of capital.
With all three effects counted, the peak annual loss in output is roughly one-tenth greater and the recovery is somewhat slower. All told, the cumulative loss in G.N.P. through the year 2000 comes to a shade less than $500 billion in 1990 dollars.
It does not make much sense to add up the annual losses this way: since time is money, a dollar of income in 1980 is worth a lot less than a dollar lost in 1999. But the more rigorous "present value" figure for lost income is not much different. Recomputed by the Congressional Budget Office from the perspective of 1990, it comes to $484 billion.
Big numbers may not impress the way they once did. But a half-trillion here and a half-trillion there still add up to real money. The $484 billion, for example, is roughly in the range of the output lost during the current recession. And it is greater than the total foreign debt accumulated by the third world in the 1970's.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the savings and loan collapse is how little enduring impact it seems to have had on politics and policy. Whole continents stagnate for want of $484 billion. But here in America, the thrift follies seem to have been relegated to just another sour footnote to the what-me-worry 1980's.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Hopes Fade For More Interest Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher yesterday, as expectations of an imminent cut in interest rates subsided.
Analysts said comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, helped puncture speculation that the nation's central bank would nudge rates lower to help revitalize the economy. The dollar gained more than 2 cents against the British pound and nearly 2 pfennigs against the German mark on the remarks. 
 Gold prices moved higher, by 40 cents an ounce in New York.
In a speech at the convention of the Indpendent Bankers Association in San Antonio, Mr. Greenspan repeated his belief that interest rates were low enough to stimluate the economy.
The Fed chairman left open the possibility of further moves to push rates lower. But he said actions already taken by Fed should be "adequate to turn the economy onto the path of sustained recovery."
Financial markets had expected the central bank to push rates downward after the Labor Department issued another bleak employment report last Friday. The Government said the economy lost another 91,000 jobs in January.
But the Fed took no steps on Monday or yesterday to signal that it was easing its monetary policy. And Mr. Greenspan's testimony wiped out any remaining expectations that rates would soon fall.
The Fed chairman "took the speculation out of the market," said Kevin Logan, the chief economist of the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
That was good news for the dollar, which is supported by stable or rising rates. Higher yields increase foreign demand for American securities, which must be bought with dollars.
The dollar rose to 127.55 Japanese yen in New York yesterday from 126.70 on Monday. In Tokyo, markets were closed for a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 126.90 yen, up from Monday's close of 125.35 yen in Tokyo.
The British pound fell against the dollar, slipping to $1.7970 in New York, from $1.8190 late on Monday. In London, the pound fell to $1.8025, from $1.8280 late on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Monday, included: 1.5965 German marks, up from 1.5770; 1.4295 Swiss francs, up from 1.4085; 5.4380 French francs, up from 5.3775; 1201.25 Italian lire, up from 1,187.50, and 1.18215 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17765.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose 40 cents an ounce, closing at $356.30. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $355.80, also up 40 cents.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $356.15, from $355.00. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $356.25 from $355.00.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Fall

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit continued to ease in the week that ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that tracks bank rates.
"The next direction in savings yields will be influenced by the consumer confidence report due out on Thursday," said Robert K. Heady, The Monitor's publisher. 
 "If there is no improvement, there will be additional pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates further. In the event it does act, we can expect another wave of rate cutting that will send yields down to even lower levels than at present.
"Right now,"the odds heavily favor another action by the Federal Reserve."
Among New York area commercial banks, the average yield on a money market account dropped by 7 basis points, to 3.51 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Among the savings institutions in this area, money market account yields averaged 4.12 percent, off by 4 basis points.
 
Midlantic's Big Cut
 For money market accounts, the steepest cut among area banks was made by Midlantic Banks Inc. in New Jersey, which lowered its yield by 26 basis points. The Bank of Tokyo Trust in New York posted the sharpest drop in yields on its three-month certificates, with a cut of 19 basis points, while the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company lowered the yield on its six-month certificate by 26 basis points -- more than any other bank in the area.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday,February12,1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Frustrated, Chip Group May Disband

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
A Government advisory panel charged with drafting a strategy to help the American semiconductor industry issued its final report yesterday and prepared to shut itself down, its numerous recommendations having gone largely unheeded.
"I expect that we will go out of business," said Ian Ross, the chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors and the former president of Bell Laboratories, the research division of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. "We don't really see that there is a role for NACS ongoing, under the present circumstances." 
 Dr. Ross, who spoke at a Washington news conference, could scarcely conceal his disappointment that the committee, which started out with a bang in 1989, is ending with scarcely a whimper. Almost none of its recommendations have been carried out and, in the committee's view, the nation's computer chip industry is still losing ground to Japanese competitors.
Dr. Ross and other industry executives said the group's experience demonstrated how difficult it could be to craft a policy to help a specific industry when the Bush Administration was against "industrial policy" that picks winners or losers.
"Either the stuff they said had no teeth, or the stuff they said was interesting and never had a prayer," said Michael Borrus, a semiconductor industry expert at the University of California at Berkeley who had worked for the committee.
Now, with the economy reeling and an election at hand, the Administration appears to be becoming more receptive to what it calls technology policy. But the committee concluded that it has "done all that it can" in terms of presenting ideas.
 
First Proposals Were Rejected
 The committee, made up of top electronics industry executives and Government officials, was created by the 1988 trade law to advise the Government on a strategy for the semiconductor industry.
Its first report, issued in 1989, contained some bold proposals -- chief of which was the establishment of a corporation, perhaps backed by Government loan guarantees, that would make low-cost capital available to help American companies re-enter the consumer electronics business.
The proposal was "opposed by the Administration very openly and very forthrightly," Dr. Ross recalled yesterday. In retrospect, some analysts say, the committee lost credibility with that initial report and never regained it.
The committee also recommended an increase in the financing for Sematech, the semiconductor industry consortium that is partly financed by the Defense Department. Instead the Bush Administration is proposing to cut the Federal contribution to Sematech next year to $80 million from $100 million.
 
Some Accomplishments Cited
 The committee more recently proposed Micro Tech 2000, an ambitious undertaking in the tradition of the Apollo moon project, to develop the computer chip manufacturing technology that would allow American companies to leapfrog the Japanese. But no plans were ever put forth as to how to organize, coordinate or finance such a project. That task will now fall to the Semiconductor Industry Association, the chip makers' lobbying group.
Still, Dr. Ross pointed to some accomplishments of the group. A proposal to accelerate depreciation for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is now in a bill before Congress. The committee also made many more generic recommendations, such as calling for improved education and improved tax credits for research and development -- measures that have also been suggested by many other parties and which the Administration is trying to implement.
In the last two or three years, American computer chip manufacturers seemed to have stopped losing market share and the Japanese appeared to have stopped gaining ground. But Dr. Ross said he believed this was more an anomaly tied to steep price declines in Japanese memory chips than a true turnaround.
 
A Final Warning
 In its final report, entitled "Attaining Pre-eminence in Semiconductors," the committee warns that Japanese companies are still heavily outspending American ones on research and new equipment. It also says that American market share of electronics equipment, such as computers and televisions, dropped by 14 percentage points between 1985 and 1990.
The report recommends steps to encourage industrial investment. It also recommends that the Government help spur the formation of electronics consortiums, among other things by allowing rival companies to cooperate in manufacturing in nascent areas, such as flat-panel displays.
It also recommends that the Government stimulate manufacturing of electronic products that could be big users of semiconductors, such as by supporting the development of high-speed communications networks and "smart" highways and vehicles, which use electronics to speed traffic flow and reduce accidents.

HEADLINE: Honeywell-Minolta Dispute Teaches Conflicting Lessons

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
In full-page newspaper ads, news conferences and public statements, Honeywell Inc. has been insisting that its $96 million award last week in a patent infringement case against the Japanese company Minolta Camera is less a victory than a vindication of American technological prowess.
Honeywell also asserts that the whole affair highlights how the United States has squandered the benefits of that prowess by failing to demand more international protection for patents and other intellectual property. 
 But Minolta officials say that in the battle over who invented the automatic focusing technology widely used in today's cameras they see a different lesson: America pays a price for the timidity of its industry.
Minolta officials, who have been irked by what they call Honeywell's efforts "to turn a complex business dispute into an international trade issue," say that Americans concerned about the country's economic future should look closely at testimony about Honeywell's decision to quit making a key camera component based on its automatic focusing technology. Minolta says that the retreat was premature and cost the United States hundreds of manufacturing jobs.
"It was typical of a number of American manufacturers that have failed to look to the future," said Sadahei Kusumoto, chairman and chief executive of Minolta Camera's American subsidiary, the Minolta Corporation, based in Ramsey, N.J. "It was a good device," he said. "And with a couple of hundred thousand dollars in investment, everyone would have been able to use it, and they would still be in the photographic business."
The four-month legal battle in Federal District Court in Newark ended in victory for Honeywell on the issue of whether Minolta infringed the automatic-focusing-technology patents that Honeywell filed in the early 1970's, although the jury said the infringement was unintentional.
The jury sided with Minolta on whether it had breached a contract with Honeywell that ran from 1979 to 1985 and covered the use of what was called TCL, a later Honeywell autofocusing technology covered by other patents. It was the TCL technology that Minolta says Honeywell abandoned too soon.
 
Dispute Over Research Money
 As Minolta told the story in court, Honeywell first informed it and other Japanese companies in 1979 that TCL was being developed to provide autofocus technology for single-lens reflex cameras, which were growing in popularity because they allowed consumers to use telephoto lenses and other variations on the standard fixed camera lens. The technology proved to be far more difficult to develop than anticipated, however, and when the first cameras using it reached the market by 1982, they were commercial flops.
At that point, Minolta says, it and other Japanese camera makers told Honeywell that it would have to improve TCL if they were to use it. Minolta said that Honeywell was also informed that Minolta was working on its own autofocus system. It claimed that in 1983, Honeywell responded with a series of what Minolta considered unreasonable demands that the Japanese company pay half the cost of the improvements, commit to purchases and accept delays in the target date for completing the project.
Minolta said that Honeywell had actually already decided to drop the business and was putting off any further investment because it was secretly concentrating on trying to sell its TCL rights to another Japanese company, Mitsubishi.
 
Minolta Produced a Hit
 Eventually, Minolta went with its own system and, in 1985, introduced the Maxxum camera. The Maxxum was a hit with consumers, helping send Minolta into its current position as the leading camera maker in the United States market, with annual sales of about $400 million.
Minolta said that one result of its success was a temporary surge in TCL orders from Japanese rivals desperate to catch up. Those orders waned as the other camera makers developed new technology, and the TCL unit was sold by Honeywell several years later. Today, TCL is used primarily in video cameras.
Honeywell says Minolta's view of TCL's history is misleading. "Honeywell invested tens of millions of dollars in TCL," said Michael V. Ciresi, the Minneapolis attorney who led the Honeywell legal team. "The idea Honeywell wouldn't invest was nonsense."
Mr. Ciresi said that Honeywell was demanding a commitment from Minolta and the other camera makers before investing still more in 1983 because of its experience with the VAF autofocus technology it pioneered in the mid-1970's for lens-shutter cameras -- cameras which, unlike single-lens reflex models, do not allow the user to view the image directly through the camera lens.
 
Japanese Sought an Alternative
 VAF autofocus modules were big sellers in the first few years after Pentax of Japan brought them to market. But the Japanese manufacturers soon began looking for a local alternative. Instead of the passive-focus technologies of VAF and TCL, which simply process the image received by the camera lens, the Japanese switched to active autofocusing technology. This active version relies on shooting a beam of light out to the subject and determining the focus by measuring how long it takes the light to bounce back.
Active autofocusing does not have enough range to work well in all applications in single-lens reflex cameras, which is why TCL continued to be of interest. But Honeywell feared that Minolta and others intended to use TCL only until they could develop their own alternative. "There wasn't any doubt that they were going to go their own way," said Mr. Ciresi.
He also said that Honeywell approached Mitsubishi not for the purpose of selling TCL but to try to establish a joint venture with a Japanese partner that might make the technology more appealing to Japanese camera makers.
Both companies' arguments echoed themes that have risen repeatedly in trade tensions between the United States and Japan. And although both companies say that such tensions are not the problem in their particular dispute, it is likely that further developments in the camera wars will reflect the larger tensions and differences between the two countries.
Honeywell attorneys, for example, said that pretrial investigations had uncovered cooperative practices among the Japanese manufacturers, cooperation the attorneys say would constitute antitrust violations in the United States. Camera industry committees in Japan discussed both the design and pricing of new products before they reached market, Honeywell said Monday.
"Those are interesting issues we are going to pursue in the other cases," said Mr. Ciresi, referring to pending disputes with 14 other Japanese camera manufacturers. Besides the Japanese camera makers, Honeywell has named a Korean company, a Taiwan company and an American corporation, the Eastman Kodak Company, as potential violators of its patents.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Cable Television Stocks Languish

BYLINE: By Geraldine Fabrikant

 BODY:
WHILE the stock market has been soaring, the cable television stocks, particularly Tele-Communications Inc. and the Comcast Corporation, have languished, depressed by the specter of tougher regulations.
Neither is even near the highs they hit in 1989. Tele-Communications closed yesterday at $15.50, off 25 cents. Its high since 1986 was $21.625 in late 1989. Comcast, too, closed yesterday at $15.50, up 37.5 cents. Its high had been $19.938 in late 1989. 
 Two weeks ago, the Senate approved a bill that would let municipalities regulate cable systems rates and would allow television stations to charge cable systems for the right to retransmit their broadcast signals.
The bill faces several other hurdles before it becomes law, but experts and officials say some form of regulation seems inevitable.
If the new rules prove to be relatively mild, then cable stocks could take off, many analysts say, because the uncertainty would be removed.
While concern is focused on the Senate bill, most of the other issues potentially damaging to cable have virtually disappeared, including rising interest rates, and competition from direct broadcast satellites and the regional telephone companies, at least in the near future, said John Kornreich, who follows the media companies for Sandler Capital, an investment firm.
The drop in interest rates has allowed most cable operators to refinance their debt at much lower costs. In the last several months, for example, Tele-Communications has refinanced close to $1 billion of debt, probably saving about $30 million in interest over a year ago, Mr. Kornreich estimates. The company has been piling up long-term debt. It could have used bank debt, which would have offered lower rates in the near term, but left an uncertain future.
Aside from taking advantage of lower interest rates, Tele-Communications has raised its cash flow over the last two years by at least 35 percent.
Comcast was able to finance its $1.5 billion acquisition of Metrophone, a cellular telephone company, more attractively than it might have a year ago.
Moreover, the pay-per-view segment of cable, which allows cable subscribers to pay to watch movies on impulse, is growing. It would not be subject to regulation, since it is not part of the basic cable offering. Indeed, for the first time Time-Warner cited pay-per-view revenue as a noteworthy contributor to the profitability of its cable operations.
As cable operators upgrade their systems, more channels will be available, including more allocated to pay per view.
The recession has slowed cable's growth somewhat, but not as much as had been feared.
"We follow 50 cable companies," Mr. Kornreich said. "Every one had a record year of cash flow. At least 80 percent had double-digit growth. I don't know any that had under 5 percent growth."
Meanwhile, direct broadcast satellites, once viewed as a serious threat to cable, have not proved to be much competition.
And the telephone companies appear more likely to form joint ventures with cable than to challenge it.
Thus if there is a compromise on the Senate bill, the cable stocks probably would react favorably. The cable companies want the issue resolved one way or another. Once there is a resolution, investors would undoubtedly feel reassured.
The House still has to come up with its version of cable reregulation. But based on a moderate bill it passed in 1990, the House will not be as aggressive as the Senate. Then it would go to a compromise committee. President Bush has said that he will veto a harsh bill.
John Reidy, who follows the cable industry for Smith Barney & Company, said he believed the President was likely to accept reasonable legislation. "He has no particular interest in the cable industry, but he has a strong vested interest in preserving his role as a deregulationist," Mr. Reidy said. "If adversaries of cable want to get anything through, it has to be something both the President and the industry can live with."

HEADLINE: Democrats Try to Foil Bush's Tax Agenda

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
As President Bush urged House Republicans to stick with him on his "short-term" economic growth package today, Democrats set the political stage to force them to vote against other parts of his plan.
At a meeting at the White House, Mr. Bush told Republican members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee that the country wanted action on a cut in taxes on capital gains from 28 percent to 15.4 percent, on faster depreciation for new investments and on various steps to encourage home buying. Action on the other proposals in his State of the Union address and budget request could come later, he said. 
 But Democrats were busy arranging things so that Mr. Bush could not set the legislative agenda. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, introduced all of Mr. Bush's tax proposals in the House as one bill. Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, announced that this was the bill the committee would consider on Wednesday, in a rare open session.
 
Scoring Political Points
 That committee meeting will be televised, like Mr. Bush's opening comments before meeting with committee Republicans today, as the White House and the Congressional Democratic leadership concentrates on scoring political points. The smaller Republican package does not include one major individual tax-cutting provision, a $500 increase in the personal exemption for children. Democrats want to chide the President for not making the "family credit" a priority item.
The bigger White House list includes at least three sections that the Democrats want to use to demonstrate broad opposition by Congressional Republicans. They include imposing Medicare taxes on state and local employees, taxing undistributed investment income on some annuities and disallowing interest deductions for loans on corporate-owned life insurance policies.
In today's White House meeting, Republicans criticized each of those provisions to Mr. Bush, said Representative Raymond J. McGrath, Republican of Long Island.
Republicans emerged from the White House with a unified counterattack against what they called the "Gephardt bill." Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, said it was not the President's bill because it lacked the domestic spending cuts Mr. Bush had proposed to pay for further tax reductions.
Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said Mr. Gephardt's approach was "hypocrisy" because he would not try to pay for the tax cuts in the larger Bush proposal. "I'm for the family credit, but I'm not for providing it without funding it," she said.
The proposal Mr. Bush and his allies are now supporting also goes beyond his original plan in reducing capital gains taxes. Under his original proposal, taxpayers subject to the alternative minium tax would have had to pay that 24 percent rate on capital gains. The bill introduced by Republicans Friday omits that requirement, potentially benefiting about 200,000 upper-income taxpayers.
Mr. Gephardt seized on that change today, saying it would cost an additional $2.7 billion and showed that Republican concerns were "focused on the ultra super-rich."
Along with the public effort to embarrass Republicans with the full Administration tax proposal, Mr. Rostenkowski and his Democratic colleagues will caucus privately Wednesday to define an alternative tax bill with a middle-class tax cut paid for by a higher tax rate on upper-income taxpayers.

HEADLINE: Rate Cut Not Ruled Out, The Fed Chief Repeats

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
A gathering here of lenders to the nation's small towns and small businesses heard Alan Greenspan restate today that he would not rule out reducing interest rates further if the economony needed an additional spur toward recovery.
But unlike bond traders and Wall Street economists counting on Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to lower interest rates after last week's disappointing January unemployment report, many of the bankers at a meeting here of the Independent Bankers Association of America have different interests. They fear that cheaper money at this point could damage the fragile economy. 
 "Lower interest rates are not good for people living off fixed-rate certificates of deposit," said James R. Lauffer, chairman and chief executive of the First National Bank of Herminie, a bank with $180 million in assets 25 miles west of Pittsburgh.
"If lower rates aren't generating productivity and expansion in the business sector, then you've got more parts of the economy hurting," he said.
 
Wants 6% C.D. Rates
 Bob Hawkins, chairman of the Southern Commercial Bank, in St. Louis, said, "To give savers a fair return, considering the inflation rate, we should be looking at C.D. rates of 6 percent, not 4 percent."
Small community bankers like Mr. Lauffer and Mr. Hawkins, who heads an institution with assets of $200 million, have lost large amounts of deposits since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a full percentage point on Dec. 20. They say the loss of deposits has forced them to turn cautious on lending to their regular customers who are small businesses, home buyers and consumers.
Their traditional source of the money they lend are older people with large savings in Federally insured, short-term bank deposits. But many of these people have taken money out of banks and helped provide record inflows of money for stock and bond mutual funds in the last eight weeks.
The bankers said they had pursued higher bond yields and capital growth from stocks to capture a portion of income that vanished as interest rates plunged by more than 2.5 percentage points in the last 18 months. But those investments carry more risk than low-yielding bank deposits, and if they tumble in value, the bankers fret that less money will be available to switch back to the bank deposits.
The bankers say the shift of funds has already crimped their ability to make loans. They say the squeeze could worsen when loan demand accelerates.
David Ballweg, head of the bankers' group and president of the Community State Bank, with assets of $80 million in Union Grove, Wis., 25 miles south of Milwaukee, said consumer confidence was the biggest obstacle now to a recovering economy.
 
Backs Investment Credits
 Worries about rising health care costs, a gaping Federal budget deficit projected at $399 billion for the 1993 fiscal year, declining living standards and layoffs probably cannot be cured by lower interest rates, Mr. Ballweg said.
"The investment credits that President Bush proposed would stimulate more activity in the small-business sector," he said. "That is where the new jobs will be added, not in the big companies that are laying off people."
In his speech to 2,000 of the community bankers this morning, Mr. Greenspan repeated his comments before Congress last week that he had not ruled out a further cut in interest rates, but that he still believed enough had been done to put the economy on the path to recovery.
In words slightly stronger than his remarks to the House Budget Committee on Feb. 4, Mr. Greenspan said that the Federal Reserve "must -- and will -- continue to monitor" daily economic reports, and, "if necessary, would move toward an increased degree of monetary ease."

Chip Index Rises Again

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
On the strength of increased chip orders, the semiconductor industry's leading indicator climbed for the fifth straight month in January, a trade group reported today.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08 for the three-month period ending in January, up from a revised figure of 1.07 in December, and from 1.01 in November. The book-to-bill compares orders to shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 1.08 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $108 was ordered, indicating that demand has increased. 
 At $1.41 billion, three-month orders for January were up 1.4 percent from $1.39 billion for the period ended in December, and 16.7 percent higher than the comparable figure for one year earlier, which was $1.21 billion. Three-month average shipments for January totaled $1.31 billion, flat with December's figure. At $1.24 billion, actual United States market shipments for January were down 11.2 percent from December's $1.39 billion.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Discloses Apple Claim

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The Microsoft Corporation today disclosed that Apple Computer Inc. was seeking $4.37 billion in damages in its long-running copyright infringment suit against the software company.
Apple sued Microsoft and the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1989, contending that Microsoft's Windows 2.03 and Hewlett-Packard's New Wave programs copied the look and feel of the Macintosh's visual displays. Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., later amended its suit to include Windows 3.0, the version currently marketed by Microsoft. 
 Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it considered the claim insupportable and speculative and noted that before any damages could be awarded, there would have to be a finding of infringment.
The amount of damages sought from Hewlett-Packard were not disclosed and Hewlett officials were unavailable for comment today, but the amount could presumed to be much lower because of the comparably small sales of New Wave.
 
Claim Based on Study
 Christopher Escher, a spokesman for Apple, said the $4 billion was not a formal damage claim. He said it was the conclusion of a study aimed at estimating damages that was done for Apple by Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University.
"This is one piece of evidence," Mr. Escher said. "There will be more evidence presented." He added that Apple would make its formal damage claim to the jury.
According to Microsoft, the total damages Apple seeks include $3.01 billion in profits Apple claims to have lost because of reduced unit sales and depressed hardware prices resulting from Microsoft Windows being on the market. Apple also seeks to recover gross revenues of $1.34 billion on Microsoft Windows and on products that operate with Windows, like Microsoft Excel for Windows.
Microsoft said the claim was received by its lawyers in February in the course of pretrial discovery in a memorandum marked by Apple as "for attorneys only." Microsoft released the documents late today after Apple agreed to lift the confidentiality requirement.
Federal District Court Judge Vaughn Walker has set Friday as a deadline for motions in the case. No trial date has been set.

Apple in Radius Deal
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- In a relatively rare move, Apple Computer Inc. has licensed part of its key operating system software to Radius Inc., a company that makes circuit boards that enhance the power of Macintosh computers. Apple has long treated its operating system, the basic software that controls its Macintosh computers, as a key competitive advantage. But Apple is now expressing more willingness to license parts of its software. Radius, based in San Jose, Calif., will help to develop a software product called Rocketshare, which will allow several Macintosh computers or Radius Rocket circuit boards to divide a complex computing task and solve it faster.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed, With Dow Rising 6.49

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, as investor attention shifted from earnings to interest rates, and from secondary issues to cyclicals. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 6.49 points, to 3,251.57.
Investors cautious ahead of the Treasury's quarterly refunding that began yesterday with an auction of new three-year notes, moved to the sidelines as the Fed again declined to signal an easing at its normal intervention time. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 200.2 million shares, up from 188 million shares on Monday. The Big Board composite closed at 228.94, up one-hundredth of a percentage point as the number of gaining issues outdistanced losers by 935 to 774.
Anthony Ludovici, senior vice president and senior investment analyst at Tucker Anthony, saw yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes as a non-event for the stock market, as the bond market eased ahead of the auction results, then firmed when it became apparent that the street was comfortable with the yield.
He also noted the talk by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, before the annual conference of the Independent Bankers Association of America in San Antonio, where he repeated what he has been saying all along, that he expects the effects of recent Fed cuts to be evident reasonably soon, that he believes Fed action to date should be sufficient, and that the Fed stands ready for further monetary easing if necessary
 
Dow Refuses to Retreat
 "The market believes Mr. Greenspan, as cyclicals geared to an economic rebound replace the biotechs and health care stocks in the eyes of the investors," Mr. Ludovici said. "You're talking about the major industrials, manufacturers, machine tool companies, capital goods and automobile companies.
"The Dow refuses to go down, even in its overbought position, as it makes internal adjustments through rotation."
Market activity left the Standard & Poor's index virtually unchanged at 413.76, down one-hundredth of a percentage point, while the American Stock Exchange index showed a 0.32 point gain on the day, to 415.46.
Weakness in secondary issues pulled the Nasdaq composite down 0.76 point, to 633.37, while the Russell 2,000 managed to gain 0.18 point to finish at 210.71.
Traders said after an opening loss, blue-chip issues made moderate gains as they moved out ahead of the broad and secondary markets, with buyers being selective. Airline stocks were active, while biotechs stayed weak, with cyclicals the most sought after. Money rotated out of growth stocks into cyclicals and lower-priced issues. But on the whole investors were content to remain on the sidelines, with only individual stocks reacting to news.
I.B.M. rose 1/2, to 90 1/4, as five of its previously announced ES/9000 models became available ahead of schedule.
Christina Heuer, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, confirmed a repeat on a "buy" rating for Pfizer, as the stock gained 1 3/8, to 73 7/8. According to traders, she said Pfizer is scheduled to meet with analysts tomorrow and that the shares of the drug company are at an attractive level. Of all the major drug stocks, it has corrected the most, down 13 percent on a year-to-date basis.
Some analysts yesterday recommended Shaw Industries, a carpet manufacturer, following news of its planned merger with Salem Carpet Mills on Monday. Traders said the stock rose 1 3/4, to 45 3/4. Josie Esquivel, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, reiterated her "outperform" rating, saying the merger was a positive move that could increase Shaw's market share.
Goodyear Tire gained 7/8 to close at 61 1/4, as the company posted solid earnings, with cost containments offsetting a slight revenue drop.
Citing a slower and weaker than expected recovery in the cellular phone business, traders said Thomas Kurlak, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, lowered his 1992 and 1993 earnings estimate for Motorola, as the price of the stock fell to 80 1/8.
Conrail tumbled 4 1/2, to 82, after posting a net loss of $9.23 a share for the fourth quarter on Monday, while also making a cautious first-quarter forecast.

HEADLINE: House Sales Rose 7% From December '90

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Sales of existing single-family homes in New York State north of New York City rose by more than 7 percent in December 1991, and realty experts said today that the housing market is slowly starting to rally.
"The recession took a lot of steam out of the real-estate industry during 1990 and 1991," said Charles M. Staro, executive vice president of the New York State Association of Realtors. "We hope this modest rebound aids the housing market, and economy as a whole, shake the recessionary doldrums." 
 The association received sales figures from 40 of its 50 local realtor boards and associations. In December 1991, members reported 4,680 houses were sold statewide, an increase of 7.4 percent from the 4,359 sold in December 1990.
Houses sold in December 1991 averaged $139,167 statewide compared to $127,305 a year earlier, an increase of 9.3 percent, the association said. In Westchester and Rockland Counties houses sold for an average of $338,381 and $188,975, respectively.

HEADLINE: A New Species of Donor Gives to Help the Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
File this one under "and you thought you'd seen everything."
With only two weeks to go in the 80th annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, it seemed that the list of contributors to the fund this year had run the gamut: toddlers and octogenarians, residents of Caracas, Zurich and Dubuque, wealthy people who operate large companies and poor people who have been unemployed for months. Poets, movie stars and mechanics. Nevertheless, yesterday's mail brought a first for this appeal: a $100 check from a dog. 
 "Adam, who is an Irish setter and who lives with me, and I have saved our quarters for a while and decided that we wanted to send you a check," said a letter signed by Florence and Adam Kaye of Upperville, Va. "You can do what we cannot, so we send you our thanks and our blessings."
Adam may be the only contributor who wags his tail when he is happy, but the slow, methodical way he amassed his donation is only one variation on a theme.
 
Pennies and Nickels
 Another contributor, Susan S. Ach of Manhattan, wrote: "We are enclosing a check for $37, which represents $26 of pennies and nickels saved during the year and $5 contributed by Benjamin, 6, and $6 from Rachel, 9."
An anonymous letter attached to a check for $35 said, "For many years I never used the innumerable food coupons that cross our threshold because, I am ashamed to admit, I felt they were more trouble than they were worth. However, last January I decided to try using them for a year and to contribute at least half the savings to the Neediest Cases."
Since the fund was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The Times, it has raised money for disadvantaged New Yorkers by showing readers what The Times initially described as "a world of famine in the midst of plenty; of cruel heart and body hunger with bounty in sight but not in reach." What began as the Hundred Neediest Cases has expanded to meet needs of thousands of individuals.
The newspaper covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed directly to seven charities. The money provides many forms of relief, including food for the hungry, homes for the homeless and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to provide job training for the disabled and counseling for substance abusers and to support a wide array of AIDS-related programs.
 
Coins From Bottle Returns
 Carolyn Holmes of Manhattan cobbled together her $18 donation a nickel at a time. "A year ago I decided to save my coins from bottle returns," she wrote. "My best friend said: 'What a hassle. What are you going to do with the $15 or $20 you might collect?' "
" 'Go to two or three movies,' I replied."
Ms. Holmes continued, "I rarely read this newspaper before subscribing in October and how happy I was to learn of the fund and hence find a better reason for keeping track of the redemptions. I'll be collecting more cans and bottles in 1992 and look forward to contributing to the fund again."

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
After a Tourist's Death, Lingering Pain Remains

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
IN this time of dangling question marks, it is hard to say whether it helps to remember. For some, it is impossible to forget.
On July 4, Rhona Lantin, a 26-year-old visitor to New York City, was killed by a stray bullet as she sat in a car inching through Chinatown. 
 The slaying of the Philippine native was one of those events that jolt this jaded metropolis, making New Yorkers seem somehow more concerned about the senseless killing of an outsider than of one of their own.
Just as when Brian Watkins, a tourist from Utah, died trying to protect his family, New Yorkers seemed to take notice for a nanosecond, a few perhaps feeling pain over what we have become.
Patrick Canning, who is now 31 years old, was Miss Lantin's fiance. "I will always try to picture her looking at me, and me trying to make her smile," he said.
The bare facts are these: The two worked in the Agriculture Department in Washington and attended the same graduate program in agricultural economics at the University of Maryland. They became engaged on November 1990. The planned wedding date, known only to the couple, was May 30, 1992.
Facts, of course, do not begin to tell this love story with no happy ending. "I more or less carry a kind of resolve, as opposed to letting this consume me," Mr. Canning said in one of several telephone conversations.
Last week, an uncle of Miss Lantin's received a check from the New York State Crime Victims Board for $2,000 -- much appreciated, but less than the cost of her coffin.
There is no more involvement with the city where Ms. Lantin died -- other than the empty promise Mayor David N. Dinkins and then-Deputy Mayor Milton Mollen made in an October meeting. They told Mr. Canning and Miss Lantin's brother, Ryan, that they would be kept regularly informed on the investigation's progress, even if there was none. They have heard nothing.
"I don't want to give the impression that I'm bitter or impatient," Mr. Canning said. "We more or less feel in the dark and alienated."
The deeper darkness is the absence of the merry sound of Miss Lantin's voice. She would sometimes break into song, usually one of the old Broadway standards she loved, as she worked in the computer room at work. "It made everyone embarrassed -- not for her but for their own insecurity," Mr. Canning said.
Miss Lantin made all kinds of rooms sparkle. She crafted dolls for Mr. Canning's nine nephews and nieces. She loved to play the piano. There was no Philippine dish she could not cook wonderfully.
In her master's thesis, she was using a sophisticated methodology urged by her adviser. The adviser, Mr. Canning said, was disappointed that his star student was not going for a Ph.D.
Mr. Canning remembers July 3, the last time he saw his fiancee, as a time of anxiousness for her. Soon, she would have to make the oral defense of her thesis.
But first, she planned two big trips. One was to New York City to join 10 members of her high school class from the Philippines for a mini-reunion. The second was a cross-country camping trip with Mr. Canning; she would join him on the West Coast for the return portion.
"I convinced her, and she wasn't all that hard to convince, that all she could do was to do her best," he said. "She promised me she would have a good time in New York City."
The next few days are forever jumbled. There was a harried flight to Newark from Chicago, where Mr. Canning had been visiting a friend. All the sudden, he was helping identify her body and choosing a coffin.
Then came the flight to Manila with the body. A three-day, 24-hour-a-day wake followed. The mourners, all wearing white, never stopped coming. The experience was ghostlike, enervating, then oddly soothing.
More than half a year has passed. Mr. Canning is finishing the final chapter of Miss Lantin's master's thesis, and will soon present it to the three members of her reviewing committee. He is proud of doing this. He is also administering two scholarship funds in her name, one for poor Philippine children and one for University of Maryland graduate students. Each has collected several thousand dollars.
The address for both is the Rhona Lantin Scholarship Fund, 4513 MacArthur Boulevard N.W., Washington, D.C. 20003. Checks should be made payable to the Philippine National Bank, the transfer agent.
The seasons change, and Mr. Canning has returned to graduate school. But he still hangs close to his fiancee's family -- striving mightily for continuity in a cruelly discontinuous world.
On Sunday, he visited her aunt's house in Maryland. She made pies from baby coconuts. One for dessert, another for him to take home.

HEADLINE: Convicted Mayor Wins Yet More Time in Office

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J., Feb. 11

 BODY:
For the second time in five days, Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City won a stay today of a judge's order that he leave office immediately because of his conviction on Federal fraud charges.
A three-judge appeals panel lifted a temporary stay today on a ruling by Judge Arthur N. D'Italia of Superior Court, who held on Friday that Mr. McCann had forfeited his office. But Mr. McCann was out of office for only a few minutes before his lawyer, Matthew P. Boylan, telephoned the clerk of the New Jersey Supreme Court and won another stay to give the state's highest court time to review the forfeiture ruling. 
 When she stayed Mr. McCann's removal for three business days on Friday, to bring Mr. McCann before the appeals court today, Judge Sylvia B. Pressler of the Appellate Division of Superior Court was heard to say, "What can happen in three days?"
Mr. McCann demonstrated what can happen when he made 21 appointments to Jersey City's planning board, zoning board of adjustment, redevelopment agency, economic development corporation, parking authority, environmental commission, human rights commission, library board, assessment commission and the construction board of appeals.
 
Round of Appointments
 One of those named to the economic development corporation was Peter Murphy, director of the Hudson County Chamber of Commerce and a former vice president of Midlantic National Bank North, which lent Mr. McCann $20,000 in 1986. One of the counts on which Mr. McCann was convicted was that he filed a false application for that loan. There was no evidence at the trial that Mr. Murphy knew Mr. McCann had lied on his application.
The spate of appointments angered members of the City Council, who apparently do not have the power to stop them. On Monday Mr. McCann sent 10 more nominations to the council, but they were for posts, such as municipal judge, that require council confirmation. "They were rejected out of hand," said Councilman Jaime Vazquez.
Mr. Vazquez said Mr. McCann had managed to unite the eight council members against him since he was convicted Dec. 17 of defrauding a Florida savings and loan association of about $260,000. The savings and loan iis now defunct.
The council was evenly divided among supporters and opponents of the Mayor until last week, when Mr. McCann vetoed two ordinances that would have given the council greater influence over independent authorities. The council voted unanimously to override the vetoes.
Councilman Bill O'Dea, a longtime critic of the Mayor, said Mr. McCann was "handing bonbons to his supporters." Councilman Dan Waddleton, once one of the Mayor's strongest allies on the council, issued a statement in which he said: "These last-minute appointments are an insult to everyone who cares about Jersey City. I call upon all of these appointees to act in the best interest of Jersey City and decline their nominations."
Mr. O'Dea said he would recommend that the council file suit to block the appointments, which came after Judge D'Italia's forfeiture order. But Joanne Monahan, the acting city corporation counsel, reminded the council that attempts to block last-minute appointments made by Mr. McCann at the end of his first term as Mayor in 1985 were unsuccessful.
When Mr. McCann lost the mayoralty to Anthony Cucci that year, he showed his anger. Mr. Cucci arrived in City Hall to find the locks on the Mayor's office plugged with Krazy Glue, official documents shredded and the office in a shambles. Mr. McCann won a second term as Mayor, defeating Mr. Cucci, in 1989. The events that led to his conviction occurred during the four years he was out of office.
Mr. O'Dea said that if Mr. McCann repeated his angry leave-taking of 1985 and causes any damage in City Hall, "we'll seek to have criminal charges filed against him."

HEADLINE: Remember the Winter of '78?;
Those Big Snow Stories Are Fading With the Years

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
A new generation gap is forming, between people whose childhood memories are hip deep in snow and children who have rarely seen snow deep enough to roll into a snowman.
After eight years of snowfalls that have been well below normal, New York City has had only 2.2 inches of snow midway through this winter. That compares with the usual 17 inches by this time in February, and it is less than a tenth of the city's average of 28.3 inches a season. 
 In Connecticut, the National Weather Service has recorded only 9.5 inches in Windsor Locks, where the season's average is 47.9, and in Albany only 19.4 inches has fallen, less than a third of the average winter's 66.
 
A Strange Statistic
 The unusually dry winter is bad news for children with sleds, hardware stores with racks of shovels, and truck owners with new plows. It has been good news for schools, many of which have avoided closing for even a single snow day, and for hard-pressed governments, which stand to save millions of dollars on overtime, sand and salt. If it doesn't snow.
Meteorologists caution not only that it may, indeed, yet snow, but also that snow, after all, is what people remember about winters. Heavy snows are rare in this region south of the snow belt, but a single blizzard roars forever in the human memory.
"Snow is a strange statistic, because it has a high degree of variability from year to year," said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at the Penn State Weather Communications Group, a part of Penn State University. "Such a period of below-normal snow is not unprecedented."
He continued: "The anomalous thing was the period from the mid-50's through the late 70's, when seldom was there a winter substantially below normal. That 20-year period may have cemented impressions of a climate of more consistent snowfall than has been the rule."
So people remember 1978, when back-to-back blizzards paralyzed the Northeast, dropping 31.3 inches of snow on Central Park. The winter of 1972-73, when the weather service said New York City had a record low snowfall of 2.8 inches, is less vivid.
 
Rain Is Also Scarce
 "My deepest snow?" 12-year-old Eddie Shuler of Danbury, Conn., said yesterday as he prepared for a day of skiing at Mount Southington in central Connecticut. "Maybe two inches."
"A foot and a half," said his friend, Jay Shoffner, just three years older. With a little prodding from his mother, Joy, he could name the year: 1978.
Most of the northeastern United States is short of snow this winter. The reason, said Robert Stalker, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Rockefeller Center, is that the brief bursts of cold air blown into the region by the jet stream have not hit moist low-pressure systems. "They just haven't been linking up," he said.
Rain is also below normal, according to the weather service, and a drought warning declared by New York on Nov. 15 for New York City and Westchester and Rockland counties remains in effect. Average precipitation for January is 3.21 inches, but only 1.68 was recorded last month. And so far February has seen only 0.02 inches.
For now, the lack of snow has made life simpler and cheaper for the people in charge of the region's roads and highways.
In New York, the uneventful winter could save $500,000 worth of sand and salt in the State Department of Transportation region that includes Westchester, Rockland and five counties to the north, estimated Joseph J. Gleeson, a regional highway maintenance engineer.
 
Some Play Catch-Up
 In Maywood, N.J., the superintendent of Public Works, Sam Pernetti, said he has saved not only money, but also time. "This mild winter means that we've had a chance to catch up on all the other work that tends to pile up, like trimming trees and getting lots of indoor painting done," he said. "You just can't complain."
Many officials, however, are wary about counting on savings. Yesterday, Connecticut's Transportation Commissioner, Emil H. Frankel, told the Legislature's Appropriations Committee that he was spending substantially less -- perhaps $3 million -- on snow removal compared with the year before.
But his staff was apprehensive, he said, because last year, amid Connecticut's budget crisis, the Legislature had cut his budget for salt and sand after a mild winter. Now, he said, "I fear the new base will be the winter of '92."
That fear isn't as strong in New York City, where snow removal is such a sensitive issue that the charter sets the snow budget -- currently $11.3 million -- at the average spending for the previous five years. This winter trucks have gone out just six times to plow snow or sand for ice, and $3.5 million is left in the budget, said Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the city's Sanitation Department.
 
Some Lose Out, Too
 This winter is also saving time and money for everyone who drives in snow or for those who clear their own sidewalk or driveway. But it has played havoc with small businesses that count on snow.
In Lodi, N.J., James J. Corcoran estimates that he has lost $20,000 in sales, repairs and service of snow-blowers at his Tri-County Power Equipment.
"The guy who tries to get his blower started, and can't get it working, normally he'll bring it in the next day for service," Mr. Corcoran said. "But not this winter, because the snow has melted away, and people put it off for the next time."
In Stamford, Conn., Ed Keough Jr., of Keough's Turn of River Hardware, said the weather has wiped out an entire reason for people to enter hardware stores. "One of the things we live on is small disasters," he explained.
"In a bad economy, with a very unseasonable winter, this has certainly affected us," Mr. Keough said. People aren't buying shovels, but they also aren't buying jumper cables, de-icing materials, windshield scrapers or anything else they might see while in the store. And his season is lost.
"If we get a really big storm, we'll sell some shovels," he said, "but we won't sell a lot of ice-melting products. You get into February, and people start thinking it will just go away on its own."

HEADLINE: Panel Pushes For Investing In the Future

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
A mayoral task force committee is calling for a sharp increase in the amount New York City spends on its economic future and a fundamental shift in the way those funds are invested.
The panel's report, which reflects a consensus in a group that includes real-estate developers, business executives and union leaders, argues that unless such changes are made in the city's policies, New York "will experience a painful, long-term economic decline." 
 The report, which has not yet been made public, is likely to be controversial since it includes proposals that are sure to delight and offend virtually all of the city's powerful interest groups. A main recommendation is the creation of an economic development bank that would be started with an initial $250 million in capital, to be matched by an equal amount from other public and state authorities.
Investments would be made in large, public projects like the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan and a biomedical center in the Bronx, as well as enhancements to the city's transportation and telecommunications systems.
Another recommendation calls for the city to give tax credits to companies that make charitable contributions to cultural institutions, libraries or parks.
The task force is also calling for financial help for small businesses and a renewal of recently expired tax incentives for real-estate development.
 
'Very Intriguing'
 Arthur Levitt Jr., the former head of the American Stock Exchange, who was chairman of the committee, stressed that the report was still in draft form and had not yet been endorsed by Mayor David N. Dinkins or the full management advisory task force. Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, who sat on the committee, said that at this stage the Mayor still had more questions than definitive reactions. Still, she said, the report contains some "very intriguing proposals."
In recommending the development bank, the panel is calling for the city to invest $500 million a year over the next five years. If that is done, it would represent a sharp increase over the $74 million in city, state and Federal funds spent on economic development in the last fiscal year, which ended on June 30.
The report suggests that the money for the development bank come from newly issued bonds, which would be repaid with revenues generated by the projects that would be built as a result of the bank's investments. While some committee members said they thought the amount committed to the bank would probably end up being reduced, the bank nonetheless would become the main vehicle for investments in public projects. By funneling the funds through a bank that is financed on a continuing basis, the hope is that those projects would no longer have to compete every year in annual budget wrangling with financing for drug-treatment programs or new homeless shelters. But that very insulation from the political process could invite problems with the City Council, which currently appropriates funds annually for the city's economic development initiatives.
Support for the bank is likely to depend on details that were not specified in the report, like who is appointed to oversee the bank's investments and which projects are chosen to receive funds.
 
Changes in Tax System
 The panel also calls for significant changes in the city's tax system. The group proposes that companies be allowed to credit a portion of the amount they contribute to the city's cultural institutions, libraries and parks against what they pay in commercial rent tax.
That tax, imposed on companies that rent space rather than own it, is singularly unpopular in the business community since New York is the only taxing authority to levy such a tax and since it amounts to a form of double-taxation. (Renters also pay some, if not all, of the property tax on their space because owners typically build it into their rental costs.)
Members of the panel estimate that, based on historical levels of charitable contributions and a ceiling on the total amount of credit that would be allowed, the city could lose $50 million to $70 million in tax revenues from this proposal, a shortfall that would have to be met in some other way at a time when the city is already struggling to meet demands on its budget.
The Levitt committee also proposes that the city permanently phase out the commercial rent tax and the unincorporated business tax, imposed on partnerships, beginning in 1994.
 
An Expired Program
 One surprising decision was the endorsement the group gave to reinstating the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, which expired on Dec. 31 and provided exemptions or deferrals for taxes levied on properties in certain areas of the city.
Virtually all of the committee members except Jerry Speyer of Tishman Speyer Properties, the real-estate developers, were said to have opposed the program's reinstatement, at least in part because they regarded it as useless when there was so little financing available for new construction.
Nevertheless, the report calls for the program to be maintained in the boroughs outside Manhattan and to be extended to outmoded buildings in lower Manhattan that need renovation to reduce their vacancy rates.
Committee members said they decided to give in on the real-estate incentive issue to secure Mr. Speyer's support for other parts of the report.
 
Micro-Loan Program
 If the group's proposals are put into effect, far more emphasis would be placed on small businesses as an important engine of growth. The report calls for a dramatic increase -- to $10 million from $1 million -- in the city's micro-loan program, which grants loans ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 to retail and service businesses. And it calls for the economic development bank to begin a venture-capital program through which the city would invest equity funds in promising new companies.
To address the problem of companies leaving the city because they cannot find enough skilled workers, the panel proposed that the city match dollar for dollar the money that companies spend hiring workers who go through training programs. Again, the source of the funds to pay for such a program was not specified in the draft report.
Despite the many details that would have to be worked out for these proposals to be adopted, the panel concludes that, if approved, their recommendations could all be put into effect within 12 months.
 
Members of Panel
 Besides Mr. Levitt, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero and Mr. Speyer, these are the committee members:
Roger Altman, Blackstone Group.
Peter Brennan, Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York.
Robert Catell, Brooklyn Union Gas Company.
Stanley Hill, District Council 37, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Richard Jalkut, New York Telephone Co.

PLEA BARGAIN IN ST. JOHN'S CASE
 The last defendant in the St. John's University sexual-assault case interrupted his trial to plead guilty to sharply reduced charges, then admitted that he had done virtually everything he had originally been accused of. The plea, in an emotional court session, brought to an end a case that had rocked the 19,000-student St. John's, the nation's largest Roman Catholic university, and emerged as one of a series of nationally publicized cases that underlined the legal elusiveness of charges of acquaintance sexual assault. B3.
 
PROFILE OF A SUSPECT
 The unemployed 23-year-old man charged with the brutal slashing murder of a Hasidic woman in Crown Heights had finished a six-year prison term for robbery in October, the authorities said. They added that on several occasions over the last eight months, the suspect, Romane LaFond, had assaulted women in similar but less violent incidents. B3.
 
A CALL FOR CHANGE
 A City University report calls for wide-ranging changes in the supervision of student-sponsored events at City College as a result of a deadly crush that killed nine people at a celebrity basketball game in December. The report also underlines criticism of the college's president, Dr. Bernard W. Harleston. B4.
 
PROTEST AT COLUMBIA
 In a day that hinted briefly at the turmoil of the 1960's, students at Columbia University blockaded doors to the adminstration building for two hours, forcing professors to remain inside, then scaled a wall and occupied an office to protest a plan to limit financial aid to needy students. B3.
 
REGION
 
OF JUSTICES AND JUSTICE
 A gubernatorial task force concluded that New York State's method of electing Supreme Court justices probably violates the Voting Rights Act because of its "uniformly poor" record of placing black, Hispanic and female lawyers on the bench. By warning that the state's judicial system would not survive a legal challenge, the report served as both a confession and a call for change. A1.
 
TEANECK OFFICER IS ACQUITTED
 An all-white jury acquitted Gary Spath, a white police officer from Teaneck, in the fatal shooting of Phillip Pannell, a black teen-ager, in April 1990. After deliberating for almost nine hours, the jury returned its verdict, finding the officer not guilty of manslaughter. A1.
 
HANGING ON AT CITY HALL
 For the seconde time in five days, Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City won a stay of a judge's order that he leave office immediately because of his conviction on Federal fraud charges. B5.
 
IT'S TOUGH BEING A COMMUTER
 The siege of the Ronkonkoma tow trucks started Monday, when railroad and township officials made good on a longstanding threat to tow away illegally parked cars that cover the lawns, block exit lanes and protrude haphazardly around the Ronkonkoma railroad station. But the officials got more drama than they bargained for. After 100 cars were towed on Monday, 80 commuters who returned Monday night in sub-freezing temperatures shouted, screamed and tried to storm an improvised impound yard to retrieve their vehicles.

HEADLINE: The Endless (1996) Campaign

 BODY:
What a difference a quadrennium makes: At this juncture in 1988, Iowans had been marinated in politics. Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, after stalking the state for months, had surely earned his narrow victory in the famous Iowa caucuses. Michael Dukakis and the other Democrats had probably shaken every hand twice. The early scrambling made it seem, as in every election since 1972, like an Endless Campaign.
Not this year. The Iowa caucuses, 1992-style, pumped up all the tension of a limp blimp. That's not meant to minimize Senator Tom Harkin's achievement. Even as a native son, he had to work to win 78 percent of the precinct delegates, a margin that reduced his rivals to reading very tiny tea leaves indeed. 
 For instance, with a straight face, former Senator Paul Tsongas issued a press release yesterday crowing that among the five Democrats, he had emerged as a surprising second in Iowa. Some second. He got 4 percent, compared with 12 percent for Undecided. And Senator Bob Kerrey, a native cousin from neighboring Nebraska, won only 2 percent. In any case, it took at least 15 percent to win any delegates.
Total delegates -- that provides one way to measure Senator Harkin's achievement. Even if he should capture all of Iowa's 57 delegates, that's not even 2 percent of the Democrats' 4,318 national total. Momentum offers a more important measure: Will the Iowa outcome affect the New Hampshire primary next Tuesday? Not much, to judge by reaction yesterday. Senator Harkin won only brief coverage on New Hampshire TV.
The deflation of the Iowa caucuses restores proportion to politics, truncating the Endless Campaign. Or does it? A lone political event brightened the noontime calendar in Des Moines Monday. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp came to speak at a Republican luncheon. Why? To help promote Republican turnout at the caucuses. Really? There was no Republican contest.
Considering that Mr. Kemp has run for President before, there may be another explanation, one that resurrects the word "endless" and includes the figures "1996."

HEADLINE: Industrial Policy as Sloppy Slogan

 BODY:
The Presidential candidates have turned industrial policy into a meaningless mantra. What they seem to mean is singling out high-tech industries for Federal assistance. But which industries?
Bob Kerrey wants to support "high-value-added" industry. Bill Clinton proposes steering production toward "high-wage" skills. Paul Tsongas calls for investing in "economically critical" industries. Even Pat Buchanan, conservative Republican, talks of targeted aid. 
 That all might sound smart; translated, it turns into superficial demagoguery. "High-value-added" would mean support for insurance underwriters and oil refineries. "High-wage" would require subsidies for certified public accountants. As for "economically critical," when Mr. Tsongas is asked if he means sugar and textiles, he won't say.
In other words, the candidates are all for helping whichever industries are hurting in whichever state has the next election. They are perverting the potential of industrial policy.
Competitive advantage is no longer reserved for countries blessed with abundant oil reserves or fertile soil. Competitiveness now often depends on a country's willingness to invest shrewdly in emerging technologies. Industrial policy is a way to square private risk-taking with public needs.
The idea is to put up a modest amount of Federal money to bolster private investors going after the next decade's technological winners. The challenge is to resist letting such funds degenerate into protection of the last decade's losers. No candidate has begun to meet that challenge.
The best case for a cautious industrial policy comes from Paul Krugman, an M.I.T. economist. He focuses on interdependence. In some industries, companies using specialized resources -- like highly trained computer programmers -- benefit by locating near one another. Proximity generates benefits well beyond what individual entrepreneurs could create alone. For example, Mr. Krugman cites Silicon Valley in California and the Italian fashion industry, centered in Milan.
The trick is to guess which future industry would throw off huge economy-wide benefits. Such guesses are often bound to be wrong, which is why Mr. Krugman is reluctant to bet more than a few billion dollars a year.
Lester Thurow, dean of M.I.T.'s management school, offers a sharper focus. He points to Europe, which has recently set up projects to spur investment in high-tech ventures like computer software and high-definition TV. These undertakings then invite partnerships of businesses and research institutions to bid for grants.
With reason, Mr. Thurow admires this approach. It artfully combines market and public incentives. Partners are required to put up half the cost of the investment, guaranteeing they won't squander public money.
A smart industrial policy need not put political calculations ahead of the market or stifle Congressional capacity to act in the public good. Money will flow only where private investors are willing to take risks. But the infusion of public money will spur a bit more risk-taking.
In short, a strong case can be made for a modest industrial policy. The wealthy U.S. can afford to risk a few billion dollars a year on good bets. What it cannot afford is for Presidential candidates to turn a good idea into a worthless slogan.

HEADLINE: Help Russia. Help Ourselves.

BYLINE: By Richard A. Gephardt; Richard A. Gephardt is House majority leader.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Beneath the veneer of competence, the Bush Administration's strategy toward the former Soviet Union is a dangerously ineffective response to the greatest democratic awakening and market-opening opportunity of the 20th century. Just as Americans recognize how the Administration has mismanaged the economy, they must now comprehend how its hesitant foreign policy jeopardizes our national security and economic interests.
Boris Yeltsin recently told Congressional leaders that Russia is "in a fight for survival" and had only three months to turn things around. Without more international aid, he said, there would be "an explosion." 
 What was our response? To date, the Administration has done precious little. Although Secretary of State James Baker is right to show the flag, accompanying a shipment of allied relief to Russia, we must not confuse symbolism with substance or meager aid for an actual commitment.
For all the hype, the U.S. assistance and commercial presence in the Commonwealth of Independent States is negligible, and most planned aid shipments will not reach those in need until spring. There appears to be no sense of urgency to negotiate protective agreements for American exporters or to change our tax, trade and export laws to expand business activity and create U.S. jobs. The day after Mr. Bush praised Mr. Yeltsin's efforts, he told Congress he would veto legislation permitting the export of telecommunications equipment to the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Japanese and European investment is ready to go full bore.
The Bush policy is, to quote the French politician Boulay de la Meurthe, "worse than a crime, it is a blunder." By failing to act, the U.S. may be locked out of the most important new market and source of raw materials of the 20th century. This is all the worse because we could easily take certain actions to help preserve this critical democratic experiment.
In the short term, we should be stepping up delivery of desperately needed food and medicine, while assisting in distribution, to help the people through the immediate crisis. We should get Saudi help in meeting the republics' energy requirements. And we should lead a Western effort to make the ruble convertible, a prerequisite for a stable market economy. Russia should be allowed to defer its $9 billion in 1992 interest payments owed to the Group of Seven countries. Finally, to monitor the nuclear disarmament, the Administration should press for prompt consideration of relevant portions of Start -- on verification, notification and information exchange.
In the long term, the U.S. must promote commercial ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States -- an effort that will produce jobs and rising living standards in all nations. That means providing preferential trade status, using our oil industry to develop commonwealth energy resources, exporting computers and telecommunications products and aiding U.S. business investment in Russia and the other republics. Every day of delay endangers democratization and market development as well as costing American jobs and profits that will otherwise end up in Japan or Europe.
I would happily join the President in supporting full American participation in a vigorous aid program -- financed solely by military cuts. For example, rather than spending $5.3 billion for Star Wars, as Mr. Bush has requested, we could preserve a strong program at $3.5 billion and use the savings for humanitarian aid and to contribute to the West's economic stabilization fund for the former Soviet Union.
Some say the moment is not right, that only appeals putting "America first" will be heard in these hard economic times. That's why Presidential leadership is so urgent and the offer of bipartisan support is so sincere. If we summon the idealism that enabled the Marshall Plan to succeed in the 1940's, it would mean American jobs and greater security in the 1990's, an outcome that sounds like "America first" to me.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Ad Campaign;
Tsongas: Disdain for Rivals' Plans

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

 BODY:
SCRIPT:
Narrator: "Some candidates want to give you a tax cut of 97 cents a day. But will that create jobs? One candidate knows it's gimmicks and bigger deficits that got us into this mess. Paul Tsongas offers straight answers. He'll declare an economic emergency immediately to get America moving: Get business to invest in new jobs and plants. Rebuild industry. And make our workers the most skilled and productive in the world."
"Paul Tsongas won't short-change our future. He'll LEAD American back."
 
ON THE SCREEN:
Slow motion of coins representing the 97 cents that Mr. Tsongas estimates the various tax-cut plans of his rivals would save the average family. Stills of an "out of business" sign, workers standing in unemployment lines. Video of a Tsongas speech. A final shot of coins with Mr. Tsongas's book "A Call to Economic Arms" landing on top. (30 seconds.)
 
 ACCURACY:
The message is essentially consistent with his performance in the Senate, when Mr. Tsongas was one of 11 senators who voted against the 1981 Reagan plan to cut taxes. Just before he left the Senate in 1984, he sponsored an amendment to freeze Government spending.
 
SCORECARD:
The ad extends the Tsongas campaign strategy of dismissing rival economic proposals, including President Bush's tax-cut plans, as "gimmicks" that will only worsen the economic slump. It emphasizes Mr. Tsongas's disdain for tax cuts and deficit spending, which he blames for the current economic malaise. Mr. Tsongas presents himself as strong enough to push through plans that, even though unpopular, would energize the economy.

HEADLINE: Our Haiti Policy Doesn't Help Anyone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Neither of the two components of United States policy toward Haiti, the embargo and the forced repatriation of refugees, is serving the goals of either country. The economic embargo (while well intentioned) has had no impact on changing the repressive political-military regime. Rather, it has produced a colossal economic, environmental and health disaster for Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, as you report in "Land and Health Also Erode in Haiti" (news article, Jan. 28).
The deforestation and soil erosion caused by the embargo will have repercussions for years, perhaps decades, and the famine it has caused is referred to in Haiti as "the curse." 
 Our refusal to accept the refugees fleeing the country is also in need of change. The Supreme Court, interpreting the law, has lifted the injunction against forced repatriation, making it clear that immigration laws must be altered. We are returning Haitians who risk their lives by boat to escape executions or beatings in their homes or on their streets for more of the same, while accepting Cubans who face no personal fear, but see increasing difficulties ahead.
This differing treatment is the result of: (1) a deep bias in our immigration law favoring anyone fleeing from any Communist country and particularly from Cuba; (2) the greater political influence of the United States-Cuban community compared with the Haitian community, and (3) the fact that the fleeing Haitians, who now number 15,000, are all black and may, in some unknown number of cases, have AIDS. Ironically, our embargo is itself a cause of the growth in the number of refugees we are forcing back. It is a vicious cycle that we are aggravating.
We need to change both policies now. The stranglehold of the military and the Tontons Macoutes cannot be lifted without some form of military intervention. It is too deeply ingrained and too powerful, even if a civilian regime may be temporarily installed. Intervention by a force under the direction of the Organization of American States or the United Nations will be needed, and a subsequent period of trusteeship required to establish democratic institutions and safeguard their emergence.
As for our asylum and refugee rules, the demise of the cold war should be reason enough to end the unequal and unfair application of basic principles of human rights. At a minimum, we should provide temporary protective status to the Haitians who are already here, as we are doing for the Chinese, so they are not forced to return until after the current political oppression and retributions end. We gave 125,000 Cubans permanent asylum when they fled in the Mariel boat lift of 1980 and gave 100,000 Nicaraguans asylum from the Sandinista Government in the 80's.
It is time we reviewed our asylum-refugee rules so they reflect the true risks faced by any individuals, fleeing any oppressive or brutal regime, no matter what the ideological bent of that regime, or the ethnicity of the refugees.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Democratic Race Grows Fiercer In Last Days in New Hampshire

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 11

 BODY:
Elbows were flying in the Democratic primary race today.
In a rough new phase of the New Hampshire campaign, there were sharp attacks, emotional radio and television ads, last-minute image shaping and in every camp a keen recognition that unpredictable New Hampshire was living up to its reputation as the days ticked down to the Feb. 18 primary. 
 Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who has watched his lead in the polls evaporate in the last four days amid accusations of marital infidelity in a supermarket tabloid and questions about his draft status during the Vietnam War, mounted a new television campaign intended to capitalize on his wounds by presenting him as populist martyr.
Drawing on a powerful theme in Southern politics, Mr. Clinton's advertisements plead with the voters, "Send a message to Washington and Wall Street and to the tabloids."
Looking straight into the camera, Mr. Clinton concludes: "This is your election, your economy, your country. Take it back."
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, meanwhile, was glowing with his new status as having an edge over Mr. Clinton in the New Hampshire polls. But he took the opportunity to reiterate his against-the-grain economic message, as the Democrat who calls for a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage long-term investment and rejects tax cuts for the middle class.
"My economic views are different," he said, campaigning here today, "not only from Governor Clinton's but from every other Democrat and from George Bush."
 
Harkin Uses Iowa Boost
 All of the candidates were scrambling to adjust to a shifting political reality: an electorate that seems to skitter among the candidates, searching for an answer to their recessionary woes, but still uneasy with a field of men who arrived late and are still trying to close the sale. "It's become a classic New Hampshire primary," said George Bruno, a former state Democratic chairman who is a supporter of Mr. Clinton. "In the end, it always tightens up, and the outcome is always unpredictable."
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, for instance, was touting the mandate from his native state as he flew back to New Hampshire today. Mr. Harkin captured 76.5 percent of the vote in Monday's caucuses, based on returns from 97 percent of the precincts. After brandishing hometown headlines about his success, and brushing aside the fact that his rivals largely ceded him the contest in his native state, Mr. Harkin immediately sought to reassert his theme that he is the unashamed, true-believing, orthodox Democrat in the race.
He did so, in part, with an attack on Mr. Tsongas. Mr. Harkin asserted that Mr. Tsongas was esssentially preaching Reaganomics. "I think his mindset is right where Reagan and Bush are," the Iowan said.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who is running close to Mr. Harkin in the polls in New Hampshire, was concentrating on boosting his Presidential image -- and the President he most preferred to be compared to was John F. Kennedy. Mr. Kerrey is trying to convert what many poll takers say is an undeveloped foundation of personal popularity into Presidential support. Today, he was campaigning on the steps of the Nashua City Hall, where Kennedy made his first campaign stop of the 1960 race and where a bust of the slain President was conveniently available for the television camera crews.
 
Week to Go, Work to Do
 Each candidate enters this final week with work to do. Mr. Clinton, who just a few weeks ago seemed to be on a glide path to the nomination, is struggling to steady his candidacy. He denied the accusations that he conducted a 12-year affair with a cabaret singer, and he denied other reports that he sought to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War. But amid the denials he lost control of his message that as a moderate Southerner he would restore "the forgotten middle class" and lead an economic revival.
This week, he plans a broadcast counterattack: In addition to the 30-second spots, the Clinton campaign is buying half-hour slots on Manchester and Boston television stations for a call-in show in which viewers can ask the Governor questions. The campaign is also running radio commercials in which a Vietnam veteran defends Mr. Clinton's record."
 
Showing Tougher Sides
 Mr. Harkin reveled in the chance today to look like a winner; one of his challenges is to persuade many Democrats that his plea to return to traditional party values is a message that can win. Trying to capitalize on whatever life he could get from the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Harkin argued that they showed the resounding approval of "the people who know me the best."
In a sign of the sharpening tone of this campaign, Mr. Harkin, perhaps the most aggressive campaigner in the field, came back tough when a reporter asked about Mr. Clinton's "latest problem." Mr. Harkin replied, "What's the latest one? I've been out in Iowa; I might have missed it."
And Mr. Kerrey's campaign has been urging people to focus on a candidate's ability to be elected, arguing that this is no longer Mr. Clinton's strong point.
Still, Mr. Kerrey was trying to float above the fray -- not a bad place to be when a multi-candidate field is fully engaged. The Senator from Nebraska, who is trying to cross the bridge from interesting politician to potential President, returned to the theme of generational change today -- a theme that Gary Hart worked with considerable success here in 1984.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, meanwhile, was on television tonight with a 30-minute program urging voters to back a grassroots movement to rid politics of the influence special-interest money.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 13, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption yesterday about Senator Tom Harkin's arrival in New Hampshire from Iowa misidentified the woman with him. She was State Representative Mary Chambers of New Hampshire, not Mr. Harkin's wife. The reference to Mrs. Harkin was also incorrect; her name is Ruth, not Judy.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
U.S. Network Is Planned For Cellular

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The GTE Corporation and three regional Bell companies have announced plans to form a nationwide mobile telephone network that customers could use to send and receive cellular calls anywhere in the country.
Industry analysts said the move, announced Monday, appeared to be an attempt to play catch-up with McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., which, with 1.3 million subscribers, is the nation's largest cellular company. McCaw announced plans last fall to link its system with that of the Southwestern Bell Corporation to form the nationwide Cellular One service. 
 The new GTE-led service will link the local cellular systems operated by GTE, the Nynex Corporation, Ameritech Inc. and the Bell Atlantic Corporation. In a bid to build brand loyalty, the companies also plan to promote their local systems under a common name and to adopt common technical and quality standards. The common name has not yet been chosen.
"We are heading more and more into the information age, where you need accessibility to data and knowledge and mobility," Paul G. Kozlowski, president of GTE Mobile Communications, said in an interview.
 
A Need for Customer Loyalty
 Industry analysts said the move by GTE and the three "Baby Bells" reflected the growing pressure on cellular companies to build loyalty among their subscribers, now that the once-soaring growth of cellular communications has begun to level out.
Cellular customers have long been able to make calls from outside their normal calling areas, thanks to what are known as "roaming" agreements between cellular systems in different markets. But until recently, they could receive calls in cities outside their primary area only if they punched in a special code that informed the nearby cellular system that they were in the area. And someone trying to reach that customer would have to know what city the person was in, as well as knowing the special access number.
 
Easy as a Long-Distance Call
 As envisioned by both the McCaw and GTE ventures, a customer's cellular telephone would automatically inform the local cellular system of the subscriber's presence. The cellular system would also automatically ascertain which cellular company the customer used and whether the person subscribed to special features like voice mail. The local networks would then work together to patch through calls automatically, as easily as wired telephone networks pass along long-distance calls.
With Nynex joining the GTE venture, and McCaw Cellular already serving New York City through its LIN Broadcasting unit, consumers in New York will soon be able to choose between two companies that offer nationwide mobile telephone services.
Jonathan Tarlin, an analyst with Economic and Management Consultants International in Washington, which specializes in mobile communications, said a key to success for cellular companies in coming years would be to hold on to high-volume subscribers who run up big bills and would be likely to use a nationwide service.
Mr. Tarlin estimated that the number of cellular subscribers increased by 35 percent in 1991, to 7.3 million, but that newer subscribers were increasingly those who use their phones very little. As a result, the average monthly bill for subscribers has plunged from about $130 in 1987 to about $80 today.
Analysts also noted that the pace of change in the cellular business was now being set by McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash., a company outside the traditional telephone industry.
Under rules set up when cellular franchises were first awarded in the 1980's, local telephone companies in each city automatically received one of two licenses to operate cellular telephone service. Under that arrangement, the so-called non-wireline franchises, owned by the non-telephone companies like McCaw, initially seemed less formidable competitors than such "wireline" companies as GTE and the regional Bell companies.
"I think this shows that the wireline companies are now recognizing the advantages of having nationwide name identification," said Michael R. Vernetti, a senior vice president at Telocator Inc., a Washington-based trade association for the cellular and paging industries.

HEADLINE: Student Shot In Hallway Of a School

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
A 16-year-old student described as the principal's protege at Park West High School in the Clinton section of Manhattan was shot in the left ankle yesterday as he walked in a school hallway to his third-period class.
The student, Wilfredo Vega, was listed in stable condition at St. Vincent's Hospital, where he was taken after the shooting. The incident occurred shortly after 10 A.M. in a fourth-floor hallway filled with students changing classes. 
 There have been about 40 incidents involving firearms this school year in the New York public schools. Ten students have been shot, four fatally. Two teachers have been wounded.
The teen-ager was struck once by a bullet from a small-caliber pistol. The police said they had no suspects or motives.
The school's principal, Richard A. Ross, said a serious incident had not taken place in the school, on 50th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, during the three and a half years he has been there. He said the shooting was particularly troubling to him because the hard-working 11th grader had become like one of his own children.
"I've never found a Wil before, not in 25 years," Mr. Ross said. "This is a kid who is such a good and decent person. He has been to my house. My children love him. Now I've got to explain to my 12-year-old daughter that Wilfredo is shot."
As the principal spoke, his voice broke and his eyes welled with tears, and he briefly left his office to compose himself.
 
The Ingredients of Success
 In Wilfredo, Mr. Ross said, he found the ingredients of success waiting to be inspired in a youth from a poor family in the South Bronx. His father is unemployed and his mother is chronically ill, Mr. Ross said.
The principal said he had found the student a job in the mailroom at a Manhattan advertising agency, and had employed his father for one year in the school cafeteria before he was forced to dismiss him when he failed to report for work.
The shooting stunned teachers and students at Park West, which in recent years has struggled to transform itself from a place of violence and fear to one of relative calm. Several years ago, school officials said, students often carried weapons, assaults and robberies were commonplace, and there were many requests for transfers because of fear.
Mr. Ross said he had first met Wilfredo more than a year ago when he stopped to check the student's report card as he was waiting at a school elevator. The youth had decided to attend Park West High, a school with 2,000 students, because of its culinary arts program, one of several offerings that attract students from throughout the city.
Mr. Ross said he sensed a winner in the would-be chef and restaurant owner. "He is a decent, loving and warm human being," he said.
He said Wilfredo's parents were so impressed with the school that they enrolled their second son, a ninth grader. Mr. Ross said he had got to know Wilfredo's family, including his brother and a sister in the seventh grade. Mr. Ross said he was having difficulty making sense out of the seemingly random act of violence.
Outside his brother's hospital room yesterday, 14-year-old Manny Vega said his older brother did not see who shot him and did not hear any fighting before he was hit. Inside the room, Wilfredo was sitting up in bed, alert and listening to a portable radio.
"He heard gunshots as he was walking and he started running, then he heard another shot and he said it felt like a rock had hit his ankle," his brother said. "He looked down and saw that he was shot."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the shooting of a student at Park West High School in Manhattan misstated statistics on shootings at New York City public schools since September and omitted their source. According to the United Federation of Teachers, 44 shootings have occurred in and near schools (not solely in them). Twelve students were shot (not 10), two fatally (not four). The Board of Education disputes the union's figures, reporting fewer than a dozen shootings in and near schools.

HEADLINE: Suspect in Crown Heights Killing Was Released From Prison in October

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Several times over the last seven months, the unemployed 23-year-old man charged in the stabbing murder of a Hasidic woman in Crown Heights entered homes or assaulted women in similar but less violent incidents, according to the police and allegations by neighbors.
Leah Kopel, 35, who lives near the man, Romane LaFond, on President Street said in an interview yesterday that he followed her 4-year-old son into her living room with a screwdriver in his hand last August and asked for water. Mrs. Kopel said she escorted him out. Twenty minutes later, she said, he returned and tried to knock down the door. 
 Mrs. Kopel said that a week earlier Mr. LaFond had entered the home of an acquaintance of hers and had begun choking her, but the woman did not report the incident to the police.
And the police said the arrest of Mr. LaFond in the slaying of Phyllis Lapine last Thursday was tied to another unsolved case of the sexual assault of a Hasidic woman in December.
Mrs. Lapine, a mother of four, was found dead in her home on Lefferts Avenue with more than 30 stab wounds.
The killing briefly revived the tensions that had flared in the racially troubled neighborhood last August after a black child was killed by a Hasidic driver in a car accident and an Australian rabbinical student was stabbed to death by a mob of black youths. On Thursday night Hasidim demonstrating for more police protection were hit by bottles thrown from apartment buildings and some of the demonstrators responded with shouts of "go back to Africa!"
 
Captain Recalls Another Case
 Mr. LaFond was arraigned yesterday at Criminal Court in Brooklyn on two counts of second-degree murder, burglary and criminal possession of a weapon in what Jon L. Besumder, a Brooklyn assistant district attorney, called "the most heinous crime in recent years in this county." Mr. LaFond stood listening quietly. He was ordered held without bail.
His defense attorney, Samuel Gregory, argued that no witnesses had actually seen Mr. LaFond entering or leaving the Lapine residence and that his presence "shouldn't be unusual at all because he lives in the neighborhood."
The police said Mr. Lafond's arrest was helped by cooperation from blacks and Hasidim in Crown Heights. "Everybody we spoke to -- that would be everybody -- was upset, and they told us what they knew," Chief of Detectives Joseph R. Borelli said.
One of the breaks in the case, an official close to the investigation said, came when Capt. Anthony Marra, the executive officer of the 71st Precinct in Crown Heights, who read each day's complaints, remembered the December case.
He checked the record and found the incident on Dec. 26 in which a man had entered a Hasidic woman's home several blocks from the Lapine residence and sexually assaulted her in front of her three children, pulling down her pants and fondling her.
Captain Marra learned the case had not been solved and told detectives that it "resembled in some detail what had happened at the murder scene." Two other officers from the precinct, Carolyn Taylor and Albert Valdez, recalled that they had made an arrest of a man in August in a similar crime -- Mr. LaFond.
The police went back to the December assault victim and she identified Mr. LaFond's picture. On Sunday he was arrested in the December assault, and detectives were able to match his fingerprints to a bloody palmprint found in the Lapine household, the police said.
After he was taken into custody, Mr. LaFond was identified in a police lineup by neighbors of Mrs. Lapine who said he had been going up and down their street on the day of the slaying, handing out his telephone number and asking for work as a handyman.
 
Defense Argument
 At his home at 1625 President Street, a rundown apartment building with litter in the hallways, Mr. LaFond's neighbors described him as a loner who often muttered and talked to himself. Paul Comeau, who lives in the building, said he would take the young man out on moving jobs or construction work with him to give him something to do.
"I knew he was up to trouble, but I never asked him about it," he said, adding that he was shocked by the murder charge. "Everyone says he's crazy, but I say no. He's just not educated and he needs something to do."
Linda Alexander, another neighbor who said she had watched Mr. LaFond grow up, said: "He rambles. I think he has a mental problem."
Mr. Lafond's criminal record began in October 1985 when at age 17 he was convicted of robbery and sentenced to two to six years in prison. State prison officials said he was transferred frequently throughout the prison system because he had adjustment problems and had to be separated from other prisoners. From May 1988 to July 1988, he underwent psychiatric examination.
 
Parole Violations
 He was denied parole three times, said David Ernst, a spokesman for the New York State Division of Parole. When he had served the maximum time under a state law that reduces sentences for good behavior, he was released in December 1989. But he promptly violated his parole and was put back in prison until last April 18.
In less than four months, police and neighbors said, he was in trouble again and complaining that he could not find work. On Aug. 1, he was arrested and charged with possession of burglary tools, and on Aug. 15, he was arrested again and charged with possession of burglary tools. In the first case, he received a conditional discharge on Oct. 16. The second case is still pending, said Patrick Clark, a spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney. Mr. Ernst said Mr. LaFond was arrested again for a parole violation at the end of August and held until his sentence expired on Oct. 31.
Although Mr. LaFond was returned to prison for parole violations after the August arrests, he gained his release at the end of October because his original prison term had ended and the burglary cases had not produced a felony conviction, Mr. Ernst said.
One of the cases was still pending, and it seemed to weigh on Mr. LaFond's mind.
On Wednesday, the day before the police say he killed Mrs. Lapine, Mr. LaFond returned to Mrs. Kopel's home, where she was working in her garden, she said. He told her he was worried that he would be returned to prison because of his encounter with her in August. "If they keep this misdemeanor on my record, I'll go back to jail," she said he told her. "I want you to talk to my lawyer."
She said she gave him her phone number to give to his lawyer, and he left.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Bush's Life-Long Credo: Low Capital Gains Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
In his State of the Union Message, President Bush covered the gamut of domestic policy issues -- education and welfare, housing and health, crime and energy and trade.
 For the most part, the treatment seemed perfunctory. "We must do something about crime and drugs," he said at one point, without saying what he had in mind to do. "I ask you tonight to fund our H.O.P.E. housing proposal," he said at another. 
But on one issue, he seemed truly exercised. "This time, at this hour," he said, "I cannot take 'no' for an answer: You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country."
 Why is it that when George Bush talks about being the education President or the environment President or about rewriting the banking laws or dealing with energy conservation or handling a host of other economic and social issues, his words often seem to ring so hollow? And why, when he talks about capital gains, does he almost always seem engaged, even passionate?
 The answer may be that support of a low tax rate on capital gains, which are the profits from the sale of investments, is a lifelong credo of Mr. Bush's. This is not a stance like opposition to abortion that he began to stress late in life or one like nuclear disarmament that reflects his response to a changed world.
 In the Wall Street-Greenwich-Andover-Yale milieu of his youth and the Texas oil country where he first went into business, it was written in stone that people with capital should be free to develop it with a minimum of interference from the Government in the way of taxes.
 As a politician, Mr. Bush has tried to placate the two factions of the Republican Party -- the white shoe, Wall Street, Chamber of Commerce, Dewey wing of his youth and the supply-side, Sun Belt, Hoover Institution, Reagan wing of his Vice Presidency and Presidency. On many topics, the two wings are at odds. One dogma they have in common is advocacy of a lower capital gains tax.
 This is one of the few matters on which Mr. Bush has taken political risk as President. Two years ago, negotiating with Congress on the budget, he held out for a capital gains cut long after it was politically wise for him to do so and left himself open to charges by Democrats that he was simply the patron of fat cats.
 Back then, Mr. Bush was proposing that the top capital gains rate be lowered to 19.6 percent from 28 percent. This year, he is going even further. He would reduce the rate to 15.4 percent, the lowest level since 1933.
 Such a cut, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told Congress last week, would "generate substantial income and revenues to the Government, create growth for jobs investment, unleash a torrent of activity."
 Michael J. Boskin, chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, figures that economic growth would be more than $30 billion greater each year than it would be otherwise, and that could mean millions more jobs.
 The problem is, for all the evidence Mr. Brady and Mr. Boskin can muster, their Democratic opponents can counter with data showing that a capital gains cut would be little more than a windfall for the rich.
 Mr. Bush observed, for instance, that 60 percent of taxpayers who claim capital gains have incomes below $50,000. But Congressional economists found that 52 percent of the tax savings would be enjoyed by taxpayers with incomes above $200,000 and that 70 percent would go to those with incomes above $100,000.
This week, Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-sponsored organization that specializes in tax research and analysis, published figures showing that the economy faltered after the last two capital gains reductions, in 1978 and 1981, but boomed after the tax was increased in 1976 and 1986.
 Neither side can prove its case conclusively. Few would argue that the rate of capital gains taxation was the main reason the economy grew or contracted at a particular time. Investment decisions depend much more, for instance, on market conditions, real estate prices and enticing new opportunities than they do on the rate of capital gains taxation.
 But the lack of hard evidence one way or another does not prevent the President's political opponents from accusing him of supporting a tax giveaway to the wealthy.
 And it does not stop George Bush from advocating a deep cut in the capital gains tax as an article of faith.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
Clinton Thanked Colonel in '69 For 'Saving Me From the Draft'

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 12

 BODY:
Trying to prevent further damage to his Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton made public today a 1969 letter in which he thanked an Army officer overseeing the Reserve Officers Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas for "saving me from the draft" and also apologized for misleading the officer about the strength of his anti-war feelings.
At a news conference here, the Arkansas Governor said he was issuing the letter, dated Dec. 3, 1969, because he knew it was to be disclosed later today by ABC News. 
 The unexpected development came as Mr. Clinton, whose campaign has been disrupted by accusations that he had an extended extramarital affair with a cabaret singer and manipulated his draft status, was trying to shake free of personal controversy and focus attention on his economic program.
 
Opponents on the Attack
 With the voting in the New Hampshire primary set for Tuesday, Mr. Clinton's Democratic opponents are shedding their reluctance to take advantage of his trouble. Today they adopted the theme that whatever the truth of the accusations, they created a cloud of doubt that detracts from Mr. Clinton's value as a Democratic Presidential nominee.
Mr. Clinton wrote the 1969 letter to Col. Eugene Holmes of the Army to explain why he had decided not to join the university's R.O.T.C. program. When Mr. Clinton agreed to join the program, Colonel Holmes requested that Mr. Clinton be reclassified from 1-A, immediately eligible for the draft, to 1-D, the category for men who joined the reserves or student R.O.T.C. units
In the letter, Mr. Clinton described what he said today was a snapshot of that generation's feelings. The letter shows that the candidate, like thousands of men in his generation, actually opposed both the war and the draft and viewed the R.O.T.C. program mainly as a way of staying out of combat without breaking the law. [Text of letter, page A25.]
In tones of moral anguish, Mr. Clinton wrote about his role in organizing anti-war rallies in the United States and Britain, where he was studying in 1969 as a Rhodes Scholar. He stated that he admired friends who had defied the Selective Service law, but did not want to break the law himself and damage his career and "political viability."
"First, I want to thank you, not just for saving me from the draft, but for being so kind and decent to me last summer, when I was as low as I have ever been," Mr. Clinton wrote.
"One thing which made the bond we struck in good faith somewhat palatable to me was my high regard for you personally," Mr. Clinton wrote. "In retrospect, it seems that the admiration might not have been mutual had you known a little more about me, about my political beliefs and activities. At least you might have thought me more fit for the draft than for R.O.T.C."
Last week, fending off questions about his draft deferment, Mr. Clinton said, "You've got to understand that if you look at the facts as they then existed, instead of some 23-year-later rewrite, the facts are, I put myself into the draft, I didn't take it out."
 
Issue Is Revived
 The question of Mr. Clinton's draft status was revived as an issue last Thursday when The Wall Street Journal reported that in 1969 Mr. Clinton secured a draft deferment by promising to join the R.O.T.C. program supervised by Colonel Holmes and enroll in the University of Arkansas Law School. Instead, he attended Oxford University for a second year then went to law school at Yale University.
Mr. Clinton admitted last week that he had done that, but denied any intention to mislead Colonel Holmes or the local draft board in his hometown, Hope, Ark. He also insisted that he had acted in good faith and later asked to have his R.O.T.C. deferment revoked because he felt a moral obligation to submit to the draft. "I had four of my high school classmates killed in Vietnam," he explained last week, "and I just didn't feel right about it."
The letter released today showed that Mr. Clinton actually signed a letter of intent to join the R.O.T.C., rather than simply making a verbal promise. It also suggested that he knew he was misleading Colonel Holmes about true feelings about the war and the Army when the two men had talked during the summer of 1969. In the letter he wrote of "loathing the military to which you and other good man have devoted years." Colonel Holmes has not been available for comment on the letter.
It was a time of growing discontent with the war, with President Nixon and, at times, with authority. College students and many Democratic politicians worked that year to fan such sentiments. A high point came on Oct. 16 when millions of Americans across a broad spectrum of society wore black armbands, held prayer vigils, chanted at rallies and stayed away from classes or jobs in a protest they called the Vietnam Moratorium.
 
'No Interest in R.O.T.C.'
 "After I signed the R.O.T.C. letter of intent," he continued in the letter, "I began to wonder whether the compromise I had made with myself was not more objectionable than the draft would have been, because I had no interest in the R.O.T.C. program in itself and all I seemed to have done was to protect myself from physical harm.
"Also, I began to think I had deceived you, not by lies -- there were none -- but by failing to tell you all the things I'm writing now. I doubt that I had the mental coherence to articulate them then."
Mr. Clinton went on to describe how his moral torment kept him from sleeping and how on Sept. 12, 1969, he wrote but never mailed a letter telling his draft board to re-classify him as 1-A. He added, "I didn't mail the letter because I didn't see, in the end, how my going in the Army and maybe going to Vietnam would achieve anything except a feeling that I had punished myself and gotten what I deserved."
On Oct. 31, 1969, Colonel Holmes had him re-classified after being told by Mr. Clinton that he would not attend the University of Arkansas. But by that time, Mr. Clinton had been exempted during September and October, when according to The Wall Street Journal he had been informed by the local draft board that he faced the greatest chance of being drafted.
 
Sequence Seen as Chance
 On Sept. 19, 1969, President Nixon announced a 50,000-man reduction in the draft call for the rest of the year and ruled that the October draft call of 29,000 would be spaced out over the final three months of the year. On Dec. 1, 1969, the draft lottery was held and Mr. Clinton drew the number 311, meaning he was no longer in jeopardy. Mr. Clinton said today that he "presumed" he must have known about the lottery drawing when he wrote the letter to Colonel Holmes.
Appearing on the ABC News program "Nightline," tonight, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that his draft lottery number had been drawn on Dec. 1, that he had sent in an application to law school at Yale University on Dec. 2 and that he had written the letter to Colonel Holmes on Dec. 3.
But he denied that the sequence of his actions implied that he was by then confident that he had escaped the draft. Mr. Clinton also emphasized that at his deferment had been revoked and that he had been returned to the draft pool several weeks before the December actions. He added that the two people most directly involved in the change of his deferment were his stepfather and the head of his draft board, both now dead.
Also on "Nightline," Mr. Clinton added that he was seeking to get past the "cloud" which has all but obscured the economic message he said he was trying to send to New Hampshire voters.
"For three weeks, of course I've had some problems in the polls," he said. "All I've been asked about by the press is a woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge."
 
Trying to Broaden Question
 Mr. Clinton also sought to broaden the question of character that has been raised by the accusations by noting that Dick Cheney, the Secretary of Defense had not served in the military and assailing President Bush for advocating a cut in the capital gains tax.
"If we're going to talk about 22 years ago, let's talk about my whole record as Governor, my demonsrations of character, my fitness to lead and compare to that kind of issue I think is very important too," he said.
The Clinton campaign also unveiled a new television commercial in New Hampshire tonight in which they seek to undermine the credibility of all the accusations against him by saying that the cabaret singer, Gennifer Flowers, was paid for her story and by blaming Republicans for the series of damaging disclosures.
At New Hampshire appearances earlier in the day in Claremont and Dover and on the ABC appearance last night, Mr. Clinton vowed to "fight like hell" to continue his campaign.
But the renewal of the questions about how Mr. Clinton handled his draft status added to the confused state of the contest in the nation's first Presidential primary.
"Jeez, another one," said Mr. Harkin, a former Navy pilot, in reference to the latest controversy. "I think voters should be concerned about his veracity and character. Listen, if someone wanted to serve in the military at that time, they could have served."
"Oh, God, please, not another one," said Senator Bob Kerrey, who lost part of a leg and won the Medal of Honor in combat in Vietnam. He has previously questioned the honesty of Mr. Clinton's dealings with the draft, but said he had no direct comment today.
But Mr. Clinton said today: "We've heard a lot in this campaign about the character issue. Well, character is an important issue, and so is patriotism. But this is not about my patriotism. I supported the Persian Gulf war because I thought it was right and in our national interest, just as I opposed the Vietnam War because I thought it was wrong and not in our national interest. And I still think I was right. The real character issue and the real patriotism issue in this election is who has a vision for the country, a plan for the future, and the ability to get it done."
Mr. Clinton also said today he letter had come to his attention again when his campaign director got a call from Ted Koppel, the host of "Nightline." "Ted Koppel told my campaign manager, David Wilhelm, the letter came from the Pentagon," said Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton said he obtained the text of the letter from ABC News.
The Pentagon denied a role in the disclosure. "It clearly was not the Pentagon that provided the letter in question," said Maj. Stephen Little of the Marine Corps, a Defense Department spokesman.
Mr. Koppel also said the source had contacted his program today to deny being connected with the Pentagon. The evening news program reported the letter tonight and said one of the program's sources was Col. Clinton Jones, a former Arkansas R.O.T.C. officer.
In response to the accusations from the Clinton campaign that there was a political motivation to the disclosure, Victoria Clarke, press secretary to the Bush campaign, said, "Every time they have a problem, they start whining, they start crying, they start blaming us."

HEADLINE: NASA CHIEF QUITS IN POLICY CONFLICT

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Richard H. Truly, announced his resignation yesterday after a long and often losing battle with the White House over the direction of the nation's space program. Adminstration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Truly had been forced to step down.
Mr. Truly, a space pioneer and former astronaut, was chosen to head NASA after the Challenger disaster in January 1986 to try to get the space agency back on its feet. His resignation comes as the agency again faces an uncertain future. 
 The Administration officials said his departure was prompted by mounting friction with the White House over basic policy issues. The White House opposed building more shuttles, wanted to entertain radical ideas for space exploration and sought to scale back plans for huge science projects meant to expand the frontiers of knowledge. These and other initiatives were general resisted by Mr. Truly and the space agency.
 
He Says He Didn't Have Choice
 "Frankly it wasn't what I had planned," Mr. Truly said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "It's a situation where the President decided to make a change."
A high NASA official said of the resignation, "This has been in the mill for months."
President Bush said yesterday that the search for a new space agency administrator had begun and that the resignation of Mr. Truly had been accepted regretfully.
NASA said Mr. Truly would remain on the job until April 1. But the agency now finds itself somewhat adrift and with a leadership vacuum. The deputy administrator's slot has been empty since late last year when J. R. Thompson resigned for what he said were personal reasons.
The space agency is at a turning point, most space experts agree. The end of the cold war has diminished its original mission of trying to get a technological upper hand on the Soviets. And a bruising battle in Congress last year to secure financing for the agency's planned $30 billion space station is expected to flare again this year. Some lawmakers who supported the financing last year recently voiced doubts about continuing money for the project in light of the recession and continuing Federal budget deficits.
Most important, the resignation comes just as the agency is set to go before Congress to justify a request for an increase in its budget of about 4 percent for the next fiscal year. That would put the agency's annual budget up to $15 billion.
"It's a bad year to bail out and a bad time of year to bail out because it's right at the beginning of the budget cycle," said John E. Pike, head of space policy for the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington.
A NASA official conceded that it's not a good time for the resignation but added that "Dick will do everything he can to help us get things squared away" before he leaves.
The tenure of Mr. Truly, 55 years old, a retired Navy admiral and the first former astronaut to head the space agency, was marked by two key successes. The agency recovered from the Challenger disaster, having now flown 20 successful missions with the nation's fleet of winged spaceships since then. And it began getting large budget increases for the space station, the centerpiece of the agency's plans.
But the agency also suffered severe setbacks in Mr. Truly's tenure, including bad publicity over repeated launching delays, shuttles that leaked fuel, the discovery of a flawed mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope and, most recently, a stuck antenna that threatens to cut back dramatically on the scientific payoff from the $1.4 billion Galileo spacecraft now on the way to Jupiter.
"Admiral Truly is a good man who did a good job under difficult circumstances," said Senator Al Gore, head of a Senate subcommittee on space. "He leaves with the respect of everyone who worked with him at NASA and in Congress."
A space pioneer, Mr. Truly flew on two early space shuttle missions, including the second flight, in 1981, and became head of the shuttle program shortly after the Challenger explosion, in which seven astronauts died. He is widely credited with getting the space program back on its feet. Under his direction, the shuttles underwent a $2 billion repair program and began flying again in 1988, so far with no in-flight emergencies.
 
Conflict Occurred Early
 Mr. Truly became Administrator in July 1989 and almost immediately fell into conflict with the White House and its National Space Council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle. The council openly and repeatedly criticized NASA programs for taking too long and costing too much and called on the space agency to get new ideas and new technology from universities, Federal laboratories and private business.
The space agency often resisted, with Mr. Truly occasionally taking his opposition public.
Dr. John M. Logsdon, a space policy analyst at George Washington University, said yesterday that Mr. Truly was "a man of high integrity who fought hard for his vision of what was good for the space program."
But Dr. Logsdon added, "That view was not shared by the White House and was not, in my view, an appropriate approach to putting together a space program for the 1990's and beyond."
Basically, he said, Mr. Truly placed central emphasis on the winged spaceships, which he had piloted, at a time when the nation needed to move toward new alternatives.
 
Outside Vision Sought
 Mr. Truly's conflicts with the White House included whether outside agencies and experts were needed to help set the nation's space agenda. For instance, the White House became interested in ideas for inflatable space stations space ships, which would cost far less than the rigid metallic structures sought by the space agency.
In 1990, the White House began actively reaching beyond NASA in a search for new ways to advance the nation's manned space program, challenging a near monopoly the agency had held for more than three decades.
In another conflict, the space agency fought bitterly and hard for a huge a series of orbiting platforms, the Earth Observing System, that would carry instruments to study environmental changes in the atmosphere and on earth. But the White House wanted the proposed $30 billion system in smaller pieces to reduce the risk of failure, allow flexibility to change the program in midcourse and possibly send some instruments aloft earlier than first planned.
After many battles, often waged with panels of outside experts, the White House won.
Neither the space agency nor the White House gave a reason for Mr. Truly's resignation. But agency officials said the White House asked Mr. Truly to subject a letter of resignation, which he did on Monday, with Mr. Bush accepting it yesterday,
In a statement, Mr. Bush praised Mr. Truly as a strong leader in during a troublesome time.
"It was under Dick Truly's able leadership and steady hand that NASA was able to rebuild the space shuttle program and return it to safe operation in 1988," he said. "The nation owes Admiral Truly a great debt of gratitude."
Mr. Truly, born in Fayette, Miss., on Nov. 12, 1937, is the eighth administrator of the space agency.

HEADLINE: To Republicans' Ire, Bush's Tax Package Advances in House

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Insisting that all they wanted to do was cooperate with President Bush, House Democrats today sent a package of all his tax proposals to the floor, where they expect it to die.
Then they ended a snarling open meeting with Republicans, who were angry at the sight of the Democratic majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, introducing what he said was Mr. Bush's program. After that the Democrats went behind closed doors to check with their leaders and start working out their own alternative, which will focus on a tax cut for the middle class. 
 The open meeting had the atmosphere of a schoolchildren's game. Not musical chairs, where you try to leave opponents looking lost. Not dodge ball, where you try to make them look clumsy. But Congressional tax writing, where the object is to make the other guys sound as if they support the recession or like the rich.
By sending the "Gephardt-Bush" measure to the full House, the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee hoped to kill it and embarrass Republicans at the same time. That is because it would require a vote on all of President Bush's tax proposals at once. It includes measures he or House Republicans would rather forget about, like taxing annuities and imposing Medicare taxes on Government employees, or at least put off, like a $500 increase in the personal exemption for children or making student loan interest tax deductible -- both of which could require a tax increase for high-income people.
Besides the bill acted on today, the House will vote late this month on the unformed Democratic alternative and on the narrower Administration proposal centered on reducing the tax on capital gains, which Mr. Bush calls the heart of his economic plan.
Those partisan votes will have almost nothing to do with any eventual action on a tax law to stimulate growth. Serious efforts to compromise on a tax bill that would be acceptable to the majority of lawmakers and to Mr. Bush will await action in the Senate or in a House-Senate conference.
Today each side accused the other of putting political motives before the national interest. "Obstacles and obfuscation," complained Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the committee's senior Republican. "Sham!" He said Democrats wanted to delay economic recovery and thus embarrass the President.
Representative Brian Donnelly, Democrat of Massachusetts, professed himself "absolutely dismayed" that Mr. Bush's eloquent calls for middle-class tax relief were not a part of the smaller package that Mr. Archer advocated.
Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., Democrat of Indiana, scoffed that "hell hath no fury" like "a political speech taken seriously."
About the only thing missing was an appeal to the teacher that the other kids were being partisan.
The committee's Democratic majority defeated Mr. Archer's attempt to substitute the smaller "fast-track bill" that includes the cut in the capital gains tax.
But they offered him a chance to try again, urging the Rules Committee to let him offer the smaller package as a substitute on the House floor. When he asked if he could change this proposal after he has seen the Democratic measure, he was rebuffed. "That just starts a bidding war," said Representative Sam Gibbons of Florida, who had the votes.
 
Comments in the Senate
 The call for quick action on a small package was also heard on the other side of Capitol Hill today. "Surely these few changes can be enacted now," Nicholas F. Brady, Secretary of the Treasury, told the Senate Finance Committee.
If that happened, suggested Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, consumer confidence might rise. "It would be helpful," he said, "if the public could see that its institutions of government, faced with an obvious challenge, could rise to it and get the job done properly and promptly."
The committee's action was quickly condemned by President Bush and his re-election campaign. The campaign spokeswoman, Victoria Clarke, called the action "a vote against homes and home building."
Mr. Bush told state legislators in New Hampshire: "They say they are taking up my plan, but they are not. So I'll say it again: Don't relabel my plan; don't change it; don't use it as a way to raise taxes. Just pass this plan, and give the American people a chance to see whether it's going to work."
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, asked if he thought the committee's approach was fair, replied that since Mr. Bush's larger plan, his smaller plan, and one Democratic plan would all be voted on, "of course it's fair."
The Administration's argument since the State of the Union speech last month has been that a short list of measures should be enacted by March 20 to stimulate purchases of capital goods and homes. Other measures in Mr. Bush's program, Administration officials have argued, could wait until later in the year.
At first, officials said they would not mind if Congress added some items from the longer list, like the increased exemption for children. But in recent days they have become more insistent on the small package, which includes advantages for first-time home buyers, measures to make it easier for pension funds to invest in real estate, easing of passive-loss tax requirements for real estate developers and accelerated depreciation on new business investment.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, today followed Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of Ways and Means, in rejecting the idea of dealing with two tax bills. "My experience is you never see the second bill," Mr. Bentsen said.
He echoed his fellow Democrats in the House in offering a challenge to the Administration's insistence that a capital gains cut be given priority. He asked Mr. Brady:
"Does the White House really expect the Congress to support a bill giving tax cuts to high-income individuals and put off tax relief for working Americans until the second bill?"
Mr. Brady did not answer directly, but insisted that a "decrease in the capital gains rate would create economic opportunity for everybody."
The Democratic maneuver of introducing all of Mr. Bush's tax proposals, culled from an 880-page measure that included not only revenue measures but everything else he proposed in the budget, brought Republicans to today's Ways and Means meeting in a bad temper.
"We're not going to play," Mr. Archer said. "The Gephardt bill is not the President's program," he said, because it omitted domestic spending cuts that Mr. Bush had urged to help pay for his tax measures.
"The President wanted a race horse to create jobs," said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California. "What we have is a mule, or a jackass."
"It's about time we acted like adults," said Representative Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky.
 
The Democrats' Version
 Mr. Rostenkowski said the Republicans misunderstood. "The leadership in its wisdom decided to show its cooperation with the Administration," he said, explaining why Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, had introduced the Bush package. He said that since Republicans would not do it, someone had to.
Mr. Thomas asked if he was being asked to vote for the bill or for "Gephardt for President"?
Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island, taunted: "If you want to walk out on George Bush, we'll give you the chance."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
A Stone's Throw From Fray, Cuomo Upstages Candidates

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 12

 BODY:
With all the trappings of a campaign, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo traveled to the New Hampshire media market today to deliver a speech that won as much attention for its timing as for its substance.
Six days before the Presidential primary in New Hampshire, where Cuomo supporters are waging an unauthorized write-in campaign for the New York Governor, Mr. Cuomo went to Harvard to denounce what he described as a practice of scapegoating the poor for the country's economic problems. 
 "In 1932, people blamed the rich, the stockbrokers, the mighty industrial barons, the bankers and the landowners, the powerful officials and politicians who failed them," Mr. Cuomo said tonight to an audience of several hundred students and faculty members.
"This time, the powerful, instead of confessing error and pledging to correct it, are deflecting the blame from themselves to the powerless: to the poor, to the child who just had a child, to the new immigrants."
The content of Mr. Cuomo's speech was clearly aimed at the Republicans, both in his state and elsewhere, who have transformed welfare into an emotional campaign issue in the last two years.
 
Upstaging the Candidates
 But by the time he walked to the lectern tonight at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, his message had been largely obscured by his decision to give the speech when and where he gave it. Although school officials said the date of the speech was decided on early in January, before the recent troubles of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Mr. Cuomo's address in effect upstaged the candidates who had failed to catch fire in New Hampshire.
The Governor's visit to Boston put him under the eye of political reporters who left nearby New Hampshire -- and the Democratic candidates vying for their attention -- to come hear Mr. Cuomo, as well as Boston television and newspapers, whose reports are available to most New Hampshire voters.
For Mr. Cuomo, who has a record of overshadowing Presidential campaigns that he has declined to join, the speech seemed to offer the best of all political worlds, the chance to act like a candidate without being one.
For the first time in months, he took reporters from Albany on the state plane. Accompanied by Boston television crews, he paid a call at City Hall on Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who recently encouraged him to run.
When he arrived at Harvard, he was greeted by a small band of placard-waving fans. The speech, which attracted 11 television cameras, was broadcast into much of New Hampshire by Boston radio stations and was televised live on C-Span.
 
Lowering Expectations
 In an interview on the flight to Boston, Mr. Cuomo even engaged in the time-honored campaign tradition of lowering expectations. He said his aides had told him that winning 2 or 3 percent of the vote in a write-in campaign "would be very high."
The organizers of the New Hampshire write-in effort have set a goal of getting 15 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday.
Despite appearances, Mr. Cuomo reiterated that he had no plans to join the race and that he faced the same obstacle he faced on Dec. 20, when he said the lack of a state budget would keep him out of the race. And he said his failure to discourage the write-in campaign should not be interpreted as encouragement to his supporters in New Hampshire.
"When you encourage, you encourage," he said. "What more can I do other than say, 'I'm not running, New Hampshire'?
"I'm not encouraging them, I'm not discouraging them," Mr. Cuomo said.
In answering a student's question after his speech, Mr. Cuomo said: "In my own state, they're saying lousy things about me. If they want to say nice things about me in New Hampshire, I'm going to encourage them."
Mr. Cuomo also dismissed the notion that his continued presence on the Presidential scene might harm the five announced candidates.
"If anyone is beaten, it will not be by a candidate who never showed up," he said. "It's because they failed to reach the voters. If the other team doesn't show up, it's very hard to claim that they fouled you."
 
A Minor Annoyance
 Officials with the Democratic campaigns characterized Mr. Cuomo's speech and his write-in candidacy as a minor annoyance.
Tad Devine, the campaign director for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, suggested that Mr. Cuomo's method enabled him to enjoy the glory of a national campaign without enduring its constant illumination.
"The problem with jumping in the water is that you get wet," he said.
Officials with Mr. Cuomo's office and the Kennedy School said there was no conspiracy involved in the timing of the Governor's speech.
They said Mr. Cuomo had a standing invitation to speak at the school. Last fall, they said, two Harvard professors with close ties to Mr. Cuomo -- his former budget director, Dall W. Forsythe, and his nominee for the state's social services commissioner, Mary Jo Bane -- suggested a speech on the policy and politics of welfare.
 
Delicious Timing
 As it happened, the timing was delicious both for the Cuomo aides who still hope their boss will run and for the Kennedy School, which enjoys the attention.
The speech came at a time when the continuing troubles of Governor Clinton's campaign in the New Hampshire polls revived speculation that a new Democrat would join the race. That guessing game accelerated today after Mr. Clinton released a letter he had written in 1969 expressing his objection to the draft in the Vietnam War.
It also came as polls showed support growing for the Cuomo write-in movement, which plans to broadcast its first television commercials on Thursday.
The National Draft Cuomo for President Committee has raised about $90,000. Draft officials said they had had no contact with the Governor or his staff and had received no assitance in raising money from the Cuomo political organization.
Mr. Cuomo's visit to Boston came on the day that President Bush officially declared his candidacy in New Hampshire, allowing the country's top political columnists to enjoy a mid-February double-header by watching Mr. Bush in Concord, N.H., this afternoon and then driving to Harvard to catch Mr. Cuomo this evening.
In his speech, Mr. Cuomo criticized Mr. Bush for relying on low interest rates to revive the economy and for offering "palliatives" rather than substantive recommendations for economic growth.
"Even if monetary steroids arouse the economy temporarily in time to fool the electorate in November, that's not going to do anything to to deal with the profound weakness that threatens our future," he said.
The real campaign stood little chance when confronted with the circus next door.
J. Joseph Grandmaison, the former Democratic chairman in in New Hampshire and a Cuomo fan, said he did not think twice about driving to Boston to hear Mr. Cuomo.
"You're talking to someone who loves political theater," he said, "so therefore I think it's great."

HEADLINE: Iraq Trying to Make Plutonium Too, U.N. Aide Says

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Feb. 12

 BODY:
United Nations nuclear inspectors now in Iraq are hunting for a secret nuclear reactor capable of producing enough plutonium to make two or more bombs a year, United Nations officials and European diplomats say.
For the first time, the United Nations inspectors searching for President Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction have described intelligence suggesting that Iraq has a previously unknown reactor capable of turning out plutonium. 
 So far the main thrust of their search has been toward discovering evidence of Iraq's attempt to make highly enriched uranium explosive and to design a weapon capable of using it.
The significance of the new intelligence, experts say, is that President Hussein was trying to build an atomic bomb using plutonium explosive as well.
 
'Reason to Believe'
 While the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima used uranium as its explosive, the one that destroyed Nagasaki used plutonium, which is also used in most nuclear weapons now.
"We have reason to believe Iraq may have an undeclared plutonium reactor but our inspectors have found nothing significant yet," Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish head of the special United Nations commission, said today.
"All the specialists believe there is a reactor somewhere there," a European diplomat said.
The current search, the tenth the United Nations has conducted, has yielded nothing so far and the team is to leave Iraq on Thursday. On Tuesday the team searched the prison in the northern city of Mosul but again drew a blank.
However the intelligence, much of it from France, suggesting that Iraq has such a reactor has encouraged the United States, France and Britain to consider asking the Security Council to issue a new ultimatum to President Hussein ordering him to cooperate with their efforts to remove his weapons of mass destruction, diplomats say.
 
The Unresolved Issues
 These three countries, together with the other two permanent Council members, Russia and China, are discussing a possible new Security Council resolution or statement that would address several of their current disputes with Baghdad, according to diplomats.
These include President Hussein's economic blockade against dissident Kurds in the north, trade-sanction violations, the failure of Iraq to account for hundreds of missing Kuwaitis, Iraq's refusal to sell oil under United Nations guidelines to pay for food imports and the President's refusal to cooperate with the Security Council on the weapons issue. Most of these steps were part of the cease-fire agreement ending the Persian Gulf war.
Some diplomats said that if Baghdad rejected a new ultimatum, it could help pave the way for a new allied intervention in Iraq, aimed in part at encouraging a coup.
The nuclear inspections mounted by the special commission and by the International Atomic Energy Agency have established that President Hussein had a large nuclear-weapons program that included plans for producing highly enriched uranium explosive using both the centrifuge technique and electromagnetic separation.
Like all other aspects of Iraq's covert nuclear program, possession of a secret nuclear reactor would violate the country's obligation as a signer of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to place all its nuclear installations under international safeguards.
Possession of a reactor also violates a similar obligation that Iraq accepted when it agreed to the Security Council resolutions ending the Gulf war.
 
Help From China
 Last July, a declassified United States Army intelligence document said the United States believed that in 1986, China completed a feasibility study on building a nuclear power plant in Iraq.
The heavily censored document, which was obtained by the Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington research group, revealed that the specifications for the project included "ability to camouflage from satellites," suggesting that the plant was being built for clandestine operation.
However Paul L. Leventhal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute, said he has no evidence the reactor was ever built.
Officials at the United Nations say the intelligence presented so far suggests that Iraq might have concealed a reactor with a power of between 20 and 30 megawatts, which could produce about 20 pounds of plutonium each year. Assuming 10 to 12 pounds of plutonium for each bomb, this amount would allow Iraw to build two nuclear weapons annually.
 
How to Use Plutonium
 The bomb dropped on Nagasaki has been widely reported as containing about 12 pounds of plutonium. But the United Nations inspectors have already found evidence that Iraqi scientists were experimenting with more modern techniques to increase a bomb's explosive yield, permitting use of less plutonium.
The plutonium that Iraq acquired from a reactor would need to be separated from the residue of its burnt uranium fuel rods. And experts point out that Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission made no secret of its interest in doing this, reporting several separation experiments in recent annual reports.
The United Nations inspectors also discovered that Iraq illicitly produced about 3 grams of plutonium by secretly irradiating uranium in a Soviet reactor that was under international safeguards. The test was carried out between visits by inspectors sent by the international agency to make sure the reactor was not used for military ends.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Assessment;
Clinton's Candidacy Is Shaken, Again

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 12

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas desperately needed to make New Hampshire voters think about his message this week, not about him. Instead, in a devastating piece of political timing, the spotlight is now fixed on a letter he wrote in 1969, thanking his R.O.T.C. officer for "saving" him from the draft.
Many of his allies today hailed the letter as the powerful expression of a man who, even at the age of 23, was wrestling with hard issues and trying "to prepare myself for a political life" that, in the language of the times, worked within the system but sought to change it. 
 But there were basic political realities today: The letter further rattles a candidacy already shaken by accusations from a supermarket tabloid of marital infidelity; it creates new openings for his rivals here in New Hampshire, and it poses new problems in his Southern base, long considered his political firewall. Many professionals were hard put to see how Mr. Clinton could regain control.
 
A Clear Predicament
 Even as the Governor and his advisers sought to minimize the damage and redirect attention to the "motives of the people who leaked this letter," the campaign's predicament was clear. He wanted to be talking about economic recovery, educational improvement and tax cuts for the middle class in the days leading up to Tuesday's primary. Instead, he was forced to talk about the choices he made in one of the most divisive periods in American history.
And while he told a news conference today that the letter buttressed his argument that he did nothing wrong, the sentiments expressed in that letter are likely to stir old angers among many voters, particularly in the South, where military service is held in special esteem. "It's not helpful, that's for damn sure," said Al LaPierre, executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party.
Here in New Hampshire, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who is running strongly in some public opinion polls, seems likely to benefit from the furor. Analysts here say Mr. Tsongas, well known in the state thanks to months of campaigning and his status as a neighbor, has become a "safe harbor" for many voters. This could also be an opening for Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who highlighted his war record last week when the charge that Mr. Clinton tried to avoid the draft first appeared, and was denied, by the Arkansas Governor.
Mr. Kerrey, a former Navy Seal, won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam and lost part of his leg there. Neither the Tsongas nor the Kerrey campaign had much public commment on the Clinton letter, although Paul Johnson, Mr. Kerrey's New Hampshire director, offered an understated but telling comment: "It's Bill Clinton's issue, not ours. We're going to focus on our issues -- a tax cut for the middle class, health care and the economy -- and let Bill Clinton deal with Bill Clinton."
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, campaigning in Maine, was not as gentle when asked about the report. "Jeez, another one," he said. "I think voters should be concerned about his veracity and character. Listen, if someone wanted to serve in the military at that time, they could have served."
Questions about Mr. Clinton's military record, some analysts said, seem to be forming a potent combination with earlier reports in the tabloid Star that he had a 12-year affair with a singer, reports that Mr. Clinton denied. Gerry Chervinsky, a Boston poll taker conducting nightly surveys here for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV, said, "The Vietnam question has allowed people who didn't want to admit they had problems with his personal life to move away from him -- or at least take a second look."
Already, Mr. Clinton and his advisers have been trying to lower the expectations for him in New Hampshire, arguing that Mr. Tsongas should be considered a favorite son. But a poor showing will badly hurt Mr. Clinton, who until recently was riding a wave of inevitablity in the party, the candidate who seemed to many Democrats the only viable nominee.
His aura of electability -- as a moderate Southerner, like Jimmy Carter, the nominee 16 years ago and the last successful Democratic Presidential contender -- has dimmed. And the letter, with its strong language and its assertions that the Government was forcing its citizens to serve in an immoral war, will feed the doubts of those Democrats who were already wondering how the accusations of infidelity would affect the voters in a general election.
 
Hard to Keep Perspective
 Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker, said tonight, "Part of the problem is, Clinton will be judged out of a historical context by an awful lot of people; the voters aren't historians, and a lot of them will be thinking about this issue as much in the context of the war in the Persian Gulf as the war in Vietnam."
The Clinton campaign vowed to fight back; allies from the conservative wing of the party, like Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, issued statements in his defense. But the latest furor to rock the Governor's campaign is likely only to stir the speculation in the party that another candidate could enter the race.
Tonight, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, on whose behalf a write-in campaign is being waged in New Hampshire, was lurking on the border, delivering a speech at Harvard.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Proposal on Executive Pay Expected

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Under growing pressure from lawmakers and shareholders to make companies more accountable for executive pay, the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday will propose rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose more fully how much their executives are paid and to give stockholders the right to vote on compensation.
The proposals, described today by senior officials at the agency who insisted on not being identified, are intended to head off more restrictive legislation on executive pay that is pending in Congress. As layoffs and hard times continue, public outrage has grown over the increasing number of multimillion-dollar compensation packages offered to executives, many of which include lucrative stock options as well as big salaries and bonuses. 
 Officials at the commission who have discussed the proposals with Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the commission, said he would recommend the changes at a news conference on Thursday.
The new rule on executive pay would require that a complete and understandable list of compensation accompany the current descriptions of pay packages to senior officials in the annual statements of publicly traded companies now filed with the agency. The descriptions have been criticized as being indecipherable.
A second part of the plan will enable shareholders to vote on executive pay. It will involve a reinterpretation of Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which sets the standards for when shareholders may bring corporate issues to a vote.
Many companies have denied shareholders the right to express their views in proxies on executive pay because of an exemption in the rule that permits directors to deny votes on any matter "relating to the conduct of the ordinary business operations" of the company. Under the new interpretation of the S.E.C. rule that Mr. Breeden is expected to propose, executives would not be able to use the exemption to block shareholder votes on executive pay issues.
It is not clear, however, whether the votes would be binding; shareholders can now vote, for example, to urge a company not to do business with China, but the vote would not necessarily be binding.
In a third change, Mr. Breeden is also expected to direct the new chief accountant at the agency, Walter P. Schuetze, to work with the Financial Accounting Standards Board to study whether to change an accounting rule that permits companies to give stock options to executives without taking a charge against earnings when the options end up costing the companies millions of dollars when they are exercised. The accounting board, based in Norwalk, Conn., is a private group that has the S.E.C.'s blessing to set accounting rules for the private sector.
Congress is considering a wide range of proposals reflecting a growing popular sentiment that the multimillion-dollar pay checks of executives have become a symbol of what ails the American economy.
 
Controversial Salaries
 Those executives who have found themselves defending their large compensation packages in recent months include Steve J. Ross and N. J. Nicholas Jr., co-chief executives of Time Warner, who together made $99.6 million in 1990; Paul B. Fireman of Reebok International, who made $33.3 million; Leon C. Hirsch of U.S. Surgical, $15 million; Rand V. Araskog of ITT, $11.5 million, and Michael D. Eisner of Walt Disney, $11.2 million.
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, has proposed opening the pay-setting process to shareholder votes, a proposal similar to the one Mr. Breeden is expected to announce. Another, more radical proposal submitted by Representative Martin O. Sabo, Democrat of Michigan, would increase taxes on any company that chooses to pay its executives more than 25 times the company's lowest-paid worker.
At a hearing two weeks ago, members of a Senate subcommittee criticized the commission for not forcing companies to clarify how they pay top executives and for making it hard for shareholders to complain when they believe executives are overpaid. They threatened to pursue Congressional remedies if the commission and the accounting profession did not move quickly.

HEADLINE: Court Decision Won't Let Convicted Mayor Stay On

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court refused today to allow Gerald McCann to remain as Mayor of Jersey City while he appeals his conviction of Federal fraud and income tax evasion charges.
The court refused to stay a lower-court ruling last Friday that under state law Mr. McCann had forfeited his office because of the conviction. Mr. McCann had won two previous delays of the Superior Court order, but his lawyer acknowledged today that the Mayor's effort to fight his ouster had failed. 
 The lawyer, Matthew P. Boylan, said he spoke with Mr. McCann after the State Supreme Court ruled today. "He was calm and ready to accept the fact that the Supreme Court had decided the forfeiture question," Mr. Boylan said, "and he is out of office."
Although Mr. McCann's crimes occurred between his first and second terms as Mayor, his legal troubles cast as great a shadow over Jersey City, as had prosecutions of former mayors, most notably the late John V. Kenny, on official corruption charges.
Mr. McCann's fall from grace since his conviction on Dec. 17 was blamed today for a paralysis of city government, and Jersey City residents talked of an opportunity to get the city moving again now that Mr. McCann's hold on government had been broken.
 
Time for 'Some Answers'
 "Merchants will be happy that the situation has been cleared up," said Larry Ross, the owner of the Reliable Furniture Store on Newark Avenue. "Things have been in limbo, but now businessmen should be able to get some answers from City Hall."
Bill Canfield, chief security officer for the Jersey City Board of Education, said: "I'm glad that McCann is gone. He disgraced the city, and now it's time for a new beginning."
Jaime Vazquez said he wants to convince his fellow members of the City Council to name him interim mayor until a special election in November. "There is a general demoralization among the population," he said, "and we have to act to motivate the people and lift their spirits."
Mr. Vazquez said Mr. McCann became isolated from those in city government as his troubles mounted. "He administered by stealth and refused to share information," he said.
 
Veto Overturned
 When he took office in May 1989, Mr. McCann, who is 41 years old, had the support of a majority of the Council members, but in recent weeks they have closed ranks against him, voting unanimously last week to override his veto of ordinances that would have given the Council greater oversight over independent authorities.
On Tuesday evening, as the State Supreme Court was reading briefs filed by Mr. McCann's lawyer and the Attorney General's office, a majority of the Council adopted a resolution urging Mr. McCann to step down.
Although the Mayor's problems were a constant source of comment around City Hall, news of the state court decision traveled slowly today because of the holiday. The only person at City Hall was a policeman whose solitary watch was interrupted only by reporters looking for interviews. "I told everybody to come back tomorrow," he said. "They'll get all the interviews they want."
A telephone call to Mr. McCann's home was not returned. On Tuesday night he told The Associated Press that he had fought to keep his job because he needed the $62,000-a-year salary. "Quite literally, I become unemployed," he was quoted as saying. "I have responsibilities to my family. Nobody bothers to consider that once I go off the payroll, I'm off the payroll."
 
'No Place to Go'
 Mr. Boylan, who represented Mr. McCann in his trial in Federal court, won two delays in putting into effect an order by Judge Arthur N. D'Italia last week that Mr. McCann leave office immediately.
Richard T. Carley, the assistant attorney general who argued the case for the state, said Mr. McCann "had no place to go" once the State Supreme Court ruled today.
In the trial in Trenton before Judge John C. Lifland of Federal District Court, Michael Chertoff, the United States Attorney, had presented a case that depicted Mr. McCann as an embezzler who defrauded a Florida savings and loan association of $260,000 that was to have been used for a marina project at Liberty State Park.
The prosecution maintained that the money had been spent on jewelry, clothing, travel, sports tickets and collectibles, including rare stamps and coins, and leasing a luxury car.
Mr. McCann was convicted of 15 counts of mail, wire and bank fraud and income tax evasion. He faces up to 71 years in prison and $1 million in fines when he is sentenced. No date for the sentencing has been set.
 
To Press Appeal
 Mr. Boylan said Mr. McCann would press an appeal of his conviction and had retained John J. Gibbons, the former chief judge of the Federal Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to represent him. If Mr. McCann wins his appeal, Mr. Boylan said, he will go to court to seek reinstatement of his job as mayor.
The City Council has 30 days to appoint an interim mayor to serve until the November election. The winner of that election will serve until the next regular city election in May 1993.
Mr. Vazquez said he and a fellow Councilman, Bill O'Dea, would introduce a resolution at a Council meeting on Monday calling for the appointment of an interim mayor. "The resolution will be blank when it comes to naming anyone specific," he said. "There are too many people who are interested in the job, but we have to get started."

HEADLINE: Japanese Leaders Taken to Task By Political Boss for Bashing U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The man described as the godfather of Japanese politics chided some of his country's leaders today, saying that their recent criticisms of American work habits have helped to cause relations with the United States to worsen dangerously.
"Some Japanese politicians have caused misunderstanding as a result of their remarks," Shin Kanemaru, vice president of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in an interview. "I told my colleagues that you have to be extremely cautious when you make remarks, that you have an impact on people overseas." 
 "If we belittle the United States, there is no future for Japan," said Mr. Kanemaru, who is widely considered more powerful than Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa himself.
 
'We Owe Our Prosperity' to U.S.
 "Japan can exist because the United States exists," he said, "but it is not the other way around. We owe our prosperity to the United States. Many Japanese forget this fact."
He did not single out any Japanese official, but among those leveling harsh criticism of the United States has been the man Mr. Kanemaru, more than anyone else, put in office: Mr. Miyazawa, who said that Americans "may lack a work ethic."
"I'm concerned about this very bad state of affairs," he said, contradicting assurances from Mr. Miyazawa, President Bush and other leaders that Japanese-American relations are fundamentally sound.
He did not spell out the consequences of further deterioration in Japanese-American relations, but in a strongly worded warning he described them as being at the edge of a cliff, about to go over.
He said that Japan should improve the climate by taking many more steps to open its domestic markets, particularly the rice market, to foreign competition. "I had a talk with President Bush, and I mentioned that to him," he said.
At the age of 77, Mr. Kanemaru has a long record of pro-Americanism. In 1960, back in the days of anti-American hatred, he physically carried the Speaker of the House to his seat through a brawling Parliament to insure approval of a security treaty with the United States.
"It was such a bad riot, people were falling down all over," he recalled in an interview today. "I was very fortunate at that time of being physically strong. I personally carried the Speaker on my back and put him in the chairman's seat, so I'm sure you understand how I feel about U.S.-Japan relations."
Today, it is Mr. Kanemaru's political strength that gets attention. His support for the American position, while often not as strong as Washington would like, is a secret asset of the American strategy in Japan. But the future is in doubt because a new generation, less certain of its feelings for America, will be coming to the fore.
Gruff-voiced, with heavy-lidded eyes and craggy features that make him look something like a wily old crocodile, Mr. Kanemaru almost never gives interviews but is paid enormous deference in the political world. He also has many enemies.
"The right wing considers Shin Kanemaru the most dangerous politician in Japan," he said. "I'm not afraid of the right wing. I'm not afraid of their Molotov cocktails. You cannot let U.S.-Japan relations become shaky. I won't have any regrets, even if I am killed because of this conviction."
Despite these comments, Mr. Kanemaru prefers to run things as a kuromaku, or string-puller behind the scenes, and as a master of pork barrel politics who has brought huge sums to the governing Liberal Democratic Party. Every Prime Minister since 1980 is said to have been politically indebted to Mr. Kanemaru.
Mr. Kanemaru was born in a village northwest of Tokyo, the first son of a wealthy sake-brewing family. After serving as a sergeant in Manchuria during World War II, he achieved success in his own liquor, concrete and souvenir businesses. He entered Parliament in 1958 and quickly rose as a protege of the grandfather of modern Japanese patronage politics, Kakuei Tanaka.
In recent months, Japanese political gossip has focused on the feud between Mr. Kanemaru, who might be comfortable in a Chicago ward office, and the courtly and cerebral Prime Minister, Mr. Miyazawa. For years, the two were said to cordially loathe each other.
Last fall, for instance, Mr. Miyazawa was quoted as saying that he wished Mr. Kanemaru would sink in the Kamanashi River in his district. For his part, Mr. Kanemaru was quoted as saying that despite his support of the Miyazawa Government, it was sinking like a boat made of mud.
But a couple of weeks ago Mr. Miyazawa, stung by several legislative defeats and criticism of his lack of leadership, turned to his old rival and named him vice president of the governing party, in effect handing over control of all logrolling to the old master.
The astonishing union of the two rivals was reportedly sealed in a private room at a restaurant downtown, where the two sat on traditional straw mats on the floor, drained several glasses of rice wine and scotch, sang folk songs and promised not to betray each other.
 
Why the Change?
 Mr. Kanemaru smiles at the suggestion that the Prime Minister serves at his sufferance.
"Whether I am powerful or not is not for me to decide," he said. "It is up to historians in later generations to ponder and decide. In my view, it is irrelevant. My basic political philosophy is to work for the benefit of the people, and to contribute to better relations with allies."
He said he gave his support to Mr. Miyazawa last November, after the collapse of the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, because Mr. Miyazawa had earned it by getting support in public. Then, he said, he had to back up that support with actions to prop up the Prime Minister.
"Once he was chosen, there were certainly many problems, that is true," said Mr. Kanemaru. "But can you really put somebody in office and then take away his rudder? Is that in the interest of Japan? Is that in the interest of world peace? I had to seriously consider that."
In return for backing Mr. Miyazawa, Mr. Kanemaru, it is said, retains a free hand in the running of the Japanese political patronage machine.
After the recurrent eruption of political scandals in recent years, scandals in which money-for-favors schemes proliferated in virtually every major industry in Japan, there were endless demands for reform to curb the flow of money into politics. Mr. Kanemaru said he was skeptical.
"You know, politics needs money," he said. "And politics is expensive. That will not change. So Japanese politicians are sometimes forced to do immoral things. That is the worst thing about Japanese politics. That is something we have to reform."
But he made clear that he was referring to extreme cases of bribery in return for specific favors, not to Japanese politicians' typical practice of accepting huge contributions from business groups in return for support of general policies that favor the donors.
On trade issues, Mr. Kanemaru criticized Japan for slowness in responding to trade demands but also said the United States bears a large share of blame because American automobile makers have not made cars suitable to Japanese tastes for fuel efficiency and safety.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Bush Announces Candidacy, Claiming Reagan Mantle

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 12

 BODY:
Seeking to blunt the right-wing threat from Patrick J. Buchanan in New Hampshire, President Bush today reached for the conservative political mantle of Ronald Reagan in formally announcing his candidacy for re-election, then promptly flew here to campaign.
"In 1980 I came to Washington as part of a team," Mr. Bush said in Washington this morning with Vice President Dan Quayle, a favorite of conservatives, standing at his side. "We started a revolution to free America from -- you remember -- the politics of malaise and to set sail toward America's destiny."
 
Bedrock Republican Themes
 The President seemed intent on staking his conservative credentials on the bedrock Republican themes of the past: patriotism, anti-Communism, a strong military, family values, small government and deregulation. 
 Conservatives, especially Mr. Buchanan, have accused Mr. Bush of abandoning these principles in favor of political pragmatism. But the principles sustained him in his 1988 race for the Presidency and have begun to reappear in his oratory as Mr. Bush's political fortunes have sagged from the unassailability of a year ago to the apparent contestability of today.
After the Washington speech, in which he went through the ritual of announcing a candidacy that has been clear for months, Mr. Bush flew to New Hampshire to address the State Legislature and rush through a day of handshaking and picture-taking intended to keep Mr. Buchanan's showing as low as possible in that state's Republican primary next Tuesday.
Mr. Bush never mentioned Mr. Buchanan by name today, but took a thinly veiled slap at him by denouncing protectionism, a mainstay of the insurgent candidate's political message. "Our national symbol is not the ostrich," the President said. "It's the eagle, and that's the way it should be."
Mr. Buchanan spent his day in Carroll County, a Republican stronghold in eastern New Hampshire, and made much of an endorsement today of his candidacy by The Boston Herald, a development that clearly annoyed Bush aides.
The President declared that the 1992 campaign is a fight over the "future of America." But the day was devoted to repairing political damage and to revisiting familiar places and themes. Campaign aides say that weeks of television advertisements and visits by surrogates have not been working and that Mr. Bush must establish a stronger personal presence here.
 
Fighting an Elitist Image
 In Concord the President met with a roomful of police officers, a constituency that he campaigned regularly with in 1988. In Bedford he went to a shopping mall, where Mr. Bush, who arrived in New Hampshire in 1988 fighting his prep school image, rubbed elbows and shook thousands of hands as he tried to dispel any notion that he is remote from everday Americans.
In Washington, Mr. Bush's wife, Barbara, introduced her teary-eyed husband to the friendly crowd by testifying to his concern for Americans' suffering and his pride in their achievements.
"I'd like to tell you about the George Bush I've known for more than half a century, the man I have raised my children with, the man I've shared my life with," she said. "In the phases of his life, I've watched my husband change from a schoolboy to a family man to a businessman to public servant, from Congressman to President, from college team captain to leader of the greatest nation on earth."
While sounding his conservative themes Mr. Bush dwelt today on the welfare system, a subject he has rarely mentioned until recently, drawing enormous applause from about 1,000 supporters who gathered in a Washington hotel this morning to hear his announcement speech.
Outlining what he said was his agenda for the future, Mr. Bush said: "We'll get our economy up and running at full speed. We'll restore decency to the American way of life. We will silence the voices of hatred and gloom. And we will attack programs that lock people in bleak dependency as we work to reform our dismal welfare program."
He added: "I believe government is too big and it costs too much. I believe in a strong defense for this country -- and good schools, safe streets -- a government really worthy of the people. I believe that parents, not government, should make the important decisions about health, child care and education."
 
'My Supporter, Ronald Reagan'
 Perhaps mindful that the conservative wing of the Republican Party has never been his political base, Mr. Bush brought Mr. Quayle, a strong conservative, and his wife, Marilyn, on stage with him and looked to Mr. Reagan's legacy for legitimacy. At one point Mr. Bush even called him, "my supporter, Ronald Reagan."
The President's announcement of his candidacy was a simple formality. Mr. Bush has been raising money and entering his name on primary ballots around the country for months. But the campaign had delayed the announcement to permit him to strike an ostensibly bipartisan stand with Congress and to get as much political advantage from it as he could for the New Hampshire vote. The announcement will have no effect on who is paying for Mr. Bush's trips, since the campaign had already been paying for his campaign appearances.
Clearly aiming at Mr. Buchanan, the President said: "Protectionism isn't a prescription for prosperity. Boil away all the tough talk, all the swagger and all the patriotic posture, and protectionism amounts to a smoke screen for a country that is running scared."
Mr. Buchanan told reporters that Mr. Bush gave a "well crafted" speech to announce his candidacy. But he said, "Take the rhetoric, place it against the reality of New Hampshire and New England, and I'm afraid the President falls short."
 
'Retail Campaigning' Effort
 Bush campaign aides said their strategy for the New Hampshire primary rested on letting as many voters as possible see Mr. Bush and, as in today's events, even touch him -- the sort of "retail campaigning" that he credits for his rise to the Presidency.
At the Puritan Backroom Restaurant in Manchester, at a General Electric plant in Hooksett, at a meeting with New Hampshire police officers and firefighters and at the Bedford mall, Mr. Bush shook literally thousands of hands and posed with hundreds of supporters for photographs.
The stop at the Bedford mall was billed by its management as a "nonpolitical event," but about half of the crowd, which was lined up along yellow tapes on the floor and held back by Secret Service agents, seemed made up of people with "Bush-Quayle 92" stickers on their coats. They chanted, "Four more years!" in response to a campaign worker who moved through the crowd.
Besides trying to fend off the challenge from the right, Mr. Bush seemed bent today on innoculating himself as much as possible from problems that have beset his candidacy, including charges that he spends too much time on foreign policy. Today he tried to turn the tables and capitalize on his foreign policy record by crediting himself with ending the cold war, keeping up military spending and bringing down Soviet Communism.
"If you want to lead in the world, you've got to know the neighborhood," Mr. Bush said.
And he repeatedly reminded his audiences of the American victory in the Persian Gulf war last year. Mr. Bush even brought up the war when he reminded the Legislature of his March 20 deadline for Congress to pass his economic growth proposals.
At that time, he said, "I hope to be able to say that the liberation of America's economy has begun." When the war against Iraq began last year, the White House announced that the "liberation of Kuwait has begun."

HEADLINE: Canada Is Discouraging Shopping in the U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Canadian Government took its first significant action today to try to curb the billions of dollars that Canadians spend shopping for cheaper goods in the United States.
The steps include a new $5 handling fee on packages mailed to Canada, the dropping of the duty-free limit on packages to $20, from $40, and an unusual unilateral reduction in tariffs covering $1 billion of annual consumer imports. 
 The tariff measure, effective at midnight tonight, affects 25 popular goods from cameras to video cassette recorders, mostly from Asian suppliers. The duties on these products were substantially higher than those levied by the United States; the lower tariffs should help Canadian stores lower prices.
Still, many analysts, citing price differentials that range to 50 percent and more between Canada and the United States, said they doubted the moves would serve as much of a deterrent.
"People are voting with their feet, and their telephones," said Bill Harsh, an Ottawa publisher whose Toll Free Cross Border Shopping Guide has become a recent best seller. "To cut United States shopping, you'll either have to cut taxes in Canada or put up border guards."
Every day tens of thousands of Canadians head south in search of cheaper cigarettes, beer, television sets, dairy products and hundreds of other items. Tens of thousands of others, using catalogues from American emporiums, just pick up their telephones.
Same-day trips to the United States registered at the border rose to a record 5.22 million last November, up 3.8 percent from October and up 24 percent from November 1989.
The trend is transforming the border landscape. From Plattsburg, N.Y., to Bellingham, Wash., new shopping centers, appealing specifically to Canadian wants, have risen.
A few miles north, in Canada, merchants are folding. The retailers, already hit by a recession that has kept unemployment over 10 percent, lament that they are losing more than $3 billion a year in the cross-border shopping spree.
A bottle of beer illustrates the tax gap: In Canada, taxes represent 53 percent of its cost, in the United States 19 percent.
"There's no silver bullet, but what the Government has done today is in the right direction," said Alasdair McKichan, president of the Retail Council of Canada, which represents most retailers.
Announcing the measures today, Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek insisted, "We are not telling Canadians where to shop and where not to shop," but added, "We've got to create an atmosphere that will encourage Canadians to shop at home."
 
Smuggling Also a Target
 Mr. Jelinek also announced moves to crack down on tobacco and alcohol smuggling. A pack of cigarettes in Canada costs three or four times what it does in the United States, and a bottle of wine is twice as high. With such differentials, a lively business has grown in contraband.
To reduce the incentive for importing cigarettes and alcohol, the Minister disclosed that federal customs officers would for the first time begin collecting provincial tobacco and alcohol taxes at the border.
He also repeated an offer to have federal officers collect provincial taxes on all goods coming into the country. Now under reciprocal arrangements, if an Ontario resident buys, say, a video cassette recorder in Quebec, she does not immediately pay either the Quebec or the Ontario sales tax (both 8 percent), but she will eventually be billed for the Ontario tax. Yet if the recorder is bought in the United States, no Ontario tax is paid.
Under the proposal, federal officers would collect the provincial sales taxes, however, only if the provinces broaden their taxes to apply to all goods covered by the federal goods and services tax.
This creates a political problems for some of the provinces. Ontario, for example, would have to expand its sales tax to cover such items as children's clothing, books and women's hygiene products.

Campbell Net Climbs by 19%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Campbell Soup Company today reported a 19 percent increase in second-quarter earnings despite a slight decline in sales.
Net earnings were $160.6 million, or 64 cents a share, in the quarter ending Jan. 26, compared with $135.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year ago. 
 Campbell said the results marked the company's sixth straight quarter of record earnings. The per-share earnings took into account a 2-for-1 stock split.
Sales decreased $20 million, to $1.75 billion from $1.77 billion, mainly because of the company's divestiture of less profitable businesses. Sales from continuing businesses rose 3 percent.
"I am pleased that we have been able to deliver such strong earnings performance in the face of a very tough economic and business climate," David W. Johnson, Campbell's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
Aided by the acquisition of Sanwa Foods, a leading noodle manufacturer, and the expansion of the Healthy Request line, soup volume in North America rose 6 percent, the company said.

HEADLINE: Madrid Journal;
500 Years Later, Latin America Can Forgive Spain

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
In the long windup to the Columbus quincentenary this year, Spain's recurrent fear was that Latin America might spoil the party by retelling all sorts of unpleasant stories about the pillaging and cruelty that followed Spain's conquest of the New World.
Already in the late 1980's, some Indian groups and leftist politicians were arguing that since there was nothing to celebrate, Latin America should boycott the occasion. Even now, some governments suspect that Spain is more intent on strengthening its new ties to Europe than its old ties to America. 
 But gradually, it seems, Spain has won over its former colonies. Early on, it agreed to drop the Eurocentric concept of the "discovery of America" in favor of "the meeting of two worlds." And it publicly acknowledged that 1492 was indeed a painful turning point for the Indian peoples of America.
 
Culture, Credits and the King
 It also invested heavily in cultural programs in Latin America and signed major credit agreements with Mexico, Venezuela, Chile and Argentina, while frequent trips to the region by King Juan Carlos and his heir, Prince Felipe, helped soften Spain's image as the former imperial master.
Most successfully, though, Spain has now persuaded Latin America that the quincentenary should be an occasion to look forward and not back. And to underline this point, on Jan. 24 Prince Felipe inaugurated an exhibition here about Latin America that is called "500 Years Later: To Imagine the Future."
In essence, it is an educational exhibition, intended to show how the quincentenary is building on the strong cultural and historical ties between Spain and Latin America. But with Latin American ambassadors attending the opening ceremony, it is also clearly intended to be a political statement.
With 1992 under way, then, Spain is at last relaxing. With the exception of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, whose father was a Spanish immigrant, no Latin American leader has tried to score nationalistic points at home by prodding Spain about its past. And all are to attend a 21-nation Ibero-American summit meeting here in July.
Indeed, Mexico, which has vilified the Spanish conquest and glorified its Indian past since the 1910 Revolution, has emerged as Spain's principal Latin American partner in preparing the quincentenary. "Once Mexico came aboard, we stopped worrying," a Spanish Government official said.
The past, of course, will not go unnoticed. Indian leaders from Latin America, and the United States, plan demonstrations at the Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona and the World's Fair in Seville this summer. Some intellectuals have written extensively about Spain's colonial atrocities.
But Spanish officials now have a set reply: that other colonial powers, including Britain and Portugal, behaved no better at the time, and that the "black legend" about Spain's abuses was born because many Spanish missionaries took the side of the Indians and denounced the conquistadors.
"Fortunately, millions of Indians still speak their languages, develop their culture and preserve their way of life in Ibero-America today," Luis Yanez, the head of Spain's Quincentenary Commission, wrote recently. In a jab at the United States he added, "They neither risk extinction nor are living in reserves, as in other parts of the continent."
Spain's focus on the future has been helped by the fact that Latin America today is also anxious to forget its more recent past of military dictatorships and deep recessions and to open itself up to the world, both politically and economically. And it sees Spain as a useful sponsor.
Moves to create an Ibero-American commonwealth of nations, including Portugal and Brazil, began at a summit conference in Guadalajara, Mexico, last July and will be pursued here this year, with its agenda to be expanded from political back-slapping and cultural exchanges to embrace economic cooperation.
 
Some Limits
 But while this new coziness should forestall serious embarrassments during the quincentenary, there are limits to the relationship. "The United States will remain Latin America's main economic partner and integration into Europe will remain Spain's top priority," a Spanish Government official said.
Further, if one side benefits more than the other, it will probably be Spain. Not only are its exporters and investors preparing to take advantage of the awakening of Latin America's long-stagnant economies, but its prestige within the European Community should also be enhanced by its new influence in Latin America.
In contrast, Latin America has already discovered that Spain lacks the leverage to demand that the community grant the same privileges to its former colonies as those enjoyed by third-world countries once ruled by France and Britain.
"Spain is not a bridge to the community," a Spanish official said. "But countries like Mexico and Brazil do not need intermediaries."
It is in the complex arena of sentiments that the biggest problems may arise. While tens of millions of Latin Americans still look to Spain as the "mother country," Spain's eyes are now fixed on Europe, where after generations of exclusion it is at last winning acceptance.
Resentment that Spain has chosen Europe over Latin America becomes particularly acute when Latin American tourists are refused entry here by Spanish officials applying new community rules to combat illegal immigration. "We're sometimes made to feel like second-class citizens," a Panamanian resident said.
But if ordinary Spaniards and Latin Americans seem unsure how much they really have in common, their leaders have concluded that the quincentenary is not the time for mutual recriminations.
"For 50 years, Spain and Latin America turned their backs on each other," a Latin American ambassador said. "Now it is in both their interests to be friends."

HEADLINE: No Russian Job For Volcker Yet

 BODY:
Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said yesterday that his trip last week to Russia to explore acting as an adviser to the new Government had not produced any assignments.
"We're having a few conversations to see how much and to what degree it may be useful," he said in New York yesterday at a news conference after an economic award ceromony. 
 Since Mr. Volcker left the Fed in 1987, he has been teaching part time at Princeton University and serving as chairman of Wolfenson & Company, an investment banking firm.
Mr. Volcker said that the rise in Russian prices by 300 to 400 percent in January had created quesitons about "political and economic stability."
He said lenders to Russia must consider how their money will be spent. "If you can be satisfied it will be used constructivley, it is a very legitimate investment," he said.

HEADLINE: Scandal-Plagued Realty Concern's Chief Financial Officer Kills Himself

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
The chief financial officer of the Colonial Realty Company, an investment company whose bankruptcy has shaken banks, businesses and thousands of investors in Connecticut, committed suicide on Tuesday at his home in West Hartford, Conn., the authorities said
The executive, Frank M. Shuch, 40 years old, was to go on trial in May in Federal District Court in New Haven on charges that he embezzled $6 million from Colonial, which is based in West Hartford. He faced maximum penalties of $24 million in fines and 485 years in prison. 
 But Tuesday night his wife, Nancy, came home to their house on Balfour Drive, in an exclusive mountainside neighborhood overlooking Hartford, and found her husband on the floor of their family room, said Detective Kenneth O'Brien of the West Hartford police.
After an autopsy yesterday, an associate state medical examiner, Dr. Arkady Katsnelson, said Mr. Shuch had asphyxiated himself with a plastic bag over his head.
Mr. Shuch is the only Colonial principal charged so far in a business collapse that has caused banks to fail, wiped out hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and produced thousands of lawsuits.
 
Boom and Bust
 But the business activities of the company's founders, Jonathan Googel and Benjamin Sisti, are subjects of a criminal inquiry by a Federal grand jury working with the F.B.I. and the Internal Revenue Service, and of an investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The F.D.I.C. has taken over five failed banks that lent tens of millions of dollars to Colonial and to Mr. Sisti.
Colonial Realty grew rapidly through the 1980's as Connecticut rode a boom powered in large part by soaring real-estate values.
Eventually 6,000 people -- including lawyers, doctors, a Federal judge and the Secretary of the State -- invested more than $350 million, many of them making down payments and pledging to pay thousands more. More than 40 banks lent nearly that much to the company and its principals.
But in September 1990, as the state's failing economy squeezed Colonial's real-estate investments, six banks forced the company into bankruptcy court. In the months that followed, thousands of investors were shocked to learn not only that their investments might be worthless, but that banks owed money by Colonial were suing the investors for the future payments they had pledged.
"The impact on the economy, not to mention the business community, is just enormous," said John R. Gorman, a New Haven lawyer who is representing 2,670 Colonial investors in a total of 34 Federal class-action suits, one against each of Colonial's 34 investment funds.
"At least one, and probably two, people besides Frank Shuch -- limited partners -- have committed suicide," Mr. Gorman said. "Families have been destroyed, businesses. It goes on and on and on."
He said banks have filed 2,000 suits against individuals seeking their investment pledges, which Colonial had used as collateral for loans.
The former Mayor of Waterbury, Joseph J. Santopietro, is to go on trial this month in Federal District Court in Bridgeport on charges he received more than $170,000 in illegal payments while in office, including $25,000 in cash from Colonial, delivered in a monogrammed Crouch & Fitzgerald portfolio. In return, prosecutors say, he steered $1 million in pension money to a Colonial fund.

HEADLINE: Blacks Are Urged Not to Buy Japanese Cars

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The head of the N.A.A.C.P. urged blacks on Tuesday not to buy Japanese cars because, he said, Japanese auto makers were reluctant to establish dealerships owned by blacks and unwilling to build plants in inner cities.
"This is not Japanese-bashing," said Benjamin Hooks, the group's executive director. "We don't hate anybody. But we want to take care of our own." 
 Mr. Hooks made the statement during the 83d anniversary celebration of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He added that blacks had a big stake in the survival of the United States Big Three auto makers, which, he said, have treated them far better than their Japanese counterparts.
More than 140,000 black Americans are employed by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in the plants where the cars are made and in the corporate offices, Mr. Hooks said.
Among dealerships of American auto companies, 259 were owned by members of minorities last year, while among dealerships of the Japanese companies, 11 were owned by minorities, Mr. Hooks said.
He also said that recent talks between his group and Japanese officials had been disappointing. He said the idea his organization was getting was that the Japanese would not go out of their way to promote blacks or build plants in inner cities.
But Edd Snyder, a black who owns Mid-State Toyota in Delaware, Ohio, said Toyota treated him very well when he wanted to become a dealer. He added that Mr. Hooks's statement was simplistic. "I operate in a worldwide economic community," he said, adding that he had Japanese-brand cars on his lot that were built in Kentucky.

HEADLINE: Dow Jumps To Record At 3,276.83

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Spurred in part by expectations of a further interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, stocks rallied strongly yesterday, with many indexes bounding past recently set records.
A solid showing in the secondary market spilled over into blue-chip issues, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.26 points, to 3,276.83. That barely eclipsed its previous high, 3,272.81, set on Feb. 4. 
 Investors were also heartened, analysts said, by the reception yesterday for the second part of the quarterly Treasury refinancing, an offering of $11 billion worth of 10-year Treasury notes. While the auction was only a moderate success, the fact that it did not go poorly, lifted the market. [Page D18.]
 
Heavy, Volatile Trading
 Trading was volatile and the volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, with 237.6 million shares traded. The Big Board composite, though not setting a record, did rise a healthly 1.60 points, to 230.54, as the number of issues gaining handily outpaced losers 1,096 to 648.
Paul J. Kronlokken, technical analyst for Piper, Jaffrey & Hopwood, said the surge in the secondary market was helped by strong gains in the technology sector, after a key indicator called the book-to-bill ratio issued by the Semiconductor Industry Association for January came in very strong. The sharp rise in this measure of orders in the semiconductor business was taken as a signal that a recovery among chip makers might be broadening.
Some of the strong issues included Intel, up 2 1/2, to 68; Apple Computer, up 2 3/8, to 65 1/4; Novell, up 2, to 62 1/4; Seagate Technology, up 7/8, to 14 1/2; Hewlett-Packard, up 2 1/8, to 64 1/8, and Compaq Computer, up 1 3/8, to 31 5/8.
The strong technology sector pushed the Nasdaq composite to a new closing high of 644.92, up 11.55 points. The same was true for the Russell 2,000, which closed at 212.61, up 1.9. Active trading also took the American Stock Exchange which advanced to a record level of 418.99, up 3.53, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, was up 3.37 points, to 417.13, shy of its record.
Investors still hope that the Fed will ease rates soon and that the Treasury's refunding will go smoothly. Traders said a poor showing in the refunding could weaken bond prices, pushing stocks down.
Yesterday's note auction did not hurt the market, as yields came within expectations. "Until the refunding is over, the market is going to be held hostage as it waits to see how the bond market reacts to the refunding," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research for Janney Montgomery Scott.
A fairly heavy dose of program trading increased volatility in the market, as Philip H. Smyth, an analyst with Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm tracked four buy programs and one sell that combined to add 17.22 points to the Dow.
Today the market will focus on the last leg of the Government's quarterly refunding, with the auction of new 30-year bonds, January retail sales and weekly initial unemployment claims.
In trading yesterday, Genentech, rose5/8, to 28 3/8, and Amgen was up 3 1/8, to 68 1/8. The two biotechnology issues were both recommended by Denise Gilbert, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. She raised the rating on Genentech to "speculative buy" from "hold" because the stock is at its lowest discount price since the buyout by Roche Holdings last August. Roche, which owns 60 percent of Genentech stock, has the right to buy back all remaining shares.
She also repeated her "buy" on Amgen, saying the firm is growing anywhere from 35 to 40 percent a year.
A Paine Webber analyst, Stephen Girsky, cut his rating on Chryslerto "neutral" from "attractive," as the current market price approached his own target price of $17 to $21 a share. The auto maker slipped 1/2, to 15. Mr. Girsky also noted that Chrysler's convertible private offering of preference stock should result in a 7 to 8 percent dilution, which would rise if the company expanded the size of the offering to an expected $1 billion from $400 million.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
10-Year Notes Get Mixed Response

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
An offering of $11 billion worth of 10-year Treasury notes, the second part of the Government's quarterly refunding auctions, was fairly well received by dealers in the credit markets yesterday.
Demand for the securities among large institutional accounts, however, was very weak, dealers said, and prices of outstanding Treasury issues moved lower as the session wore on and traders sought to discover price levels that would arouse some interest from customers. 
 Rather than issue new securities at the auction, the Treasury chose to reopen the outstanding 7.50 percent 10-year notes that mature Nov. 15, 2001. As a consequence, the notes sold yesterday have a maturity of nine years and nine months.
The securities were sold at an average yield of 7.29 percent, down from the average 7.53 percent yield at the last 10-year note sale in November.
 
Lowest Yield in 5 Years
 It is the lowest yield on a 10-year note in five years. The notes sold on Feb. 4, 1987, were auctioned at an average yield of 7.25 percent.
"The auction went O.K., said one government securities trader. "We are absorbing the refunding without doing too much damage."
Other market participants, however, were not so sanguine. Much of the $26 billion worth of 3-year and 10-year notes that have been auctioned the last two days remain in dealer inventories, and the market still faces today's auction of $10 billion of 30-year bonds as well as sales next week of new 2-year and 5-year notes.
"We are in a heavy supply period and the environment is not that conducive to buying," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
"We think that retail accounts have the wherewithal to get involved, and are waiting for a catalyst to trigger a turn in the market. But in a market that currently is moving rates higher, I can't blame them for not wanting to be the first one in the water."
 
Foreign Demand Limited
 As expected, foreign demand for the new securities auctioned this week has been extremely limited.
"We bought just under $600 million of the 10-year, but we didn't sell any of that to Japanese clients," said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America. "And unless yields back up dramatically from where they are right now, I expect it will be the same at the bond auction."
Analysts said the market's reaction to economic data scheduled for release today and tomorrow could be decisive in determining the success of the bond auction and, as important, whether the rally that stalled out in mid-January is truly over.
Among the reports to be released today are January retail sales figures and the Federal Reserve's weekly money supply report. Tomorrow, market participants are expecting a weak January report on manufacturing output and producer price numbers showing that wholesale price inflation was benign last month.
 
30-Year Yield Rises
 Late yesterday, the 30-year securities to be auctioned today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.82 percent, up from 7.79 percent late Tuesday.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1026/32 in late trading, down 10/32 , to yield 7.80 percent, compared with 7.78 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9715/32 late yesterday, down 10/32 , to yield 6.83 percent. The 6 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 999/32 , down 5/32 , to yield 6.42 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9922/32 , down 3/32 , to yield 5.04 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.73 percent late yesterday, the same as late Tuesday. And six-month bills remained stuck at an offered rate of 3.81 percent.
New-issue remained heavy in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, and was highlighted by a $250 million offering of Denver airport revenue bonds. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

Tax-Exempt Yields Decline in a Reversal

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The yields on tax-exempt funds reversed and moved down a little for the week ended Monday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Taxable funds continued their decline for the period ended Tuesday.
Walter Frank, economist for Donoghue's, said: "There was some movement by investors in the latest week into tax-exempt funds as indicated by a sharp increase in their asset value to a record level. But as these yields decline, we will probably see demand for the tax frees slacken unless the Federal Reserve eases." 
 As for the taxable yields, Mr. Frank said their decline had continued longer than expected, adding that most of the decline in taxable yields was in anticipation of further Federal Reserve easing. "We think the odds favor the easing, but it is not a sure bet," he said.
The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempt funds dropped to 2.81 percent from 2.95 percent, a decline of 14 basis points, while the seven-day simple yield dropped to 2.77 percent from 2.91, also 14 basis points. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
In the same period, the 30-day compound yield dropped 10 basis points, to 2.82, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 2.78, also a decline of 10 basis points.
 
Top Performers
 The top Connecticut fund again was Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 3.35 percent, the same as the previous week.
In New Jersey, the top fund again was Fidelity Spartan N.J. Municipal Money Market Portfolio, with a yield that held steady at 3.46 percent.
In New York, the top fund again was Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compounded yield of 3.74 percent, down slightly from 3.77 percent a week earlier.
Assets of the tax-exempt funds, which have been declining, reversed course and rose sharply by $1.8 billion, to record of $98.9 billion.
Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios dropped to 50 days from 51.
Of the funds monitored by Donoghue's with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, Milwaukee, continued to lead the way, with a seven-day compounded yield of 3.73 percent, down from 3.84 percent a week ago.
 
Taxable Funds
 Meanwhile, assets of the taxable funds rose sharply by $5.4 billion, to $509.7 billion, a record, and Mr. Frank noted that the average days to maturity of holdings in the taxable funds rose by a day, to 57 days.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield was down 8 basis points, to 3.92 percent, while the seven-day simple yield fell 7 basis points, to 3.85 percent, down from 3.92 percent.
The 30-day compounded yield declined to 4.05 percent, down 9 basis points, and the 30-day simple yield dropped to 3.97 percent, also a decline of 9 basis points.
The taxable fund with the best seven-day compound return for the week was again the Fidelity Spartan Money Market fund, with a yield of of 4.65 percent, compared with 4.83 percent a week ago.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.78 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: India Plans Purchases Of Wheat

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
For the first time since 1988, the Government of India will be buying wheat abroad to bolster its stockpiles of food, Indian and American officials say.
The head of India's Food Deaprtment told the United States Agriculture Department this week that New Delhi needs about one million tons of grain to stabilize food prices, which have risen as a result of changes in economic policies. 
 In looking for foreign wheat supplies, India is in competition with a number of nations that were once part of the former Soviet Union. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome said today that 12 former Soviet republics, excluding the Baltic nations, might buy as much as 35 million tons of grain this year, 11 million more than last year.
Worldwide, the food organization said, the demand for wheat alone would increase 12 million tons.
American officials say there is less fear in Washington that supplies will be strained and more concern that subsidized European grain will siphon off buyers. American wheat sells for about $180 a ton; wheat grown in Europe under heavy European Community subsidies sells for $130 a ton.
India, which is self-sufficient in food production, bought two million tons of American wheat in 1988 when food stockpiles were running low. The wheat was sold under the 1985 Export Enhancement Program, which subsidizes sales of American grain to make it more competitive with European grain.
New Delhi has asked the United States for price concessions again this year. In the Agriculture Department, officials are inclined to support the Indian request because India, with about 850 million people and a limited ability to expand acreage, is seen as a long-term cash customer for American wheat.
Russia is seeking about 23 million tons on the world market this year, officials say. But they believe that private ownership and improvements in Russian agriculture will sooner or later make production more efficient.
The United States has made other poor South Asian nations, including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, eligible for the Export Enhancement Program subsidies on grain. Asian nations with better economic performances and large trade imbalances with the United States have been excluded. These include Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, all of which continue to buy American wheat rather than cheaper European grain.

HEADLINE: Investors in Venezuela Are Confident

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Investor confidence and contracts are returning after the failed coup of Feb. 4.
President Carlos Andres Perez has vowed to maintain orthodox, free-market economic policies, which last year helped to lower inflation and to aid growth. 
 Within hours of the failed coup, local and foreign investors signed $16 million in contracts to buy four state hotels, and the Eastman Kodak Company signed a letter of intent to create a $200 million joint production venture with a state petrochemical company, Petroquimica de Venezuela.
On Monday, a local investing group, H. L. Boulton S.A., signed a $20 million contract to buy a state shipyard. And next week, Conoco Inc. is to sign a joint venture to produce and to refine a heavy oil with a state oil company here, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.
"There is not going to be any long-term damage to investment confidence because of the attempted coup attempt," predicted John M. Werner, president of Alimentos Heinz C.A.
In the sensitive tourism sector, hotel reservations are returning to levels seen before the coup attempt.
Venezuela's oil industry, the second-largest supplier of oil to the United States after Saudi Arabia, did not skip a beat during the coup attempt. "We did not lose any production; we did not lose any exports; we did not lose any payments; there was no damage to petroleum installations," Andres Sosa Pietri, president of the national oil company, said in an interview today.
Billions of dollars of foreign investments are moving along pipelines here, apparently unimpeded by the military uprising. Shell Oil, Exxon and Mitsubishi are negotiating participation in a $3 billion natural gas project, while Shell, Veba Oel of Germany and Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi of Italy are negotiating participation in coal mines.
Fueling some growth will be state spending. The national oil company is in the middle of a six-year, $48 billion capital investment program. Within a year, work is to start on a $1 billion, deep-water port in the Gulf of Venezuela, a passageway for most oil exports. But private business investment, often more labor intensive here, will be crucial to help Mr. Perez win the social peace necessary to complete his free-market revolution.
"The plans are made, and we are going to continue with the investment," said Stephen Fellows, president of the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce.
A post-coup survey of 90 chamber members found that 30 percent planned to invest money from overseas at last year's levels. Seventy percent plan to invest at double 1991 rates. One of the largest investors here, a consortium led by the GTE Corporation, is forging ahead with a five-year, $10 billion program to modernize Venezuela's telephone system.
In the first three years of his five-year term, Mr. Perez has ended controls on prices and on foreign exchange, has slashed import tariffs by two-thirds, and has created a duty-free customs union with Colombia. Last year, Venezuela sold to private investors $2.2 billion worth of state companies: an international airline, two banks, a sugar mill and the national telephone company.
Judging by vague sympathies many people here expressed for the officers' revolt, the President is running against a clock to deliver benefits of his program. So far, statistics show that the free-market program has depressed people's standards of living.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Prodigy Makes Pitch To Marketers

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE Prodigy Services Company is intensifying its efforts to convince marketers that they should commit scarce advertising dollars to a venture that offers "on line" services like shopping and banking to owners of personal computers.
For the first time, the executives at Prodigy, a joint venture of I.B.M. and Sears, Roebuck, have hired an advertising agency to sell consumer-product companies on what they consider the benefits of the service as an alternative to television, magazines and newspapers. 
 "There has to be a call to action," Robert M. Shapiro, Prodigy's senior vice president for commercial marketing, said in a recent interview. Too many marketers and their agencies believe that "in a recession, the safest thing to do is what you've been doing."
So, to handle Prodigy's commercial marketing, which includes activities like advertising sales, classified ads and direct response, the company hired Ted Chin & Company in New York, an agency perhaps best known for a trade campaign for U.S. News & World Report in which celebrities extolled the news magazine's no-nonsense glitz-lessness. J. Walter Thompson continues to handle Prodigy's account aimed at encouraging consumers to become subscribers.
"It's a tough challenge to make the unfamiliar the un-ignorable choice," said Ted Chin, president and creative director of the agency, who joined Mr. Shapiro for the interview. Reinforcing his efforts will be an expanded ad-sales staff at Prodigy's White Plains headquarters and new Los Angeles branch office.
Prodigy's redoubled efforts to woo advertisers point up an increasingly common problem for such computer services and other new media. For some time, they behaved like the character in the film "Field of Dreams," who obeyed a mysterious voice that whispered, "If you build it, he will come."
But that has not proved true.
"We have to overcome the cocoon mentality," Mr. Chin said. "If I may play Hamlet, do agencies rise to innovation or retreat to the familiar? That is the question."
And the traditional media are fighting back. The Network Television Association, which represents ABC, CBS and NBC, has been mounting an intense promotional campaign. A 35-minute videotape and a 32-page booklet, both called "The Network Story," will be sent next week to more than 3,000 advertisers and agencies.
Already using Prodigy's information network as an ad medium are a blue-chip roster of 68 marketers, up from 42 in 1990, like BMW, Mazda, Panasonic, Sharp, T.W.A., Volkswagen, Wamsutta and USA Today. Most offer brochures, booklets and other information about their products and services via Prodigy's on-line abilities.
Though Prodigy executives declined to discuss advertising revenues, they have been estimated at around $15 million last year.
Prodigy, which began testing in 1984 and went national six years later, now has more than 1.2 million enrolled members. The number of "tune ins," Prodigy argot for individual sessions by a member during a month, reached 10.1 million in October.
Membership figures are used to set ad rates, much the way a newspaper uses circulation figures or a television network uses ratings data. Advertising is sold on the basis of a one-year presence on Prodigy screens, at rates that can run on average from $150,000 to $175,000 up to about $400,000.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Troubles in Ex-Soviet Lands Help Strengthen the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher yesterday amid concern about possible unrest in the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Gold prices moved higher, rising $1.80 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to close at $358.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357.50, up $1.70. 
 Analysts said the foreign exchange markets were at least temporarily shifting their focus from the United States economy to the political future of Russia and the other countries that once made upthe Soviet Union.
 
Remarks by Shevardnadze
 The former Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, said in a German broadcast interview that a coup was possible because of the unrest in Russia and the other republics.
Political unrest overseas is a "buy" sign for dollar traders. The dollar is seen as a relatively safe investment in times of international strife.
"There's a change in the psychology of the markets," said Ronald H. Holzer, a vice president with Harris Trust & Company in Chicago.
Currency traders focused in recent weeks on the United States economy and the Federal Reserve, which was expected to push interest rates lower to stimulate the economy. The dollar is supported by higher yields.
The Fed, however, has not made a move, despite a worse-than-expected employment report from the Labor Department last Friday. The central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has said repeatedly, most recently on Tuesday, that he believed the Fed had taken enough steps to help the economy.
Mr. Holzer said that if rates remained stable or began to climb, the dollar would strengthen.
The dollar declined against the Japanese yen as traders worried that the Bank of Japan might intervene to push the dollar lower if it went past 128 yen.
The dollar slipped to 127.40 yen in New York, from 127.55 late on Tuesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 1.66 yen, to 127.01. Later, in London, it was quoted at 127.53 yen.
The British pound lost ground to the dollar, dropping to $1.7895 in New York, from $1.7970 on Tuesday. In London, the pound fell to $1.7880 from $1.8025.

HEADLINE: Big Profits From Risky Customers

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Mail-order shopping is largely a pursuit of the affluent, with companies like J. Peterman offering a $33 leather-brimmed baseball hat described as a "treasure."
But the Fingerhut Companies is making large profits pursuing customers that most cataloguers would not waste postage on. In fact, Fingerhut has grown into the nation's fourth-largest mail-order company by serving customers who on average have a household income of $24,000, about $5,000 less than the national average. 
 Selling goods on monthly installment plans, the company last year shipped enough $100 leather skirts, $150 gold rings in the shape of dolphins and $9.99 porcelain unicorn night lights to take in $1.4 billion in revenues.
Analysts said Fingerhut was one of the few cataloguers to show an increase in profits in 1991, a dismal year for most retailers. Last year, earnings climbed 12 percent, to $53.6 million; the year before, earnings rose 21 percent.
The stock of the Minneapolis-based company hit a 52-week high of $34.375 yesterday, up 50 cents from the previous day, on the New York Stock Exchange. Its 52-week low is $20.25, posted in February of last year.
"We can maneuver through recessionary times," said Theodore Deikel, the chairman and chief executive.
Fingerhut's success is built on selling merchandise on credit to shoppers who cannot get credit anywhere else. A few years ago, an issuer of Visa credit cards mailed applications to a sampling of Fingerhut's 13 million customers; 97 percent of the applicants were rejected as bad credit risks.
So, Fingerhut sells more than 99 percent of its products on the installment plan. Its catalogues show a department-store range of products from black lingerie ($5.09 a month) to brass crucifixes ($4.69 a month) to air pumps for inflating tires ($7.79 a month).
Maria L. Fernandez, a 53-year-old resident of Astoria, Queens, is still using the 127-piece flatware set she bought from Fingerhut nearly 20 years ago for $30. "They make it so easy with the payments," she said.
 
Analyzing the Risk
 After 44 years in business, Fingerhut has developed a sophisticated system to filter out bad credit risks. To glean clues, Fingerhut painstakingly analyzes the order form filled out by first-time customers. If a customer uses a pencil rather than a pen to order a color television, a red flag goes up. Failure to include a middle initial is another strike. Deadbeats often print, rather than sign, their names on the signature line, Fingerhut has learned over the years. Not having a home phone is another bad sign.
The company also uses traditional credit reports in making a final judgment about a customer.
Another way Fingerhut covers its risk is with monthly installment prices that translate into an effective annual interest rate of 24 percent, estimates Carol M. Clark, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Company in Minneapolis.
But analysts say the company does not make money as a financing operation. The high interest rate is needed to cover an equally high number of bad debts. Last year, the company set aside about 13.6 percent of its sales to cover bills it could not collect. In contrast, Mastercard International said 4.86 percent of its charges went bad in the third quarter of 1991; for all of 1990, Mastercard's bad-debt experience was 3.61 percent, a rate typical of the credit card industry.
Wall Street has been concerned that Fingerhut's customer base makes the company vulnerable to increased bad debts in hard economic times. To allay those fears, Fingerhut deliberately ratcheted down its bad-debt level to 13.6 percent of sales in 1991, compared with 15 percent the year before. The company raised its credit standards and rejected more potential customers.
"We manage our bad debt, the economy doesn't," said Michael E. Qualen, the chief financial officer. "We wanted to prove that this year."
 
An Uncrowded Market
 Fingerhut does not have a lot of competition in the mailbox. "The vast majority of catalogue retailers chase the upscale market," said Ms. Clark, the analyst. She said the typical Sears, J. C. Penney or Spiegel mail-order customer earns considerably more than a Fingerhut customer.
"The higher the income, the greater the propensity to shop by mail or phone," said Chester Dalzell, a spokesman for the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group in New York. Mr. Dalzell said time-pressed two-income couples like the convenience of shopping while lounging in bed or watching television.
Despite its strong perfomance, Fingerhut's shares have a far lower price-earnings ratio than other mail-order retailers. The ratio, the price of a stock divided by its earnings per share, is a good measure of how investors view a stock's growth potential.
"This company is calling on a client base that is difficult for a lot of us to identify with," Ms. Clark said.
Mr. Deikel, the company's chairman, said : "You get the feeling that some people are elitist. Typically, our customer base does not get a lot of respect."
That may begin to change as Fingerhut sets its sights on a slightly more affluent customer base through a joint venture with Montgomery Ward & Company. Last year, the two companies formed Montgomery Ward Direct to mail catalogues to Ward's 10 million credit card customers. Ward's chairman, Bernard F. Brennan, has said he expects the venture to be a $500 million business by 1995.
Fingerhut is working to improve the quality of its merchandise, some of which has been somewhat shoddy in the past. Fingerhut recently appeared near the bottom of a Consumer Report customer satisfication survey on mail-order companies. Ms. Clark, the analyst, said the towels carried by Fingerhut several years ago let through more light than a window.
About 72 percent of its merchandise is name-brand products like Sony Walkmans or Kitchen Aid mixers, up from 65 percent name-brand goods two years ago.
Toasters, blenders and other housewares account for nearly 20 percent of Fingerhut sales. Electronics, including Pioneer car stereos and Yamaha electronic drum pads, make up 17 percent of sales.
Fingerhut first offered shares, with an initial price of $16.50 each, in 1990, when it was spun off from the Primerica Corporation, a financial-services company. Primerica still owns about 40 percent of Fingerhut, but is gradually reducing its stake.

HEADLINE: Allegory or Your Money Back

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
THE great leap forward in East-West relations is about to take a strange turn. Three Russian emigres now living in New York have been shopping around for the real America. They think they have found it. At Sears.
Constantin Boym, a furniture designer, and his friends Vitaly Komar and Alex Melamid, the conceptual artists, have issued their two-part manifesto:
"Sears products exemplify the contemporary American esthetic for heavy-duty beauty." -- Komar and Melamid 
 "Some things are beautiful. Some things are ugly. Some things are Searsy." -- Boym
"Searstyle" is a not totally ironic design movement that Mr. Boym is calling "the design alternative for the 90's." An exploration of what he termed the "visual and emotional heritage of Sears," it will be unveiled on Feb. 21 when his "Searstyle Furniture" exhibition opens at the Full scale Gallery, 242 West 27th Street.
The next day, an exhibition of "Searstyle Fine Art" by Komar and Melamid, which will feature the Kenmore Symphony, a musical recording of the inside of a Sears refrigerator, opens at the Ronald Feldman gallery, 31 Mercer Street (Grand Street).
Perhaps it takes a non-American perspective to understand and appreciate the real Sears, the repressed Sears.
"Of course, is beautiful!" Mr. Melamid said of such all-American wonders from the current Sears catalogue as the Magazine Rack Floor Lamp, a combination of three objects in one (page 1342; $109.99 for one; $89.99 each for two or more). "Sears is the hidden treasury of America." he added.
According to Richard S. Tedlow, a business historian, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was asked what American book he would give to every Russian, his answer was the Sears catalogue. But F.D.R. could not have predicted Searstyle.
Mr. Boym, Mr. Melamid and Mr. Komar have yet to inform Sears about their movement. But like any self-respecting promoters, they have big plans. "Searstyle" comes with its own press kit and campaign button (though not Sears's money-back guarantee).
It also has a fashion component. The three have commissioned John Mincarelli, who teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology, to design vintage Searstyle clothes, including a mousey beige man's jacket with wood-grain lapels. (They disapprove of Sears's recent move to go stylish in its clothing department.)
A Sears spokesman in Chicago, told of the forthcoming exhibits, said yesterday: "We obviously have not seen the designs so we can't comment. But we certainly would agree with their assessment that Sears is about as American as you can get."
The three friends, who all grew up in Moscow but met in New York, conceived of Searstyle two summers ago while vacationing in a summer cottage decorated with Sears wood-grain walls, in a place prophetically called Vinalhaven, Me.
"When you step into an American interior, your heart beats differently," explained Mr. Melamid, who immigrated to New York 14 years ago. "We are interested in things that define this life, in the power of the environment. We're formed by invisible things we don't pay attention to, like refrigerators. So we try to capture the lost beauty of Sears."
The ubiquity of Sears, once a mail-order symbol of middle American aspirations, came home to Mr. Melamid when he moved into a condominium in New Jersey and realized that his refrigerator was a Kenmore. "I said, Kenmore? What was this Kenmore?"
"Then I realized," he said, eyes widening in the manner of Merle Oberon proclaiming, "I am Heathcliff!"
"Kenmore was Sears."
For Mr. Boym, who started his own design studio in New York in 1986, the Sears catalogue is an inexhaustible source of design inspiration. "There's modern, there's kitsch and there's Sears," he said. Sears is the home of autumn wheat vinyl, putty vinyl, Indian brown medium vinyl, dusty rose vinyl, dove gray vinyl, seafoam vinyl and pale sunflower vinyl, among other splendors.
"It is a symbol of all those good, practical, dependable things America has given the world," he said. "Honest things. Democratic things. Things that work. Things that are about necessity, not style."
Mr. Boym's esthetic fearlessness seems to know no bounds. He is happy to tell you, not totally in jest, that America's greatest furniture design is the La-Z-Boy recliner. To high-minded designers, such a statement is about as popular as Japanese leaders' comments about the laziness of the American worker.
To illustrate his convictions, Mr. Boym ordered "authentic" bits and pieces from the Sears catalogue -- including that icon of American leisure the corduroy backrest -- and reconfigured them as elements in chairs and tables of his own design.
To leaf through the catalogue with Mr. Boym is to see America anew.
On seat cushions: "They represent Americans' fondness for comfort and softness. So there are hundreds of them!"
On synthetic materials: "They're not ashamed!"
On nylon plush toilet seat covers: "Bathrooms are an important part of the American life style. So there are an abundance of things, all good and accessible."
In his Searstyle exhibit, sponsored by the Formica Corporation, Mr. Boym mixes the new and the familiar, attaching a blue Sears corduroy backrest, for example, to a modern seat and legs. The results are not as comfortable as a La-Z-Boy. But it's the thought that counts.
"I want to bring the language of Sears into contemporary design," Mr. Boym said. "If I exhibited Sears chairs by themselves, nobody would get it."
Komar and Melamid's Searstyle art consists of grainy beige and brown fake-wood-printed panels ("hand cut from genuine plywood"). Each panel has a word on it, and they can be combined to form statements like "Oh, Heavy Dark Hot Sears."
The idea is to let customers combine panels to their own specifications, as if they were ordering chair legs or cushions from the Sears catalogue. But the prices are not Searsy: the panels cost $2,100 for the first three and $500 each thereafter.
At the gallery, Komar and Melamid's installation will include a pyramid assembled from the effluvia of American consumer culture: washing machines, television sets and bottles of Fantastik cleaner. The televisions will broadcast sitcoms, but there will be a crying track instead of a laugh track.
Though they profess to love Sears's "lost beauty," which they honored recently by spraying a green rubber plant brown, a palpable touch of pessimism seems to be mixed in with the paint.
"Life in America is not very cheerful," Mr. Melamid said. "It's almond. It's brown. It's Searsy."
The three maintain that they are not judging middle American taste, but rather recording Sears the way an anthropologist might, as a sort of American potlatch gone crazy. They say their goal is to create an American equivalent of the Italian Memphis design movement, to do for Sears what Robert Venturi's "Learning From Las Vegas" did for Las Vegas (causing acceptance, that is, among snobby intellectuals who wouldn't be caught dead there).
Whether their view is celebratory or satiric depends on whether the observer grew up loving Sears or wishing that America's supply of wood-grained plastic could be shipped off to Siberia.
But they assert that their back-to-basics Searstyle fits in with both the "poverty of spirit" of the 1990's and the current economic recession. For those who woke up with a hangover from the overly designed 1980's, it is stylistic Alka-Seltzer.
"America has its own taste, and it should go for it," Mr. Melamid said. "It may not be beautiful. But it's powerful, that's for sure."

HEADLINE: Carnegie Plans Jazz Series and Four Workshops

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
Carnegie Hall's plans for its 1992-93 season include the introduction of a new jazz series, the expansion of the professional training workshops that the hall started in 1990, and about 100 orchestral concerts, chamber performances and recitals.
In announcing the season yesterday, Carnegie Hall's executive director, Judith Arron, said the hall would be presenting about the same number of concerts as this season, though slightly fewer than it presented in 1990-91, when it was celebrating its centennial. 
 Mrs. Arron acknowledged that raising money to pay for the hall's presentations was increasingly difficult in the current economic climate. But the major events in the new schedule are not fundamentally different from those Carnegie has traditionally offered.
 
Met Orchestra at Carnegie
 Among the highlights of the hall's 102d season are the first Carnegie Hall appearances by La Scala Orchestra and Chorus, which is to give two performances of the Verdi Requiem with Riccardo Muti conducting in October. The Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Sir Georg Solti, is to give three concerts next February. Other international orchestras visiting the hall include the Philharmonia Orchestra of London, conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli; the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, led by Charles Dutoit, and the Royal Philharmonic, with Vladimir Ashkenazy.
The American orchestras the hall is presenting include the Cleveland, Philadelphia, Boston and San Francisco Symphony Orchestras, along with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.
David Zinman will conduct the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of a work by George Perle that was commissioned by Carnegie Hall. And Leonard Slatkin is to conduct the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in two concert-length contemporary works, Peter Maxwell Davies's "Worldes Blis," in its New York premiere, and William Bolcom's polystylistic "Songs of Innocence and Experience." And James Levine will conduct the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in two concerts.
 
Tributes to Davis and Garner
 Among the soloists who are to play their only New York recitals next season at Carnegie are the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, the soprano Jessye Norman, the mezzo-sopranos Frederica von Stade and Christa Ludwig, the baritone Thomas Hampson and the pianists Yevgeny Kissin, Murray Perahia, Horacio Gutierrez, Mitsuko Uchida and Alicia de Larrocha.
The new jazz series is to include four concerts by the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, led by Jon Faddis. The programs are a "Saxophone Summit" and tributes to Miles Davis, Errol Garner and Tito Puente.
There will be four professional training workshops. Robert Shaw, who has led workshops in the Brahms "German Requiem" and Beethoven's Missa Solemnis in past seasons, will conduct a choral workshop in the Berlioz Requiem next year. Pierre Boulez will lead a conducting workshop on music of Debussy and Messiaen. Alfred Brendel will conduct a seminar on the Beethoven piano sonatas. And Isaac Stern will lead a chamber music workshop for young musicians.

Black Conservatives Get A Chance to Be Heard

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
They are a minority within a minority, and until recently television scarcely acknowledged the existence of black conservatives. But as hopes have faded that once-popular liberal programs can do much about the pathologies of the inner cities, critics of the welfare state have been getting more of a hearing. "Black American Conservatism: An Exploration of Ideas," at 10 tonight on Channel 13, offers views that go smack against the policies of leaders of the major black organizations and the opinions of most black voters as well as the disposition of public broadcasting itself.
The hour, paid for largely by conservative foundations, does not have much visual kick. It consists in the main of expositions of the conservative position by Dr. Alan L. Keyes, who has served in the Reagan and Bush Administrations; Robert L. Woodson, a disenchanted N.A.A.C.P. member, who is now the president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise; Joseph Perkins, an editorial writer for The San Diego Union, and like-minded exponents of black self-help. 
 In interviews with Clarence E. Page, the Chicago Tribune columnist who serves as host, they make the case that the values of family, religion, education and self-achievement that run deep in black America have been undermined by welfare programs operated by what Mr. Woodson calls "the poverty Pentagon," professionals whose own welfare depends on the existence of a permanent underclass.
'It's the victim's responsibility to get up," says Mr. Woodson, whose organization works for local initiatives. The call here is not for more affirmative action or school busing, but for seed money for small businesses and community enterprise.
The camera visits a few apparent successes, especially a Washington housing project, whose residents, helped by some Federal money, cleaned up their neighborhood. The woman in charge points proudly to the well-kept streets, the flowers and, above all, the feeling of having done it themselves. "Everyone wants to own their own," she says.
Mr. Page notes that the debate among black Americans over the best road to equality and success did not begin just the other day. Booker T. Washington's post-Civil War vision of gradual economic achievement through education was later written off as appeasement by W. E. B. Du Bois, who demanded full equality at once.
Tonight's company is on the side of Booker T. Washington and highly critical of the black Establishment, which Mr. Perkins charges with practicing "a politics of victimization." Despite the endless stories in newspapers and on television, he emphasizes, most blacks are not jobless or in jail. He says the significant growth of a black middle class in the past decade has been ignored.
No viewer is likely to come away from tonight's session convinced that conservatives have the answers to the crime, drugs, unemployment and broken families that continue to ravage the inner cities. But at the very least, the unorthodox opinions put forth here warrant a hearing. As with other hard subjects, public television fulfills its mandate when it spices its programming with views that question its viewers' assumptions and its own standard pieties.

SCRIPT
 
"Hi, I'm Pat Buchanan. In three years, New Hampshire has lost 50,000 jobs; 5,000 more were lost last month. These numbers translate into human suffering. I've seen its face at the unemployment offices at Concord, Manchester and Laconia. I've seen in the faces of women who break down as they talk of how their husbands have lost their jobs, how they can't meet the mortgages; how they're about to lose their homes.
 "I know the pain up here. You can't miss it if you travel New Hampshire as I have for nine weeks. And until I came up and announced my candidacy, those people in Washington behaved as if they did not care.

HEADLINE: How to Squeeze Saddam Hussein

 BODY:
A year after the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein still struts. Millions of Iraqi Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis grow restless in the grip of hunger and high prices. The beaten Iraqi Army ponders its loyalties and its own best interests. Can't something decisive be done?
President Bush, like many Americans, longs impatiently for such a resolution. Late last year he authorized the C.I.A. to foment internal military action against Saddam Hussein and asked the Pentagon to plan military moves in support of any revolt. 
 But a forced resolution, however consummately wished, bears greater dangers than benefits. Given the present constellation of political forces in Iraq, U.S. military intervention makes no sense. The most reliable and effective lever for prying the dictator off his perch remains the international economic embargo.
One obvious way to try fomenting upheaval involves cliques, sects and rebels, notably the Kurds and Shiites who took up arms against Baghdad last year. Mr. Bush encouraged them -- only to stand by and permit their defeat at a time that U.S. forces could have kept Iraqi aircraft out of the skies.
But even if the U.S. could now help such rebels succeed, it would only trade one difficulty for another, more dangerous. Kurdish guerrillas and Shiite devotees of Iran-like theocracy are impressive fighters -- but not for democracy.
And even if opposition movements could agree long enough to start a coalition, they would have a hard time holding Iraq together. Today's standoff, admittedly frustrating, might well degenerate into regional war as Turkey, Syria and Iran moved to protect their interests.
If there are dangers to fomenting unrest this way, why not turn instead to secular democratic opponents of the regime? Because there aren't very many of them. They deserve maximum encouragement and diplomatic support. They may have a significant role to play in a future Iraq. But there's no practical way to install them except at gunpoint -- and to do that would risk turning true democrats into powerless puppets.
The third way to intervene would be to try inciting rebellion within the Iraqi Army. Other Iraqi commanders, even if they turned out to be just as dictatorial as Saddam Hussein, might nonetheless prove more amenable to the expectations and norms of the outside world. Then again, they might not. The history of C.I.A.-sponsored military coups around the world is not encouraging.
That leaves one other approach -- international embargo. It's a slow, unglamorous method. But for certain ends, sanctions work well. Under the present embargo, Iraq can no longer shop the world for arms. It no longer poses immediate danger to its neighbors. Baghdad callously spurns all U.N. offers of humanitarian relief; even so, it pays the price in growing popular discontent.
The U.S. has honorable reason to encourage Iraqis, from the sidelines, to rid themselves of Saddam Hussein. And America has a special interest in encouraging Iraqi democrats to prepare for a larger political role. But there is no reason to risk turning frustration into disaster. Push Saddam Hussein -- with sanctions.

HEADLINE: Free Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao

 BODY:
President Bush, having encouraged China's hard-liners last month by meeting with Prime Minister Li Peng in New York, could now redress the balance: Appeal for the immediate release of Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao.
Li Peng himself is said to have called these two imprisoned democrats the "old tigers of four dynasties." They have participated in all four of the pro-democracy movements in China since the close of the Maoist era. 
 A year ago this week, Mr. Chen and Mr. Wang drew grotesque 13-year prison terms for their role in the 1989 Tiananmen protests. Washington argues that isolating China will not help democrats there. Yes, but if maintaining official contact has value, it should allow troubling issues to be raised.
Mr. Chen is an economist. Mr. Wang, dangerously ill and denied proper medical treatment, is a journalist. Together they created institutions like the Beijing Social and Economic Sciences Research Institute that enabled China's democracy movement to transcend street protest.
The two men linked generations, students and society, reformers inside the system and radical democrats outside. They represent China's best hope for democratic modernization without breakdown and violence. Characteristically, they used their trials last year to promote respect for law.
Untold thousands suffer in the Chinese gulag. Most of their names remain unknown in the West. All the more reason for America to urge freedom for Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Two Nations

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
When President Bush expressed amazement last week at a supermarket's electronic checkout scanner, he was ribbed for being so out of touch with American life. Commentators went on to remark that high government officials as a group, with their chauffeured lives, are cushioned from reality.
Fair enough. But the episode of the President and the unfamiliar supermarket suggests a broader point, a much more serious one. 
 Upper-income Americans generally, whether in public or private employment, live not just a better life but one quite removed from that of ordinary families. They hardly experience the problems that weigh so heavily today on American society. And that fact has dangerous political consequences.
Health care, for example. The possibility of serious illness without insured care is now said to be the number one worry of Americans: not just the 30 million without any health insurance but the many millions more who have inadequate coverage or who are afraid to change jobs lest they lose protection.
President Bush does not have those concerns. He gets socialized medicine: care at public expense. Congressmen and other top officials may also be treated in government hospitals. Nor is health insurance likely to be a concern for private Americans with incomes in the top 20 percent. Comprehensive coverage goes with the territory for them.
Or consider education. Public schools are among the most depressing features of contemporary life in this country, turning out young people unable to cope with the demands of a technological society -- and culturally backward. Better-off families simply opt out of that problem. In large numbers, they send their children to private schools.
Crime is a menacing fact of daily life for millions of Americans; whole neighborhoods are unsafe. Of course the better-off may also be victims. But they increasingly protect themselves by living with alarm systems or in units with private security guards.
All this refers not just to the super-rich, the Lee Iacoccas whose inflated earnings have lately been so much discussed. The top 20 percent income bracket includes business and financial people and professionals of all kinds: lawyers, doctors, journalists.
A friend of mine, a writer and editor, was at an economic conference in Switzerland recently. He is certainly not among the American rich. But he said he realized during that meeting how people of his professional class had come to have a qualitatively different life from most Americans.
"For the elite, life really is sweeter than it used to be," he said. "Food is so much better. Hotels are more sumptuous. The variety of amusements available, the sports, the travel -- it's a cornucopia. For the few." And there's the rub: it is for the few. The top 20 percent of Americans now get 47 percent of the country's total income. The bottom fifth get 3.9 percent.
The gap between rich and poor in America is far and away the widest in the developed world. It has widened dramatically in the last 10 years, both because real incomes have grown at the top and shrunk at the bottom and because Reagan-Bush tax and other policies have exacerbated the differential.
America is more like the ancien regime in France than ever before. But luxury is not just for royalty and a handful of nobles. It is for the top 20 percent. That is a lot of people. And therein lie political consequences.
The professionals, the rich and the upper-middle-class families in the top 20 percent have the most political influence in this country. They care, they vote, they contribute to politicians. And quite naturally, not out of evil, they will tend to favor their own interest.
No one should really be surprised, then, that tax rates on upper incomes are so much lower in the United States than in Japan or European countries. It is not hard to understand why George Bush talks about the need to improve public education but puts no money where his mouth is.
In a democracy where a substantial top slice of the population is insulated from the country's most corrosive problems, it is politically very difficult to deal with those problems. And the rest of the people, the majority who live with them, become increasingly cynical about government and politics.
It is not a recipe for a healthy democratic society.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Welfare Law Strengthens Families

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The $64 Question," Anna Quindlen's Jan. 22 column, describes the plight of welfare recipients, frustrated and disillusioned by their inability to go from poverty to self-sufficiency; but her portrayal of New Jersey's new welfare reform misses the mark. Indeed, she ignores the primary focus of New Jersey's new program: reuniting and strengthening the family.
Ms. Quindlen begins by questioning whether or not those who formed the law sought input from those who would be affected by it. 
 This package was not drafted in a vacuum. Welfare recipients expressed their views on job opportunity, affordable health care, child care and other obstacles they encounter to legislative committee hearings last year held in such settings as a public housing project in Newark, a drug rehabilitation center in Atlantic City and a day care center for welfare mothers in Camden.
We developed a program to insure that each member of the welfare family attains, at a minimum, either a high school education or a vocational skill. While each family member is being educated or trained, the state will provide support services such as day care, family counseling and, if necessary, substance abuse counseling and treatment.
Efforts will be developed with the private sector so that people are trained for the job market of today as well as that of the future. The goal is to prepare welfare recipients not only to enter the work force, but also to have skills to move up the economic ladder, providing hope and a future for themselves and their children.
Even though New Jersey's government will play a more active role in making welfare recipients self-sufficient, the new law looks to the nuclear family as the real driving force.
Ms. Quindlen does not address how the welfare system actually divides the impoverished family. New Jersey's system financially penalized welfare mothers who marry. It also reduced grants when both parents reside in the home. The new law removes the system's financial disincentives for marriage and family unity. It uses education, vocational training and other means of self-improvement to help pull together the fragmented welfare family.
Ms. Quindlen states that denying additional benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children "suggests that poor women have kids for the money."
To the contrary, the new law stimulates self-reliance because it allows welfare mothers to collect their full benefits while earning an income equal to 50 percent of their grant. The law is based on the premise that individuals on welfare can make responsible decisions.
Life is about decisions, and decisions often revolve around the family.
A middle-class or a working-poor wage earner not on welfare does not go to the boss and say, "I'm having another child, so I'm entitled to a raise." The wage earner works extra hours, gets a part-time job or adjusts the family budget to provide for the new arrival. There is nothing wrong with instilling this responsible, work ethic in poor people as they become better educated, better skilled and self-sufficient.
The failed system sells poor people short. It refuses to recognize that the poor can have the same values, aspirations and abilities as anyone else.
Our new law is a compassionate common-sense attempt to break the cycle of poverty that has trapped generations of New Jerseyans.
Until today, New Jersey's welfare system has simply fed recipients fish for a day. Now we will begin to teach recipients how to become fishers so they can feed themselves for a lifetime.

HEADLINE: What Soviet Experience Doesn't Tell Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Milton Friedman supports his defense of Reaganomics by references to "experience throughout the world, from the United States to the former Soviet empire" (Op-Ed, Feb. 2). There is a case for small government, but the collapse of the Soviet Union adds nothing of relevance to it.
The Soviet Union was not simply an extreme instance of government intervention in an economy, but of a government trying to run the whole economy. It is absurd to oppose the Clean Air Act and Americans With Disabilities Act because of the inefficiencies of the Soviet bureaucracy. 
 The collapse of the Soviet empire has led to a confounding of two enduring conversations. One concerns whether capitalism or socialism is a better way to run an economy. The other concerns whether or not, and under what conditions, government should intervene in a capitalist economy. Massive defection from Soviet-style socialism supports the case for capitalism, but does not tell us laissez-faire capitalism is the best form capitalism can take.
As Professor Friedman notes, there is much experience throughout the world on government involvement in economic affairs, but the experience relevant for the United States is that of other democratic capitalist countries: why conservative Germany maintains a national health insurance program, why welfare-state Sweden does not have a minimum-wage law, whether Japan has grown because of or despite its national industrial policy.
These are all relevant to American policy, but the Soviet collapse should not be interpreted as a stick with which to beat up on any and all government programs in a capitalist democracy.

HEADLINE: A Swarm of Gypsy Cabs

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Just seven years ago, Richie's Car Service had 50 cars that shuttled hundreds of New Yorkers each day between the 179th Street subway station at the end of the F line in Jamaica and their homes in the semi-suburban sprawl of eastern and southeastern Queens.
Today, Richie's -- run from a white trailer that sits on cement blocks next to Hillside Avenue -- has shrunk to 25 cars, a victim not of the recession, its owners say, but of a proliferation of unlicensed, or gypsy, taxicabs. 
 "The gypsies keep gnawing at us like locusts," said Frank Manzella, who has run the car service, along with a partner, Richard DeLeuil, for 25 years.
Mr. Manzella and 250 other car-service owners, who provide most of the legitimate taxi service available outside Manhattan, banded together last year to seek help from the Dinkins administration. They want the city to drive out the gypsy operators, and they want the right, now enjoyed only by yellow, or medallion, taxicabs, to pick up people who hail them on the street.
In response, Mayor David N. Dinkins came up with an ambitious plan -- one more far-reaching than Mr. Manzella had imagined or wanted -- to overhaul the city's fragmented taxi industry. The plan, announced two weeks ago, would increase sixfold the amount of money the city spends to keep the gypsy cabs from stealing the business of licensed taxis.
It would also fundamentally reorganize New York's taxi industry, creating two new medallions: one for livery operators outside central Manhattan and another for the fancier radio-car services, known as "black cars," that operate in Manhattan's business districts.
But whether the plan will improve taxi service in the boroughs outside Manhattan has become a matter of debate. Experts say it is unclear whether middle-class, less densely populated neighborhoods need or want to hail cabs. Nor did Mayor's proposal win immediate support from Mr. Manzella and the car-service operators he represents as co-director of the Livery Owners Coalition of New York.
Mr. Manzella, a gruff, plain-spoken man, said that the Mayor's plan was seriously flawed. Mr. Manzella, who runs the business end of Richie's from a cramped little office in the rear of the trailer -- while Mr. DeLeuil oversees the chaos out front, dispatching drivers, is balking at the price of the new livery medallion, perhaps $15,000 a car.
 
Roaming and Unlicensed
 He and other car-service operators are skeptical about the city's ability to deliver on its promise of better enforcement against illegal operators.
Mr. Manzella said he had been trying for years, without success, to get the city to do something about the dozens of gypsy cabs that lurk on the side streets just off Hillside Avenue, waiting for people to leave the last stop on the F line. Mr. Manzella said his business would expand by as much as 50 percent if the city could get rid of the gypsies.
But he does not expect that to happen soon, and he points to other parts of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx where illegal operators also seem to roam with impunity.
In Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, for example, many car services have set up shop in storefronts, put out large signs and handed out fliers, going into business without even a nod toward city regulators.
Rick Versace, who owns Apple Express, a radio-car service in Bay Ridge, said that his is one of only three or four licensed agencies in the neighborhood. He contended that there were more than a dozen other car services in the area that were operating illegally.
A reporter and photographer recently examined 10 livery-service storefronts in Bay Ridge. None displayed a city permit to operate what the industry calls a car service base, with telephones, two-way radios and at least 10 cabs.
In fact, only 3 of the 10 car services were properly licensed, said Rebecca Bowser, a spokeswoman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Illegal storefront operations are especially a problem in Bay Ridge and Borough Park, Ms. Bowser said, although city officials do not know why.
One operation in Bay Ridge is particularly subterranean. Called Ridgeview Services, it is run out of an insurance broker's office at 6743 Third Avenue. In the corner of the front window of the streetfront office is a small sign that says Ridgeview Services. On the sidewalk is a sign with a phone number.
A reporter who called the number was told that Ridgeview was a car service, and, upon request, was given the price for rides to various airports. Ms. Bowser said city officials were aware that Ridgeview was an illegal car service and had recently issued it a summons.
One part of the Dinkins plan that pleased livery owners was a proposal to give them the same right now enjoyed only by the 11,787 yellow cabs, which operate primarily in central and downtown Manhattan and at the airports: picking up street hails.
Riders in the boroughs outside Manhattan were divided, though, on whether they want to hail livery cabs on the street.
"Sure, I'd like that, it's convenient," said Timothy Curley, as he stepped into a livery cab in Bay Ridge one evening on his way home from work. "If you can just hail them, you're in the cab one, two, three, and you can go."
But others, especially women and older people, say they enjoyed the security and familiarity of the radio-cab companies that they use frequently. They said they would be reluctant to hail just any cab on the street.
"I know the guys here and I like them," said Anna Ferrero, who was waiting for a cab at Apple Express's storefront on Bay Ridge Avenue. "I wouldn't take another car service."
 
Need to Hail Cabs
 Experts on New York's taxi industry said it was uncertain how Mr. Dinkins's proposal would affect cab service outside central Manhattan.
In middle-class, less densely populated areas, people have grown accustomed to the radio-cab services and are not likely to feel a pressing need to hail cabs on the streets, taxi-industry experts said.
But there may be many situations when middle-class New Yorkers would profit from being able to do so: older people who grow tired while on a long walk, for example, or shoppers loaded down with more packages than they had anticipated.
"You can get street hails in Manhattan," said Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens. "Why shouldn't we have the same service in Queens?"
 
Poor Would Benefit
 People in poor neighborhoods would clearly benefit from being permitted legally to hail a cab. Many poor people do not have telephones, so they cannot use the radio-car services in their areas, said Fidel F. Del Valle, the chairman of the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Street hailing of livery cabs is common in many poor neighborhoods, said Kenny Arthur, who once drove a gypsy cab and now runs a car service in East New York, Brooklyn. He said that the riding public would benefit if the city were to make the practice legal, while also upgrading the status of livery cabs and its regulation of the industry.
Livery owners say that people who use gypsy cabs are generally unaware that the cars are unlicensed and improperly insured. They say that the gypsies steal their business by undercutting their rates, because owners of unlicensed cabs have few of the expenses required of legal operators, from insurance to workers' compensation for drivers to various city and state fees and taxes.
At stake in the Mayor's initiative, the car-service operators say, is the survival of their businesses, which offer licensed taxi service to most of the city's residential neighborhoods, from the South Bronx and Washington Heights to Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bay Ridge.
 
Reasons for an Overhaul

 
 There are an estimated 30,000 livery cabs in New York. The city's Taxi and Limousine Commission estimates that there are an additional 8,000 unlicensed gypsy cabs, although the livery operators say there may be as many as 30,000.
Mr. Del Valle, the taxi commission's chairman, said there were two compelling reasons to overhaul the system. It would be "the height of hypocrisy," he said, for the city to continue to prohibit radio cars from picking up street hails outside Manhattan when officials know the practice is widespread in many places.
There was also "a very grim, raw reality" that compelled the city to act against the gypsy cabs, Mr. Del Valle said. "We may not be licensing anybody in a few years if we let the illegals put the livery services out of business."
The car-service owners said they were encouraged, at least, that the city was recognizing that they had serious problems.
"Why is it that a monopoly of guys, 11,787 of them, can have a monopoly in the city of New York, and 30,000 other guys are doing virtually the same thing?" Mr. Arthur asked. "It's unfair to the public and it's unfair to the industry."

HEADLINE: Getting 'em to the Primary on Time

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOOKSETT, N.H., Feb. 7

 BODY:
Every four years, when the national spotlight shines on New Hampshire's Presidential primary, Stephen Singer implements his long-held business philosophy: take advantage of the environment around you.
Since 1972, Mr. Singer, executive vice president of Merchants Rent A Car, has been actively campaigning to get Presidential candidates and their workers to rent cars from his family's business. Merchants Rent A Car has rented to politicians on both sides of the aisle, from Ronald Reagan and George Bush to Morris Udall, the former Arizona Congressman who ran for President in the 1970's and won Mr. Singer's lifelong admiration for handing over his personal credit card to insure that Mr. Singer got paid for his cars. 
 When campaigns were flush with funds, the New Hampshire primary meant about $100,000 in additional revenue for Merchants, which is only a part of the Singer family business. Besides its fleet of 7,000 rental cars and vans, it operates new- and used-car dealerships in southern New Hampshire from its headquarters here near Manchester.
But this year, with the recession, the candidates, the staff members and the press seem to be using fewer cars for shorter amounts of time, Mr. Singer said. Merchants said it would bring in only about $25,000 renting cars and vans to its customers here for the primary. The clients include President Bush, who is also a steady customer when his entourage is in Kennebunkport, Me., and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Merchants is also renting to several of the lesser-known candidates (there are 62 announced candidates in the New Hampshire primary) and media crews from the Cable News Network and other television networks.
Surprisingly, the politicians are not insisting on renting American cars. Their chief concern is for cars and vans with air bags on the passenger side, where candidates often ride, Mr. Singer said.
Just how a candidate's staff arranges for a rented car -- and takes care of it -- says a lot to Mr. Singer's experienced eye. The Bush campaign had big plans for a recent weekend and reserved 10 of Merchants' 15 passenger vans. But then it scaled back its order to take the vehicles for one day only, presumably to go easy on the budget, Mr. Singer said.
 
Clinton Plans Ahead
 The Clinton campaign, on the other hand, seems to be able to plan ahead and save, Mr. Singer said. It wanted 45 vans, which Merchants usually rents for $100 each a day. But it negotiated early for the vehicles and got a package deal, renting 30 for $60 rates and 15 for $70 a day.
"By far he has the strongest and best organization in the primary," Mr. Singer said of Mr. Clinton. Mr. Singer labels himself an independent.
The Presidential primary means an infusion of cash for businesses throughout the state. George Mandis, general manager of the Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn in Manchester, believes the primary will pour $10 million into New Hampshire restaurants, hotels, newspapers, broadcasters, rental-car offices and local service businesses like printers.
His hotel, which is the traditional media headquarters during the campaign as well as the home away from home for many of the candidates, is booked solid from early February until the primary next Tuesday. Things are so tight that even Vice President Dan Quayle could not get a room recently.
 
Tighter Travel Budgets
 Just how much money pours into the state is hard to measure. The state's Office of Resources and Economic Development would not hazard a guess, nor would Thomas Duffy, a senior planner with the Office of State Planning. Whatever the amount, "it helps," Mr. Duffy said, "but it isn't going to turn our economy around."
Mr. Mandis believes visitors are spending less than in 1988, in part reflecting tighter travel budgets for the news media.
"The television networks used to buy whatever they needed," he said. "Now they either rent it or bring it with them. In 1988 they bought a bunch of brand new refrigerators and then just left them here. You won't see that happen now."
At Merchants Rent A Car, Mr. Singer does not appear particularly concerned about this year's slowdown. Merchants remains profitable, he said, because of its diversity. Though new-car sales in its foreign-car dealerships are "very soft," the used-car and car-rental business is up 50 percent from a year earlier.
Mr. Singer, who runs Merchants along with four younger brothers and a brother-in-law, aggressively pursues new accounts and builds repeat business with a philosophy instilled by his father, Irving, who died last year. The elder Mr. Singer, who once drove chickens from farms to processing plants, opened a used-car dealership in 1962.
When Mr. Singer was finishing business school at New York University in 1971, his father asked him to join the business. One of the son's first ideas was to pursue the primary candidates as customers.
He put together a list of the candidates and wrote letters offering special packages of discount rates and unlimited mileage to the campaign managers. He promised the coveted station wagons, and more recently he offered the vans and mini-vans that are essential to moving armies of volunteers and voters in the weeks leading up to the primary.
Mr. Singer said business in the primary election took off in 1976 when Merchants rented "hundreds of vehicles" to the campaigns of Jimmy Carter, Morris Udall and most of the other leading candidates. "Udall had so many of our vehicles that we said 'if he got elected President, someone from Merchants would be named Secretary of Transportation,' " Mr. Singer recalled.

HEADLINE: What About Rushdie?

BYLINE: By Paul Theroux; Paul Theroux is author of the forthcoming travel book, "The Happy Isles of Oceania."

DATELINE: HONOLULU

 BODY:
When the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini first issued his decree against Salman Rushdie three years ago tomorrow, I swear I thought it was a joke -- a very bad joke, a bit like "Papa Doc" Duvalier putting a voodoo curse on Graham Greene for writing "The Comedians," but a joke nevertheless, in the sense of being an example of furious but harmless flatulence -- just wind.
I thought the death sentence would be laughed off -- condemned as despicable, and then mocked. Of course, I did not foresee much merriment about "The Satanic Verses" in any Islamic state, where building blueprints have to be submitted to a board of Islamic scholars, the ulema, so that the authorities can make sure that no toilet faces Mecca. 
 Where toys and calendars and mugs based on the Muppet figure of "Miss Piggy" are dragged from shops by the religious police and ritually destroyed. Where there are equally batty and murderous-sounding fatwas, such as the recent one delivered by a Saudi Arabian official cleric that declared that as all Shiite Muslims are heretics they should all be killed.
You know you have traveled through the looking glass when you are in a land where Miss Piggy is seen as the very embodiment of evil.
How disgusting to see that so far the intimidation of fanatics has worked. Mr. Rushdie is in hiding, his book is still vilified, his life is still threatened. Most countries, including his own, Britain, are doing business with Iran, buying its oil and cashew nuts, and selling the Iranians new cars and wristwatches, and sending them paper and ink so they can print their fatuous laws.
Trading partners in Europe and the U.S. are treating the Islamic Republic of Iran as though it is a thoroughly rational place, when any fool can see that the Ayatollah's fatwa is barbarous, as well as, from the point of view of international law, an example of criminal incitement.
In Sydney, Australia, one of my taxi drivers was an economic refugee from Pakistan, a man of 60, with a science degree from Karachi University. We talked about the Koran for a while, and then I asked him about the fatwa. His bony hands tightened on the steering wheel: "Rushdie must die."
I had a similar encounter in rural Fiji. Also with a credulous Muslim. Naturally I set these people straight: I suggested to them that these were ignorant sentiments. And I mentioned my experiences to Mr. Rushdie's Australian publishers. These Australians, living in a democratic country, with a tradition of rugged individualism and a talent for being rude, said confidentially that they were frightened. One said, "Some of us have families."
This is all very discouraging. On a personal level people are muddled or uninterested; on an official and governmental level, the response has been weak and cowardly; on a religious level, the Muslims have either been supine or vindictive.
There is very little that Salman Rushdie can do himself. The task is for the rest of us to resist the notion that beheadings and ritual destruction of toys are rational and humane, and that a religious leader in one country has the power to condemn a citizen of another country to death for writing a book.
We often find ourselves in odd postures in our dealings with the Islamic world. It always strikes me as perverse when British and U.S. academics willingly go to any number of countries and teach in schools where women are segregated from men and the laws are medieval. They do it for the money.
The governments that have been timid in defending Mr. Rushdie's rights have been influenced by money, too. They need to see him as he is -- a hostage to much worse fanaticism than confined Terry Anderson or John McCarthy. It is not just Hezbollah but the entire Muslim world that has been urged to kill him.
The first step is for governments and world leaders to speak out on Salman Rushdie's behalf.
Then it is our turn -- the readers and writers. It is obvious that if any of us raises the fatwa in Iran or Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, or like-minded countries, Mr. Rushdie will be vilified and we will be hounded. But this ought not to be the case in the rest of the world. Any non-Muslim country with the rule of law ought to be a safe haven for Salman Rushdie, where he can walk the streets and ride the buses and live without fear of being set upon.
It is awkward to be talking about Muslims this way because Islam is one of the world's great religions and many of its tenets are humane. But Muslims who do not understand that we regard the fatwa as an aberration must be singled out, because only they pose a threat to Mr. Rushdie.
With his confinement in mind, I have made a point of asking all the Muslims I meet their views on Mr. Rushdie and his book. I have had some crisp replies, but I still think my little practice is salutary.
It ought to happen everywhere: first the question -- What about Rushdie? -- and if the answer is hostile, set them straight. This should also happen on an official level, whenever a world leader communicates with President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran. What about Rushdie? I have no doubt that eventually the message will get through, and he will be free.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
It's Indecision vs. Indifference In New Hampshire's Primary

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 13

 BODY:
Pauline Dowd swears it isn't The Draft or The Woman or even The Letter that makes her grimace when she sees Bill Clinton. It's not the The Health Question or The Massachusetts Greek Issue that irks her about Paul Tsongas, either.
"These guys just aren't the ones," said the 55-year-old social worker with certainty and a little sadness. "You know it when you've seen a guy who can be President. And you know it when you haven't." 
 Voters in New Hampshire are supposed to be crotchety and difficult to please. That's their job. Their moods are like Lava lamps: colorful, protean, impossible to describe. But despite raging political and philosophical differences, the residents of at least one of this city's neighborhoods clearly agree on one -- and maybe only one -- thing.
 
'We Don't Have to Like It'
 "Somebody's got to be President," said Jodie Banks, a 24-year-old paralegal and a neighbor of Mrs. Dowd and her husband, Paul, in Manchester's North End, a solidly middle-class enclave of freshly painted clapboard houses that many families have passed down for three generations. "But we don't have to like it."
Apparently, few do. In conversations with 27 residents in their homes here over the last two days, not one showed any real enthusiasm for a candidate or pride in his choice. Many said they were undecided; others said they were decidedly uninterested.
The problems of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, including the release Wednesday of a 1969 letter thanking an Army officer for saving him from the draft, may be impossible to overcome, but his support among those interviewed seemed weak even before the letter received wide attention Wednesday night on ABC News's "Nightline" and in today's newspapers.
New Hampshire is locked in a withering recession. Having lost more than 50,000 jobs in the last three years and with an unemployment rate in many towns nearing 10 percent, the choice this year presents far more than an exercise in people's rights. Voters who aren't numb are angry.
A remarkable boom was just about to peak for New Hampshire in the last election, and in this neighborhood -- slightly more Democratic than Republican -- the antipathy to President Bush emerged in discussions as the issue that drives all others.
 
Qualified Backing for Buchanan
 Residents of the North End want a change. Of eight people who said they voted for President Bush in 1988, only one said he would do so again, with deep reluctance, he hastened to add. Two said they would support Patrick J. Buchanan just to send a message to Mr. Bush. Both said they could never imagine a day when Mr. Buchanan would occupy the Oval Office.
And like a princess dreaming of a mattress without a pea beneath it, half of those interviewed offered wistful views of Democrats who got away, particularly the one from New York.
"Mario Cuomo would make a hell of a President," said David Deschener, a 41-year-old accountant with a wife and two children.
"These other guys have a lot going for them," he said. "They are smart and they hustle. But whatever it is you are supposed to have, Cuomo has it."
Many of Mr. Deschener's neighbors disagreed, strongly. They acknowledged the New York Governor's oratorical gifts, and some said they liked his programs, but almost all expressed anger at his willingness to encourage a write-in effort after he refused to enter the race.
"We believe in working for what we get around here," said Margaret Reed, a 78-year-old widow who, except for four years of college in New York, has spent her life in New Hampshire. "I don't care how smart he is. I don't want a President who can't bother to spend a few days talking to us, right here in the cold."
Perhaps because it has been in the news so much or because the people of New Hampshire get to act like savvy political consultants this time every four years, the idea of "electability" came up repeatedly.
Most said Governor Clinton seemed to have the money and the power, but they added that questions about his personal life could only hurt him. Virtually all insisted, however, that they couldn't care less if he had had an affair. More people said they admired his stance on the war in Vietnam and the draft than said they thought he was wrong or deceptive. None suggested he had anything to apologize for.
"I'm confused," said Bob Harden, 73, retired and a Democrat. "I was leaning toward Clinton but I just don't know if he's got the stuff to go all the way. But it sure doesn't bother me that he got out of the draft. What about Elvis Presley? He went, but he just sang songs the whole time. Is that better? Muhummad Ali said no and he's a great hero."
Mrs. Harden agreed, up to a point. A Republican, she doesn't see Clinton as a man who offers the solid direction she says the country desperately needs. But she joined her husband in defending any resistance to the war. "As if all these people writing these stories wouldn't have done the same thing in a minute," she said, sharply. "And they probably did."
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts ran away with the prize for congeniality, intellect and decency. Many people also mentioned his courage, and among those who have made their decision, Mr. Tsongas was easily the winner in at least this small, unrepresentative survey. But Erin O'Shaughnessy, a 22-year-old student at the University of New Hampshire who works part time at a video store, expressed a common reservation with tart specificity.
"I really like his message," she said. "I just wish we could get somebody else to give it."
 
Concerns About Tsongas
 Few said they would oppose Mr. Tsongas. But several raised the issue of his experience with cancer, wondering whether the stress of the Presidency might make him sick again. All seemed skeptical about his ability to beat President Bush.
"With Tsongas," said Ms. O'Shaughnessy, "you would want to look hard at the vice president." But she said she thought too many of her friends were looking around for a politician who could get elected instead of looking for somebody who represented their views cogently and with vigor.
"It's just kind of cold to vote that way," she added. "The trouble is nobody seems able to get us going."
Asked if she would say whom she supported, she declined.
"We don't do that here," she said. She admitted to an early weakness for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa that she overcame because of his "Japan bashing."

HEADLINE: POST OWNER SAYS HE MAY MAKE OFFER TO BUY DAILY NEWS

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Peter S. Kalikow, owner of The New York Post, said yesterday that he intended to make an offer to acquire the bankrupt Daily News, a move that is said to have the financial backing of the Bankers Trust Company.
The announcement raises the curtain on the formal effort to find a buyer for The News, a process that could become a complex bidding war in which representatives of the paper's owners, unions and creditors weigh competing offers and try to agree on a deal that will probably require sacrifices by all the parties. 
 Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Kalikow, said yesterday that Mr. Kalikow would not close The Post if he acquired The News, but short of that all other options were open, such as making The Post an afternoon paper, as it once was.
Though Mr. Kalikow is himself in bankruptcy because of the decline in value of his real-estate holdings, a person privy to Mr. Kalikow's actions who spoke on condition of anonymity said that he has already won the fundamental consent of Bankers Trust, one of his major creditors.
From the perspective of Mr. Kalikow's creditors, The Post would probably have very little value if someone else buys The News, but a combined News-Post operation could eventually have significant value, though attaining that value would require an investment now.
Buying The News would give Mr. Kalikow a Sunday edition, which The Post does not have and which is considered a key to long-term profitability for large papers. In addition, The Post is only marginally profitable and, should The News fall into other hands, The Post's survival could be in great jeopardy.
Mr. Kalikow's decision to make a highly public declaration of his interest in The News also prompted speculation that he might actually be seeking to call attention to the advantages of owning both The News and The Post, in effect declaring to other prospective buyers of The News that they should also buy The Post.
It is highly unlikely that Mr. Kalikow would buy The News in order to close it down, since most of the value of the deal would be in the circulation and advertising relationships the paper has built up over the years.
The person familiar with Mr. Kalikow's plans said that Mr. Kalikow is anticipating making a cash offer of about $50 million for The News, which would be used primarily to secure reductions in the work force and other concessions from unions. Some of that money could also be used to reduce the paper's $53 million debt. He plans to seek an additional $50 million line of credit from Bankers Trust as working capital.
But bankers said yesterday that such a significant investment by a bank in a bankruptcy would be most unusual and some expressed skepticism that Bankers Trust would actually make such a loan, given the uncertainty and competitiveness of New York's newspaper marketplace.
 
'Buyers Begat Buyers'
 Representatives of the unions, creditors and management said yesterday that Mr. Kalikow's declaration of interest was welcome, but that he must follow the same procedure as other prospective buyers in establishing his ability to buy The News. Only then would he be given confidential information on The News prepared by Salomon Brothers.
"Buyers begat buyers," said Michael M. Connery, a lawyer from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meather & Flom who is advising the unions.
Should other offers -- even lower ones -- be made for The News, an offer by Mr. Kalikow could face challenges on antitrust grounds because he would be buying a direct competitor. The Department of Justice, which would have to review a purchase by Mr. Kalikow, is obliged to favor a purchaser who would not reduce existing competition. But in this situation, with both buyer and seller in bankruptcy and two other newspapers in the same market, the antitrust implications are unclear and the situation would have to be examined as it unfolds.
If there are no other offers except Mr. Kalikow's, precedent strongly suggests that the Justice Department would approve.
Thomas A. Parisi, a senior vice president of Bankers Trust, said that the bank was advised that Mr. Kalikow was making the announcement, but had no comment on any details of the bank's role in a possible purchase.
In his statement, Mr. Kalikow said he has also advised the banks that make up the committee of his creditors of his intention. Mr. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Kalikow, said that the creditors were waiting to review Mr. Kalikow's plan, but had offered "no discouragement" to the concept.
Mr. Kalikow's declaration that he planned to make an offer for the chronically unprofitable News -- and Bankers Trust's apparent willingness to support him -- is the first concrete signal that The News will be able to attract serious buyers, which many in the newspaper industry have thought unlikely.
Also considered serious prospective bidders for The News are Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a New York real-estate entrepreneur and owner of U.S. News & World Report and The Atlantic Monthly, and Conrad M. Black, who controls Hollinger Inc., a public company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, that owns 96 daily papers worldwide, including The Daily Telegraph in London. In the United States, Hollinger owns 80 small dailies; among the largest of them is The Meridian (Miss.) Star, with daily circulation of 22,000.
 
'Anything Reasonable'
 Mr. Zuckerman declined to comment on his intentions regarding The News, but a person familiar with the effort to find a buyer for The News who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Mr. Zuckerman was one of the first people to receive a copy of a prospectus on the paper's financial condition and prospects, which began circulating late last week.
A spokesman for Mr. Black said only that "we look at anything reasonable that is for sale." A person familiar with Hollinger who also spoke on condition he not be identified said that a company representative had approached Mr. Kalikow about possibly acquiring both The News and The Post. Hollinger has been sent The News prospectus.
Mr. Kalikow declined to be interviewed yesterday, but in an interview earlier in the week he spoke hypothetically about what he might do if he owned both The News and The Post.
He said that he would probably invest in upgrading existing presses to print in color and would seriously consider moving The News's newsroom and some production operations to The Post building on South Street from The News's 42d Street headquarters.
Such a move would eliminate the cost of The News's current lease on the space, which is estimated to cost about $1 million a month and has been singled out by News management as a cost the paper would seek to greatly reduce, regardless of who the new owner might be.
The News filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy code on Dec. 5 in the wake of the death of Robert Maxwell, its owner. Mr. Kalikow filed for bankruptcy protection last August.
Mr. Kalikow said that, should he acquire The News, he would focus his attention on the newspaper business and significantly reduce his involvement in the real-estate business.
In his statement, Mr. Kalikow said that he would not acquire The News unless "certain efficiencies, economics and enhanced profitabliity" would occur. This generally means a significantly reduced work force, despite Mr. Kalikow's pledge to "save as many jobs as possible."
Members of the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union, which deliver The News, are probably especially vulnerable in a merger because The Post's trucks visit most of the same newsstands each day.
The News is scheduled to seek approval today in Federal Bankruptcy Court for a $10 million line of credit from Sterling National Bank & Trust Company. This has won the unanimous support of the paper's creditors committee, though the creditors are seeking some modifications.
Howard Seife, a lawyer at Winston & Strawn who represents the creditors committee, said that the creditors hoped to alter that part of the agreement allowing Sterling to call in the loan in the event that the creditors and paper's management do not agree on a reorganization plan. Mr. Seife said the creditors regard this as seeking to tie their hands, because and abrupt withdrawal of credit could force the paper to cease publication.
The News hopes that the line of credit will allow them to negotiate more favorable terms with suppliers, who are now generally requiring payment in advance.
 
'The Same Interest'
 Securing the line of credit has been the last obstacle before the focus shifts to finding a buyer, or -- failing that -- an investor for The News.
The mechanism for negotiating with prospective buyers is unusual in that representatives of all the parties at interest -- the unions, creditors, management and owners -- have agreed to review all offers together and, to the greatest extent possible, to negotiate together rather than trying to make separate deals with individual buyers that favor one party above another.
"Ultimately, we all have the same interest," said Nancy Peretsman, managing director of Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm selected by News management to screen all the offers and prepare the prospectus.
But such an arrangement will be difficult to maintain when negotiating passes the initial stages, because the interests of the unions and the creditors may be quite different.
For instance, should Mr. Kalikow offer $50 million cash for The News negotiations would determine how much of that money would be spent to compensate union members who lose their jobs and how much would be spent to compensate creditors, who might otherwise have to settle debts for fewer cents on the dollar.

HEADLINE: U.N. Council Favors Peace Force for Yugoslavia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council moved ahead today with plans for its first peacekeeping operation on the European mainland, in which a 13,000-member international force will be sent to bolster the fragile cease-fire in Yugoslavia.
Secretary General Boutros Ghali won broad backing for his plan from the five permanent Council members. Mr. Ghali, acting on a proposal by his mediator in the area, Cyrus R. Vance, a former American Secretary of State, told Council members the force should be sent for at least a full year. 
 At a meeting with the representatives of the permanent members -- Britain, France, the United States, China and Russia -- Mr. Ghali said he was still unsure that all factions in the Yugoslav war really wanted to preserve the cease-fire and cooperate with the peace plan, diplomats and United Nations officials said.
Despite the risk that the peacekeepers might become embroiled in a shooting war between the breakaway Croatian state and its Serbian foes, the Secretary General argued that the United Nations must move ahead rapidly to strengthen the truce and allow Yugoslav factions to work out the political future at a peace conference to take place in Brussels.
The representatives of the permanent members appeared to support the plan, diplomats said, although the last word rests with their Governments.
"We are all for it," the representative from Russia, Yuli M. Vorontsov, said afterward. "We should not lose the opportunity because the window of opportunity is very, very small and we have to get there while the cease-fire is still holding."
By giving the peacekeeping force an initial yearlong mandate instead of the usual six months, the Secretary General argued, the Council would signal its determination for compliance and would send a message to local leaders that they cannot expect the troops to withdraw quickly before a political settlement is in place.
Authorizing deployment of the peacekeeping force for only six months, diplomats said, would arouse fears among the Serbian minority that Croatia might demand the withdrawal of the force before a political agreement is complete, leaving the Serbs unprotected.
Croatia's leader, Franjo Tudjman, has said in recent interviews that he wants the force to stay only six months.
In the letter he sent Wednesday endorsing the United Nations plan, he spoke of "technical questions" regarding the rights of the peacekeepers in Serbian enclaves of Croatia after the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army withdraws.
Diplomats say he still appears unhappy with the United Nations plan to preserve the existing Serb-controlled local authorities in these areas until a new settlement is reached.
Milan Babic, the leader of Krajina, one of the largest of these Serbian areas in Croatia, continues to oppose the plan, although he has been overruled by his local assembly.
Once the permanent Council members endorsed the decision, the Secretariat immediately started to seek troops.
The senior official in charge of peacekeeping operations, Under Secretary General Marrack Goulding told representatives of some 30 countries that he now favors a total force of 13,000, the second-largest ever deployed. The largest force, 20,000 troops, was dispatched in 1960 to the newly independent Congo, now Zaire.
This would be the first peacekeeping force to be sent to the European mainland, but there has been a small force on Cyprus for years.
 
Financing Uncertain
 The force in Yugoslavia would consist of 12 infantry battalions of up to 900 troops, separate communication and logistic groups and several hundred police monitors.
The initial plan was for 10,000 soldiers and 500 police monitors, at a cost estimated at between $350 million and $400 million for a year.
The permanent Council members pay just over half the cost of peacekeeping operations, with the United States picking up 30 percent of the bill.
Where this money will come from remains unclear because member nations already owe the United Nations nearly $1 billion in unpaid dues for past peacekeeping operations and the regular budget. The United States accounts for nearly half the balance.
But President Bush has asked Congress to establish a $700 million contingency peacekeeping fund to pay the American share of unanticipated costs.
Countries invited to the meeting on forming the force included Ghana, Ireland, Pakistan, Poland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Denmark, Belgium, Egypt, Kenya, Argentina, Brazil, Malta, Venezuela and Nepal.
No countries have made a firm commitment to send forces. But officials hope to have the first units moving into Yugoslavia about two to three weeks after the Council authorizes the force, which could occur early next week.

Croats Remain Suspicious

Special to The New York Times
ZAGREB, Croatia, Feb. 13 -- Reports that the United Nations Secretary General would recommend deployment of peacekeeping forces in Yugoslavia was the news of the night in Croatia, topping evening news broadcasts and all Friday morning newspapers.
Many Croats, including many political leaders, are suspicious of the plan, fearing that it may lead to a long-term deployment that will allow rebel Serbs to maintain political control of the third of Croatia's territory they now hold.
Today's development is certain to meet with broad approval in Serbia -- especially among Serbian leaders who face multiplying economic problems and growing popular discontent as a result of the seven-month war.

HEADLINE: HOUSE DEMOCRATS WORK ON TAX PLAN WITH $400 CREDIT

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
House Democrats began working today on an alternative to President Bush's tax legislation, centered on temporary tax credits of up to $400 for 80 percent of all taxpayers, a permanent one-percentage-point reduction in the corporate tax rate and a modest cut in taxes on capital gains.
The costs of the Democrats' five-year $90.9 billion measure would be made up mainly by increasing the top individual income tax rate from 31 to 35 percent and imposing a 10 percent surtax on taxable income over $1 million. 
 The plan, featuring a credit to workers of up to a fifth of their tax for Social Security and Medicare, was discussed today by Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee. They will vote on various provisions of the plan on Friday and Saturday before putting it before the whole House at the end of this month.
 
A Plan to Aid Parents
 One major challenge to the proposal will be an effort by Representatives Marty Russo of Illinois and Thomas J. Downey of Long Island to replace the middle-income tax credits with credits only for families with children. "I think there's a real good chance" of making the change, Mr. Russo said, but he added that he was waiting for overnight computer runs to figure out how generous the credits could be without raising the overall cost of the bill.
And there may be challenges to the measure's complex plan for reducing taxes on capital gains in a manner much more limited than what Mr. Bush has proposed. This part of the proposal, offered by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the committee, borrows from a plan he supported in 1990 and is structured in a way to encourage investment in small business and to win votes from those Democrats who favor a capital gains cut.
Mr. Rostenkowski said after today's session, "I was impressed that my membership was so receptive." In recent years, when tax bills get passed, his ideas usually end up as a big part of them.
That may be true again, although increasingly bitter partisan exchanges in an election year make the outcome unpredictable. If Democrats get some version of this measure through the House, it will supply important elements for any eventual negotiations involving Mr. Rostenkowski, senators and the White House.
The chairman said that when this proposal gets to a vote in the House and is measured against Mr. Bush's plan, the American people can see "who has the best interests of the middle class" in mind.
At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, denounced the Democrats for their party-line vote on Wednesday to send all of Mr. Bush's tax proposals to the floor in one package, instead of deferring to the smaller package he has said he wants passed first. Both of his plans feature a cut in capital gains taxes for all taxpayers who have them; the House will have a chance to vote on both of them and on the Democratic plan, too.
Mr. Fitzwater said the White House is "going to make America quite aware of just who is holding this plan up, who cares about jobs and who doesn't, who cares about economic stimulus and who doesn't, who cares about the economy and who doesn't."
"We do and they don't; we do and they don't," he continued.
Mr. Fitzwater said the White House was stalled for now by Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, whom he compared to "weasels going into a hole." But he said, "On the Senate side, we will try to work with the Finance Committee and others to get good legislation."
But at the Finance Committee today, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, its chairman, complained of "the kind of vacillation that we've seen from the President." He accused Mr. Bush of changing his own plan this week, saying, "And for all we know there are going to be more changes to come in the days ahead."
 
President in a Hurry

 
 Mr. Bush has all along advocated quick passage of a smaller package that he says will stimulate economic growth, saying he could wait for his other proposals, like a bigger tax exemption for parents with children.
But he has altered the capital gains proposal in recent days. Originally, he would have reduced the rate from its current maximum of 28 percent to no more than 15.4 percent. But those gains would still have been subject to the alternative minimum tax rate of 24 percent that applies to certain taxpayers with a wide range of deductions and exemptions. More recently, he has agreed that it should not be subject to that 24 percent rate.
Mr. Bush's capital gains proposal was estimated in Congress as likely to cost $15.4 billion in revenues over five years, although the Administration believes it would stimulate so much growth that it would add to Federal revenues.
Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal was presented to Democrats today as costing only $4.2 billion over five years. In one part of his proposal, to stimulate the development of new enterprises, individuals would be taxed at only 16.8 percent on gains realized from small-business stock held more than five years.
Then there are two parts apparently intended to meet political desires for some capital gains cuts for many taxpayers without doing so at great expense.
In one, individuals whose other adjusted gross income does not exceed $150,000 would be taxed at 19.6 percent for gains on items acquired after the effective date of the new tax law.
And for items acquired before the effective date of the tax law, such individuals would be taxed at the 19.6 percent rate for up to $80,000 worth of gains during a lifetime.
Unlike the latest Bush plan, these capital gains preferences would be subject to the alternative minimum tax.
The proposal would also make one other change in capital gains rules, indexing for inflation the current once-in-a-lifetime $125,000 exclusion for a gain on the sale of a residence.
The heart of the Rostenkowski proposal is a credit of one-fifth of the 7.65 percent payroll tax that a worker pays for Social Security and Medicare, up to $400 for married couples and $200 for individuals. Some of it would be "refundable," so that the poor would get something even if they paid no taxes. The credits would be temporary, applying only to 1992 and 1993.
Mr. Russo and Mr. Downey have each proposed plans that would give refundable tax credits for children. Mr. Russo's plan has a $350 credit per child; Mr. Downey's plan has an $800 credit instead of the personal exemption.
But each of those plans would cost more than twice the $45.9 billion that part of Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal would cost, so the two lawmakers were seeking approaches that would reduce the credit, or apply it only to younger children, as a way to keep the total cost under control.
The biggest other cut in the Rostenkowski plan is the reduction of one percentage point in both the corporate income tax rate, to a 33 percent maximum, and in the corporate alternative minimum tax rate, to 19 percent. The cost estimate of that was $17.8 billion over five years. Another $7.8 billion would go for a permanent extension of the research and development tax credit. Several other expiring credits would also be made permanent, including those intended to promote low-income housing, jobs for welfare recipients and employer-provided educational assistance.
 
Seeking Revenue

 
 The major offsets to these cuts would be in individual income taxes. The current maximum rate of 31 percent would be raised to 35 percent for individual taxpayers with taxable income of $85,000, joint filers at $145,000 and heads of household at $125,000. (Under an anomaly in the current tax law, families with taxable income from about $80,000 to $200,000 already pay 33 percent on the portion of their income that falls in that range.)
In addition, the alternative minimum tax would be raised a point, to 25 percent.
Those changes would bring in $53.3 billion over five years, and another $10.5 billion would come from imposition of a 10 percent surtax on the taxes of those with taxable income of $1 million or more.
Another $11.6 billion would be raised by extending for two years the current limits on the itemized deductions and the personal exemption of certain high-income taxpayers.
The Rostenkowski plan also lifts intact a few of the more attractive, though relatively cheap, features of Mr. Bush's various plans.

HEADLINE: Loud Israeli 'No!' To a Halt in Housing

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's chief of staff said today that there was no chance Israel would accept a freeze on new settlement housing in the occupied territories as a condition for receiving United States loan guarantees to help absorb new immigrants.
Nonetheless, the official, Yossi Ben-Aharon, expressed optimism that a formula could be found that would enable Israel to get the assistance it wanted. The Bush Administration has demanded that Israel halt new construction in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
 Undoubtedly, his Government will have to live with Washington-imposed penalties that would reduce the value of the loan guarantees, Mr. Ben-Aharon said, but he predicted that aid of some sort would be approved. Israel would use the guarantees to obtain favorable interest rates in borrowing $10 billion over the next five years to help resettle hundreds of thousands of emigres from the former Soviet Union.
 
'Matter of Principle'
 "I think it is fair and correct to say that although the United States has a clearcut policy against settlements, it realizes that this issue pertains to a matter of principle for this Government," Mr. Ben-Aharon said in an interview. "You don't challenge a friendly Government on an issue that pertains to principle."
And Mr. Shamir, he said, would never betray his conviction that Jews have the right and the duty to build settlements in all territories they regard as part of the biblical land of Israel.
Other senior officials here are far gloomier about reaching an agreement, saying that the Shamir Government cannot live with the conditions that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has put forth in two recent meetings with the Israeli Ambassador to Washington, Zalman Shoval.
Their pessimism thickened after Reuters quoted an unidentified senior Administration official on Wednesday as suggesting that Washington was opposed to new housing not just in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but also in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.
Even before that report, Health Minister Ehud Olmert, who is close to Mr. Shamir, accused the United States of trying to push Israel back to its pre-1967 borders. "I am not very optimistic on the chance to agree on the loan guarantees," he said in an assessment shared by representatives of some American Jewish groups.
 
Assessing Israel's Need
 Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai, who has said he would rather give up the guarantees than agree to a freeze on settlements, told a news conference this week that it was "an absolute absurdity" to think that Israel's fate hinged on the American assistance. But others sounded less confident, including Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, who warned of lower economic growth and higher unemployment if Israel forgoes the aid.
Even optimists acknowledge that the loan guarantees are dead if Washington in effect orders Mr. Shamir to choose: assistance or settlements.
But they are betting -- or at least hoping -- that the American reservations are tactical and that the Bush Administration, too, wants to help the immigrants, and therefore will try to find a way for both sides to save face.
Last week, Mr. Baker told Mr. Shoval that the United States would let Israel complete housing units already in progress but would accept no new starts and, moreover, would deduct one dollar in guarantees for every dollar that Israel spent to complete dwellings now under way.
Israel is prepared to slow new housing but not to stop it. And Israel wants the penalty to apply only to homes that may be built in the future.
In any event, Mr. Shamir has pledged that money borrowed with the American guarantees will not be used directly for settlements and that Russians and other recent emigres will not be guided there, even though some 350 newcomers were taken on a tour of the West Bank today by the Prime Minister's Likud Party.
Party officials said the purpose of the tour was to demonstrate the importance of the territories to Israel's security, not to sell the West Bank as a place to live.
Mr. Ben-Aharon, Mr. Shamir's chief of staff, said he was confident that Washington and Jerusalem could agree on a "clear arrangement" on the loan guarantees.
But what that formula might be was unclear even to him, he acknowledged. Beyond that, each side provides sharply varying numbers for the housing in progress whose completion the Americans would accept.
The Israelis say there are 13,500 such units. Mr. Baker initially used a figure of 9,000, and then reportedly lowered it last week to about 6,000, representing the upper limit of the additional houses he can abide by in occupied areas.
There is an odd twist to this numbers game: Critics of Israel's settlement policies are normally the ones who cite the higher figures, to prove that construction is rampant. The Israeli Government tends to use lower numbers, to show that, for all the uproar, its building activity is really quite modest.
Further complicating the dispute are factors that did not exist when it first erupted half a year ago.
 
And an Election, Too
 For starters, Israel is on the threshold of a campaign for parliamentary elections on June 23, a point underlined today by the formation of a new political party to champion the interests of the new immigrants. It is called Da, meaning yes in Russian, but how much it will attract voters is uncertain.
What is clear, however, is that whatever action Washington takes on loan guarantees between now and Election Day will be interpreted here as either favoring or hurting the Likud Party.
There are also the peace negotiations, scheduled to resume in Washington on Feb. 24, with some Palestinians warning that the process could fall apart if Israel gets the guarantees.
As an added complication, immigration from the Soviet Union has been dropping because of hard times in Israel, to 6,237 arrivals in January, the lowest monthly total in two years.
The dwindling figures have led Israelis to two contradictory conclusions: the loan guarantees are not needed quite as much as before, and they are needed more than ever to create a more favorable economic climate that would get immigration flowing heavily again.

Vehicle Sales Post Sharp Rise

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose a robust 23.8 percent in early February, auto makers reported today. Although analysts had expected a gain over the sluggish period a year earlier, they said sales for the first 10 days of the month were the strongest sign of improvement in the auto industry since last summer.
"We're off the bottom, and there seems to be genuine improvement in retail demand," said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz in New York. 
 Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, added, "There's no doubt about it; those tentative signs of strength that we saw in January were real."
 
Trucks Up More Than 40%
 Domestic cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4 million units, compared with 6.1 million in the 1991 period. The nation's domestic auto makers posted sales of 143,307 cars for Feb. 1-10, up 14.8 percent from the 1991 period. There were eight selling days in both periods.
Light-truck sales rose by 42.8 percent, to 84,582 units. Sales of light trucks were particularly soft a year ago, reflecting concerns about the cost of fuel as gasoline prices rose during the Persian Gulf conflict, analysts speculated. Some interpreted the sharp rise in the most recent period as a sign that companies are stepping up truck purchases.
The overall gain was the strongest opening period for any month since July.
The guarded optimism of analysts and spokesmen for the car companies was supported by several dealers, who had reported swifter showroom traffic and sales in recent weeks.
"I never thought I would ever say I would take a year full of Januaries," said Dean Blair, president of Jim Foreman Pontiac-Nissan in Springfield, Ohio. January is traditionally a slow month for auto sales.
 
Momentum Continues
 Mr. Blair saidJanuary's momentum had carried into early February. He said he sold as many Pontiacs in the first 12 days of February as he did in all of February 1991. Customers seem more confident about the economy, he said, and many say now is the best time to deal for a new car.
At Brown & Wood Inc. in Greenville, N.C., which sells Pontiac, Cadillac, Isuzu and Jeep-Eagle products, owner Bill Brown said that last month was his second-best January in 56 years. And in early February, sales were up 15 percent over the period a year earlier. "It's a combination of things that is hard to put my finger on, but consumer confidence is up a little bit," he said. At the recent National Automobile Dealers Association gathering in Dallas, many dealers told him that they also had started 1992 with strong sales.
Emmett Horgan, owner of Rockingham Toyota Dodge Nissan in Salem, N.H., said showroom traffic and sales increased in recent weeks, and consumers seemed more confident. "There's a feeling that the economy has leveled off," he said.
Sales of the General Motors Corporation's North American-built cars rose 17.8 percent, to 73,436 units. The company's light-truck sales rose 38.2 percent, to 33,320.
The Ford Motor Company posted an increase in car sales of 13.9 percent, to 37,106 units. Sales of its trucks rose 32.3 percent, to 28,982.
The Chrysler Corporation sold 14,750 cars in early February, a 6.9 percent gain, according to estimates from Ward's, an industry publication. Chrysler does not report 10-day sales figures. Its truck sales, which include mini-vans and pickups, rose 76.1 percent, to 19,550, Ward's said.
The Honda Motor Company said sales of its American-made cars rose 24.4 percent, to 7,737; the Toyota Motor Corporation 58.9 percent, to 5,495, and the Nissan Motor Company 29 percent, to 1,758.

HEADLINE: Trenton Senate's G.O.P. Files Bill to Cut Sales Tax

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Exactly a month after the defeat of a Democratic drive to roll the sales tax back to 6 from 7 percent, Senate Republicans began their own tax-cut campaign today.
"Unlike Gov. Jim Florio's 'business as usual' $15.7 billion spending plan, our legislation takes a half-billion-dollar chunk out of state spending by removing its revenue source," said the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco of Scotch Plains, as he announced the introduction of the Republican rollback legislation. "That's half a billion dollars that will go back into taxpayers' pockets," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "That's half a billion dollars that will be pumped back into the economy." 
 The Republicans and a cadre of business, academic and community officials at the news conference said a reduction of one penny in the sales tax would spur the state's economy, restore public confidence in government and give New Jerseyans a psychological boost.
 
'Poppycock,' Says Democrat
 Almost immediately, the Democrats denounced the idea. Outnumbered 58 to 22 in the Assembly and 27 to 13 in the Senate, they could only watch and criticize as the Republicans put their tax-repeal effort into high gear with the announcement of the Senate bill.
"I think it's poppycock," said Assemblyman Wayne R. Bryant of Camden, the deputy Democratic leader.
"The public is fully aware of the Republican pledge to lower the sales tax from 7 percent to 6 percent," said the Senate minority leader, John A. Lynch of New Brunswick. "What has been consistently absent from any of the G.O.P. rhetoric is how they will cut the sales tax without adversely affecting property taxes, school funding or essential state services."
The Senate tax-reduction bill is similar to the one the Republicans introduced in the Assembly on Feb. 3, and the Assembly Policy and Rules Committee held the first public hearing on that measure today.
 
Florio's Least Popular Tax
 The sales-tax increase is the least popular section of a $2.8-billion tax package approved by the Democratic-controlled 204th Legislature in June 1990, with Republicans voting across the board against it.
After the Democrats suffered a crushing defeat in the Nov. 5 election, they tried unsuccessfully to add a sunset provision to the entire tax package. The Senate succeeded in passing it, but the effort fell short by two votes in the Assembly, where Republicans fought a frequently bitter campaign to block the rollback as irresponsible.
The Republicans won control of both houses on Nov. 5 by campaigning against the record tax package and promising to cut taxes. But since they came to power Jan. 14, the sales-tax rollback has become markedly more complex and politically charged.
First, Mr. Florio's budget proposal for fiscal 1993, which assumed a 7 percent sales tax, included a $341 million increase in aid for public schools. That meant the Republicans risked having to take away part or all of the promised schools increase to reduce the sales tax to 6 percent.
On Tuesday, the acting state treasurer, Samuel Crane, announced that tax revenues for December, including sales-tax revenues, were lower than anticipated.
And a poll by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, published last weekend, found that a majority of New Jerseyans would object to a sales-tax rollback if it resulted in a reduction of state services.
"The Republicans have created a pressure cooker, and they have put themselves into that pressure cooker," said Assemblyman William J. Pascrell Jr., the Democratic conference chairman and Mayor of Paterson.
The Republicans said they had not determined where cuts could be made, but they promised that they would not cut school aid to reduce the sales tax. "What we are looking to do is to cut the waste in government, not essential services," Mr. DiFrancesco said.
 
Concern Over Other Taxes
 The Republicans also tried to quell concern that property taxes would increase so the sales tax could be reduced. "We're not going to lower the taxes to raise other taxes," said Senator Randy Corman of Sayreville, a co-sponsor of the measure.
The Democrats responded by trying to stir public doubt about the Republicans' intentions. "What we see happening here is that the penny sales tax will be saved at the expense of New Jersey schoolchildren," the Assembly minority leader, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, said at a news conference.
Mr. Doria released copies of a letter to the Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian of Hackettstown, in which Mr. Doria criticized a bill, A-20, that would delay annual school elections for 1992 from April 7 to April 28. The Assembly Education Committee released the bill today, opening the way for a vote by the full Assembly.
"The object of A-20 is clear -- delay the timetable for school elections long enough to allow the Republican Assembly to use education funds to replace a revenue hole created by a penny reduction of the sales tax," Mr. Doria said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Gains Tentative Pact On Sanitation

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration has reached a tentative agreement with New York City's 6,800 sanitation workers that grants a one-year raise of 3.5 percent but leaves a central productivity issue unresolved.
The city's recycling program has reduced the load for many sanitation workers, some of whom complete their eight-hour shifts in four hours. The union agreed to return to productivity levels spelled out in its 1980 contract. But what that means in terms of extended collection routes and what further efficiencies the city can gain have been set aside for further negotiation. Those issues will go to a mediation board if no agreement is reached within a year. 
 While Sanitation Commissioner Emily Lloyd hailed the agreement to return to 1980 productivity levels as a victory for the city's recycling effort, their inability to win further work-rule changes as part of the contract illustrates how difficult it is for the city to get unions to agree to productivity gains.
Work-rule changes have been an important goal for the city in a number of its labor negotiations, as it seeks both to hold down costs during the recession and to make long-term changes to streamline its operations.
 
Series of Negotiations
 "If the goal was to get a full day's work for a full day's pay, then the city failed miserably in these negotiations," said Raymond Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a public interest group. "If the city can't reach an agreement on something as simple as extending trash collection routes so that workers put in a full day, then it raises questions as to whether they can get productivity gains from other unions," Mr. Horton said.
The agreement with the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, which replaces a long-expired contract, is modeled after an arbitration panel's decision on the city police contract in November and is another step toward completing an almost interminable first round of settlements negotiated by the Dinkins administration.
Those negotiations began in the fall of 1990 with the United Federation of Teachers and went on to include District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 237, and the city and transit police unions. The transit police contract, like the sanitation contract, followed the model of the city police accord, calling for a 4.5 percent raise over 15 months. Still to come are firefighters, correction officers and the housing police.
That first round of contracts has now basically expired, and the city must begin new rounds all over again with virtually all its unions. Those talks will be conducted under the Dinkins administration's recent promise to grant no raises during the next two years, except in exchange for productivity gains.
Under the sanitation contract, a labor-management committee will review the collection routes in the city's 59 districts to determine what productivity gains can be achieved. The committee, which will include the city's deputy commissioner for sanitation and a top union official, will set each district's workload to levels established in 1980 when the city started its two-worker truck program.
The agreement provides for workers to share in productivity gains that exceed the 1980 level. Ideally, the workers would receive a pay differential based on the increased workload, which would vary greatly among the districts.
 
Retroactive Raises
 The contract covers a 15-month period from July 1990 through September 1991, meaning that the union is still technically working without a contract and must begin new negotiations soon.
The contract provides for a 3.5 percent increase for the first year, then a 1 percent increase for the remaining three months of the contract's term. The wage increases will be paid retroactively.
Steven M. Polan, the city's former Sanitation Commissioner, who resigned last month to take a job in the private sector, praised the settlement, saying, "If the full potential of the agreement is realized, and I fully believe that it will, the contract represents a significant achievement for the city and a critical boost to its recycling program."
City officials said yesterday that the talks on further productivity increases would explore using specially designed trucks that would allow workers to collect both recycled materials and regular refuse. Currently, the recycling program requires a second round of collection.
A union spokesman, Jim Grossman, said the union was pleased with the contract because it allows the city and union to work together to settle the issue of recycling and its impact on regular trash collection. Mr. Grossman said that the union's shop stewards had agreed to approve the contract and that the contract would be presented to the union's membership for ratification by mail.

Chart: "MUNICIPAL UNIONS: Where the Contracts Stand"
 
Since taking office, the Dinkins administration has completed one round of negotiations with several of the city's major municipal unions, most recently yesterday's agreement with the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association.
 
Settlements Reached
 
Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association
A tentative settlement was reached yesterday for a contract that expired on Sept. 30, 1991. The ratification vote should be completed in two weeks. The agreement calls for a one-year raise of 3.5 percent and a 1 percent raise for the last three months.
 
Transit Patrolmen's Benevolent Association
A settlement was reached in January 1992; the contract, which expired Sept. 30, 1991, will be signed today or Monday.
 
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association
A 15-month contract, which expired Oct. 1, 1991, was reached on Nov. 15, 1991, after an arbitration panel rendered a decision.
 
United Federation of Teachers
An agreement was reached in Oct. 1990 for a contract that expired Sept. 30, 1991.
 
Teamsters Local 237 and District 37 of the American Federations of State, County and Municipal Employees
Both unions reached an agreement with the city in January 1991 for 15 month contracts. The Teamsters contract expired Sept. 30, 1991 and the District 37 contract expired Dec. 31, 1991.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton's Woes Are Kerrey's Frustration

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 13

 BODY:
After spending 20 weeks campaigning, and cycling through nine television commercials with three different slogans, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska seems to have finally alighted on a definitive theme: "electability."
For the last few days, Mr. Kerrey has been exploiting this theme with all the subtlety of a supermarket tabloid. The Senator's latest television advertisement, which will go off the air on Friday to make room for yet another generation of commercials, declares, "With America in crisis, the Democrats have to nominate someone who can win the Presidency in November." 
 But even as the campaign seems to have found a message, the theme seems to be an extension of the problems that have plagued Mr. Kerrey's candidacy from the beginning.
"Electability" was a quality that Mr. Kerrey, a Medal of Honor winner with a liberal voting record and engaging manner, was expected to demonstrate implicitly during the campaign. That did not happen, though. Instead of charm, Mr. Kerrey has tended to project the dry reserve of a technocrat. In a year when voters seem most interested in jobs, he has focused almost exclusively on health care, and when they seemed to be demanding detailed economic plans, he has insisted that lengthy position papers are not important.
 
Like Something Tacked On
 Now the message of "electability," analysts say, gives the impression of something tacked onto the campaign, like a happy ending on a sad movie.
"I think to make a candidate viable on the strength of electability is pretty weak," said David Moore, a poll taker at the University of New Hampshire. "Electability is kind of in the back of the minds of many voters, but it isn't something you can bring up front."
With his record of valor in Vietnam, Mr. Kerrey inherited the electability factor after disclosures that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas had maneuvered to avoid the draft. The Kerrey campaign clearly hopes to use the same theme against former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, who has advanced in polls as Mr. Clinton has slipped.
The issues raised by Mr. Clinton's draft record seem to have been tailor-made for Mr. Kerrey's benefit: the Governor and the Senator are both seeking to become the standard-bearer for new generation of Democratic politics and as one stumbles over the generation's most wrenching experience, the Vietnam War, the other should gain.
The fact that Mr. Kerrey has, so far at least, failed to benefit from the campaign's focus on service in the military is something that the Senator's advisers seem increasingly hard-pressed to explain.
 
An Ambivalent Public
 "I think we're doing what we can do," said Harrison Hickman, the Kerrey campaign's poll taker. "But it's awfully hard to communicate when the only story of the week is, 'What evidence do we have that Bill Clinton did what somebody said he did?' "
Mr. Kerrey himself seems to have a keen understanding of the public's ambivalence about Vietnam and the difficulty of turning the war to political advantage. Last week, when the first disclosures surfaced about Mr. Clinton and the draft, Mr. Kerrey was uncharacteristically critical of the Arkansas Governor, saying his explanation of his record sounded false. Since then, though, as new questions have arisen over a letter Mr. Clinton wrote to an R.O.T.C. officer, Mr. Kerrey has reverted to a more reflective tone.
"I was in the Philadelphia Naval Hospital when Bill Clinton was going through all this," Mr. Kerrey said today. "The polls at the time showed that Americans didn't support the war. The thought of going to war in 1969 in the face of that kind of opposition was a terrifying thought and people of conscience were saying no, and people were doing lots of things to make sure that they didn't go.
"The fundamental problem," he continued, "and the thing that causes all of us a great deal of anguish, is that we know if you graduated from high school and couldn't go on to college, you were on your way. That was the anguish of the time, of 1969."
 
New Challenges
 Mr. Kerrey's reluctance to issue new reproaches is in keeping with a campaign strategy of keeping the Senator above the fray while Mr. Clinton defends himself. Indeed, advisers to the Senator say they are less worried about Mr. Clinton now than they are about Mr. Tsongas, and about Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, whose standing in some polls has inched past Mr. Kerrey.
With the focus on electability, the Kerrey campaign is apparently hoping to undermine rivals without explicitly attacking them. Polls show Mr. Kerrey is viewed favorably by most New Hampshire Democrats, and his campaign is still hoping to turn this generalized good feeling into votes without resorting to negative campaigning.
"To have your positives be as high as his are and not move in the polls," said one Kerrey adviser, explaining the strategy "sort of defies gravity."

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble, With Dow Falling by 30.18

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday as investors' hopes of a further easing by the Federal Reserve began evaporating and bond prices collapsed on signals that the economy may be stabilizing. After a record close the day before, the Dow Jones industrial average staged a 30.18-point retreat, to 3,246.65.
Robert C. Walberg, analyst at MMS International, an economic analysis and research firm, said the economic data released yesterday, including strong retail sales and lower jobless claims, exerted pressure on stocks. Also a factor, he said, was the Treasury's 30-year bond auction, which did not live up to expectations and extended bond losses in the afternoon. 
 "This is going to accelerate investors' shifting their attention to an improving economy and corporate earnings," Mr. Walberg said. "Given the market is already trading at a lofty level, it leads people to pulling back and waiting for proof that earnings are indeed improving."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 230.9 million, down from 237.6 million shares traded on Wednesday, with the composite index down 1.81 points, to 228.73. The number of issues declining yesterday nearly doubled the amount of those gaining, 1,113 to 609.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stock dropped 3.44 points, to 413.69, while the American Stock Exchange index fell 3.72 points, to 415.27.
Active Nasdaq trading took the composite down 5.82 points, to 639.10, while the Russell 2,000 closed at 211.54, down 1.07 points.
A steady barrage of program selling, some set off by futures trading as interest rates rose, added 51.42 points to the Dow, according to Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm that tracks program activity.
John Brooks, a technical analyst with Davis Mendel & Regenstein, said the bond market took yesterday's economic data to mean that the economy was picking up. "I think that is the way you're going to have to play it."
Elsewhere in the stock market, Duty Free International slid 6 3/4, to 44 3/4, in Big Board trading yesterday after Canada announced on Wednesday that it would remove duties on certain imports, or about 25 consumer products representing about $1 billion of annual imports.
Supercuts, a nationwide franchiser of hair care stores, fell 2 1/2, to 22, as Graig Bibb, an analyst with Paine Webber, cut his rating to "attractive" from "buy."
Following an 87 percent increase in earnings for the first quarter, Mesa Airlines rose 1 3/4, to 22, as Helane Becker, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, initiated coverage of the airline with an "outperform" rating, traders said.
Barry Mannis downgraded his rating on Wheelabrator Technologies to "hold" from "buy" because the stock was nearing his price target of $37 a share. Yesterday the stock closed at 35, down 5/8.
Digital Equipment, rose 2 1/8, to 61 1/4, as Jay Stevens, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, repeated his "buy" rating, again telling his firm's salespeople about a Digital chip that is twice as fast as similar microprocessors on the market.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ford Loses $475.7 Million In Quarter

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company, capping a year with its largest deficit ever, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $475.7 million today on revenues of $21.98 billion.
The latest results actually improved on last year's fourth quarter, when Ford lost $518.5 million on revenues of $24.19 billion. The narrower loss from a reduced sales volume "indicates that our efforts to reduce costs without compromising our product plans are working," said Harold A. Poling, the chairman and chief executive.
 
"Not Out of the Woods"
 
 Analysts cautioned that Ford might be facing more hard times. "Ford is not out of the woods," said Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco. Investors should realize "there is no chance of a dividend increase for several years," he said.
Investors took the results in stride today, as Ford's stock gained 62.5 cents, to $35.25. With 2.5 million shares traded, it was the fifth-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the year, Ford lost $2.25 billion on revenues of $88.28 billion, compared with a profit in 1990 of $860.1 million, or $1.86 a share, on revenues of $97.65 billion.
In 1980, Ford lost $1.54 billion, its second-biggest loss. When the General Motors Corporation posts financial results next week, the Big Three will have racked up an estimated $7 billion in losses last year, by far the industry's worst year ever.
"Many of the problems that affected us in 1991 are continuing into 1992 -- soft economies, intense competition and excess industry capacity," Mr. Poling said. Besides cost cuts, Ford forecasts a gradual economic recovery this year, he said, giving "us reason to believe our 1992 operating results will show substantial improvement," he added.
Ford declined, however, to disclose its internal prediction of whether it would be profitable in 1992.
 
Balancing Losses
 The car maker's worldwide automotive operations lost $712 million in the fourth quarter; $506 million of the loss came from the American automotive operations. The loss was balanced by a $236 million quarterly profit from Ford's financial services group, which includes the Ford Motor Credit Credit Company, the Associates Corporation of North America and the First Nationwide Financial Corporation.
Depressed sales volume because of the weak economy hurt Ford's United States results in 1991, but the No. 2 auto maker also lost market share during the period. Its share of the American car market dropped by one percentage point, to 20.1 percent, mostly reflecting weaker demand for Ford's two-door sporty models, the Probe, Mustang, Thunderbird and Cougar.
Ford's share of the American truck market was also down, by four-tenths of a percent, to 28.9 percent, reflecting a shift toward smaller trucks, away from the larger model segments in which Ford is strong.
 
Worldwide Sales Down
 Worldwide, Ford sold 5,359,000 cars, trucks and tractors to dealers in 1991, down from 5,872,000 a year earlier. For the quarter, factory sales totaled 1,296,000, down from 1,436,000 in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Overseas, losses in Britain overwhelmed Ford's profitable operations elsewhere. Although Ford remained the top-selling car maker in Britain, sales volume industrywide dropped by 21 percent, the biggest plunge in 40 years. Ford of Britain and Jaguar Ltd. together lost $1.1 billion last year; combined overseas losses, including the rest of Europe, Latin America and the Far East, totaled $970 million.
But Mr. Poling said, "We believe the worst is behind us in Britain, and we expect a modest economic recovery this year."
 
Financial Unit's Profit
 For 1991, Ford's financial-services business posted a record profit of $927 million, a 22 percent increase from a year earlier.
The aggressive sale of preferred and common stock and other tactics designed to strengthen Ford's balance sheet have left the company flush with cash to develop new products. Ford reported cash and marketable securities worth $9.8 billion at the end of the year, compared with $6.1 billion a year ago.
Mr. Glantz, the Dean Witter analyst, predicted Ford might be able to weather 1992 without additional financing.

HEADLINE: In Recession, Illegal Aliens Find a Cold Reception on L.I.

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CENTRAL ISLIP, L.I., Feb. 12

 BODY:
Shortly after her grueling overland journey here from El Salvador, Rosa R. lay terrified in an ambulance, about to give birth. She feared not the labor or delivery, but that her first encounter with American authorities would end in her deportation.
Now, at four months old, her son, William, has a fever, but Rosa is afraid to apply for aid: the last time she did, a social worker accused her of lying and threatened her with jail. This time, she fears deportation, and will likely send William to El Salvador. 
 Rosa's dread is shared by thousands of illegal aliens on Long Island, where a deepening recession and swelling public assistance rolls are cutting into the sympathy immigrants once found here, and where an estimated 100,000 Central Americans have settled in the last 10 years.
 
Caseloads Surge
 Advocates report growing hostility toward foreigners, even from social workers, whose caseloads have increased sharply as a result of the recession. There are no statistics that specifically track hostility toward foreigners here, but accounts from recent immigrants and the people who work with them, as well as steps to enact laws that would limit their rights, suggest they have become especially vulnerable as hard times set in.
In a stark example of the mood here, the Suffolk County Legislature is considering repealing a 1986 law promising illegal aliens that they will not be reported to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service should they seek government assistance.
The 1986 law, the Illegal Aliens Access Act, was passed during a time of economic boom that translated into a more generous approach to social welfare, and signaled Suffolk County's interest in the well-being of refugees fleeing civil fighting in El Salvador. It is far from certain that the repeal will be adopted. But immigrants and social workers say the drive for repeal reflects a rising impatience with the presence of foreigners, legal and illegal, as unemployment and economic difficulties spread.
So far, the turn against immigrants has not occurred in other areas of the state. In New York City, where one in four residents is foreign born, city agencies generally interpret Federal laws as liberally as possible, granting Federal benefits to low-income immigrants.
"The city has long had a policy of not seeking to use the immigration law to deny people benefits, and of not becoming an enforcement agent for the Federal Government's immigration laws," said David Grunblatt, chairman of the New York County Lawyer's Association's immigration committee.
Still, Mr. Grunblatt is concerned that the Suffolk County bill, if passed, could ignite similar measures in other areas New York State hard hit by the recession. "It's one of those cases where the first one to jump in the hot water cools it for everyone else," he said.
The current Suffolk County proposal follows other recent attempts on Long Island to roll back any welcome once extended to immigrants and refugees.
Several months ago, an Elmont school principal reported two undocumented children to the immigration service when their parents tried to enroll them in school, and found broad public support at a subsequent public hearing before the local school board -- despite a United States Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing the children of illegal immigrants access to public education. The parents, fearful of deportation, quickly disappeared with their children.
The Glen Cove City Council, fed up with Central American labor pools on its street corners, passed an ordinance forbidding people to seek work or donations in public. The 1990 law, upheld by a district court, is being appealed by the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Central American Refugee Center.
And before that, the "English only" bill, defeated in the Suffolk County Legislature, would have made English the official language of the county, and forbidden using public funds to print posters and other documents in Spanish.
"The county is dying right now," said Rose Caracappa, a Republican, who is making her third attempt to repeal the Illegal Immigrants Access Act. "We can't provide health services for our residents. I'm going to set my priorities on them."
"With the recession going on and the increase in health and social services rolls, we don't have the caseworkers to handle the influx of cases coming in," she said. "I feel that as a legislator, it's my responsibility to address the needs of the legal residents, before we address the needs of the illegals."
Experts on immigration, as well as the bill's supporters and detractors, appear uncertain of the practical consequences for Suffolk County should the 1986 law be repealed. Because the illegal aliens are eligible for only life and death medical attention, childbirth and prenatal care, a legislative review of the proposal found savings would be "minimal."
 
Hazy Prospects for Bill
 It would only save the county significant funds, the review said, if it discouraged immigrants from seeking benefits for their American-born children.
While the prospects for the bill are unclear, its importance, advocates for the aliens say, lies in the tough new stance against outsiders it represents, and in the chills it is sending through the county's clandestine communities.
"Just discussion of the law is enough to intimidate immigrants," said Victor A. Jordan, president of the Caribbean, African-American Olive Branch, an advocacy group for American and Caribbean blacks, and a professor of economics at Empire State College. "It's used to get rid of them in general. To make them feel they'll never succeed in Suffolk County."
Under Federal law, caseworkers must "refer" an undocumented family seeking public assistance to the immigration agency, a sufficiently vague formula that allows them to tell illegal aliens they should go to the I.N.S. rather than report their names. The 1986 law specifically prohibited county workers from handing over names to the I.N.S., and was meant largely to reassure illegal aliens that they could come forward for help.
The move to repeal the law "goes against everything we are trying to do," said one public health nurse who does outreach work among immigrants, and who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Sometimes, people are afraid to talk, and we have to tell them we're trying to make sure the baby is healthy, not get them deported."
On a broader level, some here worry that turning against illegal immigrants who seek aid could open the way for discrimination against other groups, including legal immigrants and AIDS patients.
"People are reacting to new groups by trying to bring legal terms that are not practical, that go against the constitutional foundations of this country," said Ruben Quiroz, director of public policy at the New York-based Center for Immigrants Rights. "You cannot undercut people just because they are different from you."
Cathy Spiridon, a caseworker at La Union Hispanica, which runs a health clinic here in Central Islip, said employees at the Suffolk County Department of Social Services had in recent months become more hostile toward immigrant parents who seek benefits for their American-born children. She said immigrants had been badgered and called liars by social workers, denied permission to bring their own translators to interviews and had benefits cut to their children without adequate investigation.
"People look at us as if we're from another planet," said Maria D., a Mexican mother of four whose children were dropped from all public assistance on the first of the month. She spent the week with only rice to feed her children for dinner, unable to pay for a prescription to treat a severe infection that was swelling a gash on her 4-year-old son's lip.
Ruth Brandwein, the county's Social Services Commissioner, said caseloads on some public assistance programs had increased by as much as 20 percent over last year, increasing the pressure on employees. Some of them had spouses out of work, she added, and may be turning against the foreigners out of resentment. She said her office would investigate the allegations.
The Commissioner said the bill would hamper, rather than ease, the work of Suffolk County social workers in helping needy aliens. "Most of them are hidden, and don't seek help when they need it," she said. "We're dealing with a very large problem, and this bill is not allowing us to do what little we have in the past."
Many of the immigrants, like 24-year-old Rosa R. -- who did not want her last name used for fear of detection -- work under false Social Security numbers, paying full Social Security and Federal, state and local taxes while drawing few benefits. "Many of them are contributing their fair share," said Kenneth Drange, director of La Union Hispanica.
A social worker back in El Salvador, Rosa found an assembly-line job here wrapping sandwiches at a local catering concern at $4.50 an hour. She worked until the day William was born, and picked up again five days later. Her pay stubs show Social Security and all taxes deducted from her hourly wages. She lives in a house with 13 other aliens.
The better life she had once sought elusive, Rosa will be sending William home, not knowing when or how she will see him again. And she will continue to toil, in a far less welcoming world.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Promises to Modify His Economic Program

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 13

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia promised today that "urgent" corrections would be made in his six-week-old economic liberalization plan to force faster change upon collective farms and to better protect the poor from the steep new price rises.
"Life does not stand still and, therefore, these corrections are perfectly natural and even unavoidable," Mr. Yeltsin told the Parliament in announcing that he would deliver a television address to the nation next Wednesday spelling out the changes and reassuring the worried Russian public. 
 In the face of prices that have increased 350 percent since Jan. 2, the Russian President is expected to announce an increased state subsidy for pensioners and the poor.
 
Crisis on the Farms
 How he might push the badly stalled issue of land redistribution, however, remains unclear as the nation's collective farm managers attempt to deal with widening bankruptcy and confusion about their future.
The Russian Parliament has so far refused to accept full privatization with the individual right to buy and sell land, and Mr. Yeltsin has given no clear sign thus far that he might reach beyond the Parliament by exercising emergency executive power.
"Everything necessary must be done to insure the normal sowing of crops," said Mr. Yeltsin, whose aides lately have expressed concern about the steadiness of the nation's wheat supply.
Mr. Yeltsin's many roles in trying to stabilize Russia were on display today as he claimed success in his recent visits abroad to reassure leaders in Washington and other capitals, as he prepared for another fractious meeting Friday in Minsk with the other heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and as he moved to protect his political flank over economic reform.
In the latter, President Yeltsin drew appreciative laughter from the Parliament when he announced that he was putting his chief domestic critic of late, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, in charge of reorganizing agriculture, in order "to occupy his time to the limit."
Farm problems were long the traditional tar baby for Communist politicians and, if the laughter in the Parliament today is any gauge, may still be still considered such in the new era of promised change. Mr. Rutskoi has had considerable time lately to spend in lambasting Mr. Yeltsin's program on the political stump and in bemoaning the sorry state of agriculture.
In returning to the commonwealth agenda to meet with the leaders of other republics of the former Soviet Union, Mr. Yeltsin will again try to resolve the future of the Soviet military establishment. This is an issue mainly snagged lately on Ukraine's insistence on building its own army and navy from Soviet units and equipment in order to protect its independence from domination by the far larger Russian republic.
 
An Army for Russia?
 In advance of the Minsk meeting, a military adviser to President Yeltsin has begun calling for the creation of a fully independent army for Russia of up to 1.5 million men. But Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vitaly I. Churkin, said today Mr. Yeltsin remained committed to a common army for commonwealth defense.
"Of course it can be done," Mr. Churkin commented on the call for a Russian Army by Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov. "But again this is not going to be our choice, because the best choice for the commonwealth would be to have a unified armed force."
Addressing the more immediate problem of the Russian Government's daily battle to stir economic change, Mr. Yeltsin's chief planner, Yegor T. Gaidar, said he saw signs that the ruble might eventually be stabilized. The ruble's currency market price has fallen back to 115 to the dollar, a drop of 25 rubles in the past few weeks, he said in a television interview.
But in other economic news, the latest Government statistics showedthat retail trade was only 63 percent of what it was a year ago, and industrial output was down 15 percent.

HEADLINE: Worries Amid Growth For Cellular Telephones

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Like the tropical clouds over this always boisterous city, the national recession has overshadowed much of the telecommunications business, stunting its growth. An exception is the cellular telephone industry.
The cellular industry is growing faster than ever, with an estimated 7.5 million users last year, up about 40 percent from the previous year, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association. 
 But even the owners of cellular telephone companies, as well as the manufacturers of telephones and switching equipment, gathered here for the cellular industry's annual convention, are plainly worried about the industry's future.
 
Both Growth and Decline
While the customer base continues to grow, monthly revenue per customer continues to fall. That is partly because of the recession but also because the industry's growth has been so pell-mell that it has brought in a lot of customers who do not use their phones very much.
The industry also faces the uncertainties of introducing digital cellular service in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas later this year. That promises to be as revolutionary, expensive and disruptive as the introduction of compact disks into the music business.
While digital service will provide better sound and longer battery life, it will also require consumers to buy costly new cellular phones that receive both the digital and the current analog signals.
McCaw Cellular, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell are expected to be among the first to introduce digital service.
That executives are worried about the future was evident from the sweaty standing-room-only crowd at a seminar at the New Orleans Convention Center called "Revenue Trends: Is Decreasing Revenue Per Customer Inevitable or Preventable?" The slides of bar graphs from market analysts and cellular companies all seemed to slope downward to the right. And the pricing plans for consumers suggested by various speakers from companies like U S West and Bell Canada elicited a busy scratching of pens and pencils in the darkened room.
 
Gains Are Expected
 Year-end figures for industry revenue and average monthly bills have not been compiled yet by the cellular association, but everyone knows what they will say. Revenue for 1991 is certain to be far above the $5 billion record set in 1990, probably approaching $6 billion.
But the average monthly bill for the six months ended in December is certain to fall below the record low set in June of $74.56 a month. The industry peak came more than three years ago, $98.02 in December 1988. Average call length is also expected to show a decline from the 2.37 minutes recorded in June. The peak in average call length occurred more than two years ago, at 2.48 minutes.
Even their big area of growth, the number of customers, has come at a price for cellular operators. They pay independent commission sales representatives a head-hunting fee of up to $400 a subscriber, as well as a percentage of customers' monthly access fees or air time, the fees charged per minute of use. To make back those big expenses, companies need customers who talk.
Another area of concern to the industry is "churn," the percentage of customers who drop service or go to a competitor. It is a stubbornly high 2 to 3 percent a month, which in a full year means a typical company will see turnover involving a disturbinglty large one-quarter to one-third of its customers. And U S West found that 65 percent of its "dropout" customers did not go to a competitor, but eliminated service altogether.
Looming larger is digital telephone service, which may come as early as this fall to the nation's largest cities, where demand is so high that it is hard to make a cellular call.
Digital service uses streams of "ones" and "zeros," the language of computers, rather than the analog electromagnetic waves used since the days of Marconi. Digital sharply increases the number of callers that can be carried on a cellular system. The Federal Government has allotted a small band of frequencies to cellular telephones, which are radio transmitters that can be carried in a pocket, a briefcase or a car. They link up to the more familiar "land line" system of regular telephones.
Digital cellular carries the promise of better sound and few, if any, calls that are unaccountably interrupted, especially during use in an automobile. "Digital eliminates the snap, crackle and drop," said Alfred F. Boschulte, president of the cellular subsidiary of Nynex that serves New York State and New England.
For consumers, especially doctors, lawyers, Hollywood producers and other heavy users, digital will bring the onslaught of a new marketing campaign by their local cellular operator. Those users will have to be persuaded to buy "dual mode" telephones that could cost more than current models, which run about $1,000 for the tiniest pocket phones and somewhat less for car phones.
Cellular operators may also have to charge more for a digital minute of air time than for an analog minute. While digital service may provide better sound under a wider variety of circumstances, a properly functioning analog system is indistinguishable from the best digital, and that poses a significant marketing hurdle.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
Democrats Move to Capitalize on Clinton's Troubles

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates for President slashed, hustled and frantically repositioned themselves today, convinced that the tempest over Gov. Bill Clinton's draft record had created vast new openings in next Tuesday's primary here.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa asserted that Mr. Clinton was no longer a serious contender in New Hampshire, and fired a withering new attack on the man who seems to be gaining the most from the Arkansas Governor's troubles, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts. 
 Mr. Clinton tried to change the subject, from his Vietnam draft history back to his economic program for the nation. "The character issue in this campaign is who is really willing to put it on the line for you to make your future better," he told an audience of retired people in Concord.
 
Kerrey Says He's 'Electable'
 Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, meanwhile, tried to sell himself as the most "electable" candidate in the field. "A decorated war veteran," one of his television commercials declares this week. "No one can question his patriotism."
And Mr. Tsongas, for 10 long months the lonely long shot in the race, was displaying the cockiness of a front-runner for his now-huge media contingent. He defended Mr. Clinton, attacked President Bush, and joked about his lack of charisma.
It was a day when New Hampshire was humming with politics, from the floor of the Statehouse to the environs of the Portsmouth Shipyard, from the overloaded airwaves of Manchester and Boston television to the the storefront campaign offices crowded with volunteers in downtown Concord. There was a keen pitch of excitement among the strategists and staffers who were struggling to get a handle on a race where so many voters seem so undecided so late.
New Hampshire voters are chronically, perhaps congentially, volatile, but Chris Spirou, the state Democratic chairman, said today, "I don't think we've ever faced this situation before."
 
Clinton Does Some Explaining
 Mr. Clinton sprinted back on the campaign trail today, one day after he found himself explaining and defending a letter he wrote in 1969 thanking an Army officer overseeing an Reserve Officers Training Corps program for "saving" him from the draft. His campaign advisers said he was intent on reaching over the heads of the news media and speaking directly to the voters; he did so tonight with a 30-minute live television show.
Mr. Clinton hired an independent research firm to assemble a dozen undecided voters who were allowed to quiz the Governor on any subject.
"For 13 years, this story was always the same in Arkansas. Until I got into the Presidential race, no one ever said anything different," he said. "And even nw, the facts are not in dispute. I put myslef into the draft and I got a high number."
He was also on the air with television commercials defending his draft record.
This afternoon, Mr. Clinton spoke, with palpable pleasure, of the themes that were the centerpiece of his campaign until it was rocked by accusations of infidelity from a supermarket tabloid, accusations that Mr. Clinton flatly denied. His voice grew stronger and his style ever more impassioned as he stood before the New Hampshire Legislature and talked of the economic challenges facing the nation. "We have to go beyond the established political solutions," he said. Alluding to Mr. Harkin, Mr. Clinton noted that he was sometimes accused of not being a "real Democrat."
The Arkansas Governor, who adroitly positioned himself last year as the voice of a redefined Democratic Party, added, "I do know I'm against brain-dead politics, in either party, or both." Throughout the day, the voters asked Mr. Clinton about Medicare, AIDS, the deficit and the future of the Haitian refugees; but the reporters who swarmed around him at every stop asked about the draft.
Still, he seemed energized by the crowds. "Every election is a fight, it's a contest," Mr. Clinton told cheering students at Winnisquam High School in Tilton, where, coincidentally, it was 60's Day and the students wore headbands, tie-dyed shirts and fringed vests.
 
Bringing Along Charisma
 Mr. Tsongas picked up an endorsement today from Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d of Massachusetts. After Mr. Kennedy delivered a rousing speech in Concord on his behalf, Mr. Tsongas quipped, "People say I don't have any charisma, so I brought some." When asked about Mr. Clinton's problems, Mr. Tsongas said he had no problem with the issues being raised, but objected to the frenzied manner in which they were being raised. He criticized Mr. Bush's health care plan as inadequate, and he defended himself from an attack from Mr. Harkin.
Emblematic of Mr. Tsongas's new stature in the race are the attacks now coming his way. Mr. Harkin, who is running neck and neck with Mr. Kerrey in the nightly tracking polls, used the Seabrook nuclear power plant as a backdrop to stress his emphasis on alternative energy sources and assailed Mr. Tsongas for favoring nuclear power.
"Mr. Tsongas has been a Seabrook cheerleader for that plant right there," Mr. Harkin declared. "There is no such thing as a pro-nuclear environmentalist." Mr. Harkin, who is running as the "real Democrat" in the race and the voice of traditional Democratic values, is also on the air with a new television commercial attacking Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Tsongas, asserting they are promoting "trickle-down" economics. And in an interview, Mr. Harkin asserted that "the myriad of problems that seem to confront Mr. Clinton all the time" had eliminated him as a serious contender in New Hampshire.
 
Kerrey's Added Edge
 "It looks as though this race is coming down to a two-person race: Mr. Tsongas and myself," Mr. Harkin asserted. "We're closing in. The surge is out there. I feel the undercurrents pushing us up."
Mr. Kerrey's camp, obviously, sees the race quite differently. The Nebraska Senator is trying to present himself as the logical alternative to a damaged Mr. Clinton and to Mr. Tsongas, who is seen by many Democrats as something of a favorite son in New Hampshire who may not travel well. From the start of his campaign, Mr. Kerrey's allies have tried to present him as a Democrat who would be exceedingly well positioned against Mr. Bush in the fall, arguing that his record as a Medal of Honor winner, who lost his leg in Vietnam, makes him immune to the accusation of being soft on defense.
This argument, however, took on an added edge over the past few days, as the furor over Mr. Clinton's draft status grew. The commercial now on the air for Mr. Kerrey not only touts his military record, but notes that he is "not a regional candidate," apparently a swipe at Mr. Tsongas.
"We just have to drive our points home," said Steve Jarding, Mr. Kerrey's press secretary. "In some ways, it's easy. In some ways, it's frightening, because you don't have a second chance."
Mr. Kerrey himself told reporters today: "Every day this campaign rushes up to the wire. It's clear to me, this is a wide open race."
The organizers of an effort to write-in Governor Mario M. Cuomo here announced they were holding a rally on Sunday, featuring Arthur Schlesinger Jr. In a statement today, Mr. Schlesinger declared, "Mario Cuomo is the strongest candidate the Democrats can come up with" to beat Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Waiving Fees and Doing the Right Thing for Love

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
IT happened right about this time of year in the dental offices of Dr. Duane Schmidt. A bent old lady named Geneva wandered in. She had tried fixing her dentures with glue so she could chew her breakfast oatmeal. As Dr. Schmidt fit a new set, Geneva kept asking about the cost. "This isn't right," Dr. Schmidt thought. He said there would be no charge.
That was Valentine's Day, 1984, on First Avenue in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
 On this Valentine's Day, nearly 17,000 health professionals on the First Avenues, the Queen Streets and the Post Roads across this country, Canada and the New York metropolitan region will quietly present similar Valentines to their poor or uninsured patients. Together they'll waive more than $3 million in fees for more than 300,000 patients, offering inoculations, examinations, fillings, hearing aids, chiropractic work, eye tests, nutritional advice and even marital counseling.
"It just seems like the right thing to do," said Lester Licht, a chiropractor and the Connecticut coordinator for Doctors with a Heart, the nonprofit organization that sprang from Geneva's office visit. "Valentine's is a day associated with love and lets us fulfill the goal that attracted most of us to health care, helping people."
Yeah, yeah, sure. It's a revealing comment on our tough times and instinctive, seemingly savvy cynicism that a contagious continental sense of charity on a day more typically associated with getting candy can seem so strange and attract such little notice. It's so much easier to picture these folks in white coats signing over our checks to their BMW dealer. There must be a catch, right?
Well, here's the catch: Since the Government reserves tax deductibility for real socially beneficial causes like corporate takeover interest expenses, we can only let these health professionals feel good about a decent deed. (You can feel good too, if you want. It's free and nontaxable, for now. Then you can return to the depressing stuff on the next page.)
The day after Dr. Schmidt and his entire office worked free, he began getting calls from colleagues eager to enlist. Soon the outfit outgrew his filing cabinets and took up residence in a Florida computer, where Ann Knight enrolls new professionals at (813) 525-7212.
"This stuff is catching," said Dr. Jeff Cersonsky, a Southbury pediatrician who talked Stewart Nerzig, a nearby internist, into joining. They clear their calendars for the entire day for what they call "Tweeners." These are families who fall through society's cracks with several children and part-time jobs, none offering health coverage.
Of course, many doctors routinely donate free care. Dr. Ali Khodadoust, a noted ophthalmologist here, estimates 25 percent of his practice is free. Still, he and his consultant, Dr. Rocko Fasanella, canceled all surgery and office visits today. They'll open the Corneal Center here at 8 A.M. and close whenever the line ends. Last year about 20 received treatment. None paid the standard $160 fee.
Sometimes on Feb. 14, Dr. Mitchell Quintner and his associate, Tina Gage, have seen up to 80 free patients in his Milford dental office. The patients receive everything from cleanings and extractions to root canals and dental floss. Never has losing $4,000 in income felt so good. "I have a pretty good life," Dr. Quintner said. "It's one way of giving back a little."
Richard McMahon, whose family-run Zenith/Omni Hearing centers sell hearing tests and aids, anticipates giving away 10 $700 hearing aids again today. "A lot of people are hurting," he said, "especially in Connecticut. Government sure doesn't care. We need to care for each other."
This year Joni L. Mark, a certified social worker who runs the Women's Counseling and Psychotherapy Center here, joined her husband, Harry, an ophthalomologist, in offering free services. "If someone is worried about their next meal," she said, "learning where their head is at can seem a luxury. But depression pervades our entire view of life."'
Marita Holl, a Hamden nutritionist, has five appointments for free allergy, hypertension and cholesterol consultations.
Mr. Licht traces his involvement to growing up in the 1960's. "Now," he said, "I'm in position to try and keep those ideals alive." He expects 20 patients in his West Haven clinic.
Each professional said today's patients were by far the most appreciative of the year, often delivering letters or home-grown flowers. Some offer repayment later. Mr. McMahon refuses, saying, "Pass the gift on." Dr. Fasanella has been offered cookies and dancing lessons. "I'm the thankful one," he added.
Another patient, an unemployed woodworker and the father of two children treated by Dr. Khodadoust, offered to do any carpentry without charge. "Of course, I declined," said the surgeon, who is no handyman without his scalpel and laser. "But I did keep his card."

HEADLINE: TAJIKISTAN AGREES TO CURBS ON ARMS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The mineral-producing former Soviet republic of Tajikistan agreed today to adopt an American-designed program for restricting the sale of weapons components and promised never to sell any of its uranium to countries that could use it to build atomic bombs.
President Rakhman N. Nabiyev made those and other promises to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who flew into the snow-blanketed capital of Tajikistan today from Turkmenistan.
Mr. Baker is touring seven former Soviet republics, including five with which Washington has not yet established diplomatic relations. 
 He has been trying to use the carrot of American economic assistance and diplomatic recognition to entice the leaders of those republics to commit themselves to a list of about a dozen principles including free markets, democratic elections, respect for existing borders, protection of minorities and promises not to develop or sell nuclear weapons technology.
 
Tajiks Say Yes
 Judging from his terse remarks to reporters after today's talks, Mr. Nabiyev was much more receptive to Mr. Baker's arms-control proposals than he was to his democracy and human-rights suggestions.
How much any of those promises are worth is an open question. They are being made by officials like Mr. Nabiyev, the head of the Communist Party in Tajikistan in the mid-1980's, who was recently brought out of retirement by former Communists to run against an Islamic fundamentalist slate. He won 58 percent of the vote but the Islamic Renaissance Party, which has ties with neighboring Iran and Afghanistan, won 38 percent.
An American official involved in setting up Mr. Baker's visit said the Tajiks could not have been more forthcoming. They said "yes" to every American logistical and scheduling request, the official said, but found it difficult to deliver on many of them -- an attitude that might apply to their commitment to American principles as well.
None of the republics want to say no to the United States. But their new Governments are so inexperienced in international affairs that they had to be advised by the American security teams on how to organize a proper motorcade.
 
Uranium Ore Deposits
 Whether Tajikistan has a free market economy is largely irrelevant to American interests. But its weapons-export policies are a real concern, and were a focus of Mr. Baker's discussion today with the President.
None of the Central Asian states Mr. Baker is visiting on this tour have nuclear weapons. Those that had short-range nuclear weapons deployed on their soil by the former Soviet Union have already had them withdrawn into Russia. Nevertheless, Tajikistan and neighboring Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are rich in uranium ore. Both have also been visited before Mr. Baker got here by high-ranking Iranian and Libyan delegations.
The President of Turkmenistan pointed out to Mr. Baker during his stop there that the first Soviet atomic bomb was made with enriched uranium from his republic.
After meeting today with President Nabiyev, Mr. Baker said, "One of the principles which we did discuss, which the President agreed, was the principle that we would work together to implement a mechanism for controlling the export of technology relating to weapons of mass destruction."
 
Caution on Islam
 What Mr. Baker offered specifically was to send a team of American arms-control experts to Tajikistan to advise it on how to set up a system of laws and mechanisms to control and prevent the unauthorized export of technology related to nuclear weapons.
President Nabiyev said: "As far as the uranium is concerned, I must say the press is ahead of events. Tajikistan has never sold and will never sell uranium to other important countries."
Of all the Central Asian republics, Tajikistan has the largest percentage of Muslims, about 80 percent of its population of about five million, and it shares a long border with Afghanistan.
Therefore, President Nabiyev must be very careful in his dealings on the question of Islamic fundamentalist influence. When asked during his news conference with Mr. Baker about the rising involvement of Iran in Central Asia, he declined to answer.
 
Race Against Time
 Privately, he made it clear to the American delegation that neither he personally nor the predominantly Russian or Russian-speaking elite of his country find any appeal in the Islamic fundamentalist message, but out in the hinterlands that might not be the case.
Moreover, he said, given the proximity of Iran, his country needs and wants good relations with Teheran. Balancing all of those pressures is the tricky act for all of the Central Asian leaders.
Mr. Baker explained to Mr. Nabiyev, according to American officials, that the United States perfectly understood his desire and need to maintain good relations with Iran and Afghanistan but that emulating an Islamic fundamentalist system would be a mistake.
All of the Central Asian leaders, say American officials, appear to be in something of a race against time now. Unless the newly independent heads of state begin to deliver for their populations, radical messages, whether of an Islamic or secular variety, are going to begin to have a greater resonance.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House Memo;
Trick for Bush Is to Run Against the Bush of 1980

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
In a new commercial that his campaign began showing on television today, President Bush gazes into a camera in the White House. He reminds New Hampshire Republicans that they "will once again lead the nation" in choosing a President and asks them to "stand united to defeat the liberal Democrats in the fall."
Campaigning in New Hampshire last month, Vice President Dan Quayle repeatedly told voters: "The Republican revolution began here 12 years ago in the snows of New Hampshire. They've been trying to tell you made a mistake. You did not make a mistake." 
 There is only one catch: Mr. Bush's 1980 candidacy, built on moderate Republican themes, died in the snows of New Hampshire, where he lost badly to Ronald Reagan in the primary and later withdrew from the race.
But now it is an important part of Mr. Bush's strategy for the New Hampshire primary to harken back to the Reagan legacy and present himself as a true conservative in hopes of countering Patrick J. Buchanan's insurgency from the right -- even if it ignores Mr. Bush's 1980 defeat.
 
Trappings of Presidency
 Another part of the strategy is to drive home the theme of Presidential leadership, using the trappings of his office. Today's commercial is the second shot in the White House. An earlier one this week emphasized Mr. Bush's leadership in the war against Iraq last year.
Mr. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is Mr. Bush's only Republican opponent, admits that the President has an enormous advantage from his incumbency, which enables him to command headlines and television time and draw big crowds.
But the first part of the strategy may prove more challenging, in part because conservative Republicans count Mr. Bush as a moderate apostate and in part because he has, in effect, begun a campaign against the George Bush of 1980.
After withdrawing from the Presidential stakes then, Mr. Bush swung his policies sharply to the right to become Mr. Reagan's running mate. In 1988, Mr. Bush won the New Hampshire primary by presenting himself as a more moderate, but still conservative, alternative to candidates like Jack F. Kemp Jr., Bob Dole and Pat Robertson, the television evangelist.
Now Mr. Bush is sounding more conservative than ever, campaigning against government that is too big and expensive and for welfare reform, deregulation and family values.
Burton Yale Pines, vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization, said that in recent days, Mr. Bush had also been telling conservative Republicans that his Administration was going to start enforcing the Supreme Court's 1988 "Beck decision," which prohibits unions from collecting dues from nonmembers for anything other than collective bargaining.
"There's a whole range of conservative things that Bush could have done two or three years ago and is only doing just now," Mr. Pines said. "I'm glad he's deciding to cut regulations, but the taxes he is cutting are the taxes that he raised. The regulations he wants to reduce are the regulations he increased. The deficit he wants to cut is the deficit he raised."
Charles R. Black Jr., senior adviser to the Bush campaign, insisted that Mr. Bush ran on a conservative platform in 1988 and delivered on as much of it as he could."Pat Buchanan, who has undertaken an insurgent conservative candidacy, has only been able to identify two issues that he harps on: the tax increase and the civil rights bill," Mr. Black said.
He argued that Mr. Bush accepted a tax increase in 1989 only to get a compromise on spending cuts with Congressional Democrats and that Mr. Bush delayed signing a job discrimination bill until he believed it would not establish quotas.
 
Avoiding Ideological War
 Clearly, the Bush campaign does not want the Republican primary in New Hampshire to be an ideological battleground. "There aren't many people who are for Pat because they don't think Bush is conservative enough," Mr. Black said. "They are dissatisfied with the economy and want to cast a protest vote."
But Mr. Bush's appeal to the right is evident. And conservatives like Mr. Pines, who probably would not like Mr. Bush no matter what he said, are not buying it. "We're all full of love in our heart for the repentant sinner," he said, "but there is reason for us to be skeptical of this."

HEADLINE: Congress Studying Ways to Ease Pain of Huge Pentagon Cutbacks

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Fearing economic dislocation from $50 billion in cuts to the Pentagon budget, Congress is considering a variety of proposals to cushion the effect on communities, employees at arms plants and displaced military personnel.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has proposed allowing military personnel a year's leave to attend college or undertake vocational training to prepare for civilian life, then providing increased retirement pay to those who go into teaching, law enforcement and other jobs designated by the Government as particularly useful to society. Congressional budget analysts have not yet determined the cost of the proposal. 
 Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has called for keeping arms-production lines open to improve existing weapons, in part to keep highly skilled workers in military industries like fighter jet and tank manufacturing. Representative Beverly B. Byron of Maryland, who heads the Armed Services military personnel subcommittee, suggests sending displaced military forces to help the former Eastern bloc and Soviet countries rebuild.
Although no one is certain what the economic effect of the military budget cuts will be, members of Congress are reacting to concerns that the savings will seriously harm some areas of the country. Some members argue that some of the money should be reinvested in hard-hit communities or otherwise used to ease the pain.
The Defense Department has announced plans to cut $50 billion from military spending from 1992 through 1997, but some lawmakers have called for cuts two to three times that size. The aerospace industries in California and Texas and big shipyards in Connecticut and Rhode Island could be especially hurt.
The Administration has not offered any sweeping proposals about softening the effect of the budget reductions since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Christopher Jehn, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel, said in response to Mr. Nunn's plan: "The concept in general is an interesting one. When we get hard legislation, we will take a serious look at it."
 
$200 Million for Training
 The Pentagon's main effort so far has been to earmark $200 million since 1991 to help retrain and find jobs for employees from arms plants who have been laid off and help communities affected by base closings.
"This funding replenishes badly taxed resources already stretched to the max by cuts in defense spending," said Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, where thousands of workers face layoffs at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton following the Pentagon's decision to cancel the Seawolf submarine.
Until Congress approved the $200 million supplemental grant, the Office of Economic Adjustment, a tiny agency in the Defense Department, relied on a $5 million annual budget for grants to communities to help them redesign their economies after a base or arms factory closed.
Paul Dempsey, deputy director of the economic adjustment office, said that 93,000 civilian jobs were lost when the Pentagon closed 100 installations in the 1960's and 1970's, but that the new businesses that took over the sites now employ 158,000 people.
 
Both Winning and Losing
 More than two million military-related jobs will be lost by 1996, Senator Nunn said, and efforts to aid those hurt by the cuts will have to compete with causes like housing, health care and aid to the former Soviet Union for the savings.
"They are not losing their jobs because they failed -- they are losing their jobs because they were successful," Senator Nunn said in a speech last week that outlined a proposal that included early-retirement incentives, job retraining and community-service credit that would be applied toward military pensions. Proposals to encourage early retirement from the services are relatively new in the era of the all-volunteer military.
The Defense Department's proposed $281 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is $10 billion lower than the current spending plan, largely from cutting expensive weaponry, including the Seawolf submarine.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says these weapons are no longer needed, given the Soviet Union's demise, and that consolidation of the arms industry was a painful inevitability.
 
Not So Easy to Cut
 Mr. Cheney and his senior military advisers have fought to shield the active-duty military from deeper cuts than the Pentagon's plan to reduce the number of forces to 1.6 million by 1995, from the current level of 2 million. "That's a very complicated process to manage the force structure in that way," Mr. Cheney said. "It's a living, dynamic being. You've got people coming in, people serving, people retiring, so we've tried to do it in an intelligent fashion."
Pentagon rules now provide that most service members discharged against their will, for reasons ranging from obesity to homosexuality, are entitled only to a one-time payment of 5 percent of annual salary multiplied by years of service.
In the past month, the armed services have started offering voluntary buyouts to selected officers and enlisted personnel, with six to 20 years of active service, to winnow the force this year by about 55,000 people in specialties where there are surplus skills. Military personnel are eligible for retirement benefits after 20 years' active service.
 
To Encourage Shrinking
 Under the military's new plans to encourage these voluntary retirements, the Defense Department is offering an annuity or lump-sum payment to those who accept the offer. "It's better to get out now than to be forced out later, when there might not be a bonus," Sgt. David Hall, an 11-year Army veteran who served as a radar repairman in the Persian Gulf war, told The Army Times newspaper re
Personnel officials have been shrinking the military in a variety of other ways, including offering fewer promotions, setting smaller recruiting targets and accelerating retirement for some personnel who have served more than 20 years.
Lawrence J. Korb, a senior military personnel official in the Reagan Administration, said that declines in annual new enlistments -- from 320,000 five years ago to about 206,000 now -- will most hurt members of minorities, some of whom use the military as a ladder of social mobility.
Mr. Nunn's proposal, while not addressing this specific concern, maps out a strategy to allow the services to trim personnel in overstaffed specialities and train them for "critical community service jobs" that require leadership skills.
His plan would offer early retirement to senior officers and non-commissioned officers with 15 to 20 years' active service. This would be aimed at about 225,000 men and women, or 11 percent of the present total force. Mr. Nunn said their retirement would prevent the military from becoming top-heavy with senior officers.
 
Credit for Community Service
 To encourage the former service members to go into teaching, health care, law enforcement and other vital professions, they would receive one year of service credit for each year of community service, up to 20 total community-and-service years.
In addition, the proposal would allow active-duty military personnel, mainly combat troops, a year's leave to attend college or job training to prepare for civilian life. These forces would be eligible for education benefits.
The Defense Department would coordinate all programs to train, counsel and provide assistance to military personnel and Federal civilian employees affected by military cuts.
"If we act wisely, we can turn the enormous problem of excess talent in defense occupations into the enormous asset of new talent in non-defense occupations," Mr. Nunn said in his speech, warning that failing to do so could worsen the economy.

HEADLINE: Off and Running at Convention Site

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The opening gavel of the Democratic National Convention at Madison Square Garden is five months away, but already 17,500 hotel rooms have been booked -- enough to house the entire population of Kings Park, L.I., or Gallup, N.M.
News organizations are already squabbling about just how cramped the press headquarters will be. 
 Top Democrats are concerned that the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers might end up in postseason playoffs. That could delay the convention construction workers hired to build the podium on which the candidates will stand and, after the Rangers' ice is melted away, the false floor on which the 4,922 delegates will cheer.
 
Into High Gear Already
 While voters' attention has been focused on the candidates in New Hampshire -- with an occasional, clearly unsolicited, glance toward Albany -- convention organizers in New York City have shifted into high gear. Contracts worth millions of dollars are being handed out, for everything from buses to carry the delegates to and from their hotels, to the big signposts that will say "Tennessee" or "American Samoa" marking off the delegates' seats. Space, how much (always a fighting issue in midtown Manhattan) and who gets it, is being argued over in the Democrats' offices a block from Madison Square Garden and in city offices across from the old Tweed Courthouse near City Hall.
Today the discussions will move into Madison Square Garden itself. Eight Democratic state chairmen will tour the arena to pass judgment on what the convention's staff has in mind for the layout and logistics of a gathering that will be part spectacle, part serious: a week of national agenda-setting, or so the Democrats hope.
New York City officials have their own agenda. They are banking on the dollars the delegates will spend to provide a $190 million booster shot for the local economy and municipal morale.
The prospect of big sales tax revenues from conventioneers' meals, hotel bills and shopping trips has city officials rolling up their sleeves. The city has budgeted $20.8 million for everything from guaranteeing the rent on Madison Square Garden to paying the police officers who will stand outside to buying insurance that will cover anyone who falls off the podium.
"We're trying to make this the emotional high that can help us through hopefully the last difficult period of this recession," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Development.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero and other city officials are hoping that the convention will mean favorable publicity about New York, both among the delegates and in stories by the 15,000 journalists expected to attend. In hopes of showing them New York at its best, the city is lining up teams of perky volunteers to greet red-eyed delegates at airports. The city is also planning upbeat parties for the 56 delegations (one from each state, plus the District of Columbia and five territories) that will nominate the Democratic candidate.
In contrast to the five previous Democratic conventions in New York -- the first was in 1868, the last in 1980 -- the Dinkins administration is determined to make the 1992 gathering a citywide effort, not just a Manhattan event. The city and the Democrats have set up an organization-chart full of organizations staffed by what amounts to a political Who's Who.
As it does for every convention, to conform to Federal election laws, the Democratic National Committee created a subsidiary called the Democratic National Convention Committee and put the fate of its day-to-day operations in the hands of someone named Mario.
Not that Mario, but Mario Cooper, an 38-year-old lawyer who once worked at Macy's as a speechwriter for Edward S. Finkelstein, the chairman and chief executive officer. Before that, he was an advance man at the Carter White House. He answers to Alexis Herman, the deputy chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who is also the chief executive of the convention group.
 
Negotiating Discount Rates
 The convention committee was responsible for negotiations for discount rates for delegates at 65 hotels, and for the somewhat more delicate negotiations about the name for the two hotels around which many convention activities will be centered, the Sheraton New York and the New York Hilton.
The Democrats needed two hotels because they decided there were not enough rooms in one for sleeping and offices. As for what to call them, the Democrats had a what's-in-a-name discussion. They considered "co-headquarters hotels" before christening the two hotels the "headquarters hotel complex."
To work with the Democrats, the city set up New York '92, which is responsible for convention infrastructure. Heading New York '92 is Henry Miller, a former aide to Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta. Mr. Miller oversaw Atlanta's winning bid for the 1988 Democratic convention.
Separately, the city set up another nonpartisan organization called the New York '92 Host Committee. It is helping to coordinate the very political parties planned during the convention. Leslie Marcus, the executive director of the New York '92 Host Committee, raised money for David N. Dinkins's mayoral campaign in 1989. She said last week that the Host Committee had raised $3.5 million toward its $6.5 million goal.
As for what people not attending the convention will see of Madison Square Garden, high-ranking Democrats have already had a first glimpse of how the weeklong will look on television.
The podium exists only as a secret model in an architect's studio in Carnegie Hall. The Democrats refuse to let it be photographed, but the 18-inch-wide miniature is already being televised. The architect, Richard Dattner, borrowed a tiny video camera hooked up to a television monitor to show convention planners what the finished podium would look like.
"It gives a sense of how to interpret colors and surfaces," Mr. Cooper said, "and gives us some sense of camera shots and angles that we need to be concerned about."
When the delegates arrive, they will be trailed by 15,000 reporters, editors, producers and technicians. They will be given work spaces on vacant floors in an office building across 33d Street from the Garden.
 
Space Squeeze 'No Surprise'
 That there is a space squeeze "is no surprise," said Steve Komarow, a correspondent for The Associated Press in Washington who is chairman of the Standing Committee of Correspondents, the group that arranges credentials for reporters wanting to attend both major parties' conventions.
He and other convention-bound journalists have memories of 1980, when "space was very tight." This time around, "the requests from news organizations will dwarf the available space," he said.
Will the convention planners get out their tape measures to make sure they are not being shortchanged? Will they rent more space for press headquarters at nearby hotels? Will cynical, hard-bitten reporters file the kinds of stories the city is dreaming of?
As they say on television, only time will tell.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Up 0.6% in Month In Hopeful Sign

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
In one of the first important reports to signal a possible economic rebound, the Commerce Department said today that retail sales rose by six-tenths of 1 percent in January.
The increase was the largest in eight months in a sector that represents about one-third of the nation's economic activity and is crucial to any economic rebound. 
 The report showed that sales of building materials rose by a strong 5.4 percent in January over December, while department store sales rose 2.1 percent, following a 1.6 percent decline in December. And auto sales, which represent about one-fifth of retail sales, rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in January.
 
Good Auto Report
 The nation's auto makers added to the encouraging economic news, reporting that sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose a robust 23.8 percent in early February. [Page D1.]
Several economists said that the increase in retail sales reported today could mean the economy was beginning to lift itself off the floor, but others said that one month's performance was not evidence enough to conclude an end to the recession, especially with employment numbers remaining weak.
"It is possible that it is a start toward recovery," said Ian Borsook, an economist with Merrill Lynch. "But I think it's too early to say whether this trend will continue."
Still, after recent reports showing unemployment flat and durable goods orders down, today's report was welcome news in Washington, where the election-year White House is eager for any signs of recovery. Also welcome was a report from the Labor Department that for the second straight week the number of Americans applying for unemployment claims had declined.
But the strong economic news discouraged the bond market, as the reports on retail and auto sales and jobless claims all suggested the American economy had bottomed out and interest rates with it. Bond prices tumbled and yields jumped, which in turn disheartened the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.18 points to close at 3,246.65.
On retail sales, the consensus prediction among economists had been for a a two-tenths of 1 percent increase, so the six-tenths gain, on a seasonablly adjusted basis, was good news.
 
Holiday Sales Were Up
 In another encouraging part of the report, the December retail figures were revised so that they were up by one-tenth of 1 percent, instead of down by four-tenths of 1 percent as the Commerce Department had originally reported.
"This report shows that the holiday season was not the unmitigated disaster we thought," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw Hill, an economics consulting group in Lexington, Mass. "The report also says that January may have seen the beginning of the upturn in sales, but that doesn't mean in production because we know there is still lots of excess inventory."
Car sales for December were also revised upward, to a gain of two-tenths of one percent, from a decline of 1.1 percent.
Speaking about the overall retail sales gain, John E. Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said, "It's nice to have a positive number suggesting that the economy is recovering."
But he added: "I don't think the actual numbers are as strong as what was reported. The increase in retail sales doesn't jibe with the employment report, income growth report or consumer confidence numbers."
The Labor Department last Friday said that business payrolls shrank by 91,000 in January and that only with the help of a big surge in part-time workers was the unemployment rate able to remain stable at 7.1 percent.
 
Jobless Claims Down Again
 But today the department reported that first-time jobless claims declined for the second consecutive week. According to the report, 437,000 workers made their first visits to jobless offices for the week ended Feb. 1, down 13,000 from the previous week.
Secretary of Labor Lynn Martin said the report might be "an early signal that the economy and the labor market are poised for improvement."
According to the Commerce Department, retail sales were up eight-tenths of 1 percent last year over 1990, the smallest year-over-year nominal sales increase since 1961. Sales were $153.5 billion in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, and $1.82 trillion for all of 1991.
Statisticians make seasonal adjustments to account for differences that traditionally occur between months. For example, retail sales in December or retail employment in December are usually far higher than in January because of the Christmas season. In assessing month-to-month changes, economists seek to even out or smooth over these seasonal variations using calculations derived for each month from patterns over recent decades.
Thus, in comparing January retail sales with those of December, economists subtract from the December figure the amount by which seasonal factors make December higher than a typical month.
 
Keeping Up With Inflation
 Compared with the previous January, the report today showed that retail sales were up 3.9 percent, which economists said was not an impressive jump.
"A year ago there was a recession, so it's basically just keeping up with inflation," said Kurt Karl, an economist with the WEFA Group, an economics consulting group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "The problem is not that consumers aren't spending. The problem is they don't have much income growth. Employment has not been growing, and we're not going to see a lot of strength in retail sales until we see employment growth."
Analysts said the strong jump in building materials sales probably reflected the positive effects that low interest rates were having on homebuilding and home improvement.
Nonetheless, the report noted that sales of appliances, furniture and other home furnishings fell 2.9 percent in January, following a 1.5 percent increase in December.
 
Apparel Sales Slip
 And although department stores sales rose, apparel store sales dipped six-tenths of one percent, following a five-tenths of one percent fall in December.
"History has shown that coming out of recessions, a large surge in chain-store sales often is a signal of a changing economic environment," Michael P. Niemira, an economist, wrote in the Mitsubishi Bank's recent weekly economic report. Last Thursday, the nation's big chain stores reported better-than-expected sales in January.
Restaurant and bar receipts climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent after December's jump of 3.5 percent. Food store rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after an increase of five-tenths of one percent in December.
Sales at service stations rose 1.4 percent, after falling 1.2 percent in December.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Daihatsu Planning to Halt Imports to U.S.

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Daihatsu, the most recent Japanese entry in the American car market, will stop importing vehicles to the United States because of mounting financial losses.
Daihatsu America, based in Los Alamitos, Calif., began selling its Charade subcompact in 1987, and its Rocky compact sport-utility vehicle was introduced two years later. 
 Daihatsu, which sells vehicles in more than 130 countries, has been among the nameplates hardest hit by the recession; sales last year of 8,963 vehicles were off 41 percent from 1990. Its least expensive three-cylinder Charade sells for $6,797. Its base Rocky model costs $12,297.
 
200 U.S. Dealerships
 In total, Daihatsu has sold about 50,000 cars and trucks in the United States through about 200 dealers, and its decision will have little effect on the United States auto industry. Daihatsu is among the top six auto makers in Japan.
The company said it would stop making cars for the United States market through the end of the month and would end distribution to dealers within six months.
Daihatsu officials cited several reasons for their decision, including weak sales and future government safety regulations that would require significant investment.
C. R. (Dick) Brown, Daihatsu America's chief operating officer, said that to this day, consumers confused the car company with Hyundai, a Korean car maker, because of the common "dai" in their names.
When quality problems arose in early Hyundai products, Daihatsu was tarnished with the same reputation, he said.
Daihatsu also could not afford the marketing expense of increasing the brand's name, Mr. Brown said. "If you spent as much as it takes nowadays to get the awareness, you couldn't justify the cost on a per-unit basis," he said.
New luxury brands, like Lexus and Infiniti, typically spend more than $50 million a year on marketing.
But other foreign car makers are not shying away from the United States because of Daihatsu's experience. Kia Motors, South Korea's No. 2 auto maker, plans to introduce a compact car and a sport-utility vehicle next year.
 
Service to Continue
 Daihatsu said it would continue selling its Hijet off-road multipurpose utility truck in the United States, and Mr. Brown said he expected Daihatsu dealers, which also sell other brands, to service their customers after the imports end.
The company operates dealerships in most areas of the United States, except for the Northeast and Midwest. A dealer in Tucson, Ariz., who sold as many as 40 Daihatsus a month, said today that he was disappointed by the company's decision.
"It's a wonderful car with fantastic quality that was way out of proportion with its price," said Lee J. Beaudry, who operates nine dealerships.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates on Treasury Securities Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Data carrying the scent of economic recovery helped to generate a big selloff in the credit markets yesterday, pushing interest rates sharply higher.
Also contributing to the decline in prices was the weight of unsold inventories of securities amassed by dealers during the Treasury refunding auctions this week. 
 The tumble in prices coincided with the last of the Treasury's auctions, the sale of $10 billion worth of 30-year bonds. Demand for the bonds was only fair, traders said, and arose only after long-term interest rates had moved up sharply in the hours before the auction.
The securities were sold at an average yield of 7.91 percent, 10 basis points higher than the bond had been trading late Wednesday. To sell the securities, the Treasury chose to reopen the outstanding 8 percent bonds that mature Nov. 15, 2021, rather than issue a new maturity.
Economic reports released before the auction made an already sour mood in the market even worse, as they provided evidence of strength that would likely discourage the Fed from reducing interest rates further.
Reports of gains in January retail sales and auto sales for the first 10 days of February were stronger than had been expected, and initial unemployment claims fell for the second straight week.
"Those three reports were too much bad news for the market to absorb at one time," said Steven A. Wood, director of financial markets research at the Bank of America.
Traders said some buyers surfaced during the afternoon, when bond prices were at their lows of the day. But selling began anew after the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply registered strong gains in the week ended Feb. 3.
The recent strong growth in the monetary aggregates is seen by many analysts as another indication the economy may be stirring.
Indeed, the shift in market sentiment since the refunding auctions began on Tuesday has been startling. But traders and analysts said that little had changed, and that at current interest rate levels Treasury securities represented good value.
Thoughts that the Fed might need to lower short-term rates, a notion that was widely prevalent after the Government released a weak set of January employment statistics last Friday, has all but evaporated.
"The market has not only thrown out that idea, but they have priced in a tightening move" by the Fed, one government securities trader said.
 
'Fears Are Overblown'
 Victor Chang, president of VC Management Company, a money management firm, said: "The market is overstressed about the possibility that the Fed will tighten policy. I think those fears are overblown, and that the Fed, which does not want to jeopardize a recovery, will maintain a stable monetary policy through the first two or three quarters of an upturn in the economy."
That sort of thinking, however, was not manifested in yesterday's trading.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 101, down more than 1 1/8 points, to yield 7.91 percent, compared with 7.80 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, down 25/32 , to yield 7.38 percent. The 6 1/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 98 1/2, down 25/32 , to yield 6.60 percent. And the new 5.50 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 5.73 percent, up from 5.54 percent late Wednesday.
 
Bill Rates Also Higher
 Short-term Treasury bill rates also moved higher.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.76 percent, up 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.89 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 13 basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.08 percent.
The big rise in interest rates served as a powerful disincentive to most companies to issue new securities.
Nevertheless, underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette did price two issues in the high-yield junk bond market.
The larger offering of the two was the sale of $200 million worth of senior notes for the Century Communications Corporation.
The noncallable 9 3/4 percent securities, which mature Feb. 15, 2002, were offered at various prices.
The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's Investors Service and B by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Municipal Bond Market
 The State of Wisconsin sold $219 million worth of tax-exempt securities at competitive bid in the municipal bond market.
A bid from a group led by the First Boston Corporation won the issue, which consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1993 to 2012.
The securities maturing in 1993 were not reoffered to the public. Yields on the securities that were repriced range from 4.20 percent on bonds maturing in 1994 to 6.60 percent in 2012.
The issue is rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
The selloff in the Treasury securities market had an adverse impact on prices in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities.
Corporate traders said prices of most issues fell by anywhere from 1/2 point to 7/8 point, depending on maturity.
Meanwhile, prices of most widely quoted tax-exempt bonds fell by about 1/2 point, municipal bond traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds:

Average Yield . . . 7.91%

HEADLINE: Hardheaded Skills Equal Financial Headway

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The good news is at least one New York City agency is operating more efficiently than it used to, despite steep budget cuts. The bad news is it is the agency that collects your taxes.
Over the last two years, since Carol O'Cleireacain took over as commissioner at the Department of Finance, changes have been coming fast and furious. And since the department is the one that administers the 23 taxes that pay for city services, manages the city's daily cash balances of $250 million and handles six million pieces of correspondence a year, any improvement in service could be considered a boon to many residents. 
 Taxpayers are now informed when they overpay and automatically credited with their refunds, instead of having to figure out their transgressions themselves and pester the city for refunds.
Property owners now get semiannual statements detailing for the first time how much they have paid in various charges, how much they are delinquent by, if at all, and the amount of interest they owe. If they have questions, they can call a new taxpayer assistance unit -- though the phone lines are often busy.
 
Demystifying the Process
 And on Jan. 15, Ms. O'Cleireacain (pronounced oh-CLARE-eh-can) unveiled what the city thinks the market values of individual buildings and condominiums are, and how they have changed over the last year.
"I am immensely impressed with what Carol O'Cleireacain has tried to do to demystify the process," said Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, which represents 1,600 cooperative organizations and condominium associations. "The whole tax procedure was gobbledygook to many people."
Ms. O'Cleireacain has just embarked on her toughest challenge yet: orchestrating a campaign to change the structure of the city's property taxes so that owners of one- , two- and three-family homes are no longer subsidized to the same degree by owners of condos, co-ops and commercial properties, a proposal that is sure to set off a political firestorm among property-owning groups.
Strikingly, the new vigor of the finance department is coming when its budget is shrinking and when the number of employees reporting to Ms. O'Cleireacain has been reduced by about 500. By the end of this fiscal year on June 30, her work force will have been cut 19 percent and her budget 21 percent since she took office in February 1990.
That Ms. O'Cleireacain has been able and willing to negotiate those management hurdles has come as a surprise to some. As the former chief economist for the city's largest union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and as the chief economic adviser to the Rev. Jesse Jackson in his 1988 Presidential campaign, Ms. O'Cleireacain was expected by many in the business world to be soft on labor and hostile to business and real estate.
 
Some Union Disagreements
 But she has surprised friend and foe alike. She did not hesitate to replace about half of the top people in her department with her own selections and has cut her staff in percentage terms more than many commissioners. About 40 percent of those cuts came in the form of layoffs -- anathema in the labor movement.
"There have been some disagreements there," said Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, some of whose members work at the finance department. "I've told her she's a member of management now."
At the same time, many of the steps she has taken to make the property-tax system more accessible have warmed the hearts of real-estate moguls in the city who had previously been fearful of her liberal background.
"I'm pleased with her running of the department," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, who has been a frequent critic of the city's tax policies.
That is not to say that the tax roll is error free, or that the unevenness with which similar properties are often assessed has disappeared. Still, many of the changes now being put into effect are intended to provide taxpayers with more information, and to make it easier for errors to be identified and corrected.
Ms. O'Cleireacain is making headway with a mix of luck and hard-headed management skills.
She received help in coping with staff reductions when the City Council changed building inspections to once every two years instead of annually. She has benefited from large investments that her predecessors made in new computer systems. (She is the fifth commissioner of the department in five years.) So far, the new computers have enabled the department to improve its paper processing and to automate property assessments, allowing her to cut staff without reducing service.
"The most important thing I can do here is to move the Finance Department into the information age," Ms. O'Cleireacain said.
 
More Criminal Inquiries
 But the changes have to do with more than just new technology. Ms. O'Cleireacain has also shifted staff members from nonproductive areas to where they could generate more revenue.
The department no longer has enforcement officers regularly cruising the streets for commercial vehicles that lack inspection stickers or inspecting basement vaults. Many of those officers are now devoting their time to criminal investigations.
She has also shifted more of her auditors into the corporate tax area, and recast her legal department so that it concentrates on bigger cases, at the same time clearing up the backlog that went back 11 years, in some instances.
As a result, the department expects to generate $501 million in enforcement revenues this fiscal year -- about $62 million more than in the 1990 fiscal year, but with 166 fewer people.
One of the big questions facing Ms. O'Cleireacain in the future is whether she can keep it up. Her success in increasing revenues has been so helpful to the city that the latest financial plan assumes she can generate $500 million a year in enforcement revenues for the next four years.
Few who know Ms. O'Cleireacain would bet against her. An intense, ambitious commissioner, she consistently pushes herself and her employees to succeed. She decided to major in economics as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, she said, because it was the hardest subject she could find. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in economics from the London School of Economics in 1977.
She will need that drive to change the city's tax laws. At a meeting of the city's business leaders, she indicated that she favored merging Class 1 housing, which comprises one-, two- and three-family houses, with Class 2 units, which are made up of co-op and condominium apartment buildings, a move that would level the playing field between the different property-owning groups, and almost certainly result in higher tax bills for small homeowners.
She said she would only support such a change, however, if it were phased in and some protection given to those with low incomes who could not absorb large tax increases.
Any change in the city's property taxes would have to go before the state Legislature and the City Council, both of which will undoubtedly be tough battles. If Ms. O'Cleireacain succeeds in getting her way on this thorny issue, she will truly have earned her reputation as a skillful manager.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Pepsi-Cola Plans Big Effort To Exploit 'Uh-huh' Theme

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS soon as Pepsi-Cola introduced Ray Charles as the spokes-singer for its Diet Pepsi brand, growling, "You got the right one baby, uh-huh!" it seemed the decision had indeed been the right one.
Consumers immediately took to the infectiously cheerful advertising created by BBDO Worldwide, ranking the campaign among the most likable and memorable of 1991. The phrase entered the vernacular, appearing on a line of licensed clothing and on cans and bottles of the soft drink. 
 There was just one uh-uh amid the uh-huhs: Diet Pepsi's market share ended the year as flat as day-old cola, according to Beverage Digest, an authoritative industry newsletter. It ranked fourth among America's leading soft drinks in 1991, with an 8 percent share, unchanged from 1990.
So, eager to translate Diet Pepsi's advertising success into sales, Pepsi executives are planning one of the industry's most extensive, and expensive, marketing blitzes ever on behalf of the 28-year-old brand. Beginning during CBS's telecast of the Grammy Awards on Feb. 25, Diet Pepsi will embark on an elaborate series of events intended to convince America that this April is "National Uh-huh Month."
"We've had tremendous image wins with the 'Uh-huh' campaign," David C. Novak, Pepsi's executive vice president of marketing and national sales, said in a telephone interview from his office in Somers, N.Y. "Our challenge for 1992 is to turn those wins into volume gains."
"We had good sales last year, especially given the economy," he added. "But we haven't leveraged Diet Pepsi's advertising and marketing. So, we're taking 'Uh-huh' to a whole new level."
While Mr. Novak would not discuss the cost of the campaign, soft-drink executives estimated it to be at least $25 million and perhaps as much as $50 million.
The problem facing Pepsi is a familiar one to advertising and marketing executives: How can a popular ad campaign be exploited to its fullest? Also confronting that question are companies like Ralston Purina, trying to capitalize on E. B., the pink bunny that parodies other ads in Energizer battery commercials, and Nestle, hoping to build on the interest in its serial commercials starring a couple searching for romance over a jar of Taster's Choice instant coffee.
The debate still rages over the effectiveness of such fondly remembered advertising as the animated Piel brothers, Bert and Harry, for Piels beer, and the skein of hilarious Alka-Seltzer spots like "I can't believe I ate the whole thing" and "Try it; you'll like it."
"If you can be very creative, and be very persuasive as well, then you've got the ideal," said Al Hampel, an advertising and marketing consultant in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., who popularized the phrase "It's not creative unless it sells" at Benton & Bowles during the 1970's.
"But too few people in the world can do that," he added.
The "Uh-huh" campaign did help Diet Pepsi last year, said Jesse Meyers, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest in Greenwich, Conn., in compensating for sales volume lost when fast-food chains like Burger King and Wendy's International switched to Coca-Cola Company brands from Pepsi-Cola Company brands.
"The advertising is fantastic," he added. "But in the soft-drink industry, distribution is the name of the game."
To that end, Pepsi will devote a significant portion of Uh-huh Month to what Mr. Novak called "partnerships with our retail customers, to make our advertising drive their sales." There will be in-store promotions and special events at supermarket chains like Kroger, convenience-store chains like 7-Eleven and fast-food chains like Subway.
Pepsi is even arranging for United Parcel Service to deliver one million 24-can cases of Diet Pepsi to consumers the company has identified as Diet Coke drinkers.
A spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta described executives there as unperturbed about the potential effects of Uh-huh Month on Diet Coke. That brand's market share last year -- 11.7 percent, according to Beverage Digest -- ranked it third, behind only Coca-Cola Classic (20 percent) and Pepsi-Cola (18.4 percent).
And if, after celebrating Uh-huh Month, consumers have room on their calendars, they might find Coca-Cola asking them to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Diet Coke, which was introduced in July 1982.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Economic Reports Lift Dollar While Gold Falls

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar climbed yesterday on world foreign exchange markets after the Government reported unexpectedly strong economic figures.
Gold prices fell, dropping $2.20 an ounce, to $355.90 on New York's Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours bid of $355.35, down $2.15 from Wednesday's late bid. 
 A rise in United States retail sales and a decline in new claims for unemployment suggested that the Federal Reserve would not have to drive interest rates lower. The reports also contributed to a decline in bond prices, forcing yields on those securities higher and making them more attractive to foreign investors. That helps the dollar by increasing demand for the currency.
John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. in New York, said traders bid the dollar higher in hectic dealings shortly after the release of the retail sales report, which showed that sales jumped six-tenths of 1 percent in January.
 
Some Still Cautious
 But he said the dollar failed to rise above its recent highs against key currencies, which suggested that traders were still wary about the recovery.
In New York, the dollar rose to 127.65 Japanese yen, from 127.40 yen on Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 127.33 yen, from 127.01 yen. In London, the late quote for the dollar was 127.70 yen.
The dollar also edged higher against the British pound. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.7725, down from $1.7895 late Wednesday. In London, the pound fell to $1.7730, from $1.7880 Wednesday.
Other dollar rates as of 4 P.M. in New York, compared with late rates Wednesday, included: 1.6240 German marks, up from 1.6065; 1.4600 Swiss francs, up from 1.4385; 5.5310 French francs, up from 5.4720; 1,220.50 Italian lire, up from 1,208, and 1.18625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18085.
In the precious metals market abroad, gold fell to $356.30 an ounce, from $357.50 late Wednesday in London, and to $356.50 an ounce in Zurich, from $357 late Wednesday.
In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.29 an ounce to close at $357.96 bid.
Silver for current delivery fell 1 cent an ounce, to $4.203, on New York's Comex. Silver fell in London to a late bid of $4.21 an ounce, from $4.22 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Puzzling Poverty Of the 80's Boom

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
DESPITE what you may be hearing from some of the candidates in New Hampshire, the bad old 80's were actually a lot like the good old 60's. The expansion lasted for almost as long as the 60's boom, eight years. The economy grew by nearly as much. And unemployment fell by an even bigger increment.
But in at least one vital dimension, the 80's were totally unlike the 60's. The official poverty rate, which counts the number of people whose income falls short of some minimum level, did not come down as the economy rose. While poverty shrank by a quarter in those golden Kennedy-Johnson years, it was actually higher at the end of the Reagan boom than in 1979. 
 That is pretty surprising no matter what side of the political divide one is on. Every prior economic expansion since World War II has lifted all boats, even the recovery in the sickly 70's. In fact, the skiffs of the working poor have generally been lifted faster than other Americans during economic rebounds, while joblessness ebbs after hitting low-income workers hardest in recessions.
So how come trickle-down economics did not work last time around, especially given that the unemployment rate fell by half, or more than five full percentage points, from 1983 to 1989? Some bright young labor economists -- two at Harvard, one at Princeton -- have taken a look at a variety of explanations and offered some intriguing ones of their own.
The most obvious suspect is the official poverty rate itself. Conservatives have been grousing for years that it overstates poverty because the data undercount income. Government handouts in the form of free or subsidized housing, medical care, and food, the "in kind" benefits that are excluded from most income measures, surged in the 70's, for example.
But, as David Cutler and Lawrence Katz point out in "Macroeconomic Performance and the Disadvantaged," which will appear in the spring volume of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, the fact that such benefits are excluded is irrelevant to the 80's because such benefits did not grow much in that decade.
Or perhaps poor people were living high and hiding more of their off-the-books income? Some analysts have argued that consumption, a much better yardstick of well-being than income in any case, at the low end of the distribution outstripped reported pay and other sources of cash in the 80's.
It is true, as Mr. Katz and Mr. Cutler discover, that there has been a lot less poverty in the United States, 10 percent based on consumption as compared with 13 percent based on reported income in 1988, if you use consumption as the basis for calculating a poverty rate. But, even on this measure, poverty did not decline in the 80's.
Perhaps greedy bosses ate workers' lunches? No cigar there either, say Mr. Cutler and Mr. Katz, both in the Harvard economics department. To their own evident surprise they find that labor's share of the economic pie, about two-thirds, did not shrink an iota in the union-busting 80's.
Instead, a slowdown in pay at the bottom end of the pay scale and a widening disparity between low-wage and high-wage workers is to blame. In other words, even though workers' slice of the economic pie did not shrink, highly educated, more experienced and more skilled workers took a bigger bite while the young, the uneducated and the unskilled got fewer crumbs.
Not only did jobs in manufacturing, where unskilled workers used to be able to earn premium pay, shrink as a share of total jobs, but within virtually every industry, demand for unskilled workers either slipped or grew more slowly than for workers with more to offer -- exactly the opposite of what happened in the 60's.
"Changes in relative labor demand against the less-skilled offset the effects of improved overall employment opportunities during the expansion of 1983 to 1989," write Mr. Cutler and Mr. Katz.
The problem may reflect the much-talked-about computerization of the American workplace, argues Alan B. Krueger, who is at Princeton University, in research that will also be published shortly by the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Krueger traces about one-third of the growing gap between the pay of high- and low-skilled workers to the mass invasion of the computer in the nation's shops, offices and factories during the 80's. Workers who use computers but are similar in every other respect to workers who do not earn a fat bonus of 10 to 15 percent for their knack with these machines.
What's important is that those who tended to use computers, he finds, are white, female and well educated. But those who do not are disproportionately black, male and high-school dropouts. Women and blacks, of course, have higher poverty rates than average and earn less per hour.
That sends a clear message to politicians who want to promote greater equality of earning power along sexual and racial lines. Instead of focusing only on getting teachers to call on girls in class, or just persuading black children to stay in school, maybe it makes sense to guarantee that these kids have equal access, and plenty of it, to computers in school.

HEADLINE: A Euro-Fling on East 77th St.

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
THE bar in the Mark hotel is small, dimly lighted and as cozily intimate as a private club. So intimate that the Frenchman in aviator glasses, black jeans, and a jacket with Mickey Mouse stitched under a "Euro Disney" logo felt free to slide his chair to a corner table occupied by two women. "May I eat off your plate?" he murmured in a thick Parisian accent, smoke curling up from his Gauloise. He helped himself to a thick slice of goat cheese quesadilla and munched ingratiatingly.
Even the nicest Upper East Side hotels are not safe from creeping Eurotrash. My friend and I had checked into the Mark for a quiet, self-indulgent girls' weekend of room-service folly, a kind of Thelma-and-Eloise adventure. Fortunately for the Frenchman, we had not packed firearms. 
 And fortunately for us, most of the clients who stay at the Mark are not as extroverted. The Mark, which occupies a red brick and limestone building on 77th Street at Madison Avenue, is what is known in the tourism industry as a "boutique hotel," small, quiet, expensive and European, the last word usually meaning that the concierge has almost as much stature as the chef.
The Mark prides itself on a stylish staff (many of whom sport Italian suits, French or German accents and an unmistakable Continental hauteur) and speedy, impeccable service (room service Continental breakfast: 6 minutes 32 seconds). Lately, its serenity has been disrupted by daily picketing by members of Local 6 of the hotel and restaurant employees union. The hotel staff is union, but the waiters and busboys in the restaurant and Mark's Bar are not.
Since it was bought by the Rafael Group and renovated two and a half years ago, the Mark has developed a large following in the entertainment industry: among others, Harrison Ford and Mitsuko Uchida, the concert pianist, have stayed there. There are also representatives from the art and fashion world; well-heeled customers from the West Coast who enjoy being treated in at least one New York establishment as old, esteemed friends.
"We wouldn't stay anyplace else, and neither would our friends," said Jack Silberkleitt, a clothing manufacturer from Beverly Hills, who travels to New York on business eight times a year. He recently switched allegiances from the Regency to the Mark. "They take care of you," explained his wife, Cheryle, who, enveloped in a full-length black mink, seemed to know what she was talking about. (On cold days at the Mark, everyone wears fur, preferably mink. Even the doorman wears a jaunty astrakhan beret.)
She spoke lovingly of Giorgio, one of the Mark's more prominent concierges. "He can do anything," she crooned. "When Coco Pazzo is booked solid Giorgio can always get us in." She also said she loved the special touches awarded repeat customers: "They sent Jack a birthday cake last time we were here, and when we bring the kids, they put brownies and milk in their room." Mr. Silberkleitt spoke most fondly of the discount. "I get a good corporate rate," he said with simple pride.
The design of the lobby, which one assistant manager, Vasile, described rather excitedly as "contemporary Italian Neo-Renaissance style," is elegant and very much in keeping with the reigning Architectural Digest sensibility: black and cream marbled floors, Biedermeier chairs, 18th-century Piranese prints and yellow hallways punctuated with marble pillars and framed etchings of Greek and Roman urns. Even without the Neo-Classical chaises-longues, the Mark has a distinct "Mme. Recamier slept here" feel to it.
The service is speedy and the employees are pleasant, but at hundreds of dollars a night, first-time guests may hunger for a little more abject servility from the desk. When we checked in on a recent Saturday at noon, we were cheerfully informed that the room was still occupied and that we would have to wait for at least an hour. We waited for plaintive apologies and a restorative cocktail on the house, and were offered neither. We followed the minks, and went shopping.
The Mark does not have its own gymnasium or health club. Guests are referred to the East Side Fitness Center a few blocks away. For each use of the center, the hotel charges $25 a person, so it might be best to wait until the urge to exercise passes, preferably over tea in the restaurant.
 
A Two-Star Restaurant
 The French cuisine served in the Mark restaurant received enthusiastic praise and two stars from The New York Times in 1990. On average, dinner for two costs about $150. Tea is more affordable, and the ambiance is just as pleasant. Many hotels are famous for their elaborate English high tea. The Mark, which serves it in the small lower area of its two-tiered, oak-paneled dining room, fulfills even the most exacting Blenheim castle fantasies. Brewed tea is served in heavy silver pots and dainty porcelain cups, while the tea sandwiches are delicate, tiny and served without crusts. (Tea for two, albeit with a glass of wine, came to $46.86.) The richly carpeted room, like the bar, has an old, burnished, patrician feeling. On a buffet table at the entrance, there are huge glass bottles filled with pears soaking in amber-colored liqueurs: a chichi variant on pickle jars in an old-fashioned deli, but very pretty.
A warning: At a recent tea, the black mink coats were so numerous that one elegant patron, who was wearing a casual brown sheared mink jacket, seemed to feel underdressed. "Mine is the leopard, and my friend has the sable," she said sarcastically to the coat-checker.
Rooms range in price from $265 for a "superior" room to $295 for the "Mark Deluxe." (First-class hotels are given to the same grade inflation found at Ivy League colleges: just as some professors give no grade below a B, no self-respecting luxury hotel labels even its smallest rooms anything less then "superior.")
Whether "deluxe" or "superior," the rooms are large, airy and comfortable, but, given the opulence downstairs, their appointments are surprisingly bland. Even a $500-a-night "executive suite," which on weekends can be had for $350 (Continental breakfast included), came with few individual touches: the pale pink walls were decorated with only a few generic prints (19th-century soldiers; other rooms carry hunting scenes or botanical drawings). The carpeting was beige and wall to wall, and the furniture was standard issue: gray Lucite writing desk and nightstands. (No charming escritoire, dainty armoires or Biedermeier BarcaLoungers.) The couches, while comfortable, were upholstered with a Ramada Inn-style fabric in a pink, yellow and gray zigzag pattern that mainly looks like a pastel electrocardiogram chart.
Nearly half the rooms come with small kitchens, which in turn come with dishwashers but no dishes. (On the other hand, plates and forks from room service: 4 minutes 47 seconds.)
 
A Restrained Mini-Bar
 The best mini-bars are the kind that could keep a wealthy agoraphobe alive for days: well stocked with wine, liquor and soft drinks as well as cheeses, cookies and pate. The Mark mini-bar is more restrained, offering a full range of beverages, but only jellybeans and chocolate-covered popcorn to eat. The price list was hidden from view in a closed cabinet, perhaps on the universal mini-bar theory that if you have to ask the price, you can't afford it. (A Coke: $3.50.)
What the rooms may lack in idiosyncratic charm, they make up for in modern conveniences. The weekend suite came with television sets and VCR's in both the living room and the bedroom. The hotel film library stocks nearly 200 movies, from the usual blockbusters to cult films ("The Rocky Horror Picture Show," "The African Queen" and "My Beautiful Laundrette"). Even the pornographic offerings sounded almost high-minded, with such titles as "Dear Fanny" and "A Passage to Ecstasy."
Toiletries in the Art Deco black and white tile bathrooms were few, and disappointingly tasteful: tiny bottles of Neutrogena (the shampoo equivalent of PBS), orange sticks and cotton swabs in a tiny black box and toilet paper wrapped with a thin black ribbon. There was only one terry-cloth robe in a suite built for two, and no bubble bath. To some, this might pass for European raffinement, but to those accustomed to the standardized pampering provided by even lesser hotel chains, it smacks of stinginess.
The Mark offers solicitous service, comfort and sleek, East Side elegance. It is certainly more restful than the rash of such fashionable midtown establishments as the Paramount, the Royalton and Morgan's, Ian Schrager hotels whose prankish post-modern furniture can strike the faint-hearted as user-hostile.
But for all its charm, the Mark has a major weakness.
First-class hotels that offer neither flowers nor bedtime chocolates on the pillow in their $350 suites should beware: Thelma and Eloise have killed for less.

HEADLINE: Studio Proposes Weekly Bargain for Moviegoers

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Universal Pictures has proposed that movie theaters sell tickets at half price one day a week to stimulate weekday moviegoing, but theater owners gave the plan a mixed response today.
Some theater operators welcomed the proposal, but others said that discounting was already in place in many theaters and that the measure appeared to be a publicity ploy by Universal. But even critics of the idea said it underscored the restlessness and concern among studios and exhibitors about the uneasy financial state of the movie industry. 
 The proposal was made by Tom Pollock, chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group, and Universal. Mr. Pollock said Wednesday that he was inviting theater owners to take part in an experimental bargain day that would offer half-price adult admissions for current Universal films every Tuesday.
"Midweek business for movies in America is a disaster," Mr. Pollock said in an interview today, blaming high ticket prices and lackluster films for lagging attendance. "The average screen in America has 38 people on a given weekday. Thirty-eight people all day! It's like flying from L.A. to New York with three people on board."
 
Cheaper Popcorn, Too
 Universal's proposal was intended to initiate debate about the impact of the high admission prices -- as much as $7 or $7.50 in some areas -- before the National Association of Theater Owners' convention next week in Las Vegas, Nev. Last year, movie admissions hit a 15-year low. Universal also urged theaters to reduce concession-stand prices, which have also drawn complaints from moviegoers.
Mr. Pollock said some chains will start adopting the half-price policy next week at theaters showing Universal films like "Fried Green Tomatoes," "Cape Fear" and "Kuffs."
But some theater owners said privately today that Universal was not proposing to lower its film rental costs while asking movie houses to limit their prices. At the same time, some owners said it would be unrealistic and difficult for movie houses to slash prices on Universal's films while maintaining separate prices for the movies of other studios.
 
Success in Canada Cited
 Support for the Universal proposal came from the Cineplex Odeon Corporation, which is partly owned by MCA. Allen Karp is president and chief executive of the Canadian-based company, which owns 1,157 screens and 267 theaters in the United States.
"Special pricing on Tuesdays has been interwoven into the Canadian theatrical exhibition fabric for several years with great success," Mr. Karp said. "It has had a positive impact both on the frequency of attendance for the regular moviegoer and in bringing out a large and entirely new audience who otherwise would not attend movies."
The plan was also endorsed by other chains, including Carmike Cinemas, a growing movie circuit based in Columbus, Ga., with more than 800 screens in the South and the Southwest, as well as the Pittsburgh-based Cinema World, and the Wometco Theaters, based in Florida. But several major movie chains reacted coolly, saying, essentially, that they already had discount programs for matinee audiences, students and the elderly. Such programs are called niche discounting.
Mr. Pollock said he had not spoken to other studio chiefs about the plan. "The movie business is sensitive to quality and price," he said. "You put better movies in the marketplace; more people will come. The question is, in a recession, is it too expensive for people to come out when there are so many other alternatives? You can rent a video much cheaper during the week than the weekend; in some places, it's only 49 cents. The video stores are aware they should reduce prices to increase volume. The movie business hasn't really done it."
He added: "If all 38 people who show up on the average get in at half price, and no one else shows up, then we lose a little money. But when times are tough -- and they are tough now -- we should try to be innovative and see what happens. I have a feeling more than 38 people will start showing once we cut the prices."

Again: South Garden
This week, four months after the Battery Park City Authority formally put a stop to a much-criticized proposal for South Garden that would have blocked its spectacular Hudson River views, the authority announced new plans for the diamond-shaped, 3.5-acre plot at the tip of Battery Park City. 
 The authority's new team -- a seasoned one, experienced in the design of open spaces -- includes the Boston-based architectural firm Machado & Silvetti, the landscape architects Hanna/Olin from Philadelphia and the horticulturist Lynden B. Miller of Manhattan.
Absent from the mix is an artist, an omission that the previous design team finds puzzling. "It's a pity the authority abandoned its original idea and that there's not an artist in the new group," says Jennifer Bartlett, the artist who was part of the initial team, along with Alexander Cooper, the New York architect.
David Emil, the president and chief executive officer of the authority, says that the choice of architect and landscape architect was made after reviewing more than 60 proposals submitted to the authority, which had solicited architects, landscape architects and horticulturists in newspaper advertisements and by word of mouth.
"The choice of an artist as part of the original design group was something I inherited from a previous administration," Mr. Emil says. "In reviewing our needs, we now felt an architect and landscape architect was most appropriate. That's not to say we won't add an artist later, but initially we wanted a team that had thought a lot about designing open, urban spaces and would give us a powerful plan, one that would work within the context of the park system."
The authority's announcement ends years of relentless, and often bitter, criticism of Ms. Bartlett and Mr. Alexander's proposal. Their scheme called for a grid of 24 thematic plantings enclosed by tall hedges and a 10-foot-high concrete wall that would have virtually blocked all river views.
Everyone from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to community planning board members to residents of Battery Park City labeled the plan impractical, elitist and expensive. But Ms. Bartlett contends, "The scheme was eminently buildable, growable and could have been done within budget."
The current $12 million budget is $2 million less than the estimated cost of the Bartlett-Alexander plan. And Mr. Emil says that the authority is now committed to working with the community to see what local residents feel needs to be included in the garden plan.
While no artist is yet part of the South Garden proposal, artists' names are circulating in another Battery Park City Authority project. According to Mr. Emil, the authority is considering adding a sculptor to the design team that is working on the two-acre park around the World Financial Center. The sculptors Martin Puryear and Brower Hatcher are among the likely candidates. Whoever is selected will join the New York architectural firm Mitchell-Giurgola and the Cambridge, Mass., landscape architect Susan Child, who have already begun the initial design.
Still another Battery Park City project, and one that is further along, involves the sculptor Tom Otterness and North Park, just south of Stuyvesant High School's new campus. Mr. Otterness is at work on what he calls a "sculptural environment," which includes about 100 bronze figures covering a 160-foot-long path. It is to be completed in May. "It's whimsical, but in a dark way," Mr. Otterness says. Sketches for some of the imaginative, doughlike figures included in the design are on view beginning this Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition "Allegories of Modernism: Contemporary Drawing."
 
Morley Is Moving
 When word spread that the figurative painter Malcolm Morley was about to leave the Pace Gallery for Mary Boone in SoHo, many in the art world wondered if the defection was a result of Arnold Glimcher's absentee management of Pace. It seems that Mr. Glimcher, who has been busy directing the film "The Mambo Kings," which opens on Feb. 28, was rarely at the gallery. Mr. Morley, art insiders say, felt neglected.
Mr. Morley's lawyer, Michael Lynne, said the artist had no comment; Mr. Glimcher did not return phone calls. But several art experts say they believe that Mr. Morley has a contractual obligation to Pace that might make his departure more complicated.
Ms. Boone would say only: "Malcolm is an artist that I've admired for a great many years. And I hope to do a show of his work next season."
Douglas Baxter, the director of the Pace Gallery, says he believes that Mr. Morley's planned departure has nothing to do with Mr. Glimcher's film career. "We worked very hard for Malcolm," he says. "He's a wonderful painter. Sometimes these things happen. He's the only artist to leave the gallery in seven or eight years."
In fact, Mr. Baxter insists that Pace is "not losing artists; we're gaining them." He points to Dan Flavin, whose first show -- "Colored Fluorescent Light 1964 and 1992" -- opens tomorrow at Pace's gallery at 142 Greene Street in SoHo. Mr. Flavin was represented by Leo Castelli, and most recently has been shown at the Rubin Spangle Gallery.
Mr. Baxter also cites Antoni Tapies, the 68-year-old Spanish artist, who is also joining Pace. "Tapies's achievement, relatively unknown here, is absolutely central to postwar art, both European and American," Mr. Baxter says. While Pace will show the artist's work in North America, Galerie Lelong will continue to represent him in Europe. "We're currently planning a Tapies show for February 1993," Mr. Baxter says. And the Museum of Modern Art is having an exhibition called "Antoni Tapies in Print," which will include more than 100 prints and illustrated books, opening May 7.
 
Koons May Leave
 Reports that the artist Jeff Koons is leaving the Sonnabend Gallery, where he has been showing his work for the last six years, have been circulating ever since his highly publicized -- and some have said pornographic -- show at the SoHo gallery closed just before Christmas. (The exhibition included many works depicting Mr. Koons and his wife, Ilona Staller, in various sexual positions and in various stages of undress.)
"The situation is like a ball of wax that has yet to be melted," says Mr. Koons's lawyer, John Koegel. "Ultimately, Jeff would like to be independent, but he has not left Sonnabend yet."
Money is apparently what is holding things up. "There's still a significant amount of money that the gallery advanced Jeff for the materials necessary to produce his work," Mr. Koegel says. Several calls to Mr. Koons's studios in New York and Munich, Germany, were not returned.
While neither his lawyer nor the gallery will discuss exact figures, art experts say they believe that Sonnabend advanced the artist between $3 million and $4 million over the years. The most recent advances helped him pay for his silk-screen-on-canvas paintings and the glass, plastic and wood sculptures of himself and his wife in the Sonnabend show.
"These works were expensive to produce," says Antonio Homem, the director of Sonnabend. "The gallery does give artists advances and they can add up to enormous sums." While Mr. Homem acknowledges that Mr. Koons and Sonnabend have had problems in the past, it is clear the gallery would like to continue to represent Mr. Koons. "Right now, we're trying to work things out," Mr. Homem says.
Both Mr. Homem and Mr. Koegel consider Mr. Koons's show an artistic success, but they say it is still too early to tell how much money was made. According to Mr. Homem, the three casts that were made of three sculptures have sold, and so have four paintings. Mr. Koons's work is pricey. His sculptures range from $65,000 to $150,000. An unusually large piece by Mr. Koons that shows him and his wife covered with butterflies costs $350,000.
Paintings were priced at $80,000. "Buyers were mainly private collectors from Europe and the United States," Mr. Homem says. "The American collectors were mostly from ouside of New York, some from the West Coast. But there was one New Yorker who bought a painting." And one museum, the Stedelijk in Amsterdam, purchased a glass piece called "Mound of Flowers" for $125,000.
"It takes courage to buy these explicit pieces," Mr. Homem says.
 
Ruth Siegel Closes
 The Ruth Siegel Gallery in Manhattan is another victim of the recession. At the end of February, the 57th Street space, which has specialized in young artists like Robert Jessup and Sam Messer for 10 years, will close. "It's been an agonizing few months," Ms. Siegel admits. "I waited to see if business would pick up, but it hasn't. And with the lease coming up for renewal at the end of the month, I had little choice."
Ms. Siegel says she will become a private dealer and art consultant.

The Substance of 'Substance'
Everyone is suddenly paying so much attention to Broadway -- and why not, with 18 shows opening in the next three months? -- that no one is noticing the phenomenon of "The Substance of Fire." The play, by Jon Robin Baitz, about a family-owned publishing business, was a hit last season at Playwrights Horizons; the star, Ron Rifkin, won an Obie and a Drama Desk Award. It closed in June when Mr. Rifkin had to return to the television series "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill." That show was recently canceled, so he and his fellow cast members, Sarah Jessica Parker, Maria Tucci, Jon Tenney and Patrick Breen, are all back. Previews began at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater on Jan. 27, a few weeks after Andre Bishop, the former artistic director of Playwrights Horizons, moved to the same post at Lincoln Center Theater. 
 "Substance" does not officially reopen until Feb. 27. But after only three weeks of previews, Bernard Gersten, the theater's executive producer, says 18,000 of its 46,000 members have bought tickets, favorable word of mouth is spreading quickly to nonmembers, and the run at the 299-seat theater, which was scheduled through April, has been extended through July 26.
Well, good news is good news, but what is most interesting here is that the play's success is debunking at least two big theatrical myths. The first is the theory of momentum, which holds that if a show waits too long to reopen when changing theaters, it loses the momentum of people wanting to see it. The second myth is the January-February slump, when producers assume that all potential theatergoers are locked in their homes waiting for the spring thaw.
"This show had a tremendous reputation from its initial run that was not satisfied, since there were only seats for 9 or 10,000 people to see it," Mr. Gersten says.
Robyn Goodman, the co-artistic director of the Second Stage, had less luck transferring Lynda Barry's "Good Times Are Killing Me" last summer to the Minetta Lane Theater, where it ran briefly. She says subscribers could have saved the show. "Lincoln Center's membership is security up front to build word of mouth," she says. "When there's a mailing to your home with a discount ticket to a show your friends told you was great, you can't lose. There's no shlepping involved. If 'Good Times' had gone to Lincoln Center, it would still be running. But they didn't ask me."
 
Orpheum for 'Sight Unseen'
 Manhattan Theater Club is on a roll. Its Stage II production of Donald Margulies's "Sight Unseen," already extended through March, will transfer to the Orpheum Theater on March 26 for an open-ended run. The play, about a Jewish American artist who travels to London and visits his old girlfriend and her husband, received unanimously favorable reviews and will move with its original cast intact -- Deborah Hedwall, Dennis Boutsikaris, Laura Linney and Jon De Vries.
 
A Busy Choreographer
 Word on the street is that she's the next Michael Bennett. So no matter what the reviews say about "Crazy for You," the new Gershwin musical opening Wednesday at the Shubert Theater, its choreographer, Susan Stroman, is already a hit -- at least among producers and directors in the theater. Enough have seen the musical -- along with her work in "And the World Goes 'Round," the Kander and Ebb revue Off Broadway -- to have offered her jobs to last through the next year.
Ms. Stroman will choreograph Carnegie Hall's tribute to Stephen Sondheim in April, and Harold Prince's revival of "Showboat" in Toronto in the spring of 1993. In between, she has become Neil Simon's first choice to choreograph the musical-comedy version of his movie "The Goodbye Girl," to be directed by Gene Saks, with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by David Zippel. Rehearsals are scheduled to begin in November for a Broadway opening next winter.
 
Roles to Grow Out Of
 Know any boys who want to earn $900 a week? If they're between the ages of 7 and 10, send them to the Palace Theater tomorrow at 9 A.M. "The Will Rogers Follies" is holding auditions to replace the four children in the cast, who have grown too tall for their roles. The show needs boys between 4 foot 1 and 4 foot 7 who sing and move well. Dance training is preferred but not required. Members of all racial and ethnic minorities are urged to apply.
 
Random Notes
 If you find yourself in Boston this spring, you may want to check out the new Mrs. David Mamet. The Back Bay Theater Company's production of "Oleanna," the new play by Mr. Mamet, will be presented by the American Repertory Theater at the Hasty Pudding Theater in Cambridge. Rebecca Pidgeon, the wife in question, who also appeared in Mr. Mamet's recent film "Homicide," co-stars with W. H. Macy in the two-character play about a university professor and a student. Performances run from May 1 to 24. Also at the Hasty Pudding, from March 26 to April 26, is "Media Amok," a new play by Christopher Durang, directed by Les Waters. Anne Pitoniak and Lewis Black will join the American Repertory Theater company in this political satire set against the world of talk-show television. . . . At least two Broadway musicals are taking no chances on losing a single ticket-buyer who might have missed the shows' connections to their hit songs. "Man of La Mancha" seems to have taken on "The Impossible Dream" as a subtitle in many ads and on its marquee. And "Miss Saigon" has been running ads that say "The American Dream," referring to its big production number, which Jonathan Pryce made famous. The hope is that in a recession, tickets will sell as well as dreams. . . . The punch line to the recent flap on "Falsettos" is that the show is rehearsing at Lincoln Center Theater. Joining us late? After the two one-act musicals by William Finn and James Lapine about gay life in the early 1980's were directed by Graciela Daniele at the Hartford Stage and received raves, they were to transfer to Lincoln Center but didn't, because of costs and scheduling problems. Mr. Finn fell out with Andre Bishop, the theater's artistic director, and Mr. Lapine became the director. But after the incident went public, Mr. Bishop and Mr. Finn reconciled in record time. And when Fran and Barry Weissler, the show's new producers, discovered a shortage of rehearsal space caused by the crush of spring shows, they finally called Lincoln Center. A happy ending, after all.

Finding a Burmese restaurant in New York is about as easy as remembering that Burma now calls itself Myanmar. So it's a surprise to find this engaging restaurant spicing up this drab stretch of gas stations and parking garages on Amsterdam Avenue on the Upper West Side.
Mingala West has avoided many of the fluorescent cliches of the Chinese restaurants that line Broadway one block to the west. The walls are cool and black, the banquettes and Breuer chairs inviting, and ceiling spotlights set off moody atmospheric charcoal drawings. 
 Myanmar is bordered by China, Thailand and the Indian subcontinent, and traces of each turn up in the food. The best dishes are generally the simplest, among them many of the appetizers, the bright salads and the tossed noodle dishes. Several of these, with a soup or an entree, make a fine shared meal for two.
Savory lentil fritters dipped in a vinegary-hot tamarind sauce are an addictive starter ($3.95). Steamed green beans, topped with sesame seeds and peanuts, are delicately fragrant with lemon ($4.50). The Southern Rangoon shrimp salad achieves a precarious balance, the searing heat of the seasoning relieved by cool mint leaves and lemon juice ($5.95).
Pungent Mandalay nungi noodles -- fat rice noodles tossed with chicken in a potato and bean sauce -- are accented with curry and garlic ($6.95). Northern Burma pan fry noodles are bright and vivid, incorporating pork, shrimp, ground peanuts, eggs and bean sprouts ($7.95).
Among the best of the poultry and meat dishes are mountain ruby chicken, an earthy blend of boneless chicken, peanuts, red pepper and zucchini ($8.75), and glass palace chicken, marinated chicken served with potatoes in a soothing blend of curry and coconut milk sauce ($8.75).
There is a modest wine list, but Singha beer from Thailand ($3) is the perfect accompaniment to these lively dishes.
Mingala West is now offering a lunch special for $4.50, including a salad or soup, vegetable fried rice, and a choice of two dozen entrees, and a similar early dinner special for $5.95.
"The recession, you know," a waiter said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hampshire;
CLINTON STRESSING HIS ECONOMIC PLAN

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 14

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton took his extraordinary last-ditch effort to revive his flagging Presidential campaign to a live New Hampshire audience tonight for the second night in a row, appealing to voters to trust him to put the country back on the right track.
During the 30-minute live call-in show that was televised during prime time on a Manchester station, Mr. Clinton fielded only one question about his draft status during the Vietnam War, an issue that has raised new questions about the Arkansas Governor's credibility in recent days. 
 The rest of the time, New Hampshire residents who telephoned a toll-free number or made up a sedate studio audience asked about unemployment compensation, health care, the environment and energy policy. The program originated in Durham, across the state from Manchester.
In many ways, the questions resembled the sort that Mr. Clinton gets at campaign rallies, where he is seldom asked about rumors of extramarital affairs or the issues of patriotism that have eroded his New Hampshire support, according to recent polls.
His television appearance came at the end of a day in which he sought to refocus his attacks on President Bush and move beyond the problems that have threatened his campaign.
Only one questioner, a man from Hampton who identified himself as an undecided voter, asked Mr. Clinton if "in retrospect" Mr. Clinton should have said he simply did not want to go to Vietnam "rather than lying" and saying that he had genuinely made himself available for the draft in 1969.
"First of all, I didn't lie," Mr. Clinton said. "The facts have always been clear, and I'm the only person who's been telling the same sory in this for 13 years." Mr. Clinton's campaign has released an affidavit from a Republican member of the Hot Springs, Ark., draft board who stated that no undue influence was applied to allow Mr. Clinton to receive a deferment by promising to join the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the University of Arkansas.
Mr. Clinton has acknowledged that he wrote a letter in 1969 to an Army colonel supervising the R.O.T.C. program at the university and thanked him for "saving me from the draft." In the letter, Mr. Clinton, then 23 years old, conceded that he had been misleading when he said he intended to join R.O.T.C.
"I put myself back into the draft," Mr. Clinton said. "If I had gotten lottery Number 1, you wouldn't be calling me to ask this question."
When he did finally relinquish his deferment, Mr. Clinton was able to avoid the draft because he drew Number 311 in the first lottery, held on Dec. 1, 1969.
Mr. Clinton's audience, seemed more concerned about policy and their own lives than about the candidate's personal life. One woman asked him what he could do about getting a new train line built between Portsmouth and Boston.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton vowed to return the campaign to talking about the issues.
"There's been a lot of falsehood out there," Mr. Clinton told a crowd of reporters at the supermarket stop. "I want the facts out there. The main thing I'm trying to do is give this election back to the people. You all are trying to stop me from doing it. I'm going to try to run this election on issues from here on in."
Mr. Clinton continued his general policy of ignoring his Democratic rivals, even as Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa held a news conference at a toxic cleanup site in Nashua to denounce Mr. Clinton for "sweeping environmental problems under the rug in Arkansas for more than a decade."
Two other Democratic candidates, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, also declined the opportunity to attack other Democrats by name. Instead, they reserved their criticism for policy issues like health-care reform and proposals for tax cuts for the proposals.
Mr. Kerrey, who has made national health insurance the centerpiece of his campaign, said today that he was "a bit of an underdog at the moment," but he insisted that he was not discouraged by public opinion polls showing him in a close constest for third place with Mr. Harkin.
Even as he aimed an occasional barb at a rival, Senator Kerrey continued to insist today that his first concern was not his own future, but the country's. "This is not just about electing a new President," he said. "It's about trying to take America in a new direction."
But Mr. Clinton's recent troubles continued to hurt his best efforts to conduct business as usual. At the supermarket, the tabloid newspapers at the checkout stands featured him on the cover, and after he passed shoppers at the mall, some of them murmured about him in his wake.
 
Looking Back in Empathy
 David Barker, a 44-year-old sales manager from Merrimack, and Richard Seyfried, 45, a locksmith from Salem, said they both drew high draft lottery numbers during the Vietnam War and thought no less of Mr. Clinton because of reports of his efforts to avoid the draft in 1969.
But neither man said they think that Mr. Clinton can now be elected.
"I think Bill Clinton's got a credibility problem," Mr. Seyfried said after shaking the Arkansas Governor's hand in a Sears, Roebuck store. "It's just the whole air of how the press has played up the problem makes it an issue, whether there is any realism behind it or not," said Mr. Barker. .
Nevertheless, Clinton campaign aides said that the Governor's slippage in polls had bottomed out, and that their private polling showed him regaining some ground on Mr. Tsongas.
 
Good News for Tsongas
 Three independent polling organizations, conducting continuous surveys that keep track of changing voter sentiments, showed Mr. Tsongas leading Mr. Clinton by at least eight percentage points through Thursday. The American Research Group, Gallup and KRC Communications Research are each interviewing 150 to 200 likely Democratic primary voters nightly, and are issuing each day the combined results of the previous two or three nights.
Late today, Mr. Clinton's campaign workers issued figures showing that they had raised $1 million in the last two weeks at the height of Mr. Clinton's problems.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Republicans;
Bush, Slipping in New Hampshire, Hopes for Rally and 'Home Run'

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Feb. 14

 BODY:
President Bush arrives in New Hampshire Saturday for a final two-day spurt of campaigning, facing a deteriorating political situation and the need to stage a late rally like the one that brought him victory in 1988.
Although the White House continues to maintain that all is going according to plan, Bush strategists here are seeking a decisive victory and are increasingly worried about the challenge of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator. One said today, "We're slipping again, and the President needs a home run this weekend to turn it around." 
 Mr. Bush's visit to the state on Wednesday generated lukewarm support at best. He won no more applause from the State Legislature than Mr. Buchanan did earlier in the week, even though Mr. Bush has five or six times as many backers among the legislators. At a visit to a shopping mall here, the crowd was big and polite enough but notably standoffish.
Worst of all from Mr. Bush's point of view, he failed to dominate television or newspaper reports in the state, with the troubles of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in the Democratic race stealing much of the attention.
Significant numbers of voters interviewed by canvassers and by reporters are starting to repeat the themes of Buchanan advertisements, without mentioning the source of their ideas. "We can't afford Bush for another four years," said a woman in Claremont, in western New Hampshire, and a man in Portsmouth commented, "He doesn't have a real economic plan."
 
A Shift Toward Buchanan
 After seemingly stabilizing his support at the beginning of the month, Mr. Bush stayed away for two weeks, giving Mr. Buchanan another chance to persuade the economically battered electorate here that Mr. Bush had forsaken them. In the polls that continuously keep track of fluctuating public opinion, three survey organizations found that large numbers of voters began leaving the President and describing themselves as uncommitted.
Now, says Dick Bennett of the American Research Group, an independent poll-taking firm, new data show that two-thirds of undecided voters are beginning to move toward Mr. Buchanan. Another potential problem is Jim Lennane, a wealthy businessman who has spent $500,000 on anti-Administration television advertisements.
"I think the President is really in trouble," said Gerry Chervinsky," the poll taker for The Boston Globe. "He might well not get 55 percent of the vote."
The Bush brain trust does not see that happening. Ron Kaufman, the White House political director, said in Concord this week, "I think we're doing remarkably well."
Presidential strategists hope to score at least a 2-to-1 victory on Tuesday, with Mr. Bush approaching two-thirds of the vote. That would make it harder for Mr. Buchanan to raise money to compete effectively in Georgia, which votes on March 3, and the other state he is emphasizing, Texas, which votes on March 10.
But even among the President's backers, there is evident concern as the final weekend approaches, four years after he overtook Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to win New Hampshire and put his drive to the White House in gear. Several of them said they were concerned about his inability so far, in a race that remains highly volatile, to generate intensity or commitment.
Senator Warren B. Rudman, the state's most popular politician, who has made a radio commercial for the President, said the other day that Mr. Bush had not come here "early enough or often enough" to get the job done.
 
Need for Reassurance
 "People are a little like characters out of Brigadoon up here," said Tom Rath, one the President's principal advisers in this state. "They know they go off into the mist again after Tuesday, not to be seen or heard from for four years. So they need reassurance they won't be forgotten.
"That's our job for this weekend. The President has to convince them that he'll still remember them on Wednesday, after the votes are counted."
Conversely, Mr. Buchanan will continue to try to persuade the voters that Mr. Bush is a fair-weather friend. For weeks, the challenger has been banging away at the President's decision to increase taxes after having promised not to do so. Today he escalated his attacks at a news conference, accusing Mr. Bush of "a cynical betrayal of the American middle class."
"In his State of the Union address Mr. Bush said his $500 extra deduction for each child was at the heart of his new economic plan," Mr. Buchanan said in his assault on the President's credibility. "Now we learn it isn't even in his plan. In retrospect, it appears to have been a giant political scam to hoodwink New Hampshire voters into believing George Bush favors tax cuts for working people."
Former Representative Chuck Douglas, Mr. Buchanan's highest-ranking backer in the state, expressed delight at Mr. Bush's change of signals on the tax break for dependent children, saying, "We never in our wildest dreams thought that in the final three or four days we'd be handed an issue like this."
This has been a mighty battle of television advertisements, with each campaign buying 25 to 30 commercial spots a day on WMUR, the state's leading station, as well as substantial numbers on Boston outlets. By primary day, Mr. Buchanan will have spent $1.7 million on television, an aide said. Mr. Bush probably will have spent only slightly less, although he joined the electronic fray later.
Most of Mr. Buchanan's money -- he has raised about $2.5 million -- has come from direct-mail solicitations, with the average gift about $50.
 
Painting Foe as Protectionist
 So far, Mr. Bush has refrained from attacking Mr. Buchanan by name, but he has labored heavily to paint the former White House speech writer as a protectionist and an isolationist. On Wednesday, for example, he warned voters here "not to listen to the siren's call that says we can't compete and we've got to turn inward." No state would suffer more from protectionism than this one, he said, estimating that 35,000 jobs here were directly linked to foreign trade.
But this week, Bush campaign aides said, a debate has been raging about whether to use negative advertisements, attacking Mr. Buchanan, that have already been prepared. Mr. Rath said he thought that attacks would be a mistake, partly because Mr. Buchanan and his ideas were not the issue. But others argue that discrediting the conservative challenger, even as a protest candidate, was becoming imperative.
Mr. Buchanan clearly believes the isolationist label does him no harm. At today's news conference, he was asked by a foreign reporter for assurances of a continuing American role "in the outside world." He replied with gusto: "My friend, this campaign is not about the outside world. It's about the U.S.A."

HEADLINE: Lawyer Says Saudi Detention of Sheik Is Political

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A Western human-rights campaign on behalf of a jailed Saudi sheik heated up yesterday when the lawyer F. Lee Bailey said the sheik was being held for political reasons and demanded to know his whereabouts.
Mr. Bailey asserted yesterday in an advertisement in The New York Times that the Saudi Government had been holding Sheik Mohammed al-Fassi without charge since October "in inhumane conditions" in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. 
 "To my knowledge, he's been charged with nothing so far; he's just imprisoned," Mr. Bailey said in a telephone interview from his office in Florida. He has been Sheik Fassi's lawyer for 10 years.
 Saudi officials refuse to discuss Sheik Fassi's whereabouts. In Saudi Arabia, prisoners do not have to be publicly charged within a specific period of time after they are detained. Nor are they guaranteed access to a lawyer before they are charged.
 
Reportedly Seized in Amman
 Sheik Fassi's family and supporters say he was seized in Amman, Jordan, and illegally sent back to Saudi Arabia, which had demanded his extradition. The Jordanians are believed to have handed him over to improve relations with Saudi Arabia, which cut off badly needed economic aid when Jordan supported President Saddam Hussein of Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait.
Although Sheik Fassi has represented himself as a champion of democracy and has frequently called for political reforms, some prominent Saudis say he has no constituency in the kingdom, and he is probably best known in the West for his flamboyance.
He repeatedly embarrassed Saudi royalty while living in Florida, where he walked out without paying hotel bills and wrote bad checks to charities. He also drew the wrath of the local humane society when he adopted and then neglected more than 100 homeless cats in Miami Beach.
In California, he outraged neighbors by painting the genitals on classical statues at his Beverly Hills mansion in bright colors.
 
Spoke on Broadcasts From Iraq
 Reports of such actions deeply offended many people in Saudi Arabia, a conservative, religious country. But Sheik Fassi's broadcasts from Baghdad in October 1990 were considered far more serious. The station was used to beam anti-Saudi propaganda from Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis.
Mr. Bailey said that in those broadcasts, Sheik Fassi "had the courage to suggest that a democracy might be a better practice in the region."
Saudi Arabia is ruled by King Fahd, an absolute monarch. He has pledged to establish a consultative assembly in the kingdom, although it will have little real political power.
Sheik Fassi's sister, Princess Hind, is married to Prince Turki, a brother of King Fahd. Mr. Bailey said yesterday that he had written to the King this week asking to see Sheik Fassi, who has not been heard from for more than a month.
King Fahd insisted in an interview with the Arabic weekly magazine Al-Hawadeth that there is "not a single political prisoner" in the kingdom.
The campaign for Sheik Fassi's release is backed by human rights groups. In November, an advertisement signed by 120 supporters appeared in major Western newspapers. It said in part, "Stop the detention of political prisoner Mohammed al-Fassi -- his only crime was speaking out for democracy in Saudi Arabia."
Last month, a mysterious counter-ad appeared in American and European dailies, quoting 20 people who signed the earlier ads as saying that they were withdrawing their support for Sheik Fassi because he had been charged with forgery. Mr. Bailey said in his advertisement yesterday that some signers were not aware their names had been used in the second ad.
William Adler, a spokesman for The New York Times Company, said, "Both advertisements, the Jan. 31 and the Feb. 14 advertisement, met the conditions of advertising acceptability for The New York Times. The Times does not take a position on the relative claims of the two advertisements."
One of the American signers of the Jan. 31 advertisement signed an affidavit certifying that consent was obtained from anyone named in the advertisement, in accordance with advertising acceptability standards, Mr. Adler said.
 In New York, the Saudi mission to the United Nations had no comment on the matter.

HEADLINE: A New Health-Insurance Crisis Underfoot

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Imagine an undiscovered health crisis in America: 110 million of the nation's residents living with no health insurance and suffering in silence. Well, sort of silence.
The Presidential candidates have yet to mention the problem, but some insurers say this may be the year when America finally is ready to invest in a big way in health insurance for pets. With a $99 policy, one company says, an owner no longer has to wince at the cost of a $1,000 CAT scan for a cat, a pacemaker for a geriatric retriever or ultrasound for a pregnant Pekingese. 
 The company is starting a national promotion campaign that veterinarians say could vastly improve the quality of animal health care.
"With all the conversation surrounding human health care, many people may now consider that insurance may work for animals as well," said Fred Tierney, a New York veterinarian and an adviser to Medipet, an insurance plan promoted by the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. "Many people who are not wealthy will want to provide for their pets like family members."
But consumer advocates and some economists call the new campaign by a mainstream company ridiculous.
The notion of insuring pets is an attempt to cash in on the nation's enormous health-care profits, the critics charge, to bring millions to veterinarians and insurers and upward spiraling costs to everyone with a furry dependent.
They say it is another example of economically unnecessary or unsound insurance for which Americans already pay millions of dollars a year, protecting themselves against such things as lost frequent-flier miles or rainy days at the beach.
"Once consumers believe that insurance is paying the bills, they agree to treatments and costs they never would have permitted if they were paying directly from their pockets," said J. Robert Hunter, the executive director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization in Washington, a nonprofit group. "Just as in human medicine the result would be more technology and higher prices for everybody."
For years veterinarians have complained that they have been denied the financial support available to physicians, and that for lack of money their patients are usually denied the full fruits of modern medical science. Magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography, radiation treatments and chemotherapy for cancer, sophisticated laboratory tests, among other expensive services, could bring longer and happier lives to many animals, they say, if their masters were not quite so concerned about the costs. Extensive cancer treatments, for example, can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.
Owners facing hefty bills often chose to put their animals to sleep. Since World War II, small numbers of pet insurance policies -- designed to spread the cost among consumers -- have been sold by small insurance companies. Until recently they fared poorly.
This year, however, a major insurer, Fireman's Fund, together with the Animal Health Insurance Agency of Danbury, Conn., is starting a significant nationwide sales push to make the product something more than an oddity. This month they are beginning a cable television campaign of half-hour "infomercials," aimed at reaching 20 million viewers.
 
Direct-Mail Campaign
 It follows the first of a planned series of direct-mail campaigns begun last fall through Sears, Roebuck that was designed to reach more than 600,000 households, said J. Scott Henderson, Medipet's president.
At a time when human health insurance is in the headlines, the company's pet-coverage slogan is: "Because they're family, too!"
In addition, another company that has been offering pet insurance for years, Veterinary Pet Insurance of Anaheim, Calif., reports a surge in sales in the last year of more than 20 percent, to 90,000 policies last year. Although the company has had some problems with the state insurance department, which has required it to increase its capital reserves, the company says consumer response continues to rise rapidly and it plans to begin its own national advertising campaign in the next year.
 
Pet Insurance Terms
 With more than 52 million dogs and and 55 million cats living in the United States, according to a 1987 study by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the potential market is vast.
Under the basic Medipet plan, masters pay $99 a year for pets up to age 9, to cover up to $1,000 in bills for any injury or illness. The deductible is $50. Or they can pay $42 for up to $2,500 in coverage with a $250 deductible.
Medipet refuses to pay for psychiatry, root canal or dental capping. Veterinary Pet Insurance does cover acupuncture, but its policies, too, have limits. Its fine print says pets will not be covered during wartime for injuries sustained "in resisting attack," nor will it pay for injuries suffered during insurrection, rebellion or revolution.
Supporters of the idea say it is unlikely that pet insurance will lead to the type of price spiral that has afflicted human medicine. Michael Walters, a spokesman for the American Veterinary Medical Association, which supports pet insurance, says dogs and cats are better risks in many ways than more typical consumers.
"They don't smoke as a group," said Mr. Walters, quite seriously. "They rarely travel by automobile. They are less likely to be victims of street crimes. So a lot of things that put people in the hospital don't put animals there."
Hilary Robinson, a 39-year-old unemployed book editor with two boxers and a pug in a tiny New York apartment, praises her three Medipet policies. A fourth policy helped her pay for the kidney specialists, the chemotherapy and holistic veterinarian who treated a third boxer who died of cancer recently.
"It saved us thousands of dollars," she said.
But Orin Kramer, an economist and consultant in Princeton, N.J., who specializes in insurance issues, says that widespread insurance for pets may have results that mirror human health care strikingly.
 
Healthier Animals, More Vets
 "Animals would live longer and animals would be better positioned to overcome serious diseases," Mr. Kramer said. "Animal health care costs would rise significantly and more people would be attracted to the veterinary profession."
Given time and sufficient price rises, consumers would become increasingly concerned about high premiums, Mr. Kramer said. Insurance companies might begin to compete for the lower-risk customers, offering, say, special premiums for poodles, in contrast to German shepherd and other dogs with a higher incidence of joint problems. And then, possibly, a debate might erupt about cost controls.
"To what extent do you move to managed care?," Mr. Kramer asked.
Mr. Hunter of the National Insurance Consumer Organization said that consumers should buy insurance primarily to protect themselves against catastrophic events. It makes more sense to put money aside into savings, he said, to pay for smaller unexpected costs. Mr. Hunter, a longtime industry critic, lumped pet insurance together with what he described as other types of marginal policies.
But Mr. Hunter did express an interest in life insurance for cats.
"Imagine a type of life insurance," Mr. Hunter said, "where you don't have to pay the first eight times the policyholder dies."

HEADLINE: Despite the Forecasts of His Fall, Mobutu Has Zaire in His Grip

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Six months ago Zaire seemed on the brink of political chaos as mutinous soldiers rioted and the 26-year autocratic rule of President Mobutu Sese Seko began to crumble. But despite dire predictions from most Zairian political analysts and foreign diplomats, General Mobutu now seems more firmly in control than ever.
His political resurrection is in large part because of growing infighting among the anti-Government movement and also his deft handling of dissension within the country's army and police units. The result, analysts here say, is that the prospects are fast fading for this impoverished central African country to join the democratic trend sweeping much of the continent. 
 For more than a year the President has spent most of his time aboard a yacht on the Congo River, about 18 miles from the center of the capital, and has issued directives from there. Nearly everyone says that if he were to enter Kinshasa, he would be a target. But he has managed to frustrate the opposition by controlling the Government apparatus while virtually never entering the city.
Over the last decade, in fact, General Mobutu has spent increasingly less of his time in the capital. Frequently he has appeared on television from the yacht, holding news conferences or meeting with diplomats and political leaders.
Last September, in the face of mounting criticism of his rule, General Mobutu took some steps to share power with a group of religious, civic and opposition political leaders. But in recent weeks he has abruptly reversed himself, startling the United States and other foreign governments as well as many of Zaire's 40 million residents.
At the same time, anti-Government leaders say soldiers loyal to the President have become increasingly assertive, arresting and occasionally physically assaulting those perceived as a threat to the Government.
The pivotal event occurred in late January when Prime Minister Nguza Karl-i-Bond, who was appointed by General Mobutu last November, called off indefinitely a national conference that had been working on a formula for holding the country's first multiparty elections since it gained independence from Belgium in 1960. The conference began last July, but it had been repeatedly stalled by disputes over who among the various political and civic groups would be allowed to attend.
Mr. Nguza said the conference had become too costly and was degenerating into political chaos, assertions that opposition leaders mocked as a sham. "Nguza is talking nonsense," said Joseph Ileo, who served as Zaire's Prime Minister in the 1960's and is now a leading opposition politician. "He has become a dictator like Mobutu."
Etienne Tshisekedi, who served briefly as Prime Minister last October and now heads Zaire's biggest opposition party, the Union for Democratic and Social Progress, said General Mobutu and Mr. Nguza were "criminals, who are determined to stay in power for as long as possible."
 
4th Prime Minister in a Year
 Mr. Nguza is the fourth Prime Minister named by President Mobutu in less than a year. Since he joined the Mobutu Government, he has been denounced and disowned by much of the opposition, although he continues to maintain that he is sympathetic to their cause.
This weekend, the President indicated on national television that he was willing to resume talks with opposition leaders about sharing power, but it was not immediately clear whether this meant a resumption of the national conference.
Increasingly, the confusing and contradictory turn of events seemed to confirm suspicions of many Zairians that President Mobutu never really intended, as he promised last September, to relinquish power.
Just what has motivated President Mobutu and his Prime Minister's recent actions is not clear, but two theories are gaining adherents. One is that Zaire's opposition has demonstrated its weakness by attracting only token public support for a series of general strikes called to protest the President's growing intransigence against conceding more power. General Mobutu thus believes he can abort the national conference without sparking widespread protest that could threaten his grip on power.
Another theory circulating among political analysts here is that he never intended the conference to succeed, and hopes instead to avoid any threat to his political hegemony by calling elections before the opposition can organize a campaign against him.
According to this view, the President believes he could win an election against an unprepared opposition despite the growing turmoil in Zaire. The United States and other Western Governments have said that some form of transitional government is needed as a bridge between General Mobutu's autocratic rule and free and fair elections.
 
Violence and Looting
 The September accord between the President and the opposition followed a week of looting and violence triggered by mutinous soldiers angered because they had not been paid. Discontent had been rising for months, however, as the country reeled from a severe economic crisis and as opposition leaders pressed General Mobutu to adopt democratic changes in Zaire, long regarded as one of Africa's most closed political systems.
The United States, France and Belgium, the former colonial power of The Congo, have also condemned the decision to cancel the national conference. In perhaps the strongest condemnation to date of the Mobutu Government, the State Department said in a statement that the suspension of the conference offers few "prospects for national reconciliation and democracy."
Echoing the blunt criticism from Washington, Melissa Wells, the United States Ambassador in Zaire, said in an interview that the national conference had "engaged the hopes of the Zairian people, and to that extent it cannot just be thrown aside." She indicated, however, that the United States was holding out hope that President Mobutu would reverse himself.
American and Western diplomats said they felt particularly betrayed by Mr. Nguza's action because during a tour of Washington and European capitals in December, he made assurances that the procedural disputes that had plagued the conference from the outset would be resolved. At a Congressional hearing this week, Herman J. Cohen, Assistant of Secretary of State for African Affairs, said the Prime Minister's cancellation of the conference "was very disappointing and made us very upset with him personally."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Challenger;
As a Candidate, Buchanan Shows Compassionate Side

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 14

 BODY:
To listen to Patrick J. Buchanan on the stump is to witness a startling transformation. While it has not vanished completely, the fire-breathing, hard-edged, economic and social Darwinism that made Mr. Buchanan famous in his columns and on television shows like "Crossfire" has been tempered. In its place is a candidate striving to be seen as a sensitive, caring populist.
As a writer, Mr. Buchanan called AIDS "nature's retribution" against homosexuals and said the disease was spread by "promiscuous sodomy -- unnatural, unsanitary sexual relations between men." On the campaign trail he talks of showing compassion for people with AIDS, which he now compares to the cancer that killed his brother. 
 As late as December, Mr. Buchanan said homeless people who refuse to go to shelters should be locked up. In a recent interview, however, he said society must distinguish between harmless individuals who are down on their luck and "those who are deranged and dangerous and felons out on the street who like this as a way of life." The latter group, the candidate says, is a "tiny minority" of the homeless.
 
'Well, I Care'
 In recent days Mr. Buchanan has praised Alfred E. Smith, the 1928 Democratic Presidential candidate who was a populist governor of New York. He scorned as "vulture capitalism" a suggestion by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady that now was a good time for speculators to invest in real estate because property values in the state were so low. In place of his high-decibel rantings as a regular participant on the "McLaughlin Group" news-analysis program, Mr. Buchanan's campaign commercials have him speaking in muted tones, telling voters that, until he entered the race, "those in Washington behaved as though they did not care. Well, I care."
The candidate has not completely changed and still has plenty of harsh things to say. For example, Mr. Buchanan recently said it was absurd for the United States to maintain an economic blockade of Haiti to try to restore the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the candidate called a "dingbat priest."
But in an interview, Mr. Buchanan said his experiences campaigning in economically depressed New Hampshire had caused him to question some long-held beliefs.
Before the campaign Mr. Buchanan opposed extended benefits to the unemployed. He now supports them.
"You don't alter your views, but you certainly modify what might be strong intellectual positions when they come into conflict with the reality out here," he said. "This has made me much more radical in terms of the need to deregulate the economy to cut taxes. But at the same time you can't go into those unemployment offices, see those guys about to lose their homes without saying, 'Well, we ought to go ahead with 12 more weeks of unemployment benefits.' "
 
Image 'Wasn't Selling'
 To some, the new Buchanan is little more than an campaign conversion, a dressing up of the candidate in new rhetorical garb when the old fashions could not be sold to enough voters.
"In Buchanan's case, the sharp edge that he was projecting wasn't selling very well," said Charles O. Jones, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin. "It's one thing to go up to New Hampshire and tell voters what they already know -- that it's an economically depressed area and to point out who's President. But negative campaigning in you own party gets tiresome. People want to know what you've got to say about their problems."
The candidate's change also underscores something else. Despite running as an outsider who will stand up for the little guy, Mr. Buchanan has in fact been a Washington insider; a mover about in a cloistered world of pundits and policy makers; the owner of a Mercedes and a Cadillac who admitted he has never ridden the Washington subway. When Mr. Buchanan visited a Manchester homeless shelter on Christmas Eve, it was the first time he had ever been inside a soup kitchen.
 
Listening in a Different Way
 "It's one thing to talk about grand ideas, but when you talk about them to people who are worried about their taxes being raised or their Social Security being cut, you listen in a different way and take on some of their concerns," said Thomas E. Cronin, a political science professor at Colorado College who ran for Congress in 1982.
"You do take on a greater consideration for the average person," Mr. Cronin added, "particularly when you're in the upper 1 or 2 percent income bracket and you don't normally mingle with them."
Indeed, Mr. Buchanan now speaks disdainfully of conservatives who inhabit the "antiseptic" world of think tanks or commentators whose jobs are not threatened by tough economic times -- a description that could easily be applied to himself.
John McLaughlin, the host of the "McLaughlin Group," said in an telephone interview that he had told Mr. Buchanan he was at his best -- and most sensitive -- when he left Washington and reported from the field.
"But this is a rarity for you. What you do is go to your home in McLean, go in your office, sit down at your typewriter and you drive yourself angry with your ideas."
 
Shift on Free Trade
 The biggest shift in Mr. Buchanan's political philosophy is in the area of trade. As an aide to former President Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Buchanan lobbied for a Presidential veto of a bill passed by Congress to protect the country's shoe industry. As late as 1988, Mr. Buchanan said the rise of Asian capitalism was a success for American foreign policy. "To squander that in an absurd 'trade war' because we cannot compete with Korean cars or Japanese computer chips would be an act of almost terminal stupidity," he said.
But Mr. Buchanan announced his candidacy in New Hampshire with the slogan "America First." And this week in an address to the New Hampshire Legislature, the candidate said that "we Americans have got to stop being trade wimps," and advocated that the United States take retaliatory action against countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
Mr. Buchanan acknowledges his change in thinking, though he says he has been moving away from a pure free-trade stance for about a year. "I believe America should be No. 1," he said. "I want to see her No. 1 in industry, manufacturing, standard of living. But I also believe in free trade. If it comes to the point where the free trade theory conflicts with that, then it's the free trade theory that's going to give way."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Halts Planned Cut In Medicaid

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Hours before the action was to take effect at midnight, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last night temporarily suspended a 10 percent cut in the state's $550 million program of reimbursing pharmacies for the prescription drugs they dispense to 2.5 million poor people covered by Medicaid.
"We're temporarily suspending the implementation of these cuts to allow for further discussion with the pharmacists," Terry Lynam, a spokesman for the Governor, said in Albany after discussions involving Mr. Cuomo, legislative leaders and lobbyists for trade groups representing some 3,700 pharmacies. 
 The trade groups, including the Pharmaceutical Society of the State of New York and the Empire State Pharmaceutical Society, have argued that the cuts would pose an economic hardship for small pharmacists and that some might be forced to stop serving Medicaid patients or handling the most expensive prescriptions, many of which are used to fight H.I.V. or cancer.
Officials of the State Department of Social Services, which administers the reimbursement program, say the cuts are required under Federal regulation and insist that they would not seriously harm the industry. They say a hotline would be set up to direct any Medicaid recipient to a pharmacy that would help.
 
Concern Over Pricing
 Since 1978, the state has paid pharmacies for Medicaid prescriptions based on the average wholesale price of each drug, plus $2.60 as a dispensing fee for each prescription. The pharmacies often buy the drugs wholesale at a discount, and Federal and state surveys suggested that many were making excessive profits on some drugs, an assertion denied by the pharmacists.
In 1987, however, the Federal Government wrote new rules to control health costs. These directed that states, to continue receiving Federal aid paying half of Medicaid costs, cut 10 percent from the reimbursement rate based on wholesale drug prices.
Lawsuits by pharmacies and their trade groups kept the state from imposing the cuts immediately. The state offered to settle by increasing the dispensing fee to $3.90, but the plaintiffs refused. But recent court rulings cleared the way again for the state to implement the cuts, which were set for 12:01 A.M. today.
Governor Cuomo's spokesman, Mr. Lynam, said that last night's temporary suspension -- expected to be in effect at least a few days -- had been ordered "to give a little extra time to resolve this to everybody's satisfaction -- so Medicaid patients can get their drugs, the state can get its savings and the pharmacists can be satisfied that we are going about this in the right way."

The Economy
Industrial production fell sharply in January and factory utilization slid as businesses struggled to bring inventories back in line with sales; producer prices also slipped, thanks to sharply lower energy and food prices. But economists are paying more attention to Thursday's rosier reports. [Page 37.] 
 House Democrats agreed on a tax-cut bill they said would show they cared about the middle class, while Republicans catered to the rich. If the proposal becomes law, Democratic committee aides said, taxes will increase for only the top 1 percent of taxpayers, while declining for everyone else. [37.]
Cars fueled with a mixture of alcohol and gasoline emit more smog-causing chemicals and are more costly to operate than those running on reformulated gasoline, according to a study issued by the auto and oil industries. [37.]
Wholesale prices fell for the second straight month in January, the Government said, another sign that the sluggish economy is holding inflation in check. [49.]
Tumbling sales pushed business inventories up 0.4 percent in December for a fourth straight monthly rise, the Commerce Department said. [49.]
An undiscovered health crisis to some, a ridiculous notion to others: health insurance for pets, it seems, may be headed for the big time. [1.]
 
Companies
LTV filed a reorganization plan that for the first time since it entered bankruptcy in 1986 carries the tentative support of its five main creditor groups and the Federal pension guaranty fund. But court approval could be delayed for months. [37.]
Warren E. Buffett and his lieutenants portrayed Salomon as a firm that had lost a tremendous amount of business and, after a top-to-bottom renovation, was now primed to claw much of it back. [37.]
Saturn and Toyota raised their prices, a day after a report that showed signs of an upturn in auto sales. [39.]
McCrory said it would miss a debt payment and hinted that it might file for bankruptcy protection. [39.]
 
International
OPEC oil ministers are close to an agreement that would cut the group's total oil production by a little more than a million barrels a day from its current 24.2 million. [38.]
A fund to stabilize the Russian ruble may be set up by the U.S. and other Group of Seven nations. [4.]
 
Markets
Stocks ended a volatile week on a steady note, with blue chips practically unchanged and the broader market showing weakness. The Dow ended at 3,245.97, off 0.68 for the day but up 20.57 for the week. [40.]
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed, as short- to intermediate-term issues continued to fall while bonds staged a bit of a recovery. [40.]
The dollar closed higher after first falling in response to two economic reports. [46.]
Wheat futures prices ended on a strong note, bolstering ideas that the week's steep loss was just a blip in a bull market. [46.]
 
Today's Columns
Should investors rush to buy tax-deferred annuities in case the law changes? Financial experts are divided. Jan M. Rosen: Your Money. [38.]
Fax machines, despite their speed and convenience, are not a particularly private means of sending or receiving documents. One advertising executive thinks he has a simple solution. Edmund L. Andrews: Patents. [38.]

THE PAIN OF THE CITIES
While the entire region has suffered from employment losses during the recession, the sharpest drops have struck the cities, with some declines so steep that they wiped out in a year or two all of the gains of the boom years in the mid-1980's, according to a university report released this week.

DINKINS DENOUNCES FORMER AIDE
As investigations into his former campaign finance chairman widened, Mayor Dinkins moved for the first time to distance himself from his once-trusted aide, denouncing him as "a common thief." Law-enforcement officials said skeptical prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office were trying to verify a range of tips and leads from the former aide, Arnold I. Biegen, concerning Mr. Dinkins's 1989 mayoral campaign. These include Mr. Biegen's assertion that he took cash contributions on the campaign's behalf that might have been illegal. Investigators have subpoenaed financial records of some contributors. Pages 1 and 26.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
The Persian Gulf war left Saddam Hussein in power but freed Kuwait from his control, broke his military power and, in the opinion of some experts, paved the way to Middle East peace talks. Yet the war and its aftermath have also taken as many as 200,000 lives.
The debate over this ambiguous outcome has been eclipsed, in the year since the war ended, by matters as diverse as the Palm Beach rape trial and the Presidential campaign. 
 But some people do continue to brood over the war, whether it was just and whether the teachings about just and unjust wars inherited from Cicero, St. Augustine and Grotius proved adequate for judging it. Those broodings may be important for the future moral health of the country.
Although President Bush defended the Persian Gulf conflict in just-war terms after it began, no one imagines that he and his closest advisers planned their diplomatic and military moves while reviewing a list of the requirements that a military action should meet to be considered just:
"Just cause, Jim?" Check. "Honorable intentions, Dick?" Check. "Legitimate authorization, Colin?" Check. "Exhaustion of less violent alternatives, Brent?" Check.
"Reasonable chance of success? Likelihood of doing more good than harm? No deliberate attacks on civilians? Scrupulous efforts to minimize the losses of both troops and civilians?" Check, check, check, check.
Indeed, the just-war tradition "is not a mechanical template or a moral computer into which data are plugged and answers pop out," George Weigel said in a recent conference at Vanderbilt University on just-war thinking. Mr. Weigel is the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington.
Just-war thinking is far from supplanting other ways Americans approach warfare: pacifist rejection, realpolitik calculation, crusading fervor or simply visceral response to graphic images of enemy atrocities or battlefield carnage.
But Mr. Weigel and other proponents of just-war thinking believe that its categories have increasingly seeped into American public discourse, explaining for example why Gen. Michael Dugan of the Air Force was promptly dismissed, in September 1990, when he floated the idea of carpet-bombing Baghdad.
The theory not only tested the war, however; the war also tested the theory. Several recent books and discussions like those at Vanderbilt show that the war exposed enough ambiguities in just-war thinking to trouble its adherents as well as its critics.
To begin with the most elementary of questions, What is "a just cause?" In the eyes of most just-war adherents, reversing a flagrant act of aggression -- Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait -- was about as clear-cut an instance of a just cause as could be expected. But what about maintaining the balance of power in the Middle East? The toppling of Mr. Hussein himself? The prevention of nuclear proliferation? The protection of a vital energy source?
The Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a frequent adviser to Roman Catholic bishops on international issues, warns against extending the notion of just cause beyond resistance to aggression to concerns over nuclear proliferation or access to resources.
Michael Walzer, in a foreword to a new edition of his "Just and Unjust Wars" (Basic Books, 1992), limits just cause to "restoration plus" -- the liberation of Kuwait and the crippling of the military power that had made the invasion possible. He refuses to include the transformation of Iraq's government to one that respects human rights.
Mr. Weigel regards just cause much more broadly, emphasizing the nature of Mr. Hussein's rule and the threat it posed to peace in the region and to the world's oil supply. Unlike Mr. Walzer and Father Hehir, Mr. Weigel located the "moral tragedy" of the war in the failure to remove the Iraqi leader, or at least to prevent his remaining forces from crushing the Kurdish and Shiite rebellions.
Similar questions surround the just-war criterion that military force can be used only as a last resort. When, if ever, is the point of "last resort" reached? Opponents of the war's morality continue to argue that negotiations and economic sanctions were never given a chance to work.
Mr. Walzer and Mr. Weigel believe that many opponents of the war bent the last-resort criterion from something involving a reasonable judgment to a debater's exercise in abstract logic. The theoretical possibility of further economic presssures could always be evoked by those unwilling, in reality, to condone military action under any circumstances.
Finally, does the obligation to avoid direct attacks on civilian targets rule out massive destruction of a nation's infrastructure -- its electric power grids, water pumping and purification plants, sewage systems, transportation and communication links?
In the gulf war both pilots and weapons demonstrated remarkable success in sparing civilian targets. But American strategy deliberately struck at the infrastructure, considering it a legitimate military target.
Mr. Weigel agrees with that assessment, despite its "aftereffects on civilians," which others have described as widespread malnutrition, epidemics and deaths owing to the breakdown of food and water supplies, sanitary services and medical care.
Mr. Walzer believes this constituted "an attack on civilian society" in which "it is the military effects, if any, that are 'collateral.' "
For many people, these arguments are little more than Monday-morning moral quarterbacking. But the adherents of just-war thinking insist it is not simply a way of assessing current actions; it is also a way of shaping future attitudes.
Questions like the scope of a just cause, the meaning of last resort or the legitimacy of targeting electric power grids and water supplies should be systematically pursued in forums ranging from the military academies and university seminars to interfaith gatherings and Congressional committees.

HEADLINE: Panel's Democrats in Tax Accord

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
House Democrats agreed today on a tax-cut bill they said would show that they cared about the middle class and that Republicans catered to the rich.
Announcing agreement on a package that will go to the full House later this month, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, whose Democratic members approved the bill tonight, said: "I think we need fairness in the tax code. That's the difference between Democrats and Republicans. We're going to see to it that middle-income Americans have a better tax break." 
 If the proposal becomes law, Democratic committee aides said, taxes will increase for only the top 1 percent of taxpayers, while declining for everyone else.
The six-year measure would offer $90 billion in tax reductions and a matching $90 billion in increases. The biggest cuts are tax credits of up to $400 for working couples, and a one percentage point reduction in corporate tax rates, to 33 percent. The bill also provides a cut in taxes on capital gains, weighted toward new ventures. This cut would be much less sweeping than what President Bush wants.
The main sources of new revenue are an increase to 35 percent from 31 percent in the highest income tax rates, which would apply to taxable income over $85,000 for individuals, $145,000 for couples, and $125,000 for heads of household, and a surtax of 10 percent on taxes owed by people with taxable income over $1 million.
The measure agreed on today differed little from the proposal Mr. Rostenkowski laid before committee Democrats on Thursday. The biggest difference is in the capital gains proposal, which is simpler than Thursday's plan.
An attempt by Representatives Thomas J. Downey of Long Island and Marty Russo of Illinois to replace the middle-income tax credits with a refundable tax credit of $180 for each child was defeated this morning on a 13-to-7 vote.
One section on capital gains in the legislation would set an effective rate of no more than 14 percent for investments in small companies held at least five years. Thursday's proposal had been 16.8 percent.
Then, instead of allowing a rate of 19.6 percent on other gains, this proposal would keep the current maximum rate of 28 percent, but the gains on all items purchased after the bill's effective date would be indexed for inflation, so there would be no tax on any profits made simply because all prices went up.
Today's action was another step in the steady intensification of partisan debate over taxes that began when President Bush used his State of the Union speech to challenge Congress to pass his proposals by March 20. They are focused heavily on a capital gains tax cut, accelerated depreciation for new industrial investment, and steps to encourage home buying.
 
Challenge to Bush
 Today the Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee formally laid down their challenge to his proposals, which have been altered since January to provide an even bigger cut on capital gains taxes. Their plan aims its tax breaks, even its capital gains cut, much more toward lower- and middle-income taxpayers than does the President's.
If they can get the bill passed by the House, which is less than certain because some House Democrats usually oppose any tax increases at all, they would then deal with an undoubtedly different measure the Senate will be considering in March, and be seeking compromise with the Senate and the White House in conference.
But for today, there was no talk of seeking agreements.
"I don't want a compromise," President Bush said today while campaigning in Belcamp, Md. He explained that he wanted his narrower plan acted on first and his other proposals later: "I want them to pass this, and then we'll get into negotiating on this big baby here."
Mr. Bush toured three houses under construction in Arborview at Riverside, a 100-home subdivision of mostly frame condominiums, town houses and single-family homes about three miles from the Aberdeen, Md., Army post. About 90 percent of the occupants are first-time home buyers.
Asked by a reporter what was wrong with raising taxes on the wealthy, he replied: "We don't need any tax increases. What we need to do is stimulate the economy, and every time you aim at the wealthy you hit these guys," referring to the home builders. He said: "Why divide, kind of keep trying to divide America, class against class. Why not get on with stimulating the economy so everybody's going to have a piece of a bigger pie?"
Mr. Bush also asserted that the tax reductions in the Democratic bill would not be paid for by the increases, and would therefore require Medicare cuts to make up for them.
"We must really be doing our job because we're irritating them downtown," Mr. Rostenkowski responded. "The bill is complete. The bill is paid for."
The middle-class tax cut in the bill, which the chairman will present to all House Democrats at a caucus next week, is basically one he proposed last fall. It would refund 20 percent of Social Security and Medicare taxes, up to $200 for individuals and $400 for couples. Those limits would be reached generally by individuals with earnings of $13,000 and couples with earnings of $26,000.
The credits would be temporary, expiring in two years.
The reductions in corporate tax rates would be permanent. Not only would the basic rate be reduced a point to 33 percent, but the corporate alternative minimum tax, for companies with large deductions and exemptions, would also be cut one point, from 20 to 19 percent.
Neither of those changes has any counterpart in Mr. Bush's proposals. But some other provisions that may help taxpayers outside the top brackets are borrowed or adapted from Mr. Bush's proposals.
 
Plan for I.R.A.'s
 They agreed to his proposal that first-time home buyers be permitted to make early withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts without the normal 10 percent penalty. But they rejected a $5,000 tax credit he had proposed for such purchases, too.
They proposed a tax credit, limited in most cases to $300, for interest charges on student loans. When interest exceeds 10 percent of someone's income, the credit could go to $500. Mr. Bush had proposed making such interest deductible. Democrats often prefer credits to deductions, since deductions are worth more to people paying a higher rate of taxes than to those in lower brackets, while credits are equally valuable to all taxpayers.
In a largely symbolic move, expected to raise only $1.9 billion over six years, they proposed that corporations be barred from deducting that part of an executive's compensation that exceeds $1 million a year.
Far more would be raised by the new maximum rates on individuals. The Democrats expect to raise $53.3 billion over six years by adding the 35 percent bracket and increasing, from 24 percent, to 25 percent, the alternative minimum tax for individuals with large amounts of tax-exempt income.
Committee aides said it was important to consider the impact of the 35 percent rate not just on people's taxable income. Individuals who would become subject to it at $85,000 of taxable income usually have adjusted gross income of about $105,000 and $20,000 in deductions, an aide said.

HEADLINE: 7 Industrialized Countries Prepare Fund to Aid Ruble

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The United States and other Group of Seven nations have begun laying the groundwork for a multibillion-dollar fund to stabilize the enfeebled Russian ruble, and some officials say such a fund might be set up in three to four months.
When President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia visited Washington two weeks ago, he and his economic aides strenuously urged the United States to help set up a fund that would, in effect, back the ruble with foreign money and so reduce economic and political instability during Russia's long and difficult winter. 
 And as some Groups of Seven nations push for a fund, which has been estimated to range from $5 billion to $12 billion, the United States has hinted that it might take part.
But American officials see many obstacles, among them Russia's high inflation rate, its large budget deficit and the primitive state of its banking system. Some American and European officials say it would be unwise to set a fund up when Russia's economy was in such a state of flux and when the people of Russia and the other former Soviet republics that use the ruble have such little confidence in their currency.
 
Economic Reform Plan
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said this week that Washington would support such a plan only if Russia agreed to comply with an International Monetary Fund program of economic discipline.
"It may well be that there might be some participation by nations, either as a group or bilaterally, in support of an I.M.F. program," Mr. Baker said Monday. "I frankly don't see that happening before there is a credible, overall economic reform program that has been devised with the international financial institutions."
Many Western officials say there is a good chance that a stabilization fund will be created shortly after Russia and other republics join the International Monetary Fund. Fund officials say Russia might join in late April at the time of the fund's spring meeting.
Last Monday, Russia began negotiating in Moscow with a fund delegation on a program in which Russia would agree on goals for budgeting, pricing policy, credit policy and privatization. In return, Russian officials expect aid from the global lender, perhaps in a stabilization fund, perhaps in a fund to help finance imports.
A stabilization fund is money that foreign nations contribute to supplement a country's gold and other reserves. The fund is used to back that country's efforts to maintain its currency's value in international transactions, and in doing so increases domestic confidence in the currency. If the currency comes under attack, money from the stabilization fund can be used in foreign exchange markets to defend the currency.
There is some dissent within the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, German, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- about how soon to set up a stabilization fund. British officials have called for urgent action, saying a commitment to such a fund would provide much needed confidence to the Russians. The British have suggested that Russia be allowed to join the fund even before the April broad meeting.
"We thought it would be advisable if the Commonwealth of Independent States could know that the G-7 were holding out this idea of a stabilization fund," a British Treasury official said.
French, American and German officials say a stabilization fund should come after the April fund meeting. Group of Seven officials say Japan is wary of committing new aid to Russia until there is further progress in settling the dispute over ownership of the Kurile Islands.
Some analysts said the Administration was toning down its support for the plan because the fund could involve a foreign aid commitment of more than $1 billion in a campaign year when the President has been accused of spending too much attention to foreign affairs.
"Politically, I can't see this happening until after November," said a Senate staff member, adding that the Administration and Congress would hesitate to make large new foreign outlays.
Indicating Congress's reluctance to make additional foreign-aid commitments, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid, said last week that Congress would not approve the Administration's proposal for a $12 billion appropriation for the world lender.
"There's just not the support on the Hill for it," the Vermont Democrat said.
 
'Pivotal Political Moment'
 If the Group of Seven nations fail to contribute to a stabilization fund, some economists say it is possible the money would come from the lending agency.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics professor who is an adviser to the Russian Government, said a stabilization fund should be set up within weeks rather than months because Russia's situation is so precarious as the nation swallows tough economic reforms.
"This is a pivotal political moment in Russia's history," Mr. Sachs said. "If the ruble starts strengthening, if goods come into shops, if the Government is bolstered to carry out further reforms, then they can succeed. If, on the other hand, sentiment turns negative, the ruble weakens and shops remain empty, then things can spin out of control."
He said Russia's recent reforms have slashed the budget deficit from 20 percent of gross domestic product to about 5 percent and are slowing the printing of money.
 
Billions Could Be Lost
 In January 1990 the Western industrial nations formed a $1 billion fund to help stabilize the Polish zloty as the post-Communist Government in Warsaw began a sweeping series of free-market reforms. Not a dollar of that fund was tapped because Poland's economic program quickly restored confidence in the zloty.
But American officials voice fears that billions of dollars could be lost from the proposed ruble-stabilization fund if it is established before the time is right. The concern is that the ruble will come under attack, and that large amounts of money from the fund will be spent to keep the ruble from plunging against foreign currencies.
"When you look at developments in the former Soviet Union, you see there is a lot of fog," said a German Finance ministry official who insisted on not being identified. "It has to clear up before there can be action like the zloty fund."
Advocates of a fund say little money can be lost because Russia would be prohibited from tapping the fund if it fails to comply with the lender's program. They say the only way the ruble would come under serious attack would be if Russia did not follow the program.
Some economists say a stabilization fund might not be needed.

HEADLINE: The Dow Is Virtually Flat, at 3,245.97

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks ended a volatile week on a steady note yesterday, with blue chips practically unchanged and the broader market showing a bit of weakness. The Dow Jones industrial average adjourned for the long weekend at 3,245.97, off just 0.68 point for the day but up 20.57 for the week -- a week that saw another record high.
Trading was choppy, with the market under pressure from the outset, as some investors sold to reduce exposure ahead of the three-day weekend, while others simply rotated out of growth issues into cyclical stocks. 
 Blue-chip issues recouped much of the day's losses on the strength of transportation stocks, particularly autos and airlines, and a firming of bond prices following weaker-than-expected industrial production data for January.
 
Big Activity in Auto Stocks
 Automobile stocks were active, with the Big Three carrying the market for the day, along with airline stocks. Chrysler rose 1 1/4, to 16 3/8; Ford Motor was up 1 7/8, to 37 1/8, and General Motors was up 1 1/2, to 38 1/8. The companies hogged three of the top five spots on the New York Stock Exchange active list.
Talk among analysts is that auto sales are expected to improve this spring as a result of the Federal Reserve's efforts to lower interest rates, and that the average car is now more than eight years old, so there is a replacement demand. Besides that, they note that the Japanese are raising their prices.
John H. Shaughnessy, senior vice president and director of research for Advest Inc., said he was surprised "that the market did not react more negatively to the poor 30-year auction on Thursday and the fact that interest rates are backing up." He added: "This has been an interest-rate-driven market, and if rates go up and the economy does not turn around, then equities would be in big trouble."
 
Losers Outnumber Gainers
 On the New York Stock Exchange the volume was 221 million, down from 230.9 million on Thursday. The Big Board composite slipped 0.57, to 228.16, with losing issues ahead of gainers by 902 to 786.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 1.21, to 412.48, and the American Stock Exchange index was down a point, to 414.27. Trading on the Nasdaq was active as the composite dropped 2.67, to 636.43, while the Russell 2,000 ticked up 0.2, to 211.56.
Analysts said soft bond prices kept stocks under pressure as yields rose, making bonds more attractive to investors looking for the best return.
 
B.P. Off 1 1/8, to 58 1/4
 In trading yesterday, British Petroleum fell 1 1/8, to 58 1/4, as analysts said the company was not ruling out a future dividend cut, following disappointing 1991 earnings results released Thursday. Traders said John Hervey, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., did not think that a dividend cut was likely but that it might not be as safe as he had thought.
Citing what he said was an accelerating earnings growth, Mark Gulley, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, raised his rating on Morton International, an industrial and consumer products company, to buy from hold. Mr. Gulley said investors were looking ahead at 1993 earnings as the company prepared to step up production of air bags for the 1994 car model year.
The stock was up 2 1/8 yesterday, to 62 1/2.

HEADLINE: Ex-Soviet Atom Scientists Ask Baker for West's Help

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHELYABINSK-70, Russia, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Some of the top nuclear bomb designers of the former Soviet Union, aware of Western concern that they not sell their expertise to hostile powers, presented Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today with a list of commercial scientific projects they were ready to work on if the West would just invest in them.
In a remarkable encounter, Mr. Baker became the first Western official known to have visited Chelyabinsk-70, a top-secret military nuclear complex near the old industrial city of Chelyabinsk in the Urals. Chelyabinsk-70 and other secret military towns were not listed on published Soviet maps. A Russian official said the numerical suffix on the name was for postal reasons. 
 The Russian nuclear bomb designers who greeted Mr. Baker appeared to be almost desperate in their desire to obtain civilian contracts from the West to keep themselves employed now that their own Government has announced major cuts in military projects. Mr. Baker seemed in tune with their desires as he told them of American and German plans to help create a "clearing house" for nuclear and other scientists in Russia.
 
Like a Salesman's Pitch

Speaking quickly, like a salesman who has only a few minutes to make his pitch, the chief scientist of the Chelyabinsk-70 weapons design center, Yevgeny N. Avrorin, presented Mr. Baker with a long list of commercial products that his scientists could produce if they had Western investors.
These included industrial diamonds, fiber-optical equipment, nuclear medical equipment and computer software that they hoped might particularly appeal to Japanese electronics companies.
 
'Remarkable,' Baker Says
 When Mr. Baker's motorcade arrived at the nine-story building in Chelyabinsk-70 where his meeting was held, every window in the structure was packed with scientists, technicians and secretaries, creating a remarkable multi-story tableau of smiling faces and waving hands. The vigor of the reception in sub-zero weather suggested that the Russian scientists saw the United States and the West as an answer to their economic woes.
"This is every bit as remarkable for us as is it for you," Mr. Baker said as he sat in front of a blackboard in a classroom filled with the most senior nuclear bomb designers of the former Soviet Union.
The scientists said the pay rate at their institute ranged from 857 rubles a month for technicians to 1,500 rubles a month for the top nuclear bomb designers. At one time these were impressive salaries, well above the average of about 300 rubles a month. But with the runaway inflation of the ruble, these salaries are no longer so privileged. Even with occasional bonuses and subsidized food and housing, the scientists said they were struggling to keep themselves afloat.
In his prepared remarks at Chelyabinsk-70, situated just east of the Ural Mountains in western Siberia, Mr. Baker told the scientists: "We know that right now your options at home are limited and outlaw regimes and terrorists may try to exploit your situation and influence you to build new weapons of war. We want to help you find new projects that will allow you to remain in your country and earn a decent living, applying your skills to the cause of science and peace, rather than forging weapons of war."
To do that, Mr. Baker said, the United States and Germany, in coordination with Russia, will discuss how to establish "an international scientific center" in Russia that might also have branches in other former republics.
 
Clearing-House Role Seen
 "The center would play a clearing-house or facilitating role," Mr. Baker said. "It would receive, review, generate and fund proposals for projects. It would help match projects with qualified scientists and individuals and monitor projects to insure proper use of funds. Actual projects themselves could be carried out by top scientists throughout the new independent states. It would be open to scientists from all the new independent states."
Chelyabinsk-70 is one of two nuclear bomb designing complexes in the former Soviet Union, the other being Arzamas-16, situated near the Volga River. A sister city about 20 miles away, Chelyabinsk-65, actually manufactures the nuclear bombs designed here and was visited by a Senate delegation in January.
The Chelyabinsk district was the site of one of the worst nuclear accidents in history in 1957 -- worse even than Chernobyl, although it was not reported at the time. Some stored nuclear waste exploded, irradiating a wide trough of territory and forcing the evacuation of some 30 villages.
Mr. Baker flew from Dushanbe, Tajikistan, this morning, where he was on a tour of Central Asian republics, to Yekaterinburg, one of the chief cities in the Urals. From Yekaterinburg, formerly known as Sverdlovsk, he drove for two hours south through a forest of pine and fir trees to Chelyabinsk-70, which consists of about 100 acres of buildings and apartment houses surrounded by double barbed-wire fence.
 
Nods of Approval
 The 30-odd senior scientists gathered for Mr. Baker in Chelyabinsk-70 in the building known officially as the All-Union Scientific Research Institute for Technical Physics nodded their heads in approval at all of his remarks. But before Mr. Baker even began, Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy, and Mr. Avrorin, the chief scientist at Chelyabinsk-70, presented the Secretary of State with what they described as a hasty translation of their own proposals for employment.
Mr. Avrorin explained that Chelyabinsk-70 is one of 10 closed military industrial cities spread around Russia and employs 16,000 people, about 9,000 of whom are technicians and 7,000 production engineers and scientists.
"Our institute is well equipped with scientific research equipment," Mr. Avrorin said. "This has come at great expense to our taxpayers, and we understand that now is the time to give this back. We have a huge scientific research potential, and therefore conversion to different types is not so painful. We have no shortage of ideas. But we have no sufficient financing for them."
He went on to tell Mr. Baker that the institute is interested in developing cooperation with foreign countries, particularly the United States.
Mr. Avrorin stressed that he and his colleagues were not looking for handouts and were not begging.
"It is important not just to have money for living, but also interesting work," he told Mr. Baker.
He said the center had been working to develop synthetic microscopic diamonds that could put an edge on knives that would never have to be sharpened. The center, he said, has also done sophisticated work on fiber optics and various applications of nuclear medicine and nuclear magnetic resonance. He also suggested joint mathematical research between Chelyabinsk and Los Alamos, the American nuclear weapons laboratory in Mew Mexico.
Beyond seeking investors for such commercial applications, Mr. Avrorin asked Mr. Baker to help provide government guarantees for potential investors, as well as customs and tax breaks to make such deals more attractive. To coordinate the proposals, he suggested "a bilateral commission" of American and Russian scientists quite similar to what Mr. Baker was suggesting.
 
No Commitment by Baker
 Mr. Baker did not commit himself in any way, although he promised to study the Russian proposal carefully. He said that an American arms control team would meet him in Moscow on Monday for talks on this subject with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and that at that time they would try to begin formalizing some arrangements for cooperation.
Vladislav I. Nikitin, deputy director of the institute, told reporters that as far as he knew no former Soviet nuclear bomb designers had been approached yet by foreign powers. He said that for now, leaving Russia for more money abroad did not appeal to the premier scientists working at Chelyabinsk.
Mr. Nikitin said, "All the noise about the brain drain is having an influence on the state of mind of our scientists and is now driving this process."
He maintained that since 1988, Chelyabinsk-70 has been converting its research to civilian applications and that now roughly 50 percent of its research was military and 50 percent non-military. The problem, he explained, was that conversion to civilian projects was expensive, and without commercial customers there was no way for the institute to cover its costs.
 
Tour of Laboratories
 After Mr. Baker spoke with the scientists, he toured one of their laboratories, and was shown various experiments involving plutonium, uranium- 235 and tritium. While the buildings in the complex looked neater and more well-built and well-kept than the normal Soviet office block, they still had a 1950's feel about them, and there were few computers to be seen.
Before leaving, Mr. Baker asked his hosts if they would allow him to be filmed by an American network television crew as he visited a memorial to one of the founders of the Soviet nuclear program that is situated on the grounds of Chelyabinsk. The director said that he was very sorry but that absolutely no filming was allowed inside the gate. It had never been done, he said.
But as the director spoke, the other nuclear bomb designers sitting around him in the classroom began whispering, "Let him do it, let him do it." Finally, the director relented, and all the Russian scientists applauded.
"See, it is a new day," Mr. Baker said.

HEADLINE: Treasury Issues Mixed, With Bonds Rising

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, as short- to intermediate-term issues continued to fall while bonds staged a bit of a recovery.
While some market participants were cheered by the upturn in bond prices, economic reports released yesterday should have benefited the entire fixed-income market. 
 Traders said a rise in the midmonth survey of consumer attitudes by the University of Michigan, even though it was tiny and confidence remains at a very low level, was not welcome news. It suggested to traders that consumers may begin spending more in the future, which could ignite inflation, the foremost concern of credit market participants.
Two other reports yesterday, however, suggested that inflation would remain under control for the foreseeable future. Producer prices fell three-tenths of a percent in January, and industrial production dropped nine-tenths of a percent, steeper than most forecasts had projected.
The implications of the numbers, however, were lost on traders.
"This market is getting great news and it keeps going down," said Jay Goldinger, a principal at Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. "I don't think I want to be around when it gets some bad news."
The only piece of information that did seem to please traders were rumors that the Fed had bought for a customer as much as $1 billion worth of Treasury securities with maturities from 2 to 30 years. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which handles such trades, would not comment on the rumors.
But the talk had a salutary effect on bond yields, which earlier in the day breached 8 percent for the first time since late November.
"The rise above 8 percent triggered some bottom fishing, and that helped stabilize the market," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
The bulk of yesterday's activity was telescoped into the morning hours. On the recommendation of the Public Securities Association, an industry trade group, trading in Government securities stopped at 2 P.M., Eastern time, to observe the long Washington's Birthday weekend. The market will be closed Monday.
At the close of trading yesterday, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 1002/32 , up 6/32 , to yield 7.90 percent, compared with 7.91 percent late Thursday. But the rise in yields over the course of the last week has been steep: on Feb. 7, bond yields were at 7.75 percent.
In the secondary Treasury note market, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10025/32 late yesterday, up 1/32 , to yield 7.38 percent. But prices of the 6 1/4 percent five-year notes fell by 1/8 point, to 9813/32 , to yield 6.63 percent. And the 4 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9910/32 , down 2/32 , to yield 5.24 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to up slightly.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 3.79 percent, up 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged at a late offered rate of 3.89 percent.

DATELINE: DUSSELDORF, Germany

 BODY:
Friedrich Wilhelm Christians was a young panzer commander when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and his force was ordered through the Ukraine to Baku, Azerbaijan, places he says younger Germans barely know.
At the end of the war he was stationed near Konigsberg, today Kaliningrad, then surrounded by advancing Soviet forces, until he and a comrade jumped on a tramp steamer that took them across the Baltic to Sweden to escape the Soviet onslaught. 
 Twenty-four years later, in 1969, Mr. Christians was the first German banker to go back to the Soviet Union, to negotiate with the Soviet Government the first of many immense deals involving German deliveries of industrial goods, like steel pipes, in exchange for raw materials like natural gas. Over the years, Mr. Christians, who is now chairman of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, made dozens of trips to Moscow.
 
A Competitive Edge
 Mr. Christians, who is 69 years old, is one of a number of German business leaders who have personal histories and experiences that seem to give them an advantage over their business competitors in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Further, the background of men like Mr. Christians seems to enable them to meet some of the concerns raised by Germany's history in Eastern Europe at a time when rising German investment is generating some anxiety in the region.
Mr. Christians's background, for example, left him a major advocate of German trade with Eastern Europe. In the early 1980's, this embroiled him in a political controversy that split the Reagan Administration and the Government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt over construction of a new gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe.
Washington said the multibillion-dollar deal, financed by German banks led by Deutsche, gave the Soviets Western technology and a cash boost at a time of major Soviet rearmament under Leonid I. Brezhnev and would heighten West Germany's economic dependence on the Soviets. The Germans denied that the impact of the deal was that great or that it jeopardized Germany's reliability.
With the opening under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Christians took a particular interest in Kaliningrad and the Baltic shore he had come to know as a young officer. On a trip to Moscow in 1988, he proposed to Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that the city be transformed into a kind of free trade and settlement area, a major port linking the old Soviet republics with Scandinavia, Poland and Western Europe. Together with German friends, he founded a Konigsberg Initiative.
"My proposal was: no re-Germanization, but a Europeanization," Mr. Christians said, sipping tea in his Dusseldorf office. "Konigsberg should be restored as a great port, an exchange for people, ideas, capital and goods."
In this, Mr. Christians was little different from many German businessmen, who acquired some ties to the east while serving in armies in the Soviet Union or languishing in prisoner of war camps, some even learning scraps of pidgin Russian.
Since the Soviet coup last August, Germans have been returning to Konigsberg in increasing numbers, only to be depressed on finding a region swept of its German cultural heritage, he said.
 
Cut Off From Birthplace
 "The younger they are, especially those 30 and 40 who were born in Kaliningrad, the more open they are. Recently I had a visit from a young artist and his student friend. They were proud of the city's historical past.
"But with the older generation it's different. Shevardnadze once said to me that for them, Kaliningrad remains a trophy of the war."
For some people engaged in business, Eastern Europe was the place of their birth, though the loss of German lands after the war meant they could not return for many years. Count Ferdinand von Ballestrem, for instance, was born in Breslau, today Wroclaw in Poland, in 1943, just before Hitler declared it a fortress in a last, futile attempt to halt the invading Russians.
His family settled in Silesia around Gleiwitz, today Gliwice, in the mid-18th century and built up the coal mining and steel making industries.
But after World War II, the family was driven out and its properties, including coals mines and steel mills that at their peak employed some 40,000 people, were nationalized by Poland's Communist Government. Silesia's wartime industries, sapped of German labor, used forced labor during the war, and anger ran high toward industrialists after the war. Count Ballestrem concedes that had family members remained, "they would not have survived."
Until 1975, he and his family were refused entry to Poland, though he now travels there freely. Today he is a senior executive at Ferrostaal, one of Germany's largest steel trading companies, which is deeply engaged in Poland's economy by arranging so-called triangular deals to offset chronic cash shortages. Typically, Ferrostaal buys Romanian crude steel, delivers it to Canada, and uses the proceeds to purchase Polish railway wheels that it then delivers to the Romanians, for a fee.
Now he is helping to establish a management school at Poland's Catholic University in Lublin, and together with other German businessmen has organized courses in Poland and in Germany to teach Polish executives Western business practices.
But he discounts a large investment stake by Ferrostaal in Poland. "Even if they gave us their factories for one mark," he said, "we do not have the billions needed to get them running again.
"Things have been so totally turned around that we must now try to cooperate so that some day it would be possible for a German to live and work in Wroclaw or Katowice just as he would in Paris or New York, or Liege."
He recalled that Liege, in Belgium, had once been part of the German Reich, too, but added, "Certainly, this is far more difficult."
"Naturally, a Pole who thinks in the categories of 1945 sees a criminal in every German," he said. "It's our job to bring them to the year 1992."

HEADLINE: Study Says Recession Wiped Out 80's Boom in Cities

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Feb. 14

 BODY:
While the entire region has suffered from employment losses during the recession, the sharpest drops have struck the cities, with some declines so steep that they wiped out in a year or two all of the gains of the boom years in the mid-1980's, according to a university report released this week.
A study focusing on New Jersey by a team of Rutgers University researchers shows that Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth, Trenton and Camden, the state's largest cities, were rescued from "an economic free fall" by the strong growth that began in 1982. But after peaking in 1989, each of the cities fell back to a lower level of employment than they showed in 1982.
 
Boom's Heroes Are Villains
 Suburban private employment similarly peaked in 1989, and then dropped by 2.3 percent in the following 12 months. But for the cities, the job loss amounted to nearly five percent of their total. 
 The report, "New Jersey Cities in the 1980's, an Economic Report Card," was written by James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning, and Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics. It is part of the Rutgers Regional Report, a periodic study of regional economic and planning issues. The release of the report coincides with the third anniversary of the onset of the recession, which economists measure from February 1989, the peak employment month for the region.
Mr. Hughes said in an interview that the villains in his bleak urban employment review were easy to spot: they were the heroes of the boom years.
"Defense, financial services, real estate, broad service growth -- they were the economic locomotives that powered the 80's, and they are all derailed," he said. "Now we are all desperately looking for new sources of motive power to put us back on the tracks."
Figures provided by state and Federal labor statisticians show that the Rutgers report's analysis of New Jersey's urban employment holds broadly true for the rest of the region, notably New York City, although over a longer period. The city's private employment grew to 3 million in 1989 from 2.8 million in 1982, only to fall back to below the 1982 level last year, according to preliminary figures for 1991 from the State Department of Labor.
But because of the relative employment strength of upstate cities, Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and the Utica-Rome area, New York State's overall urban private employment managed to hold on to most of the gains of the 1980's. The three biggest upstate cities, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, all profiting from liberalized trade policies with Canada, saw their total private, non-agricultural employment rise from 964,000 in 1982 to 1.13 million in 1989, the level at which they remained with only a slight decline through 1991.
 
Few Cities Improved
 Yet of the 17 biggest centers of non-government employment in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, only four -- Buffalo, Syracuse, Utica-Rome and Newark -- improved their employment from 1989 to 1990, and then by only small margins.
Employment outside of government in Connecticut shows a steady loss of jobs in the cities. Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford and Waterbury grew from 837,800 total employment in 1982 to a peak of just over 1 million in 1989, and then fell back 995,300 in the following year.
Because of different methods used to collect them, the employment figures are not directly comparable from state to state. But they accurately reflect employment trends within the states. Economists tend to focus on private employment as the best indicator of economic performance, because government employment does not respond to general economic conditions as quickly.
According to the Rutgers report, the strong growth of the 1980's came just in time for New Jersey's cities. The steady losses in manufacturing employment and the drain of retailing into suburban malls contributed to the loss of 49,000 jobs, 13.9 percent of the total, from the six cities between 1975 and 1982, a period when most of the country was recovering from recession.
"Thus, during the second half of the decade of the 1970's and the early yeas of the 1980's, New Jersey's cities were arguably close to economic free fall, led by employment declines in Camden and Newark approaching 25 percent," it said.
The boom years carried over into the state's cities, with employment increases led by services, transportation and construction, the report said.
"Thus, a rising economic tide did raise all ships, including the state's urban centers, albeit at a much lower rate of increase compared to the gain experienced everywhere else in New Jersey," the report noted.
The authors doubt the state will see a spurt in employment like the one of the last decade anytime soon.
"That period is history," said Mr. Hughes. "We may have bottomed out but we still haven't recovered yet, and meanwhile we're still grasping for the idea that will pull us out, the idea of the 90's. But I haven't seen it yet."

HEADLINE: Oil and Auto Industries See No Gain From Alcohol Fuel

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The domestic automobile and oil industries have issued a study that purports to show that cars fueled with a mixture of alcohol and gasoline emit more smog-causing chemicals and are more costly to run than those using on reformulated gasoline.
But the conclusion was immediately criticized by the chairman of the California Air Resources Board and representatives of the alcohol industry. They said the data were meaningless because they were based on older cars with obsolete pollution control systems. 
 The immediate criticism may keep the study from doing what oil company representatives said was its primary objective: to influence legislators and regulators in setting air emissions standards. With a huge investment in gasoline production, they oppose subsidies or mandates that promote the use of alcohols, like methanol, in motor fuels.
"On the Federal level, these results should make clear to our lawmakers that legislation for large methanol subsidies or mandates to compel the use of methanol-fueled vehicles are not in this nation's best interest," James W. Kinnear, the president of Texaco Inc., said in a statement.
He also said states, especially those in the Northeast, should be wary of adopting California emissions standards that promote the use of alternative fuels.
But Jananne Sharpless, the head of the California board, said the agency "has already established that emissions from a methanol-powered vehicle are 50 percent less smog-forming than the same volume of emissions from a gasoline-powered car."
The study is part of a joint research effort undertaken by the auto and oil industries in October 1989. One part examines emissions, while two others examine the economics of converting cars to operate on methanol fuel and the costs of operation. More reports are expected in the future.
"The basic conclusion is that there will be no environmental benefit to buying a flexible-fuel vehicle, but it will cost more," said John J. Wise, the vice president for research for the Mobil Oil Company.
 
Results Are Surprise
 "It shows that ozone would increase 26 percent in Los Angeles" with methanol as a fuel, said Robert Trunek, senior vice president for technology at ARCO. Ozone is one of the key components of atmospheric smog. "That came as a surprise," he added. "Most people anticipated a decline."
The study also show that reformulated gasoline would cut ozone-forming emissions in the same region by 26 percent. "That's a 52 percent swing in ozone between reformulated gasoline and methanol," Mr. Trunek said. "That is a very surprising and significant finding."
But Raymond A. Lewis, the president of the American Methanol Institute, said the study gave a misleading picture of emissions. He said it included cars from the early 1980's, whose fuel handling and emissions control systems were not well adapted to any fuel other than gasoline.
Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environment and safety engineering, said the real message of the research was that "both methanol and gasoline are showing more promise than anyone thought a few years ago."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell In January

BYLINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14, Reuters

 BODY:
Wholesale prices fell for the second straight month in January, the Government said today, another sign that the sluggish economy is holding inflation in check.
 The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index fell three-tenths of 1 percent after a revised decline of one-tenth of 1 percent the prior month. The department had previously said that wholesale prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent in December.
 The drop continues a trend established last year when wholesale prices posted their first annual decline in five years.
 
Some Worrisome Data
 Nonetheless, the report was not all good inflation news. If volatile food and energy prices were excluded, the wholesale price index rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January, the department said.
 In comments on the economy today, President Bush chose to emphasize Thursday's reports that showed a jump in retail sales in January and a decline in weekly claims for jobless benefits.
He said things were looking up, and he called on Democrats to approve his anti-recession tax cut plan.
 "The economy is getting ready to move," Mr. Bush said, speaking in Belcamp, Md. "Interest rates are down. Inflation is down. Everything is not all gloomy. What it needs is a stimulative push right now."
 Officials of the Bush Administration, hoping to put some life into the economy by the November election, have been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further. The latest reports offer few obstacles to further cuts, but it is far from clear that the central bank -- where officials have expressed concern about the anemic economy -- will ease credit again.
 Three years of slow growth or recession are having an impact on prices from trucks to computers and gasoline. The last time wholesale prices rose was in October.
 
Energy Prices Drop
 The January drop in producer prices came as energy prices fell 2.8 percent after declining 1.4 percent in December. Energy prices have fallen 10 percent since January 1991, when the Persian Gulf crisis sent the cost of oil soaring.
 Gasoline prices fell 7 percent last month, far more than December's 1.6 percent drop, and prices for natural gas, electricity and home heating oil also fell.
 Food prices fell for the eighth time in nine months, sliding three-tenths of 1 percent as producers got less for eggs, pork, chicken and citrus. Fresh vegetable prices rose.
 Car prices were up 1.5 percent in January after remaining unchanged in December. Car prices have risen 3.5 percent in the last 12 months, the department said.

Dollar Shrugs Off New Data and Ends Day With a Gain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher yesterday after first falling in response to two economic reports and then recovering as the market gave more weight to upbeat retail sales figures issued Thursday.
Gold prices fell in New York and overseas. Gold dropped $2.20 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $353.70. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $353.25, off $2.10. 
 Analysts said the dollar fell after the Government reported industrial production slipped nine-tenths of 1 percent in January, a sharper drop than the five-tenths that the financial markets had generally expected.
The Labor Department's report that producer prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent last month, another larger-than-expected decline, also took the dollar lower.
Weak production levels and a cooling of inflation give the Federal Reserve more leeway to lower interest rates, and lower rates would tend to depress the dollar's value.
But the market's surprise soon wore off. Traders shrugged off the latest figures and instead focused on Thursday's report of a healthy gain in retail sales last month.
Revitalized spending by consumers raised hopes that the economy would turn around and that interest rates would halt their decline.
Walter Simon, a vice president with Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York, said the dollar was also helped by rumors that the Fed had entered the market to push the currency up.
At the same time, he said, there was concern that central banks might intervene to stop the dollar from climbing too high. The dollar has surged recently amid signs the economy might be recovering.
The dollar rose to 1.6265 marks in New York, from 1.6240 late Thursday. In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.6285 marks from 1.6230.
The dollar also advanced against the Japanese yen, rising to 127.80 yen in New York from 127.65 yen. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.62 yen, to 127.95. Later, in London, it fell to 127.80 yen.
The British pound fell against the dollar, slipping to $1.7715 in New York from $1.7725. In London, the pound fell to $1.7685 from $1.7730.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.4650 Swiss francs, up from 1.4600; 5.5370 French francs, up from 5.5310; 1,221.25 Italian lire, up from 1,220.50; 1.18665 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18625.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Days Inns Executive Is Promoted to President

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Hospitality Franchise Systems Inc. yesterday promoted Doug Collins to be president of its Days Inns of America unit. Mr. Collins had been senior vice president and chief financial officer of Days Inns since 1990.
Hospitality Franchise acquired Days Inns last month for $259 million from the Tollman-Hundley Lodging Corporation. Hospitality, a wholly owned subsidiary of a unit of the Blackstone Group investment firm, also owns the Ramada and Howard Johnson hotel chains. All three hotel chains operate as franchisers. 
 With the acquisition of Days Inns, where the average room rate is $40 a night, Hospitality has 2,300 franchised properties, with Days Inns accounting for 1,250 hotels.
Days Inns, which is based in Atlanta, has been hard hit by the weak economy, along with the rest of the lodging industry. The average hotel was only 60 percent full last year, and Mr. Collins said Days Inns' occupancy rate was in line with the industry average.
Mr. Collins added that "1990 and 1991 have been very difficult years for the hotel industry." Still, he said, there were some signs that business and vacation travel were picking up in recent months. "We like to think we have hit bottom," he continued. "We are guardedly optimistic about the future."
Most of the chain's hotels are in the United States, but the company is starting to expand in India. Mr. Collins said that 25 percent of Days Inns' franchisees were Asian-Americans and that an Indian franchisee in the United States was trying to popularize the hotel chain in India. There is one Days Inns in India, and five more are planned.
Before joining Days Inns two years ago, Mr. Collins was president of Imperial Hotels, a 50-hotel chain.
Mr. Collins is a certified public accountant with an M.B.A. from George Washington University. He and his wife, Peggy, have four children and live in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: Paying Off a Loan Early Can Hurt

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
As people race to refinance loans to get better interest rates, some may end up paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars in hidden interest charges because of an accounting method used by some lenders.
The method, known as the "rule of 78's," inflates the amount of interest that the borrower must pay if the loan is paid off or refinanced early in its life. The procedure is generally not used for first mortgages, but some lenders use it for second mortgages, home equity loans and loans for cars, boats and mobile homes. 
 The term "rule of 78's" refers to a formula used to compute the interest. Though it is forbidding to any but those with plenty of sharp pencils and a penchant for precise figuring, here is a primer:
Using a 12-month loan as an example, the numbers 1 through 12, each representing a month, are added together -- 1 plus 2 plus 3, and so on -- yielding a sum of 78. If the borrower pays off or refinances a loan after one payment, he is assumed to have paid 12 seventy-eighths (about 15 percent) of the total interest owed; after two payments, 12 seventy-eighths plus 11 seventy-eighths, and so on.
 
The Unpaid Principal
 In effect, the formula credits the borrower with paying more of the total interest bill -- and thus less of the principal -- in the early payments. So if he pays off the loan in the early months, he will find that he owes more principal than if the loan carried simple interest.
The inflation in the interest is typically highest about a third of the way through the loan. With a large, long-term loan, it can amount to thousands of dollars.
Take, for example, a 15-year $30,000 loan for a mobile home at 16 percent interest. If the procedure in the rule of 78's is used, a consumer who repaid or refinanced the loan after five years would pay an extra $4,595 in interest. With other accounting methods, like simple interest, there is no hidden charge.
"The bottom line is that the rule of 78's is a consumer rip-off," said Margot Saunders, an lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center in Washington.
Even some lenders who use the rule are offering alternatives. The General Motors Acceptance Corporation, for one, is increasingly making car loans with simple interest, said Linda Kosinski, a spokeswoman. But the company does use the rule of 78's in several states, including Pennsylvania, and in the District of Columbia, she said.
Ms. Kosinski suggested that a car buyer ask the dealer if a simple-interest loan is available. "We think simple interest is more consumer friendly," she said.
At least 16 states, including New York, prohibit lenders from using the rule of 78's procedure. But it is permitted in many states, including Connecticut, and loans made in recent years in states that are phasing it out may still be affected by it, said the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group in Washington.
Consumer groups are concerned, too, because some courts have ruled recently that lenders in states that allow the method may use it on loans to people who live in states that prohibit it.
"The state laws aimed at outlawing these practices may not be protecting consumers," said Peggy Miller, director of banking issues for the Consumer Federation. She said the rulings may affect people who are thinking about refinancing loans, because any saving from lower interest rates may be offset by prepayment costs.
 
A Holdover From Hard Times
 The rule of 78's was adopted by lenders in the 1930's as a quick way to figure how much interest remained on loans when they were prepaid by borrowers. Personal and car loans were small then, and the rule of 78's was not considered unfair because it has little effect on refinanced loans that are small or short term. It also has no consequences for loans that are repaid over their full term.
But over the years, as loans lengthened in term and grew in size, the method's quirks became more apparent and more troublesome. The reasons are complex, but the method effectively allocates a larger proportion of a borrower's payments toward interest in the first years of a loan and less in later years.
So the formula's mathematical quirks also may make it less attractive to refinance a loan late in its life, because the effective annual percentage rate decreases over time.
For example, a 12-year 14.5 percent loan using the rule of 78's procedure is actually carrying an annual interest rate of 9.19 percent after nine years. So anyone who rushes out to refinance such a seemingly high-interest loan at 9 percent may be making a mistake, Ms. Miller said.
"You'll just extend the life of an existing loan without any benefit," she said.
 
 
A TIP: LOOK BEFORE LEAPING
 The Consumer Federation of America has this advice for those who want to refinance loans:
First, read your contract to see if the terms "rule of 78's" or "sum of the digits" appear. Even if they do not, ask the lender if your loan is bound by the rule of 78's. Lenders are not required to mark the loan documents.
Before you refinance or prepay, ask the lender to estimate in writing the amount of any penalty that would be invoked because of the rule of 78's. Use that as a guide to decide if it is worthwhile to switch to a lower-interest loan.
Make sure that your new loan uses a simple interest method, rather than the rule of 78's.

HEADLINE: MARATHON;
In Vietnam, Race Sets New Course

BYLINE: By BARBARA BASLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Le Buu was once a dedicated Vietcong guerrilla, fighting first the French, then the Americans, whom he called "the invaders."
But today, dressed in a dapper white suit and a pinstriped shirt, he greeted his former enemies as friendly competitors and welcomed them to the first Ho Chi Minh City International Marathon. The race will take place Sunday, with runners making their way through the heart of this elegant city, which residents still call Saigon. 
 When an American financial consultant who does business here first suggested the idea of a marathon, the Vietnamese were intrigued but skeptical. "They said, 'Will people come all this way to run in this heat?' " recalled the consultant, Bruce Aitken, who lives in Hong Kong. "I brought them running magazines and showed them there were marathons all over the world -- from Boston to Bangkok, London, Paris. And they got excited."
 
Sports as Marketing
 Because of its stumbling economy, Vietnam today is eager to rejoin the international community -- to attract foreign investors and foreign loans. It has made a number of conciliatory gestures, and this marathon, with its surrounding silk banners, dragon dances and schoolgirls in native costumes, is one more way to show its new attitude.
The marathon hoopla represents a real change for a country that only reopened its doors to tourists in 1987.
With more than 250 runners from 26 countries, this is the first major international sports event to be held in Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in 1975, said Buu, the director of the Ho Chi Minh City Sports Authority and the deputy chairman of the marathon.
It is a race rich with meaning, as veterans from both sides of the Vietnam War run side by side past old monuments and memories.
"I was a conscientious objector during the war, and I'm here racing with American veterans and Vietnamese veterans," said Bill Rodgers, the 44-year-old American who has won the New York City and Boston marathons. "I think we all feel this marathon is a symbol -- something to bring all of us together."
 
Embassy Is Course Landmark
 The course will take runners under the gracious shade trees of Le Duan Boulevard, past the former United States Embassy, whose rooftop landing pad was used to evacuate Americans and some Vietnamese when Saigon fell to the Communists from what was then North Vietnam.
The course runs along the Saigon River into the rice paddies of the countryside, then ends at the former Presidential Palace, now Reunification Hall.
While much of Vietnam remains impoverished, Ho Chi Minh City, with a population of almost 4 million, is the commercial heart of the country. It has bustling markets with stalls overflowing with fruits, vegetables, meats, pottery and even United States Army boots, backpacks and canteens left over from the war. The streets are filled with bicycles and motorbikes, and there are scores of discos, bars and nightclubs, one of the most popular being Apocalypse Now, named after the American movie about the Vietnam War.
Organizers say they expect crowds in the hundreds of thousands to line the marathon route. The Vietnamese Government has publicized the marathon in nightly television announcements.
 
Serious and 'Fun' Runners
 Buu said that while soccer is the most popular sport in Vietnam and running is a relatively new activity here, runners began to train as soon as news of the marathon was sent to all the people's committees in the provinces. Now, 92 Vietnamese will join the international runners in the marathon on Sunday, and 600 other Vietnamese are expected to compete in "fun" races to be held on Saturday. Buu said of his 92 countrymen, only 8 have run in a marathon before.
The race has had its problems. By international standards, the field is small, largely because of its distant location and the lack of corporate sponsorship.
"The big problem, of course, was that American companies, which are very generous about sponsoring sports events, were not allowed to sponsor this marathon because it was in Vietnam," Aitken said.
Aitken believes the event will probably lose money. "But I think for the runners, this will be fun and very, very successful," he said. "Despite our losses, we expect to hold another one next year."
For Buu, the race will show "we let bygones be bygones. We want people to understand our country. We want to create understanding and harmony."

HEADLINE: Production Down 0.9% Last Month

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Industrial production fell sharply in January, and factory utilization slid as businesses struggled to bring inventories -- particularly of cars and trucks -- back in line with sales.
The Government said yesterday that output fell by nine-tenths of a percent, its third decline in a row and the largest in 11 months. 
 Producer prices also slipped last month, thanks to sharply lower energy and food prices as well as the difficulty that many companies are having in raising prices. [Page 49.]
 
Looking Farther Ahead
 "Today's reports paint a bleak picture of the first quarter," James Annable, chief economist at the First Chicago Bank, said yesterday.
But economists are paying more attention to Thursday's reports that showed a pickup in car sales, consumer spending and money growth, all of which, they said, point to economic growth in the spring. The nation's auto makers said car and truck sales in early February were up 23.8 percent, while the Government said January retail sales grew six-tenths of 1 percent. As a recovery begins to unfold, spending typically picks up before production shows gains.
"The data hint at a possible turn in the economy, but a full-blown recovery is probably still a few months away," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
 
Harbingers of Spring
 Mr. Annable said: "The weak production numbers indicate where we are right now. The spending numbers are signs of spring, like twigs in swallows' beaks."
The Federal Reserve, Mr. Annable said, would probably focus on the more forward-looking indicators and not act again soon to reduce interest rates. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his colleagues are acutely aware that the central bank's most common mistake has been to cut rates when the economy was too far into a recovery. Before the 1980's, the Fed often ignited inflationary booms by easing too much at the beginning of upturns.
"They believe they have gone far enough" in cutting rates for now, Mr. Annable said.
One reason is that the money supply has been growing briskly since early January, a trend that also points to more spending. For the first time in months, M-2, which includes cash and checking and savings accounts, is growing at the midpoint of its target range instead of at its lower end, the Federal Reserve reported on Thursday.
 
Goods Are Piling Up
 Last month's sharp production cutback was probably prompted by a pile-up of inventories before Christmas, Mr. Steinberg said. That pile-up, much bigger than assumed in the fourth-quarter report on gross domestic product released a couple of weeks ago, was reported by the Commerce Department yesterday. It could well result in an upward revision in the final report on fourth-quarter G.D.P., initially reported to have risen three-tenths of 1 percent after inflation.
Business inventories grew four-tenths of 1 percent in December, the fourth straight increase, while sales of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers slid 1.7 percent. "Weak sales show that the inventory buildup was involuntary," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence.
The slump in industrial production reported by the Federal Reserve yesterday left the output of the nation's mines, factories and utilities only a tiny bit higher than it was when it hit bottom last spring. Auto production plunged 8 percent, to 5 million units at an annual rate, well below the recent sales pace.
The Fed also revised December's overall production rate to show a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent, double the drop of two-tenths originally reported. November showed a revised decline of three-tenths of 1 percent, rather than the two-tenths first reported. And October production was flat, after first being estimated as down one-tenth of 1 percent.
Breaking down the January output numbers, production of consumer goods fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, mining activity dropped two-tenths and utilities were off four-tenths of 1 percent.
Output of capital equipment other than computers -- mainly heavy machinery and transportation equipment -- also declined for the third month in a row. That suggests that investment spending by businesses is weakening this quarter. Even construction materials registered a drop, surprising because building activity has been strengthening recently.
The production cuts left factory utilization even lower than it was last spring when the overall economy hit bottom.The rate slumped to its lowest in more than eight years, with plants operating at just 78 percent of capacity, off from 78.8 percent in December. It was the lowest since the beginning of the recovery from the recession of the early 1980's.
Those figures suggest, Mr. Yardeni said, that any broad revival in manufacturing profits is still some time away. When there is plenty of capacity to spare, businesses have a hard time raising prices and that makes it difficult to increase earnings.
 
Stagnant Period Is Seen
 If sales to consumers and businesses keep firming and the housing market continues its recovery, Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said, industrial production could start moving up again in the spring. "In the meantime, output is likely to be flat or slightly down, " he said, as retailers and wholesalers struggle with an unwanted overhang of goods on their shelves.
The recovery in consumer buying, which perked up in January, is likely to proceed at a modest pace, he cautioned. The University of Michigan's latest poll of consumers, taken during the first part of this month, showed only a slight rise in confidence, indicating that consumers are still worried about their economic prospects.
The Michigan index of consumer sentiment ticked up a statistically insignificant six-tenths of a percentage point, to 68.1 from December's 67.5. That is well below last summer's levels, which were in the mid-70's, though not as dismal as the readings after Iraq invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990.

HEADLINE: Bashing Lawyers. Also Justice.

 BODY:
Playing off public distaste for lawyers, the Bush Administration embraces "reform" of civil justice. "Let's stop America's love affair with lawsuits," the President says. And Vice President Quayle condemns the costs and delays of litigating civil cases. Bashing lawyers may be fun, but this campaign risks harm.
Lawyers have indeed encouraged an increasingly litigious society. But Mr. Quayle addresses himself mainly to richer Americans, like manufacturers, municipalities and doctors. He offers nothing for the poor and middle class who need lawyers but can't afford their fees. 
 Lawyers do extract costs from the economy. But they also police the marketplace, drafting and enforcing the contracts that make a $6 trillion economy function. Yes, many bright people are drawn to law at the expense of vocations that create wealth. But many lawyers, including Mr. Quayle, apply their skills outside the practice of law.
Mr. Quayle makes some harmful, some useful and some harmless proposals. The harmful include requiring a losing plaintiff to pay the defendant's legal fees, sharply curtailing contingency fees for lawyers and recklessly attacking punitive damages.
Supporters of the "loser pays" rule believe it discourages frivolous lawsuits. It also discourages legitimate but risky ones. Similar arguments apply to contingency fee arrangements by which lawyers get a percentage of the winnings, but only if they win. Such fees often provide the only access to justice for people without means.
Punitive damages -- awards over and above straight compensation for civil wrongs -- have sometimes spun out of control. Mr. Quayle wants states to limit punitive awards to the actual financial harm the plaintiff suffered. But what of a wrong that caused small financial harm but such distress that the jury wants to teach a lesson?
Mr. Quayle would encourage more programs for out-of-court resolution but doesn't propose funds to pay for them. He also refuses to seek long-deferred increases for Federal poverty law programs, which he unfairly derides.
The President, likewise, fails to distinguish between meritorious and meretricious suits. "Health costs would be an awful lot lower if we didn't have a lot of frivolous lawsuits going after those doctors for malpractice," he says. That assigns no blame to doctors who malpractice, only to suits charging malpractice. An overloaded civil justice system needs reform, not simplistic slander.

HEADLINE: Kennedy Would Have Stood by Vietnam in '65;
Feared China's Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Further to the discussion raised by the Oliver Stone movie "J.F.K.": 
 No one can be confident what a President who died in November 1963 would have done in the quite particular circumstances of July 1965. Moreover, there is bound to be something self-serving as well as unscientific in any such projection. I limit myself to four statements of fact.
* Representative John F. Kennedy's view of Asia, June 1952-February 1961: Down to the autumn of 1951, Kennedy's view of the world was narrowly focused on Stalin's threat to Western Europe. He did not at first vote for President Truman's Point Four. A trip through the Middle East and Asia late in 1951 changed his perspective. In the House on June 28, 1952, he said this about Asia:
"Mr. Chairman, last year when this bill was before the House, I offered a motion to cut technical assistance. But this fall I had an opportunity to visit Southeast Asia, and I think we would be making a tremendous mistake to cut this money out of the bill. Here is an area, Asia, where the Communists are attempting to seize control . . . where the tide of events has been moving against us. The Communists have a chance of seizing all of Asia in the next five or six years."
In that period, he also argued for Vietnamese independence from the French and economic and military aid for independent South Vietnam.
* President Kennedy's view of Vietnam in July 1961: In the summer of 1961, Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor and I were working with the President on this matter. Our joint memorandum to the President dated Aug. 4 said:
"As we understand your position: you would wish to see every avenue of diplomacy exhausted before we accept the necessity for either positioning United States forces on the Southeast Asian mainland or fighting there; you would wish to see the possibilities of economic assistance fully exploited to strengthen the Southeast Asian position; you would wish to see indigenous forces used to the maximum if fighting should occur; and that should we have to fight, we should use air and sea power to the maximum and engage minimum United States forces on the Southeast Asian mainland."
On this basis the Taylor mission went to Southeast Asia in October.
* President Kennedy's view of Asia in December 1961: The following passage from my book "The Diffusion of Power" (1972) sets out President Kennedy's view of Southeast Asia in relation to Asia as a whole, the only time I heard him make such a statement in private:
"He said if we walked away from Southeast Asia, the Communist takeover would produce a debate in the United States more acute than that over the loss of China. Unlike Truman with China or Eisenhower in 1954, he would be violating a treaty commitment to the area. The upshot would be a rise and convergence of left- and right-wing isolationism that could affect commitments in Europe as well as in Asia. Under these circumstances, Khrushchev and Mao could not refrain from acting to exploit the apparent shift in the balance of power. If Burma fell, Chinese power would be on the Indian frontier: the stability of all of Asia, not merely Southeast Asia, was involved. When the Communist leaders had moved -- after they were committed -- the United States would then react. We would come plunging back to retrieve the situation. And a much more dangerous crisis would result, quite possibly a nuclear crisis."
* President Kennedy's view of Vietnam and Asia, September-November 1963: On Sept. 2, 1963, in an interview with Walter Cronkite:
" . . . in the final analysis it is the people and the government" -- of South Vietnam -- "itself who have to win or lose this struggle. All we can do is help, and we are making it very clear, but I don't agree with those who say we should withdraw. That would be a great mistake.
"We took all this -- made this effort to defend Europe. Now Europe is quite secure. We have to participate -- we may not like it -- in the defense of Asia."
On Sept. 9, 1963, questioned by David Brinkley:
Q. "Mr. President, have you had any reason to doubt this so-called "domino theory," that if South Vietnam falls, the rest of Southeast Asia will go behind it?"
A. "No I believe it. I believe it. I think that the struggle is close enough. China is so large, looms so high just beyond the frontiers, that if South Vietnam went, it would not only give them an improved geographic position for a guerrilla assault on Malaya, but would also give the impression that the wave of the future in Southeast Asia was China and the Communists. So I believe it."
His remarks prepared for delivery at the Trade Mart in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, included these words about countries bordering the Communist world: "Our assistance to these nations can be painful, risky and costly, as is true in Southeast Asia today. But we dare not weary of the task."
On Jan. 1, 1965, the Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi said at a diplomatic reception: "Thailand is next." By early 1965 Sukarno had left the United Nations and joined an aggressive coalition led by Beijing, which included North Korea and North Vietnam. He began a massive confrontation against Malaysia, requiring the British Commonwealth to mobilize some 80 warships. Regular North Vietnamese forces were moving for the first time into South Vietnam.
These were the circumstances that led Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore to say: "We may all go through the mincing machine." President Johnson reluctantly, but with overwhelming Congressional, news media and public support, decided to send large United States forces to Vietnam.
Those who believe that John Fitzgerald Kennedy would have walked away from the disintegrating situation in Asia in 1965 have every right to their opinion. But clarity about our history and wisdom about our future are not advanced by setting aside hard, relevant facts.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Harkin: Projecting a Softer Image"
 
SCRIPT
 
Narrator: "He's the son of a coal miner. College on an R.O.T.C. scholarship. Navy Pilot. Senator from Iowa. Husband and Father of two. Author of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Leader in the fight to transfer Pentagon billions to education and medical research
"The only candidate with a plan to take back the billions wasted on tax breaks for the rich and put Americans back to work rebuilding the nation now."
 
ON THE SCREEN
 
Photographs of Tom Harkin as a child, as a Navy Pilot, with his wifa and two daughters, signing with his deaf brother, speaking at a senate hearing, sitting with children in a classroom, talking with construction workers and speaking at a closed factory. The ad ends with Mr. Harkin in shirtsleeves with a American flag as tha backdrop and the line: "Build a New America."
 
ACCURACY
 
Though Mr. Harkin was chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, he had a great deal of help from other Senators. He proposed an amendment last year to transfer military spending to domestic programs, but he is not the leader in that cause, nor is the only candidate with an economic plan.
 
SCORECARD
 
This commercial seeks to convey a softer image after several television commercials in which the Iowa Democrat spoke in strident tones about the economy and the troubles brought about by the Bush Administration.
By emphasizing Mr. Harkin's roots and picturing him with his family, the ad is an attempt to portray him as a person of character while questions are being raised about the personal life of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cuts Off California Farmers' Water Supply

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Six years of drought in the West culminated today in what farmers in California feared the most: The Federal Government announced that it no longer had enough water to supply farmers.
It was the first time in the 40 years since the Government opened the vast network of dams, reservoirs and aqueducts that made California the richest agricultural state in the nation that farmers have been cut off completely. 
 The action not only threatened to disrupt national supplies of tomatoes, lettuce, melons and other crops; it also seemed certain to intensify an emotional debate in the West over whether farmers get too much of the area's scarce water and over whether the 1973 Endangered Species Act causes needless hardship to farmers and city dwellers.
The move came as coastal California braced for still more drenching rainstorms that have caused severe flooding and damage in Southern Calfornia this week. But that water mostly ran out to sea while the snowpack in the mountains of Northern California, which provides most of the water to California farms and cities as it melts and runs off, remained well below normal. The main reservoirs stand at only about one-third of normal for this time of year, and there is no other source of water for the affected farmers unless they can pump water from the ground.
The decision was made by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation, an arm of the Interior Department that runs the irrigation system known as the Central Valley Project. The project, which consists of 20 dams and 500 miles of canals and aqueducts that lace through the farms of the San Joaquin Valley, is the single largest supplier of water in California. It supplies 25,000 farmers and provides 25 percent of all agricultural water in the state.
The agency said that barring heavy precipitation in the remaining two months of the rainy season, it expected to be able to deliver only two-million acre-feet of water to all the users along the system, compared with seven million in normal years. (An acre-foot is enough water to supply two typical households for one year.)
By contract and law, the agency said, all of the little available water had to go to urban users and to protect endangered environments. It cited the winter run of the chinook salmon, a threatened species that swims from the Pacific Ocean, through San Francisco Bay and more than 200 miles up the Sacramento River to spawn at the base of Shasta Dam in Northern California. The young die if the water is too warm, so if less water is released through the dam the reservoir water will be deeper and therefore colder.
 
Farmers Are Stunned
 The news stunned the Central Valley, where farmers said they were planning layoffs as a result of the cutback. "The cuts are devastating, if they hold," said Jason E. Peltier, manager of the Central Valley Project Association, which represent the major water contractors, adding that bankers would now refuse operating loans to thousands of farmers, which they need to plant and harvest.
Gil Ramos, an almond farmer in Arbuckle, 50 miles north of Sacramento, who is president of the Colusa County Farm Bureau, said that he had already laid off three workers and was teetering on bankruptcy, unable to borrow money to drill for ground water. "All we can do is pray for rain," he said. "Last year we got a lot of rain in March and the Bureau of Reclamation changed their assessment and gave us 25 percent. I can only hope that happens again."
Farmers have survived water cutbacks over the last three years by switching to less water-demanding crops and using more costly ground water where it is available. The effects of the cutbacks on consumers were difficult to predict. But in the past it has meant that the prices of some commodities go up and others down as farmers switch crops and growers in other regions of the country make up for the shortages from California. The major crops affected are tomatoes, lettuce, cantaloupes, sugar beets, almond, rice, grapes, broccoli and cotton.
The California Farm Water Coalition, which represents agricultural users, said that the direct loss to farmers alone could exceed $1 billion. The coalition's executive director, Stephen Hall, said that the cutbacks were "more driven by politics than environmental necessity."
 
'Recognize the Difficulty'
 In Washington, a spokesman for Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr. said that the Secretary had been apprised of the decision, but that it had been made by the Commissioner of Reclamation. "The bureau had no latitude in its decision because of the Endangered Species Act and the extraordinary nature of the six-year drought," said the spokesman, Steven Goldstein. "We recognize how difficult it will be and what a hardship this will be on some. But we cannot make it rain."
The issue was inevitably entangled in the politics of the environment, especially since the Endangered Species Act is up for reauthorization by Congress this year. Environmentalists have long asserted that that farmers, who use 80 percent of the available water in California, waste it because it is so cheap. Subsidized Federal water costs farmers from $2 to $17 an acre-foot, compared with more than $200 paid by urban users.
The drought has made the conflict much worse between the various interests fighting for water. Reduced water flows in California rivers and the Sacramento Delta have drastically cut populations of the salmon, striped bass and the delta smelt.
 
New Water Allocations Sought
 Environmentalists were cautiously approving of the action. "They are doing the right thing, finally," said Laura King, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, who added that she remained concerned that the cutback would be used in a broader assault on the act being mounted by loggers, home builders and other groups who say protecting obscure animal species is causing economic hardship.
Tom Graff, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland, said he hoped the action would spur much-debated changes of water allocations in California. The fund supports two bills in Congress, one sponsored by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and the other by Representative George Miller of California, both Democrats, that would require more water be left in northern California for environmental purposes and create a partial free market in water.
On Thursday in Sacramento, the Share the Water Coalition, made up of numerous environmental groups, asserted that the operators of the Central Valley Project had exacerbated the environmental damage of the drought by continuing normal deliveries to farmers during the first three years of the drought.
The Central Valley Project dams water in northern California and saves it in such reservoirs as Lake Shasta, Clair Engle Lake and Folsom Lake. It is then shunted south through the Sacramento and American Rivers, as well other rivers, which carry the water into the Sacramento Delta east of San Francisco, where it is shunted into aqueducts to the farms.
Just how much water will be available remains uncertain. The bureau forecasts snow runoff in the Sacramento River basis will be scarcely a third of the normal 18 million acre-feet. On that basis, it says it would supply urban contractors about half their normal supply. They said they would hope to supply wildlife refuges 50 percent of their normal amount.
The affected agricultural areas are mainly on the west sides of the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin valleys, where alternative water supplies are very limited. "If farmers run out of options, they have no choice but to close the barn door," said Mike Henry, spokesman for the main farmer organization, the California Farm Bureau Federation.
At the Westlands Water District in Fresno, the Central Valley Project's largest customer, a spokesman, Donald Upton, estimated that unless the agency could buy water elsewhere, farmers would remove half their land from use, causing a loss of 7,100 jobs.
 
Farmers With Own Wells
 Many farmers have their own wells, but fear that the natural underground reservoir might be nearly depleted. Last year, when Central Valley Project supplies were cut 75 percent, growers pumped ground water at four times the usual rate. Still, the wells made up only half the shortage.
One-third of the Westlands district farmers have no access to well water, Mr. Upton said. Without purchases of outside water, he said, "Those folks are essentially out of business this year."
Gary G. Robinson, a farmer, predicted that he would secure most of the water he needs, but that it would cost two to five times what he usually pays. Mr. Robinson, who grows almonds and pistachios on 1,050 acres near the town of Huron, said he must buy water at any price. "We have a large, long-term investment in these trees," he said. "No water on almonds for a year would probably kill most of them."
Another farmer, Robert F. Viets, was more pessimistic. "How are you going to buy water when there is none?" he demanded. Mr. Viets, who grows a variety of crops on 600 acres near Coalinga, said he was not sure of making it through the year financially solvent.
"Thousands of people are going to be out of work, hundreds are going to be out of business, and all the businesses in towns around here are going to suffer," he said, "all for a couple of hundred fish."
 The Federal Bureau of Reclamation, an arm of the Interior Department, runs the project and announced the new limits on Friday. The project is the biggest supplier of water in the state and provides 25 percent of all agricultural water in the state.
Before the drought, now in its sixth year, the Central Valley Project typically delivered 7 million acre-feet of water to all users in the system. Without heavy precipitation over the next two months, the agency said it expects to deliver 2 million acre-feet this year. (An acre-foot is enough water to supply two typical households for one year.)
Groups representing farmers in the Central Valley said that the new limits could cost farmers $1 billion in losses and disrupt national supplies of tomatoes, melons, lettuce and other crops.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 19, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about cuts in Federal water deliveries to farms in California misstated the extent of the cuts. Only farms that received new irrigation when the Central Valley Project opened in 1951 were cut off completely. This group of about 7,000 farms covers about 1 million acres. A total of 25,000 farms covering 3.2 million acres are served by the project.
The other 18,000 farms are to receive water from the project at levels ranging from 50 to 75 percent of normal. Those farms had water rights before the project was built, or exchanged those water rights for project water. When they joined the project decades ago they won a commitment from the Federal Government that their requests would be given priority during drought years.

HEADLINE: Teen-Age Robot Makers' Initiation

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 14

 BODY:
The high school gymnasium is packed with screaming fans, but instead of a basketball game, the students are watching strange-looking robots with names like "Da Cat" and "the Devastater" maneuver through a big box filled with feed corn, trying to scoop up tennis balls.
At each robot's remote controls are high school students being coached by professional engineers and scientists from Motorola, Xerox, I.B.M. and 25 other companies and universities. For the last two months, the students and engineers have worked together designing and making the robots.
 
Effort to Break Barriers
 Companies like A.T.& T., Boeing Delco Electronics, General Electric, Raytheon and Nynex and schools like M.I.T., Harvard and Dartmouth have provided teams of volunteer engineers and scientists to "adopt" a local high school class and design and build a remote-controlled mechanical vehicle to compete. 
 "The interaction between the corporations and the high schools is critical," Dr. Allan D. Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, said amid the din emanating from the gym. "Far too few kids ever get a chance to see what an engineer or scientist really does. This kind of event can break down those barriers."
The event, part of a national competition in creative engineering called the Maize Craze, is the first of four regional contests that will culminate in a national championship later this year. Though it is hardly the first national science competition, it is unique in teaming high schoolers with high-powered engineering teams from big companies or universities.
"If big companies want our country to be successful and to have a source of educated workers for the future, they'll have to do this," said James J. Wynne, a physicist and program manager for local education outreach at the International Business Machines Corporation's Yorktown Heights Research Laboratory. "In Japan, engineers are heroes. Here, athletes are heroes. By creating a hands-on sports atmosphere around engineering, you have a chance of drawing youngsters to it."
For the Maize Craze, contest officials got in touch with the 28 sponsoring organizations in mid-December and gave them barely two months to find schools to sponsor, develop and design the robots and get to Manchester for the competition.
"I had no interest in engineering before this," said Nicole Weiner, a junior at Doherty Memorial High School in Worcester, Mass., whose team worked with engineers from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. "But now I'll definitely be considering that as a career."
The idea came about because of the efforts of Dean Kamen, a frenetic 40-year-old physicist, inventor and self-made millionaire who is obsessed with the relentless decline in America's science and math skills.
He approached Dr. Woodie Flowers, a professor of teaching innovation and mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who designed the contest. He patterned it after M.I.T.'s 2.70 contest, a similar design competition where students are given bags of equipment that are to be used to accomplish a certain task.
"We've designed the contest so that there is no right way to do it," Dr. Flowers said. "We wanted to have an ambivalence factor. The teams must ask themselves: 'Should I try to block the other machines? Should I just concentrate on offense or defense?' "
 
Aiming for Cultural Change
 Mr. Kamen is convinced that a cultural change in attitude can be accomplished only by using the marketing prowess and muscle of America's top corporations.
"Every kid in this country knows who Ronald McDonald is, but not one of them could name the Nobel Prize winner in physics," Mr. Kamen said. "Clearly the hamburger stands know something we need to learn."
Mr. Kamen, who made millions by inventing an insulin infusion pump when he was in college, has spent the last four years putting his money where his mouth is.
He created USFirst, the United States Foundation for the Inspiration of Science and Technology, a Manchester-based nonprofit coalition of corporate executives, government officials and academicians. He calls it "the Olympic Committee of Smarts" and says its focus is "making kids go to bed thinking about superconductors, not the Super Bowl."
Ronald Campbell, senior vice president of strategy and architecture at the Xerox Corporation, sent out an electronic mail message one morning seeking volunteers and had a team by 4 P.M.
For the students, the commitment meant long bus rides to Xerox after school and early on Saturday mornings. "That was a sign of success for us," Mr. Campbell said. "We saw the excitement and enthusiasm they brought to the project."
The rules were simple: each team built its robotic device from a kit consisting of $200 worth of electro-mechanical parts. The sponsoring companies were allowed to use any equipment or personnel to design and build the machines.
 
Interest From the White House
 The concept is gaining credibility in the technology community. Preceding the final round today, a Maize Craze awards dinner here on Thursday night drew 1,200 contestants, teachers, engineers and corporate sponsors and was addressed by Dr. Bromley, the White House adviser. It was also attended by John H. Sununu, the former White House chief of staff; Roland W. Schmitt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Ray Price, the president of the Economic Club of New York.
President Bush stopped in on Wednesday night to endorse USFirst and invite the regional Maize Craze winner to the White House.
The winning team, chosen today, is from Clinton High School of Clinton, Mass., a small town west of Boston, which worked with Nypro Inc., a medical equipment maker in Clinton.

The Universal Instinct
 Virginia Woolf reminds us of the true meanings of many of literature's most famous heroines in a wry piece included in "The Essays of Virginia Woolf: Volume Three, 1919-1924," edited by Andrew McNeillie (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, paper). 

Before the 19th century literature took almost solely the form of soliloquy, not of dialogue. The garrulous sex, against common repute, is not the female but the male; in all the libraries of the world the man is to be heard talking to himself and for the most part about himself. It is true that women afford ground for much speculation and are frequently represented; but it is becoming daily more evident that Lady Macbeth, Cordelia, Ophelia, Clarissa, Dora, Diana, Helen and the rest are by no means what they pretend to be. Some are plainly men in disguise; others represent what men would like to be, or are conscious of not being; or again they embody that dissatisfaction and despair which afflict most people when they reflect upon the sorry condition of the human race. To cast out and incorporate in a person of the opposite sex all that we miss in ourselves and desire in the universe and detest in humanity is a deep and universal instinct on the part both of men and of women.
 
Ghosts of a Vanished World
 The best historians don't simply study the past, they enter into an imaginative dialogue with it, according to the economic historian Carlo M. Ci polla in "Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History" (Norton, paper).
 
Obviously there are historians and historians. The best ones do not confine themselves to providing their audience with a well-documented description of what happened. . . . They also communicate to the reader an appreciation of . . . constraints, a sense of historical perspective and a feeling for the ineffable complexity of human life. They are able to convey a sense of something deeper that defies description, and to people the reader's mind with ghosts of a vanished world -- a world that is indeed a "foreign" country where "they do things differently." In other words, good historians know how to rouse their readers from passivity and to turn them into active participants in the great exploit of evoking the past.
 
Machine Logic
 If you seek for the reason behind the decline in the popularity of pianos in American homes, look, Arthur Loesser suggests, to the rise of the machine age for your answer. This is from "Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History" (Dover, paper).
 
The piano's decline was the 20th-century fate of any object -- or any publication, or performance, or idea -- that cannot be sold quickly to scores of millions of people. Pianos are made by machinery, but they cannot call forth the machines' fuller potentialities. At the height of the reign of technology, only those things that machines can make the fastest and in the greatest quantities can command the fullest respect. Good machines must give way to better, those that make things for a million are thrust aside for those that can produce for a hundred million, while the supplying of mere thousands becomes an act of charity or of eccentric devotion. The logic of the machine, then, colors all sense of values and all ethics of human relations. People acquire not what they might want for themselves, but what machines can most conveniently and profitably make in the largest amounts.
 
Nature From the Inside
 We err, Stephen Budiansky suggests, in treating nature, for better or worse, as if we stood outside it, when we are in fact simply a sentient part of it. This is from "The Covenant of the Wild: Why Animals Chose Domestication" (Morrow).
 
The challenge for society carried ever further from personal acquaintance with nature is to retain a grasp on its place in nature. Yet the tendency of both those who would conquer nature and those who would save it is to draw a line and declare human society ever apart from nature. The Victorians, starry-eyed over steam engines and railroads, saw in nature just another tool. . . . Today's environmentalist, cross-eyed over sulfur-dioxide-belching factories and oozing drums of noxious chemical waste, sees in nature an innocent victim of human greed. . . . The truth, as ecological research struggles so often in vain to tell us, does not admit of any simple lines between that which is man's and that which is wild. The interests of people and other animals do collide; that which is wild and free is not always heroic and beautiful. Man has always been a part of nature, a fact we can ignore now only at the peril of man, animals and the world.
 
 
Buying and Selling Reality
 We have turned religion, and even our sense of reality, into malleable commodities, according to Walter Truett Anderson in "Reality Isn't What It Used to Be" (HarperCollins, paper).
 
Most of us now are not so much believers as possessors of beliefs. Conversion comes easy and often. The seeker after religious faith tries on not one religion, but any number of them. . . . And a dazzling tool kit of contemporary methods . . . is employed to get people to drop this belief, pick up that one, adjust the fit of another.
We all become consumers of reality (although, as in other forms of consumption, not with equal buying power), and greater numbers of us also become creators and merchandisers of reality. As the faith in old absolutes wanes, the season opens on the construction of new realities for those who do not care to be seen in the standard models. In earlier times, the invention of cultural forms was shrouded in mystery; now it becomes, for better or for worse, democratized. Individuals feel free to create new identities for themselves, and entrepreneurs of reality dabble gaily in the creation of new history, new science, new religion, new politics.

Why Politics Is a Lot Like 'Star Search'

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
Whatever happens in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the television encounters of the Democratic hopefuls have already set the terms for the primary season. After a shaky start, the debates -- the fourth of which can be seen tonight at 8 on CNN -- are proving to be the best such efforts the nation has enjoyed or endured.
In a welcome development, NBC, C-Span and PBS barred the audience claques and multimoderators that hobbled their 1988 efforts, and the questioning, especially from the PBS team of Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer on the economy, has been better focused. 
 Future engagements promise to follow that pattern. Tonight's 90-minute debate, the last to be held in New Hampshire, will also concentrate on the economy. ABC will be the host network early in March, by which time the field may have been slightly reduced, and CBS plans to display the survivors after Super Tuesday, March 10.
But the debates have also demonstrated the limitations of even well-conducted sessions in helping voters sort out policies. Each candidate, like an actor who makes a career out of being typecast, is compelled to find an easily recognizable, tube-friendly persona to separate himself from the field.
Beyond a certain point, digging substance out of even the best of the discussions is not easy. In all their get-togethers so far, for example, the five contenders have come out for bigger cuts in the defense budget than proposed by President Bush. Enormous sums have been tossed around. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas says he expects to save $90 billion by the fifth year. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa ups it to $400 billion over 10 years. Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, promises $700 billion over 10 years. Everyone exudes confidence in his own figures. Caught up in the bidding and with no way to measure the realistic possibilities, viewers can only wait for somebody to make it a trillion before Election Day.
There is also enthusiasm for some sort of national health plan. The exchange between Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska on last month's PBS debate brought out a seemingly clear-cut difference in approach: Mr. Kerrey wants the states to manage health care; Mr. Tsongas would entrust the job to private providers operating under Government standards. But that is about as far as they took the subject. Position papers were flashed, but the on-tube exchanges gave the most conscientious viewer little help in discerning the real cost of either proposal or their relative merits or even how they would work.
Other differences have shown up: Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton favor a middle-class tax cut; Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Harkin are against it. Mr. Tsongas emphasizes investment in basic industry; Mr. Harkin would put money into fast job-creators like road building. Real issues all -- but in no case was the viewer given enough information to figure out the pros and cons. Every road seemed to come to a dead end.
That is not meant as a criticism of the moderators or the much-improved formats. The problem is endemic to television and perhaps to debates generally, with their tendency to invite the quotable statement and to discourage the less grabby details. It does not take a professional media manipulator to recognize that the goal in a debate, especially before an audience of millions accustomed to a quick fix in both news and entertainment, is instant impact. Welcome, sound bite.
Recognizing that getting bogged down in the tangles of health care or the vagaries of what everybody now calls industrial policy is a sure way to send viewers to a less demanding channel, the candidates have naturally slid into image-projection. Here is what is coming across.
 
 
Edmund G. Brown Jr.
 Mr. Brown, in his curious way, has been the most successful in setting himself apart from his competitors, perhaps so far apart that he risks seeming like the town kidder. Despite having been around the longest, he comes on as the new-age outsider, determined to drive the money givers from the temple of politics. That spares him and his audience the strain of analyzing specific programs, since all programs are bound to be corrupted in a corrupted system.
Easy though it is to make jokes about Mr. Brown, whose plugs for contributions bring to mind 800-number pitches for anti-establishment tunes from the 1960's, his insurgent image is one that fans of movies and teleplays about politics should have no difficulty recognizing.
 
Bob Kerrey
 Mr. Kerrey has also positioned himself as something of an outsider, only instead of pulling down the pillars of the temple, he would mow down the pillars of Federal bureaucracy. It is a perennially popular role -- no candidate has ever run on his admiration for bureaucrats -- and the Senator is playing into the prevailing disaffection with politics: Mr. Kerrey Has Come to Washington. He is also projecting youth, energy, boldness, qualities that complement the heroism in Vietnam that keeps finding its way into his campaign. As Mr. Clinton has reason to appreciate, television is rarely unkind to war heroes.
 
Tom Harkin
 Mr. Harkin presents himself as a reformer of an older school, a hard-bitten, softhearted populist who would open the temple's coffers to the needy. He sometimes seems to be borrowing his more-compassionate-than-thou lines from a Bill Moyers documentary. Tapping into the old American suspicion of foreigners that has surfaced so dramatically in the past year or two, he has come out against plutocrats abroad as well as fat cats at home.
Every protagonist in a television drama needs a villain or a gang of villains to shoot down, and you can't distinguish yourself among Democrats by riddling Mr. Bush. In case some viewers are put off by the odor of grass-roots radicalism, Mr. Harkin perfumes his presentation with come-together pieties about God and America, which have never lost anyone a vote. If Mr. Kerrey is trying out for James Stewart, Mr. Harkin is playing Henry Fonda.
 
Bill Clinton
 Mr. Clinton is not looking for an argument; stars rarely do, even flickering ones. In the debates, he has been making much of his accomplishments as the governor of a state that has known hard times, competing in the compassion stakes with Mr. Harkin and in the youth-and-energy stakes with Mr. Kerrey, but reinforced by a claim to superior experience at managing things. What can senators know about managing anything, he seems to be asking in his cool way.
Unpleasant rumors aside, if a producer who knows his McLuhan had to choose one of these men as the lead for an election-year mini-series, the handsome, self-possessed, uninflammatory Mr. Clinton, abetted by a personable and supportive wife (the only spouse to receive prime-time attention; thanks, Gennifer Flowers), would probably get the job -- though, yes, a war record wouldn't hurt. As for last month's embarrassing moments, they could of course be a problem; on the other hand, they may add a certain frisson of romance that further sets Mr. Clinton apart from a rather gray group.
 
Paul E. Tsongas
 Romance is not the word that rushes to mind for Mr. Tsongas. Yet this knight of the doleful countenance has managed to position himself in an unorthodox way for a politician in heat. With his admonitory tone, he seems to be playing the tightfisted bookkeeper (Gene Lockhart?) who usually takes a beating from go-get-'em Frank Capra heroes. "I'm not Santa Claus," he announces, and asks an audience accustomed to commercials for pain relievers to swallow the news that his proposals do not promise instant relief. Nor do they lend themselves to 30-second exposition.
Does he really expect anyone to buy a copy of the book he has displayed twice a debate as though acknowledging the hopelessness of making his case to nonreaders? His hope must be that he will emerge as the sleeper of the season, one of the unlikely counterheroes who occasionally win an audience's heart.
 
The Odds
 You don't have to be a cynic to see the candidates as performers, and particularly as television performers. They are already trapped in the roles they have worked so hard to create. Mr. Tsongas, with the most substantive program, has the hardest job; he must turn his implacably uncharismatic manner into an asset. The truth-teller, he has to persuade viewers, is rarely a matinee idol: remember Socrates.
The others are in more conventional modes: the proven executive; the down-home populist; the up-to-date reformer; the indignant outsider. Like other personalities of the tube, they will survive or expire by their images and their ratings, which will reveal at least as much about the people watching the screen as about those who temporarily occupy it.

 BODY:

Gambling in South Dakota
Q. I have heard about a casino in South Dakota called Midnight Star. Can you provide any information about it? -- Berri Blair, Bronxville, N.Y. 
 A. The Midnight Star casino opened on July 3 in Deadwood, the town where James Butler (Wild Bill) Hickok was shot playing poker by (Crooked Nose) Jack McCall. Two of Midnight Star's owners are Kevin Costner and his brother, Dan. The two became involved with the project during the filming of "Dances With Wolves" in South Dakota. Their partners are Carla and Francis Caneva, who owned a women's clothing store, The New York Store, in the building now occupied by the casino.
Legalized gambling came to Deadwood on Nov. 1, 1989. Since then there has been a resurgence of tourism in the town, which has a population of 2,035 and more than 80 casinos.
Other tourist attractions include a re-enactment of the capture and trial of Jack McCall, who was acquitted by a miners' jury for Wild Bill's murder but later rearrested, sentenced and hanged. In Mount Moriah Cemetery, lying side by side, are the graves of Wild Bill and Martha Jane Canary, better known as Calamity Jane.
Wild Bill and Calamity Jane were Deadwood residents in the town's earlier boom days, in 1876, at the height of the Black Hills gold rush.
Today things are tamer. There is a maximum betting cap of $5 on card games. Midnight Star offers blackjack, slot machines and video lottery, with a restaurant and sports bar and grill. The casino, at 677 Main Street, is open 24 hours.
For information on accommodations and restaurants in Deadwood, as well as on the state's other tourist attractions, write to the South Dakota Department of Tourism, 711 Wells Avenue, Pierre, S.D. 57501; (800) 843-1930.
 
Concorde World Trips
 Q. I have read about an around-the-world vacation package on the Concorde. Is it still being offered? -- Kay H. Hazel, Vero Beach, Fla.
A. The trip you have in mind, organized by a Miami travel agent, was run in 1989 and 1990 but was suspended last year because of the Persian Gulf war and this year because of the economic recession. With at least one of those factors behind us there are plans to repeat the event in April 1993.
The 21-day charter, which is limited to 100 people, will originate in London but passengers can also board in New York. From Kennedy International Airport the Concorde will take off for Las Vegas, then go on to Hawaii; Fiji; Auckland, New Zealand, and Cairns, Australia. The next stop is Singapore, followed by Kenya and Luxor, Egypt, then back to London and New York. In Luxor, passengers will take a three-night Nile cruise.
Passengers will stay in first-class hotels and, according to a spokesman for the organizers, in the best rooms. The cost will be between $45,000 and $50,000 per person.
The 1989 trip, which lasted 23 days, was led by William F. Buckley Jr., who provided political and cultural commentary. The former astronaut Frank Borman acted as host of the 1990 trip. Next year's host has not been chosen but is expected to be from the entertainment world.
Reservations can be made through a travel agent or through the organizers, Lorraine Travel, 1001 N.W. 42d Street, Miami, Fla. 33126; telephone (305) 642-1001 or (800) 666-8911.
The same company is also organizing a trip by Concorde this fall around South America. The 13-day trip is scheduled to leave New York on Nov. 27 and call at Caracas, Venezuela; Rio de Janeiro; Buenos Aires; Santiago, Chile, and Guayaquil, Ecuador, returning to New York on Dec. 9.
Passengers will have the option in Ecuador of taking a trip to the Galapagos Islands and returning to New York in first class on a subsonic jet. The trip is expected to cost about $25,000 a person.
 
North Carolina Festival
 Q. What are the dates and location of the modern dance festival held in the summer in North Carolina? And is it more accessible by train or by air? -- Annie B. Coan, Tarrytown, N.Y.
A. The American Dance Festival, one of the premier artistic events of the season, will be held in Durham, N.C., from June 11 to July 25. The performing companies have not yet been announced, but a spokeswoman said the festival, held on the grounds of Duke University, would feature companies from Spain and Central and South America. Such groups as the Paul Taylor Dance Company and Pilobolus Dance Theater have appeared in previous years. Ticket prices will be the same as last year, from $10 to $21.
Single tickets will go on sale in the last week of May and can be ordered by calling the Page Auditorium box office at (919) 684-4444 or writing the American Dance Festival, Post Office Box 6097, College Station, Durham, N.C. 27708.
The most direct way of getting to the festival is by air to Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The festival's official travel agent, C.M.R. Travel, 250 East Hartsdale Avenue, Suite 10, Hartsdale, N.Y. 10530, (914) 472-7676, says it will provide special fares to the festival on American Airlines.
 
Bombay's Weather
 Q. I would appreciate knowing the kind of weather to expect in Bombay in the latter half of February. Can you also advise on "must see" sights there? -- Paul K. Stahnke, McLean, Va.
A. Be prepared for temperatures in the 80's with 70 percent humidity. The average maximum daily temperature in February is 83 degrees; in March it is 86. The average daily minimum temperatures are 67 in February and 72 in March. Early-morning humidity is 71 percent in February and 73 in March. There is little or no rain from November through May.
Bombay is a leading industrial and commercial center but it also has a rich history, and many monuments and other attractions have been preserved. The Gateway of India, one of the last imperial edifices built by the British, is similar in design to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The large arched gateway at the water's edge is best seen at dawn.
An hour's boat ride from the gateway are the Elephant Caves on Elephanta Island. Rock temples were hewn out of one of the two conical hills near the island's center sometime toward the end of the Buddhist period, probably in the eighth century. The outside of the main cave consists of a columned veranda 30 feet wide and 6 feet deep, approached by steps flanked by sculptured elephants. Four rows of massive columns cut into the rock lead to a three-headed sculpture representing Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer. The figure is over 16 feet high.

WHITNEY SHOW
Sol LeWitt, Eva Hesse, Carl Andre and Jonathan Borofsky are among the 14 artists featured in the exhibition at the Whitney Museum in Stamford, titled "Immaterial Objects: Works from the Permanent Collection." 
 The show, which was organized by Richard Marshall, one of the museum's curators and remains on view through April 8, explores areas of art that the public frequently views as incomprehensible or worse.
For example, Mr. LeWitt's "Lines to Points on a Six-Inch Grid," created in 1976, is newly drawn on the wall of whatever museum it inhabits, re-created from the artist's written instructions.
Bruce Nauman's work called "Untitled" (1965-66) assumes a different configuration every time it is dropped on the floor. It is made up of several floppy strips of burlap soaked in latex and connected at one end.
The Whitney is at 1 Champion Plaza, corner of Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard. Visiting hours are 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday and admission is free. Gallery talks are given Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 12:30, free of charge, and free parking is available in the Champion garage on Tresser Boulevard. Call 358-7652 for more information.
 
SPERM WHALES
 "Studying the Living Sperm Whale" is the subject of Dr. Hal Whitehead's lecture on Thursday evening at 8 P.M. in the Imax Theater of the Norwalk Maritime Center, at 10 North Water Street in South Norwalk.
Dr. Whitehead, a professor of biology at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, is the author of "Voyage to the Whales," among many published works. His research on whales, carried on in the West Indies, the Galapagos Islands, the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, provided some of the most comprehensive information on the creatures' social behavior, mating, communication and migration, gathered by swimming with the whales, photographing them and observing a birth.
Previously, information had been based on studies performed on whale carcasses. Dr. Whitehead has been a major force in reducing the killing of whales for research.
Tickets are $9. Call 852-0700, extension 206, for more information or reservations.
 
CHANGING BUSINESS
 The Connecticut Business and Industry Association has scheduled two workshops for companies whose futures are threatened by the loss of defense contracts in the state.
Diversification is perceived to be the solution, and the workshops will offer a practical approach to formulating a new business plan. Information on state and Federal assistance available to defense-dependent companies will be distributed.
Both workshops will be conducted by Ken Wexler, consultant on defense diversification to the State Department of Economic Development. Speakers include Joseph McGee, Commissioner of the department, and Louis Auletta, manager of strategic planning for Bauer Aerospace in Farmington, where diversification has already begun.
The first workshop is scheduled on Wednesday from 8 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at Mohegan Community College in Norwich. The second session, at the same hours, will take place at Mattatuck Community College in Waterbury. The fee is $75. Call 244-1900 for reservations of more information.
 
INDIVIDUAL IN ART
 "Human Conditions," the exhibition on view at the Walsh Gallery of Fairfield University through March 11, contains 20th-century American works focusing on the ordinary individual.
Among the works on display are Paul Cadmus's "Fleet's In," banned by the United States Navy for almost half a century because of its raucous depiction of sailors on shore leave; Isabel Bishop's paintings of working women in lower Manhattan during the 30's and 40's, and Reginald Marsh's earthy scenes of Broadway bars and "The Gaiety Burlesk."
A long list of equally notable artists from the first half of the century includes Jacob Lawrence, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Marsden Hartley and Jared French. Among the more recently created entries are Hugh Steers's paintings that address the AIDS crisis and Abby Shahn's "Salvador" and "Eco-Terror: Baghdad."
Visiting hours at the Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts, the gallery's site, are 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday. Admission is free. For more information call 254-4000, extension 2975.
 
DISSENT IN HISTORY
 A public symposium on "Justice and Its Discontents: Dissent in the Renaissance" will be held at the Whitney Humanities Center, 53 Wall Street, in New Haven, on Friday from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.
The program, which is sponsored by the Yale Journal of Law and the Humanities, the Yale Law School and the Smart Family Foundation, will examine the beginnings of the modern concept of justice, and how changes wrought by dissent redirected the future of literature, the arts, politics and philosophy.
Specific topics under discussion include the conflicts between the individual and the state, religious movements in the context of new notions of justice that tolerated other beliefs, and the early changes in gender role definition and woman's voice in society.
Guido Calabresi, dean of the Yale Law School will moderate a panel of speakers from Dartmouth, Columbia, Rutgers, Northwestern and Yale as well as from the Universities of Alabama, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, Stanford Law School and the University of Virginia School of Law.
Call 432-4037 for more information or to arrange overnight accommodations.
 
AMERICAN HISTORY
 Portraits of Rosa Parks, Ralph Abernathy, A. Philip Randolph, Malcolm X, Roy Wilkins, Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr. are among 22 paintings dealing with the civil rights movement on view at the Museum of American Political Life of the University of Hartford thorugh March 7.
They were painted by Robert Templeton of Woodbury over a 20-year period but never before shown at a museum in his home state. Mr. Templeton died in July.
The show may be seen Tuesday through Saturday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. The museum is at 300 Bloomfield Avenue; admission is $3, $1.50 for children, students and the elderly. Call 243-4090 for more information.

HEADLINE: Talking: Tax Proposals;
All That Glitters Isn't Great

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
THE goodies in the Bush Administration's tax proposals designed for those buying or selling a home appear to offer a windfall. But careful analysis by tax attorneys and real estate consultants suggests the rhetoric may outshine the reality.
The proposed $5,000 tax credit for first-time buyers will probably offer the most help. But other benefits, such as the tax deduction available if a home is sold at a loss, the ability to withdraw IRA money without penalty to buy a first home or even the revival of more favorable capital gains tax rates may have very limited impact. And the proposed changes in passive-loss rules are being so tightly drawn they are likely to affect only full-time developers. 
 Nobody yet knows, of course, if any of these measures will actually become law or how they may be modified. So how to act?
Consider, for example, the $5,000 credit for first-time buyers.
"There's a lot of confusion and misunderstanding out there," said Diane Scalza, a real estate agent with Remax Plus of Babylon, L.I., who specializes in serving first-time buyers. "People think the credit's going to put money in their pockets before they buy the house. But it's not so."
Instead, the measure is available only to someone who actually buys a first home betweenFeb. 1, 1992, and Jan. 1, 1993, providing them with an immediate tax credit equal to 10 percent of the purchase price up to a maximum of $5,000. A first-time buyer is being broadly defined as anyone who hasn't owned a home for three years as well as anyone who has never bought a home.
The credit is limited to $5,000 for each home even when there are multiple buyers. And only $2,500 is available during the year of purchase, with another $2,500 the next year. But since it is a credit and not a deduction it means that the full amount will be subtracted from any taxes due -- not simply a percentage, as happens with a deduction. For instance, if the buyer owes $20,000 in income taxes over the next two years, he or she will have to pay only $15,000.
A sales contract must be signed by the end of this year, although the closing may be delayed into the early months of 1993. So it may mean acting fast. The buyer should therefore be out looking even before the measure is approved.
Julian Block, a tax attorney in Larchmont, N.Y., who has written widely on tax issues as they affect the consumer, suggests that those likely to qualify should get their employers to lower their withholding tax as soon as possible. Employers may refuse to do so until a contract is signed. But even then, the change could still put several hundred extra dollars into the buyer's pocket before the closing date, assuming there was a gap of two months or more between contract and closing.
James A. Sharp, a tax attorney and real estate consultant in the Washington offices of Arthur Anderson, the national accounting firm, further suggested that buyers who barely qualify for a home loanshould look at the extra cash generated by the credit as income enhancement when approaching lenders. The rationale is that after the two-year credit period is over they will probably be earning more anyway. So it should stetch their borrowing power.
"You must mention you are eligible for the credit even if there's nothing said about it on the form," he said.
But a word of caution. The anticipated credit has already spurred developers to capitalize on it in their promotions, offering an immediate $2,000 to $5,000 reduction off the purchase price to be paid back from the extra cash generated by the credit, when it is approved. Buyers should analyze these offers cautiously; the market is still weak and some developers might be willing to provide these incentives without any later payback.
Similar caution should be taken towards the kind of offer being made by Koeppel and Koeppel, New York City landlords. The company has announced it is willing to release from a lease -- free of penalty -- anyone who has been in one of its three Manhattan buildings for at least 10 years. The idea is to help such a tenant buy a first home within the window period.
BUT landlords are normally willing to foster the turnover of long-term tenants in rent-stabilized buildings (and probably would release them from a lease anyway). It affords them a rare opportunity to raise the rent on the unit above the regular limits.
Martin M. Shenkman, a tax attorney in New York City and Teaneck, N.J., said the opportunity to tap IRA funds (up to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple) for a downpayment may be totally irrelevant since most first-time buyers do not have an IRA of any size. Moreover, he said, the proposal is unlikely to free anyone who uses IRA money from paying ordinary income tax on the amount withdrawn, making the withdrawal an expensive way of raising capital.
What the new proposal would eliminate is the normal 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal of any part of a deductible IRA contribution and the interest earned on any contribution. But both principal and interest would still be taxable as ordinary income when they are withdrawn.
The proposed tax deduction available to anyone who must sell a home at a loss -- which many are being forced to do -- may turn out to be even more of a letdown. It is available only to those who sell a home after Jan. 31, 1992. Anyone who sold a house at a loss during 1991 can only "add" that loss to the purchase price of the next home to help reduce any future gain.
ANY tax deduction available right now must also follow casualty loss rules, which means a deductible of 10 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. For many sellers this could immediately slash the eligible amount in half, said Mr. Shenkman. And it is further reduced because for most people -- those in the 30 percent tax bracket -- a deduction is worth only about a third of its size in actual dollars saved.
Even worse, these experts warn, most sellers have probably deferred taxable gains from profits made on previous homes and thus will not actually have a taxable loss.
Say, for example, a couple bought a home in 1980 for $80,000 and sold it in 1986 for $110,000, for a $30,000 profit. If they had immediately bought another home equal to the sale price of $110,000 or more they could have deferred paying tax on the $30,000 gain.
Say, also, that the next home they bought in 1986 cost them $130,000 but that they could get only $110,000 for it in 1992. They would still be carrying a $10,000 gain, not a $20,000 loss ($130,000 less $110,000 plus $30,000).
Only someone in a high income bracket who bought a first home worth $500,000 or more in the mid 1980's and must now take a substantial loss is likely to benefit, said Mr. Shenkman. Moreover, anyone selling at a loss is probably doing so because he can no longer afford the home, having been laid off or because business has floundered.
"So there won't be much income to offset," added Mr. Sharp.
And corporate transferees will probably have been made whole by their company.
By contrast, the proposed reduction in the capital-gains tax may have more substantial impact, especially for the many smaller investors who still have a rental property or two they have been eager to sell, said Mr. Sharp.
He said it should lower the tax due on any profits -- although not to levels available before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. For another, he said, the market for starter homes, which includes many investor-owned condminium units, could be strong this year since it should attract first-time buyers eligible for the tax credits who also need to buy at a time of low interest rates.
"So it could be a great time to sell," he said.
THE benefits inherent in the proposed changes in the passive loss rules, however, will limited to a privileged few.
Albert Bialeck, president of Albert Bialeck Associates, real estate consultants in Manhattan, noted that the express intent is to exclude the lay dabbler, like the limited partner, who benefited so widely from passive losses before 1986.
The changes, he said, are intended to help professional developers offset losses from current construction with income from mature projects. But this could have positive results for the economy, said Mr. Bialeck, because it may enourage lenders to get back into the construction market, albeit with residential rather than the commercial projects, since the office market is still heavily overbuilt.

Master Antenna vs. Cable
 
Question: I moved into a building two years ago and found to my happy surprise that there was a hookup to the building's television antenna, which provided me with clear reception. About two weeks ago my reception very suddenly became terrible. Two days later a letter from Paragon Cable arrived describing the advantages of cable service. The superintendent of the building and cable installers on the street have told me that tenants in my building have been disengaged from the antenna because the building is being made cable-ready. It would seem that I now have two choices; pay for cable service or suffer with a barely visible picture. Is there any reason why I should not be reconnected to the antenna if I am content with network offerings? . . . Debra Victoff, Manhattan 

Answer: Probably not. New York State executive law sec. 828.3 says, in part, that cable companies may not interfere with the master antenna on a building. Edward Kearse, a spokesman for the New York State Commission on Cable Television, said that while the companies that serve the city now have crews in the field upgrading service, the removal of any master antennas in the process would violate the laws that regulate the industry.
"Landlords are not obligated to provide antennas," said Mr. Kearse, "and can remove them at any time. But they cannot profit from installation or improvement in cable service. So there should be no incentive for the landlord to remove an existing antenna."
If you believe the law was broken you can write to Ann Dalton, director of the Office of Consumer Complaints, at the New York State Commission on Cable Television, Corning Tower, 21 Empire State Plaza, Albany, N.Y. 12223. You can also call the toll-free complaint number: (800) 342-3330.
 
Cutting Doorman Service
 
Question: I am on the board of a co-op. Due to increased operating costs that forced us to increase maintenance charges, several shareholders have suggested we cut down on our 24-hour doorman service. Prior to conversion there were doormen on two shifts from 4 P.M. until 8 A.M. For the last five years we have had the 24-hour service. But there are several rent-regulated tenants in the building and our managing agent has told us that they could demand reduced rent if we decrease the doorman service. Do we have the right to decrease the service? . . . Angie Cunningham, Manhattan
 
Answer: Maybe. According to Joseph D'Agosta, an assistant commissioner in the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the service to which any rent-regulated tenant is entitled depends on what was provided on the base date in their lease. If the doorman service in your building was not expanded until after the conversion, then the co-op's obligation would be to maintain the level provided to any tenant before the conversion.
An exception would be if any tenant were offered a rent-stabilized lease after the service was extended.
From a practical standpoint this would be unlikely because holders of unsold shares have no obligation to offer leases after the conversion to a co-op or condominium.
Mr. D'Agosta suggested that if your co-op board decides to reduce service it file an application for a ruling from the state housing agency before proceeding, to make sure the rights of tenants are not violated.
 
Co-op Board Election
 
Question: I am a board member of a co-op in which the sponsor owns 52 percent of the shares. The sponsor's obligation to relinquish control of the board will occur next September. Since that date is seven months before the corporation's annual shareholders' meeting, shouldn't there be a board election before then to reflect this change in status? . . . Carolyn Horsman, Brooklyn
 
Answer: Yes. According to Richard Barr, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office, it is the sponsor's responsibility to schedule such an election as soon as possible after control of the board is relinquished.

Stamford May Ask Tax-Exempts for Help

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
NEXT May, Stamford will start asking owners of tax-exempt property -- hospitals, churches, private schools and other institutions -- to help pay for city services to reduce budget deficits.
The voluntary plan is based on one that has operated for 10 years in Portland, Me., where last year's collection totaled $575,000. Boston's program, in place since 1977, took in $10 million in 1991. 
 A resolution to be voted on March 2 by the Stamford Board of Representatives states that the taxpayers are concerned about the reduction of services. To help provide police, fire and public works services, ease cutbacks and alleviate the burden on taxpayers, all individuals, corporations and associations with tax-exempt property will be asked to make an annual voluntary contribution of 5 percent of the taxes they would owe if they were not tax-exempt.
The measure was introduced by Robert DeLuca, a Republican from the 14th District. "I first made the proposal two years ago," he said. "The board laughed at me."
This time it was no joke. The resolution is expected to pass without dissent.
"I don't think there is any problem in requesting nonprofit agencies that receive a tax abatement and city services -- that enjoy preferential treatment which profit-making agencies do not -- if they are willing to contribute in these tough economic times," said Richard L. Lyons, a Democrat who is president of the board.
"We have a deficit of $7.12 million, our welfare caseload has doubled to 1,169, and our tax delinquencies are up to approximately $11 million. If we receive $50,000 it will help."
Almost $750 million of the city's $5.5 billion worth of property is tax-exempt.
After the budget is adopted in May, the tax assessor will send out letters apprising some 150 nonprofit agencies of the new policy. The letters will include a computation of the suggested contribution. According to Daniel McCabe, the city attorney, "there is no legal barrier, so why not try it?"
David Anderson, president of the Stamford Partnership, an association of downtown businesses, welcomed the proposal.
"Anything to keep taxes down," he said. "Nonprofits get their funds from a variety of sources, often from outside the community, so to some extent it would be new money, not necessarily out of the local economy."
But the institutions that would have to pay are skeptical. "We rendered $12 million worth of free care last year," said Patrick A. Colangelo, vice president of finance for Stamford Hospital. That's 8 percent of our business."
The hospital pays $57,000 a year in taxes on property it bought for housing its employees. "We could probably have that property declared tax-exempt, but it's our gift to the city," he said, adding that the hospital's 5 percent could be as much as $25,000.
New Neighborhoods, a nonprofit housing development agency, would have to charge higher rents to its low-income tenants to make a contribution, said its director, Howard Quinn. He has written to the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Hartford to determine whether his organization would be allowed to pay money in lieu of taxes because of its Federal mortgage.
One City Hall worker who requested anonymity said, "It will all come out of our pockets. They will ask for another $20 a week at church, or raise the dues at the "Y," or the tuition at your kid's school."
In Maine, Anita LaChance, the adminstrator of Portland's program, said, "this affects hub cities, where social services and low income and elderly housing, arts institutions and churches want to be." Some 25 percent of Portland's real estate is tax-exempt and most organizations pay nothing. Among the larger contributors-in-lieu-of-taxes are Blue Cross-Blue Shield, which gave $80,000 last year, and Regional Waste Systems, with $357,000.
PORTLAND and Boston make their expectations clear to incoming nonprofit groups. "We encourage new facilities to emulate those already paying," said Lee Jackson, Boston's treasurer. Of the city's $30 billion in real estate, 51 percent is tax-exempt. "Massachusetts General Hospital pays $487,000," he said, "Blue Cross-Blue Shield pays $500,000 and the Museum of Fine Arts' parking structure $22,000."
Brian Rogoz, vice president of finance at St. Joseph's Hospital in Stamford, said, "We would be glad to pay, if we were able to collect our portion of uncompensated care. The state reimburses at 50 cents on the dollar for indigent patients, but it doesn't begin to cover costs. The balance has to be passed on to another payer -- insurance carriers."
Some individual members of the community were also critical. Brenda Lewis, acting president of the 200-member Cove East-Side Neighborhood Coalition, a homeowners group, said, "I would prefer reducing the 70 percent of budget that we pay in labor costs."
And Samuel Kahn, president of the North Stamford Association of 1,000 homeowners, said, "It's well intentioned, but I suspect there is not much potential."
In anticipation of the May mailing, Frank Kerwin, the city tax assessor, has been identifying tax-exempt properties and calculating their contributions. King and Low-Heywood Thomas School, a private institution founded in 1865, sits on 35 acres. Tuition costs $5,000 to $10,000 from pre-kindergarten through Grade 12. Its tax would be $201,290 and its contribution $10,140. "The board of trustees would make the decision, and there has not been much discussion," said Karen Peterson, the school's business manager.
A request of $9,960 would be made of the Y.M.C.A. The Stamford Center for the Arts would be asked to pay $6,730 and the Jewish Community Center, $10,140.
At St. Leo's Roman Catholic Church on Roxbury Road, Msgr. Benedict Tighe reminisced about the 60's at Mount Saviour Monastery in the tiny town of Pine City, N.Y., near Elmira. "We had 1,100 acres and we were encouraged by the Bishop of Rochester to pay something voluntarily to help the town," he said.
His church will be asked to contribute $2,400 to Stamford. "We would have to have discussions among the diocesan priests and go through the parish finance board to be figured into the next budget," Monsignor Tighe said. "I am inclined to say a cautious yes."

HEADLINE: For Some Seeking Presidency, Winning Isn't the Only Thing

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE is an out-of-work commercial pilot from Brick Township. Another is a Rahway homemaker. A third is a general contractor from Manahawkin, and a fourth is in a Kansas prison, serving time for murder.
What the four share is a mission: to be elected President of the United States this fall. Though two are registered as candidates with the Federal Election Commission and two are on the ballot for the New Hamphsire primary on Tuesday, their campaigns bear little resemblance to those of the major party candidates. 
 There are no high-powered media consultants, no private jets, no gala fund-raisers, no packed press buses for these candidates. Their campaign literature, what there is of it, tends to be painstakingly typed and copied at the local print shop, or laid out on home computers. They drive old cars and stay in inexpensive motels.
And even they would agree that their chances of winning are slim to none.
 
From the Adept to the Naive
 Not since the second-term victories of Woodrow Wilson, a former New Jersey Governor, in 1916 or Grover Cleveland, a Caldwell native, in 1892 has New Jersey produced a successful candidate for President. But there have always been the little-known Presidential hopefuls, ranging from the politically adept to the naive, from college professors to local gadflies, and this year is no different.
Campaigning by such candidates, political scientists agree, is a relatively harmless and wholly American practice. "Of course, in certain countries you can get shot for this," said Ross K. Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University. "I don't think this sort of thing is encouraged in Iraq, for example. So it is to this nation's credit that we allow this."
Why four New Jerseyans have decided to challenge the odds is a matter of conjecture. Jonathan Krasno, assistant professor of politics at Princeton University, said part of the explanation might lie in New Jersey's proximity to New York, the center of communications in the country.
 
'In the Middle of Things'
 "If you were sitting in a farmhouse in Kansas, it would seem completely unrealistic to decide to run for President to get your message across," Mr. Krasno said. "Here, we're more in the middle of things, and you can see how you could work it."
Professor Baker saw other factorsat work: the "incredible high of seeing your name" posted on the national ballot, matched with a fierce determination to get views across. "Most of them are probably people who are very earnest and committed to a certain cause," he said. But a lack of any major financing or party support, he said, can take its toll. "There's just something a little forlorn about it."
Contrary to conventional wisdom, getting a campaign under way is a relatively simple matter.
A letter to the Federal Election Commission is all it takes to become a candidate, though all candidates are not eligible to hold office even if elected, for a variety of reasons ranging from being underage or having been convicted of a felony. But after a candidate raises $5,000, the process gets more complicated, with legal requirements for financial disclosure and the like.
A more costly alternative for a candidate intent on seeking a major party nomination involves filing as for that party's primary in a particular state. The registration fee for the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, for example, is $1,000.
Officials at the Federal Election Commission say the number of lesser-known candidates has remained fairly constant over the years. "We usually get over 200 of these candidates," said Fred Eiland, a spokesman for the commission. "Since there is no filing deadline, these applications just keep trickling in."
But a check of the ballots for the New Hampshire primary in recent years shows a marked growth in interest among candidates of all stripes. There were 12 Presidential contenders -- seven Republicans and five Democrats -- in 1980, 27 in 1984, 37 in 1988 and no fewer than 62 in Tuesday's primary.
 
From the Cockpit To the Primary
 Before running for President, Vincent Latchford of Brick Township was a pilot for Eastern Airlines for 24 years until he lost his job as a result of a long strike that began in March 1989, He said his public speeches had been confined to the cockpit. "You know, 'We are now flying over Ohio, that's Cleveland to your left' -- that kind of thing," he said.
Prompted by the Eastern pilots' encouragement of political candidacies in 1990 and 1992 as a way of calling attention to their situation, Mr. Latchford has jumped into public life.
His platform is based on ridding the Government of the fraud and mismanagement he says he saw within the airline industry and in the Federal agencies that oversee it. At the same time, Mr. Latchford has issued a challenge to the man he feels could have rescued the airline industry -- George Bush.
"For two years, he knowingly permitted violations of Federal law to continue, involving misappropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars from a public corporation and endangerment of the lives of tens of thousands of American citizens," reads one of the two fliers Mr. Latchford has produced since he registered for the New Hampshire primary.
 
Several Campaign Swings
 Mr. Latchford, a 54-year-old Republican, said he had already made several campaign swings through New Hampshire in his 1982 Chevrolet. He was enjoying the attention that having his name on the ballot has given him, he said. "I've been invited to speak at a bunch of schools and university forums," he said.
Mr. Latchford's wife, Lois, a high school teacher and administrator who is also out of work, has been helping her husband's campaign. The couple have four children, two in college and two in high,
Also trying to round up support for the New Jersey primary in June, Mr. Latchford has so far found running for President to be fairly rewarding, despite the fact that some of his previous supporters backed away when it came to the actual work of campaigning.
"I very nearly didn't do this," he said. "My friends had a lot of enthusiasm at first, pats on the back, etc. But then when I filed, I think people just didn't believe it -- and by the time they come around to actually believing I'm running for President, the primaries will be over."
He is also realistic about his prospects: at worst, he hopes he will get to talk to a few people. "At best, I really hope my going to New Hampshire would kick off a sympathetic wave in other states on this issue," he said. He also talks on education and taxation. "It's got to do some good," he said.
 
Homemaker Wants "To Go to the Top"
Over in the Democratic primary, Rose Zeidwerg Monyek of Rahway has been pushing for support on a platform of "jobs, jobs, jobs." Her reason for running is simple, said Mrs. Monyek, who describes herself as a "housewife who's been running for office since college."
"Senior citizens should be the watchdogs of society, instead of political pawns," she said. "And since you can't change things from the bottom, you have to go to the top."
Although campaigning for President is something new, Mrs. Monyek, 62 years old, is no stranger to the political process. A native of Montclair and graduate of the Elizabeth schools system, she ran against an incumbent Representative, Matthew Rinaldo, Republican of Union, for Congress in 1980, tried for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1981 and sought the party nomination for United States Senator in 1982.
As a perennial candidate, Mrs. Monyek, who isa widowed mother of three, could be expected to have built up something of a following. But some of her local efforts have been against the very people who could best assist a dark-horse campaign for the Presidency. Her most recent election efforts have been a rather personal series of challenges to the same candidate, State Senator Raymond Lesniak of Elizabeth, who has just been named chairman of the state Democratic Party.
 
Created Independent Party
 Mrs. Monyek's campaigns have also brought problems with election officials, especially after she created an independent party that referred to "the unethical incumbent" by name, a practice she was promptly ordered to halt. Her most recent try, in the 1991 State Senate primary, ended when she was found to have fewer than the 100 signatures needed to qualify.
So far, things have been quieter in New Hampshire, where she is trying to rub elbows with the national candidates. "I feel I'm as qualified as many of these guys," she said. "They talk like they know what they're doing, but it's like they're reading the newspaper upside down."
Having never been elected to office, Mrs. Monyek admitted that winning this time would be a bit of a long shot. "It would be nice, wouldn't it?" she said. "I think people are ready for a woman President. But are they ready for a Jewish woman President?"
 
Contractor's Plan To Distribute Money
 Running for President is old hat to Lester F. Byerley of Manahawkin, who is in the midst of his third campaign. Using his home as campaign headquarters and equipped with a limited number of videotaped campaign statements, Mr. Byerley, a Democrat, is avoiding the primary route to stage a low-profile campaign based on the slogan "America Can't Wait."
Although he has never held elected office, he offers a legislative package to rival a State of the Union address. The cornerstone of his platform is a plan to revive the national economy by printing and distributing $15,000 in spending money to each American citizen earning less than $80,000.
While the plan may seem like a new idea, Mr. Byerley gives credit where credit is due. "This program in a way is similar to the Roosevelt era, where he printed up new money to subsidize the banking industry," he said. "We will also be subsidizing the banking industry, but this time through the hands of the American people."
Nor would receipt of this "seed money" be limited to consumers over the age of 18.
 
'Refinancing of America'
 "Every newborn American should be able to participate in such a revenue share," said Mr. Byerley, who suggests that each $15,000 payment be deposited in a trust fund until the child reaches legal age, again assisting the banking industry. This "refinancing of America" would pay for the rest of his programs, which include an anticrime package and an ambitious program to explore alternative energy sources.
Mr. Byerley, a 47-year-old general contractor, also has a plan to revise the Social Security system. "Everyone will pay into the program at the present rate, but money will only be paid out to retirees with personal yearly incomes under $60,000," he said.
Mr. Byerley and his wife, Lynn, have eight children in their household, some of whom are from previous marriages. Mr. Byerley would push for the creation of new home-based service industries for women or men raising families. "It would be part-time employment based on a pyramid growth, which would end the need for welfare, food stamps and other subsistence programs," he said.
While very serious about his campaign, Mr. Byerley said this would be his last press interview. "Since the free press ignored me during the previous campaigns, I will now ignore them," he said. Instead, he has hit on a strategy he hopes will take him straight to the voters: he plans to set up a money-making Byerley "900" line that supporters could call to hear his stand on a different issue each week.
 
A Platform Emerges From a Prison Cell
 Jouett E. Arney is flatly ineligible to hold national office, or even to vote. Convicted in 1973 in a one-night crime spree in the Midwest, Mr. Arney is in Kansas serving four concurrent sentences on murder, kidnapping and assault charges, although he has maintained his innocence from the start.
Running on the ticket of the Freedom of Choice Party, which is based in Jersey City, Mr. Arney, 59, registered as a Presidential candidate early last year. His platform contains planks supporting term limits for members of Congress, lifting of farm subsidies, prison reform aimed at mandatory education or labor, and a detailed ethics-in-government package.
In addition to disconcerting prison officials at the Kansas State Department of Corrections, who said they had never heard of a convicted murderer's running for President, Mr. Arney surprised his wife, Rose M. Arney, who lives in Jersey City.
"I was shocked when he told me he would run," said Mrs. Arney, who is registered with the election commission as chairwoman and campaign treasurer of the Committee to Elect Jouett Arney President. "But he told me this was the one way to maybe touch one heart in the whole United States about the injustice that has been done to him."
 
Lawsuit on Prison Conditions
 A successful jailhouse lawyer, Mr. Arney filed a lawsuit more than a decade ago that eventually resulted in major improvements to the prison complex and hospital. Alleging overcrowding and indequate conditions, Mr. Arney, a high school dropout, typed his lawsuit papers on a broken-down typewriter, similar to the one he now uses to tap out his campaign platform.
"You might ask yourself, what is this guy talking about that has not been said already?" Mr. Arney wrote as part of platform. "What can he bring before the American people? But I have suffered through 19 years of injustice, and dealt with some mighty big crooks."
Mr. Arneyncludes within his general political platform more detailed data about his conviction for a murder in Kansas despite an alibi placing him in another state.
"Anyone thinking a prisoner has a chance at such office while incarcerated must be joking," Mr. Arney wrote. "I do, however, assure you I am genuine in this endeavor."

HEADLINE: Attacking Habits To Battle Pollution

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
ABOUT a fourth of the county's car owners change their own motor oil to save money. The bad news is that most of those economy-minded people pour the used motor oil into the nearest storm drain, polluting nearby ground water.
A chapter of the League of Women Voters in Westchester is determined to change the out-of-sight-out-of-mind mentality that has contributed nearly 80 percent of the oil pollution in the Hudson River by using a grant from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
 The grant, which will focus on household hazardous waste, is one of 18 that the Federal agency has awarded to league chapters nationwide to teach people about preventing ground-water pollution. Life-style pollution, or that contributed by sources other than industry and municipal sewage treatment-plants, accounts for 50 percent of ground-water contamination, agency officials have estimated.
"There is so much environmental bad news, we wanted to give people something they could do," Daria Gregg, project manager for the league chapter, said in a recent radio interview describing the program. Noting the publicity outlining New York City's effort to protect its watershed, Ms. Gregg said that "technology won't fix these things; a change of behavior will fix these things."
 
Traveling Road Show
 The Briarcliff, Ossining, Croton and Cortlandt chapter of the League of Women Voters is using its $4,500 grant to create a traveling road show, using workable models to describe what members call "the secret underground water world" under Westchester and to outline ways in which ordinary citizens can become part of the pollution solution to stop its contamination by making simple changes in their everyday lives.
Among other tips, league members advise motorists to take used motor oil to the nearest gas station for recycling. Under the law, gas stations that perform 500 or more oil changes yearly must accept the used motor oil, which can be reused as a lubricant.
Other commonly misused products contributing to ground-water contamination, Ms. Gregg said, include dishwasher detergents, which commonly contain phosphates. Phosphates contribute to algae growth in water. A number of phosphate-free alternatives exist, Ms. Gregg said, but consumers must ask supermarket owners to carry them.
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation recently banned additional phosphate discharges into reservoirs, imposing new regulations governing phosphate discharges from sewage-treatment plants.
Consumer ignorance is all that is preventing the purchase of well-known exterior paints that don't contain mercury, Ms. Gregg said. Mercury, a toxin that most notably poisons fish and could, at higher levels, presumably poison humans, evaporates into the atmosphere and returns in rain. It has increased pollution significantly, Ms. Gregg said, adding "people don't realize that a number of big-name exterior paints are available without mercury."
 
Brochures Are Available
 Among other materials, the league has produced several brochures with additional information about control of ground-water pollution, including reference guides to domestic wells and septic systems and individual guides to the water systems of the four communities that the league chapter represents.
The guides contain do's and don'ts for consumers, including proper disposition of leftover household chemicals. Consumers wanting to follow proper procedures must stay abreast of county collection days. That system, now being reviewed by county officials, has set aside certain days during the year for collection. For more information about the new schedule, call the county at 285-6143.
Displays related to the ground-water program of the League of Women voters will be on view in libraries and malls throughout the four-town area through June when they will be available to other organizations in the county. For more information, contact Ms. Gregg at 762-1316.
In a related development, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency recently recognized the county's efforts to insure that local industries safely discharge into the county's sewer system. The industrial pretreatment program of the Department of Environmental Facilities was recently chosen from among 50 such programs in the state to receive the agency's Outstanding Pretreatment Award.

HEADLINE: Proposed Legislative Lines Provoke Complaints

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IF newly drawn legislative districts take effect statewide next year as proposed, Mount Vernon will be represented in Albany by two state senators and three assemblymen -- an excess of riches, some in that city say; a key to disenfranchisement, others say.
Mount Vernon, whose 67,000 residents packed into 4.2 square miles make it the ninth most densely populated city in the United States, has a large minority population. This means it is a key element in the creation of federally inspired minority districts, or those designed to make it possible and even likely for a minority candidate to win. 
 Two such districts, one in each chamber of the State Legislature, have been proposed -- one contained within Westchester and another extending outside the county -- by the State Legislative Task Force on Demographic Research and Reapportionment. Last week, its members came here to hear comments, and they got an earful.
 
District Starts in the Bronx
 David A. Ford, the Mount Vernon Democratic leader and one of several black elected officials to speak, said that while the so-called minority districts created by the task force might be statistically correct -- the proposed Senate seat has an 81 percent minority population and the Assembly District a 64 percent minority population -- Mount Vernon's representation in each case is small, even negligible.
The Senate minority district, the 33d, is essentially a Bronx seat that begins at Third Avenue in the southern portion of that borough and extends into Mount Vernon's largely black south side. Mr. Ford said Mount Vernon represents "just 12 percent of that district; without Mount Vernon they would have 75 percent minorities, so they didn't need our population at all."
With his city "just an attachment to what is essentially a Bronx district, the elected Senator will be keyed to the people who put him or her in office, disenfranchising us," Mr. Ford said.
 
Horseshoe-Shaped Corridor
 "We have similar problems and needs as the Bronx, but they are not the same," he added. "When the money comes down, the district's representative in Albany will be paying attention to Bronx constituents, not us."
A second Senatorial District, the 34th, now held by Senator Guy J. Velella, a Republican, is also based essentially in the Bronx. It reaches into Westchester to include parts of east Yonkers, north Mount Vernon, western New Rochelle and the town of Pelham in a horseshoe-shaped corridor that surrounds the south Mount Vernon neighborhoods in the 33d District.
In the Assembly, the new minority district, the 84th, is entirely within Westchester, ranging along its southern border from Yonkers' predominantly black southwest sector to Mount Vernon's south side, also predominantly black. According to the task force's experts, the split is 64 percent black and Hispanic and 33 percent white.
But Mr. Ford said that 70 percent of the new district is in Yonkers, "which means that a Yonkers Assemblyperson would not have to pay much attention to Mount Vernon." He submitted a revised proposal for a minority district, one that would be "divided more equally between the two cities."
He noted further that Mount Vernon, despite its small size, had been divided into three Assembly Districts, further dissipating its political strength. With Mount Vernon making up the smallest part of each district, Mr. Ford said, "it means we'd be a city with three representatives who don't have to pay attention to us."
Mount Vernon's black Republicans looked at the situation differently. Charles Smith, a member of the Republican City Committee, supported the task force's proposed lines, saying that Mount Vernon's problems had more in common with the Bronx than they did with the wealthier suburbs of Westchester.
But Ernest D. Davis, a Democrat who represents Mount Vernon on the County Board of Legislators, said, "The only thing we have in common with the Bronx portion of the Senate minority district is the melanin in our skin." As for the Assembly minority district, he supported the revised version, which is divided equally with Yonkers and "where we have two Assemblymen instead of three."
Sheila Morris, speaking for the Black Women's Political Caucus in Westchester, said that "except for minor changes, we're in favor of the new districts as they've been drawn."
Winston A. Ross, who heads the county's regional office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, questioned whether "African-American and Hispanic strength had been improved by the process."
 
Less Influence in Albany Seen
 Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood of Mount Vernon, a Democrat, said the minority districts had been created "at the expense of Mount Vernonites." He said the city's representation in Albany will be diluted, producing "the reverse of what is intended by the Voting Rights Act."
Although Mount Vernon's complaints dominated the task force hearing on Monday in White Plains, it was not the only source of disagreement. Speakers raised objections to dramatic changes in district lines, sometimes made to help incumbents of the controlling party or to weaken those representing minority parties.
For example, the Democrats running the Assembly placed two experienced Republican incumbents, Peter M. Sullivan of White Plains, now representing the 87th District in central Westchester, and Henry W. Barnett of the 89th District in north-central Westchester, in a single new 89th District, which reaches south from the Putnam County border as far as New Rochelle.
Both men have indicated their interest in seeking re-election. Mr. Barnett said: "I was not very happy with the fact that Sullivan came running out of the gate saying he's the guy for the district. It was unnecessary because these lines won't be the final version."
Mr. Sullivan had said he "did not plan to retire until the people want me to."
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Greenburgh, saw his district shifted northward, losing the foothold in northern Yonkers that enabled him to negotiate on the city's behalf through the years of political and economic strife in the sprawling city.
 
Eye on County Executive Post
 At the other end, Mr. Brodsky picked up the heavily Republican town of Mount Pleasant, formerly part of Mr. Sullivan's district. Mr. Brodsky is interested in running again for the County Executive position that Andrew P. O'Rourke, a Republican, will vacate if his proposed Federal judgeship is confirmed by the United States Senate.
Assemblyman Gregory P. Young, a Democrat whose 88th District includes Mount Vernon, the town of Pelham and 30,000 of New Rochelle's 70,000 residents, finds himself seeking new voters in an elongated district stretching from northeast Mount Vernon, through Pelham Manor, Eastchester and Scarsdale to the southern half of White Plains.
He said he will be "picking up 87,000 new people" in a district of 120,000.
Assemblywoman Cecile D. Singer, whose 84th District includes Eastchester, Scarsdale and parts of Yonkers and White Plains, will defend a newly created 87th District that is mostly in Yonkers but includes northwest Mount Vernon.
 
New Putnam County District
 Assemblyman Vincent L. Leibell, a Republican whose 90th District now includes North Salem, Pound Ridge and Lewisboro as well as central and eastern Putnam County, finds himself in a new 91st District that is entirely within Putnam County.
Assemblyman George E. Pataki, a Republican who has also indicated an interest in Mr. O'Rourke's job, seems to have benefited from the redistricting despite its Democratic authorship, with a new district entirely within Westchester. Mr. Pataki's current district, the 91st, includes communities in four counties: Rockland, Dutchess, Putnam and Westchester. His new 90th would add Yorktown and Ossining to the town of Cortlandt and the city of Peekskill, communities he already represents.
Little changed is Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci's Long Island Sound district, with the Democrat adding Pelham and New Rochelle's north end to the 85th District he already represents, which includes the rest of New Rochelle and the towns of Rye and Mamaroneck.
On the Senate side, the Republicans who control that chamber gave Suzi Oppenheimer, a Democrat, a major challenge by removing south Mount Vernon, a Democratic stronghold, from her new 36th District, as well as Eastchester, while adding the towns of Ossining, North Castle and Mount Pleasant, all mostly Republican.
 
Plan Due by End of the Month
 Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican, will find only minor changes in his 35th District, losing Mount Pleasant but gaining Eastchester. Senator Mary B. Goodhue will spend more time visiting her constituents, which range into Dutchess County in an extended 37th District. Previously, her district extended only through Putnam County. She loses Ossining, North Castle and Mount Pleasant.
The task force will complete its hearings this week, make revisions and submit a final reapportionment plan to the Legislature by the end of this month, wait for the Governor's action and then submit the approved plan to the Federal Justice Department for approval of the minority districts.
Candidates for State Senate and Assembly will run in the new districts this fall.

HEADLINE: When Men Hit Women

BYLINE: BY JAN HOFFMAN; Jan Hoffman, a staff writer for The Village Voice, recently completed a journalism fellowship at Yale Law School.

 BODY:
His Saturday night shift has been excruciatingly dull for the police in Duluth, Minn., a brawny working-class city of 90,000 on the shoreline of Lake Superior. The complaints trickle into the precinct, the callers almost embarrassed: black bear up a tree; kids throwing stuffed animals into traffic. But it's 1 A.M. now, and the bars are closing. People are heading home.
1:02 A.M.: Couple arguing loudly. Probably just "verbal assault," the dispatcher tells the car patrols. 
 1:06 A.M.: Two squad cars pull up to the address. A tall blond man opens the door as a naked woman hurriedly slips on a raincoat. The man looks calm. The woman looks anything but.
"We were just having a squabble," he begins.
"He was kicking the crap out of me," she yells.
"Let's go in separate rooms and talk," says one of the officers, following the Duluth Police Department procedure for domestic disputes.
In the living room, George G. tells his side of the story. "We've been trying to work on things. And so we were talking. And wrestling."
How does he explain the blood oozing from the inside of her mouth? "She drinks, you know. She probably cut herself." From inside the bedroom, Jenny M., whose face is puffing up, screams: "Just get him out of here! And then you guys leave, too!"
The police officers probe for details, telling her that something must be done now, or there will probably be a next time, and it will hurt much worse. Jenny M. glares, fearful but furious. "He slapped me and kicked my butt. He picked me up by the hair and threw me against the wall."
"She lies, you know," George G. confides to an officer, who remains stone-faced. Jenny M. starts crying again. "I don't want him hurt. This is my fault. I'm the drinker. He's not a bad guy."
Following protocol, the officers determine that the couple live together. And that she is afraid of him. Next, they snap Polaroids of her bruised face, and of his swollen, cut knuckles. Then the police head toward George G. with handcuffs. He looks at her beseechingly. "Jenny, do you want me to go?"
An officer cuts him short. "George, it's not her choice."
George G. thrusts his chin out and his fists deep into the couch. "But this is just a domestic fight!"
One cop replies: "We don't have a choice, either. We have to arrest you." They take him away, handcuffed, leaving Jenny M. with leaflets about the city's Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (D.A.I.P.).
By 1:34 A.M. George G. has been booked at the St. Louis County jail, where he will sit out the weekend until arraignment on Monday morning. Within an hour, a volunteer from the city's shelter will try to contact Jenny M., and in the morning, a man from D.A.I.P. will visit George and explain the consequences in Duluth for getting into "a domestic fight."
IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO THIS SUMMER THAT Duluth became the first local jurisdiction in America to adopt a mandatory arrest policy for misdemeanor assaults -- the criminal charge filed in most domestic violence cases. But the arrest policy alone is not what makes Duluth's perhaps the most imitated intervention program in the country. Its purpose is to make every agent of the justice system -- police, prosecutors, probation officers, judges -- deliver the same message: domestic violence is a crime that a community will not tolerate. The program's centerpiece is D.A.I.P., which acts as a constant, heckling monitor of all the organizations. The project, which also runs batterers' groups and supervises custody visits between batterers and their children, chugs along on $162,000 a year. Financing comes from the state's Department of Corrections, foundation grants and fees for D.A.I.P.'s manuals and training seminars.
The Duluth model -- pieces of which have been replicated in communities throughout Minnesota, in cities like Los Angeles, Baltimore, San Francisco, Nashville and Seattle, and in countries like Canada, Scotland, New Zealand and Australia -- has been admiringly described by Mary Haviland, a New York City domestic-abuse expert, as "an organizing miracle."
Typically, a first-time offender is incarcerated overnight. If he pleads guilty, he'll be sentenced to 30 days in jail and put on probation, pending completion of a 26-week batterer's program. If he misses three successive classes, he is often sent to jail. Men who are served with civil orders of protection are routinely sent into the same treatment program. Staff members and volunteers from the shelter maintain contact with victims throughout the process.
Many experts regard Duluth as embodying the best of what the almost 20-year-old battered-women's movement has sought to achieve. The movement, inspired by the grass-roots feminist campaign that opened rape-crisis centers in the late 60's, sprang up in the mid-70's as a loose coalition of emergency shelters. Duluth's own shelter, the Women's Coalition, was founded in 1978. Reflecting the national movement's multiple approaches a few years later, Duluth activists then prodded local law-enforcement agencies to take the issue seriously and eventually urged that batterers be offered treatment as well as punishment.
Nowadays in Duluth, women who seek help from the legal system do receive some protection, and their batterers are usually held accountable. After a decade of many trials and many errors, Ellen Pence, one of the project's founders and its national proselytizer, estimates that 1 out of every 19 men in Duluth has been through the program. During that same period, not one Duluth woman died from a domestic homicide. Given the rate of Duluth's domestic homicides in the 70's, says Pence, "there are at least five women alive today that would have otherwise been killed."
The results from Duluth are not, however, wholly triumphant. One study shows that five years after going through the Duluth program and judicial system, fully 40 percent of the treated men end up reoffending (or becoming suspects in assaults), either with the same woman or new partners. Pence thinks the real number may be closer to 60 percent. And the number of new cases each year that come before either criminal or family court judges has remained constant -- about 450 a year.
"The changes in the country have been enormous," says Elizabeth M. Schneider, a Brooklyn Law School professor and expert on battered women. "But we seriously underestimated how wedded our culture is to domestic violence." Upward of four million American women are beaten annually by current and former male partners, and between 2,000 to 4,000 women are murdered, according to the National Woman Abuse Prevention Center. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, has identified domestic violence as the No. 1 health problem for American women, causing more injuries than automobile accidents, muggings and rapes combined. The connection with child abuse in a family has been well documented: between 50 and 70 percent of the men who physically harm their partners also hit their children.
At this point, while intervention may be possible, prevention seems all but unimaginable. Despite the community's exceptional efforts, as Pence flatly admits: "We have no evidence to show that it's had any general deterrent effect. The individual guy you catch may do it less. But in Duluth, men don't say, 'Gee, I shouldn't beat her up because I'll get arrested.' After 10 years, we've had a lot of young men in our program whose dads were in it.
"I have no idea where the next step will come from," she adds. "We're too exhausted just trying to stay on top of things as they are."
ELLEN PENCE'S COMMITMENT TO ENDING family violence is hard-earned. An aunt was shot to death by her husband, a sister is a former battered wife and, one night about 20 years ago, a neighbor fleeing an abusive partner left her young boy with Pence, who subsequently helped raise him. In 1981, D.A.I.P. received a $50,000 state grant for Pence's bold new experiment, Duluth was chosen for a simple but powerful reason: the city's judges and police chief were the only ones in Minnesota willing to take her proposal seriously. A Minnesota native, Pence, now 43, is an exasperating, indefatigable earthshaker, who, by dint of her salty wit and impassioned outbursts, simply will not be denied.
Duluth, she concedes, is not exactly the mayhem capital of the Midwest. In 1990, homicides hit a record high of three. The local scourge is predominantly alcoholism, not drug addiction. The people are mostly Scandinavian and Eastern European, with a modest minority of OjibwaIndians, blacks and Southeast Asians. With fir-dotted hills that swoop sharply down to the largest fresh-water lake in the world, Duluth appears to be a pretty decent place to live -- particularly for those with a fondness for ice fishing and months of subfreezing weather. Its incidence of domestic violence is probably no worse than anywhere else in the country, and, a decade ago, was treated just as casually. In 1980, there were just 22 arrests for domestic assault, and only four convictions.
First, Ellen Pence took on the cops.
Traditional practice: If an officer doesn't witness a misdemeanor assault, the officer won't arrest.
New practice: If an officer has probable cause, including a victim's visible injury, to believe a misdemeanor domestic assault occurred within four hours of the arrival of the police, the officer must arrest. In 1990, the Duluth police arrested 176 men and 23 women for misdemeanor domestic assaults -- of whom almost all were convicted. (Experts agree that violence by women against men is usually in self-defense or retaliation, and is often less severe.)
Over the years, mandatory arrest has become increasingly popular, having been adopted, though inconsistently enforced, in dozens of municipalities and 15 states -- although recent studies have called into question whether police arrests are the best way to protect domestic abuse victims.
Still, mandatory arrest earns favorable reviews from police and prosecutors, and a D.A.I.P. survey found that 71 percent of the victims approved of the Duluth police's handling of their situations. But some battered-women's advocates remain skeptical, particularly because the policy can be disproportionately tough on poor minority families. Most experts point out that while battering occurs across all races and classes, poor people are more likely to be reported to authorities and punished than men from middle-class households. "For people who are more disadvantaged economically, like Native Americans, blacks and Hispanics, there are higher levels of all kinds of victimization, including family violence," says Angela Browne, the author of "When Battered Women Kill."
Another significant problem with mandatory arrest is that it can backfire: on occasion, when faced with two bloodied people accusing each other of attacking first, police have arrested the woman as well as the man. When this happens, children may be sent into foster care. In Connecticut, which has one of the country's toughest domestic-violence policies, the dual-arrest rate is 14 percent.
Many police still are reluctant to arrest because prosecutors tend to put the cases on the back burner. Prosecutors, in turn, blame their lack of action on the victims, who, they say, often refuse to press charges, fearing a batterer's revenge or believing his promise of reformation. Duluth, however, has what officials call a "flexible no-drop" policy: regardless of the victim's wishes, the prosecutor will almost always pursue the case.
"I assume that victims won't cooperate," says Mary E. Asmus, the chief prosecutor of Duluth's city attorney's office. Asmus has a working procedure for obtaining evidence independent of the victim's cooperation. At trial, she'll offer police photographs, tapes of calls to 911 and medical records. She also subpoenas all victims. If the victim recants on the stand, Asmus, making unusual use of a state rule of evidence, will offer the woman's original statement to police -- not to impeach her witness, but to assert the facts of the incident. In her nine years as a Duluth prosecutor, Asmus has lost only three domestic-violence cases in court.
Nationwide, some of the most aggressive domestic-violence prosecutors are in Philadelphia, San Francisco and San Diego, which files at least 200 new cases each month. To pressure women to testify, some prosecutors have gone so far as charging them with filing false police reports and perjury, issuing contempt-of-court citations, and, in rare instances, even jailing them. The no-drop policy has ignited fiery debate. One prosecutor argued in a recent National District Attorneys Association Bulletin that it "smacks of the worst kind of paternalism." In Westchester County, N.Y., Judge Jeanine Ferris Pirro retorts that "Some jurisdictions allow a victim to drop charges, and that's sending a subtle message that they don't take the crime seriously."
Not surprisingly, a no-drop policy often puts prosecutors at odds with the same activists who are demanding that the justice system go after batterers. Susan Schechter, author of "Women and Male Violence," contends that such a policy can erode a battered woman's sense of self-esteem and control, "particularly when she has a good sense of her own danger and what's best for her and the kids." Pence says that in Duluth, D.A.I.P. has managed to cut the dual-arrest rate way down. "We trust our system," she says, "so we're willing to force a woman into it." But Pence doesn't condone mandatory arrest or no-drop prosecutions unilaterally.
While tougher policies have diverted more cases into criminal court, women who just want their abusers out of the house but not sent to jail seek relief through a different route: the civil order of protection, which limits the batterer's contact with the woman and her children. Applying for such an order can be a labyrinthine undertaking -- even on a good day. Every jurisdiction has its own criteria for who qualifies, as well as for the duration of the protection order. Women with mixed feelings about getting the order in the first place can quickly become frustrated.
And judges become frustrated with them. Gender-bias studies of various state court systems have sharply criticized judges for penalizing battered women. In Duluth, the D.A.I.P. targeted the judiciary. "We explained why they were seeing what they were seeing," Pence recalls. "They were interpreting a woman's fear as ambivalence and masochism. We showed them what happened in cases when they just gave a guy a lecture or a fine." Now she occasionally trots out one or two Duluth judges on her judicial training sessions around the country. One grumbles fondly that "Ellen Pence is turning us into feminist tools."
Judge Robert V. Campbell of Duluth's District Court presides over most of its order-of-protection hearings. If a woman fails to appear in court because her abuser may be present, "I'll continue the order for a month or so, on the theory that she's being intimidated," Campbell says. A Duluth woman named Brenda Erickson, whose request for an order against her husband alleged that he'd raped her, had her first brush with the justice system before Judge Campbell. Her husband's attorney argued that his client could not have raped her. "Your honor," Erickson remembers the lawyer protesting, "she's his wife!"
The judge, she says, all but leaped down from the bench, sputtering, "If she'd been raped by a stranger, would you expect her to live with him, too?" "And I thought, Oh God, he understands how I feel," Erickson says.
SIX GLUM FACES, 12 crossed arms -- nobody thinks they did anything wrong, so why do they have to be here? Ty Schroyer, a D.A.I.P. group leader, assumes an expression of determined cheeriness as he greets this week's recruits, all ordered by the court to the batterer's program. Some ground rules:
"We don't call women 'the old lady,' 'the wife,' 'that slut,' 'that whore,' 'the bitch,' 'that fat, ugly bitch.' . . ." The list quickly becomes s unprintable.
"So what should we call her -- 'it'?" says a man who calls himself Dave, as the others snicker.
"How about her name?" snaps Schroyer, who himself was arrested nearly a decade ago for pounding his wife's head against a sidewalk.
Trying to change a batterer's behavior toward women makes pushing boulders uphill look easy. Nonetheless, at least 250 different programs around the country, filled with volunteer and court-referred clients, are having a go at it. Among them, no consensus has emerged about philosophy or length of treatment: Phoenix courts send their batterers to 12 weeks or more of group counseling sessions; San Diego batterers must attend for a year.
Edward W. Gondolf, a Pittsburgh sociologist who has evaluated and developed batterers' programs for 12 years, says, "We're making a dent with garden-variety batterers" -- first-time or sporadic offenders -- "but there's another cadre, the most lethal, who are still out of our reach." Batterers who go through the legal system should be more carefully screened, he says, and some confined. Men whom he would categorize as antisocial or even sociopathic batterers -- about 30 percent -- not only resist intervention, but may be further antagonized by it.
He cautions women not to be taken in when their partners enter counseling. "Counseling is the American way to heal a problem," he says. "She'll think, 'If he's trying, I should support him,' while he's thinking, 'I'll go to the program until I get what I want -- my wife back.' But his being in counseling may increase the danger for her because she has got her guard down."
In Duluth, when a batterer enters D.A.I.P., officials at the Woman's Coalition shelter will stay in close touch with the victim; a woman who is reluctant to report another beating to police can confide in a shelter counselor, who will tell a group leader, who may confront the man in the following week's session.
Nearly half of all batterers have problems with substance abuse, especially alcohol, and D.A.I.P. group leaders often have difficulty persuading men not to blame their violence on their addictions. John J., 35, a Duluth man who once beat a marine senseless with a lug wrench, raped the women he dated and kicked the first of four wives when she was pregnant, thought he'd become violence-free after going through the D.A.I.P. batterers' program and Alcoholics Anonymous. One night several years later, though sober, he shoved his third fiancee so hard that she went flying over a coffee table. "Men have more courage when we're drunk," he says, teary-eyed with shame, during an interview. "But the bottle didn't put the violence there in the first place."
Why do men hit women? "Men batter because it works," says Richard J. Gelles, director of the Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode Island. "They can not only hurt a woman but break down her sense of self-worth and belief that she can do anything about it."
Some programs use a therapeutic approach, exploring family history. Others employ a model inspired by the psychologist Lenore Walker's "cycle of violence" theory of battering: the man goes through a slow buildup of tension, explodes at his partner and begs her forgiveness during a honeymoon period.
But Pence criticizes both approaches for failing to confront a batterer's hatred of women, as well as his desire to dominate them. Duluth's 26-week program is divided in two sections. The first, usually run by a mental-health center, emphasizes more traditional counseling that tries to teach men to walk away from their anger. The second, run by D.A.I.P., provokes men to face up to their abuse and to identify the social and cultural forces underlying it. (In 1990, Duluth sent 350 men through its program. By comparison, Victim's Services in New York City sent 300.)
Bill, 30, admits that he once believed "you were allowed to hit a woman if you were married -- the license was for possession." A sense of entitlement pervades the men's groups: when Schroyer asked one man why he cut telephone cords in his house, the man shouted, "Why should she talk on something I paid for?"
Duluth batterers don't necessarily have to slap, punch, choke, kick with steel-toed boots or crush empty beer cans against a cheekbone to keep their partners terrified. During arguments, abusers will floor the gas pedal, clean hunting rifles or sharpen knives at the kitchen table, smash dishes and television sets, call her office every two minutes and hang up. One man smeared a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in his wife's hair. One woman's ex-husband wrote her phone number in the men's rooms of Duluth's seediest bars, with an invitation to call for a good time.
Then there are the outright threats. If she leaves him, he'll tell child-welfare services that she's a neglectful mother. Or he'll kill her. Or himself.
Schroyer and the other group leaders stress that when the violence does erupt, contrary to a batterer's favorite excuse, he has not lost control. "You chose the time, the place, the reason, how much force you'd use," Schroyer tells them. "She didn't."
But convincing men that they are better off without that control is perhaps the most challenging impediment to treatment. One night a batterer huffily asked, "Why should men want to change when we got it all already?"
BRENDA ERICKSON, ONE of the Duluth women who appeared before Judge Campbell, had been thinking about leaving her husband, Mike, for a long time. Mike had always told her that she was fat, ugly and stupid, and besides, no man would want a woman with three children, so she'd better stay with him. Brenda never thought she was a battered woman, because Mike had never punched her.
The social psychologist Julie Blackman points out that a byproduct of the attention given to the Lisa Steinberg tragedy several years ago is that the public now mistakenly associates battered women with the smashed, deformed face of Hedda Nussbaum. Susan Schechter finds that many abused women who are not as bloodied as the character portrayed by Farrah Fawcett in "The Burning Bed" do not believe they deserve aid. "Many battered women see themselves as strong, as keeping together a family, in spite of what's going on," Schechtersays.
Mike often assured Brenda that if he went to jail, it wouldn't be for wife-beating -- it would be for her murder. When he was angry, he would shatter knickknacks or punch a hole in the wall right next to her head. Brenda is 5 foot 1 and Mike is 6 foot 3. "Imagine an 18-wheeler colliding with a Volkswagen," she says. "So I learned how to say 'yes' to him, to defuse situations."
Over the eight years of their marriage, the family subsisted on welfare and Mike's occasional earnings as a freelance mechanic. In the final years, Brenda cooked in a restaurant, worked as an aide for Head Start and cared for their three sons. According to Brenda, Mike chose not to seek a full-time job in order to keep an eye on her. She couldn't even go to the grocery store alone.
Frequently, he raped her. "He'd rent pornographic films and force me to imitate them," Brenda says. The sex was often rough and humiliating. "He thought that if we had sex a lot I wouldn't leave him." Mike acknowledges that there was "mental abuse" in their marriage, but not what he'd call rape. "I'm oversexed, but there's nothing wrong with that."
A friend at work, sensing Brenda's distress, gave her the number of the Women's Coalition shelter. Brenda would call anonymously, trying to figure out if she could possibly escape. Finally, she just picked a date: Feb. 9, 1988.
That morning, she told Mike she was taking the kids to school. Once there, a shelter official picked them up. When Brenda walked into the handsome Victorian house filled with women and children, she felt an overwhelming sense of relief.
Women stay in abusive relationships too long for many reasons. Susan Schechter says it can take years before physical abuse starts, even longer for a woman to learn "not to blame herself or his lousy childhood for his violence." Brenda refused for years to believe her marriage wasn't working. Another Duluth woman, who endured a decade of stitches and plaster casts, sobbed, "We did have some wonderful times, and he was my entire world."
Some women stay because they may have reasonable expectations that they will die leaving. As many as three-quarters of the domestic assaults reported to authorities take place after the woman has left.
Some women stay because they can't afford to leave -- or because, long since alienated from friends and family, they have no place to go. There are about 1,200 shelters scattered across the country, many reporting that they must turn away three out of every four women who ask for help. Duluth's shelter can house up to 30 women and children; the shelter in Las Vegas, Nev. (population: 850,000), has only 27 beds.
But when Brenda finally made the decision to leave, she had more options than most battered women in the country -- the full resources of the shelter and D.A.I.P. were available to her. Shelter staff members screened her phone calls, and Pence spoke with Mike on Brenda's behalf; she joined a women's support group, and a counselor led her through the first of what would be many appearances before Judge Campbell in family court. But things did not go smoothly.
Mike did manage to complete the batterers' group program and made several passes through substance-abuse treatment. Yet, even though Brenda had filed for three separate orders of protection, the net effect was negligible: she claims to have suffered harassing phone calls, slashed tires and broken car windows. D.A.I.P. officials pressed police to investigate, but because the officers never caught Mike on the premises, he was never arrested.
After the divorce was granted, they continued to battle over child visits. Brenda had ultimately left Mike because of her children -- the eldest, then in kindergarten, was already angry and traumatized. Research indicates that children exposed to family violence are 10 times as likely to be abused or abusive in adult relationships.
Two years ago, D.A.I.P. opened a visitation center at the Y.W.C.A. for noncustodial parents whom the court has granted supervised time with their children. The entrances and exits are such that neither parent has to see the other, and, under the watchful gaze of a D.A.I.P. staff member, parent and children have the run of two large living rooms, a small kitchen and a roomful of toys. This is where Brenda's boys have been seeing their father and his new wife.
Brenda Erickson is now an honor student at the University of Minnesota in Duluth, majoring in family life education. "Mike has some good qualities," she allows, "but this sure as hell beats walking around on eggshells. The boys and I are so much more relaxed and able to love each other. And I found a strength I never knew I had."
On a Friday night last fall, Mike Erickson was finally arrested for domestic assault and violently resisting arrest. The victim was not Brenda, however, but his new wife, Deborah, and her teen-age son. In the ensuing brawl, it took four officers and a can of Mace to get him into the squad car, as he howled: "I wasn't domesticating with her. I was drinking!" He pled guilty to all charges and served 36 days on a work farm. Mike is now enrolled in the D.A.I.P. program. "That night I pushed my stepson and backhanded my wife because she pulled the phone out and I got irritated," he says. "It's hard for me to shut up when I get going."
But Deborah Erickson refused to file charges against Mike or even to speak to a volunteer from the Women's Coalition. She has been in abusive relationships before, but she's certain this marriage is different. "I told the cops, 'Hey, it happened, but it's not happening again.' "
THOSE WHO ARE IN A POSITION TO help battered women tend to deny the gravity of the problem. "Doctors still believe the falling-down-stairs stories, and clergy still tell women to pray and go to a marriage counselor," says Anne Menard of the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
But Congress has begun to act. In 1990, it passed a resolution, adapted by 30 states, urging that domestic violence by a parent be a presumption against child custody. The most dramatic policy reform, however, may be Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s pending Violence Against Women Act, which proposes, among other things, to stiffen penalties for domestic abusers.
But while the use of the criminal-justice system to quash domestic violence has gained currency around the country, Ellen Pence's advice to women in battering relationships is simply this: leave. Leave because even the best of programs, even Duluth's, cannot insure that a violent man will change his ways.

She screamed at the police not to hurt her husband and pleaded with him to cooperate. Against her wishes, he was taken away in the police car and charged with assault and resisting arrest.

HEADLINE: CULTIVATING THEIR OWN GARDENS

 BODY:
I want to thank Jason DeParle for his article "Cultivating Their Own Gardens" (Jan. 5). It depicted the success of Cochran Gardens, a public housing development in an inner-city community in St. Louis and portrayed the various facets of self-sufficiency generated by a resident management corporation.
There are over 200 resident organizations training community executives to lead their neighbors up the ladder of socio-economic opportunity in this country. This remarkable movement is nothing less than a populist revolution.
As your article illustrates, resident leaders cannot accomplish the awesome task of moving families out of dependency alone. We must sweep away the legal and economic barriers that perpetuate the incidence of poverty and despair in our nation's inner cities. 
 As chairman of the White House Empowerment Task Force, I have promoted the development of an asset-based welfare strategy that provides new incentives for work, entrepreneurship and home ownership.
Low-income public housing residents, like other Americans, want our country to be strong economically. We must tear down the barriers in this nation's tax and welfare systems to provide real incentives for residents to move from welfare to economic independence.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A Coup in Latin American Bonds?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Lincoln Y. Rathnam, a director of Scudder, Stevens & Clark's Latin American group, doesn't get too many phone calls at home at 5:30 in the morning. But when he does, they're usually memorable.
"There's a coup going on, but it doesn't seem to be serious," reported A. Peter Monaco, a Scudder portfolio manager, when he roused Mr. Rathnam from bed on Feb. 4. He was in Venezuela on business. 
 Serious, indeed. Units of Venezuela's army revolted and President Carlos Andres Perez was nearly killed before the coup was put down. An immediate consequence was a sudden drop in the value of foreign debt bonds, among other Venezuelan securities. And just the night before, Mr. Rathnam had dined with a private client for whom he had bought a large position in Venezuelan debt bonds.
Latin American debt bonds are not blue-chip investments by any means, and they are hard enough to sell when circumstances are perfect, especially to Americans. There are lingering concerns about the debt crisis that plagued Latin America in the 1980's, and the simple lack of familiarity on the part of investors makes them a hard sell.
But Mr. Monaco's instant assessment on the morning of the coup appears to have been on target. The situation quickly stabilized in Venezuela and bond prices snapped back. Just before the coup, the bonds were selling at 71.125. They plummeted as low as 62 after the army revolt, a 12.8 percent decline, and closed on Feb. 10 at 64.875, an 8.8 percent fall.
Now, Mr. Rathnam is even using the coup attempt to convince large investors, many of them outside of the United States, to buy the bonds. He argues that they are a good alternative to equities for investors who want to get in on the action as Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil and other South American countries struggle to create open-market economies.
He contends that the astounding, sometimes triple-digit stock returns of the last few years in these countries are over and the big gains will be in the debt bonds.
Mr. Rathnam and other Latin American debt traders say that the rebound of the Venezuelan debt after the coup also shows the bonds' relative stability, making them attractive when compared to the volatility of the Latin American stock markets. "There are still a few easy returns to be made in Latin America" in the bonds, he said.
The bonds that Mr. Rathnam has been buying were created in the debt reduction and restructuring deal that Venezuela and its commercial bankers agreed to in 1990. The agreement was as part of the Bush Administration's debt relief program designed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
The bonds, which are known a D.C.B.'s, or debt conversion bonds, were selling on Friday for $68.375 for a bond with a face value of $100. The interest rate, which is adjusted every six months, is 5.4375 percent, which makes the interest on the $68.375 paid for the bond about 7.95 percent a year.
But the real potential is for a gain in the price of the bond as the Venezuelan economy grows and foreign investors become convinced that the country will become more stable economically. Mr. Rathnam is betting this will happen soon.
Practicing what he preaches, Mr. Rathnam bought more bonds after the coup at 63 for his private client and his fund, the Sovereign High Yield Investment Company, which trades in London and can't be sold to Americans. He sold a few days later at around 69, locking in some profit. American investors with several million dollars can buy bonds through Scudder or elsewhere but small investors are limited to funds that combine stocks with bonds.
Scudder expects Latin equities to return 20 to 30 percent per year over the next several years. Mr. Rathnam projects that the Venezuelan debt investment will return about 20 percent per year over two years. However, this depends upon bonds being upgraded by credit rating agencies to a level that will allow purchases by many pension funds and other institutional investors now excluded by their investment policies.
If Mr. Rathnam is correct, this could mean debt conversion bonds in countries like Argentina and Brazil could offer an opportunity for high yield and strong capital gains if debt agreements like that for Venezuela are reached. Negotiations are now underway between both countries and their lender banks, and Mr. Rathnam is buying the loans in anticipation.
The coup attempt, however, is a reminder of the risk involved in such investments. Economists like Frank Fernandez, senior Latin American specialist at Merrill Lynch, note that the early benefits of economic restructuring in Latin American countries go mostly to the very wealthy and not the poor or the middle class. Discontent by these groups was seen as helping spark the Venezuelan coup attempt
Chip Brown, chief economist for Latin America at Salomon Brothers, said that he expects President Perez to use government spending to deal with the wealth distribution problem. He had already expanded some programs before the coup attempt.
More spending could raise the budget deficit, which might worry foreign investors who are concerned about economic stability. But Mr. Brown does not think such efforts would derail the move to open markets. Instead, he thinks the program will move at three-quarter, not full, speed.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Next It May Be Economy Up, Stocks Down

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The stock market now seems to believe that the recession is almost over. The question for investors, however, may be whether all the fun is gone even before the growth begins.
Notwithstanding all the bull market publicity, many investors have not found joy so far in 1992. The Dow Jones industrial average did hit a record high of 3,276.83 on Wednesday, but 12 of the 30 Dow stocks have lost ground so far this year, among them such long-term favorites as Merck and Philip Morris. The best of the Dow stocks is much-maligned General Motors. And bonds, which everyone knew were sure to advance rapidly, have generally fallen in price. 
 Among the analysts who follow corporate America, this year began with an unprecedented wave of pessimism. For every analyst who found a stock worthy of a higher profit estimate, there were more than four analysts slicing forecasts.
Perhaps, given the fact that Wall Street is one of the few oases of prosperity these days, it would be more accurate to say that the cuts reflected not so much pessimism as a deferral of optimism. "Economists and analysts are constantly postponing their estimates of when the economy will improve, and it does not seem to bother anyone," said Rick Pucci, a vice president of Institutional Brokers Estimate System, which monitors what the analysts are up to. "The market just keeps looking beyond the valley."
Now, analysts seem to be turning a little less negative. In the most recent four weeks, there were just two cuts for every increase. Analysts see signs of better days ahead in such industries as restaurants and computer software, not to mention brokerage houses, where the forecasts keep rising as investors snap up every new initial public offering. But profit forecasts are still being cut in such industries as steel, oil and autos.
To a significant extent, changes in analyst forecasts reflect what the companies themselves see occuring in their businesses. Coupled with surprising figures on retail sales last week, the changes may very well provide an early indication that the recession, at long last, is ending.
The stock market seems to be forecasting such a development. Highly cyclical stocks like G.M., up 32 percent this year, are showing strength while the steady growers that are supposed to be recession-resistant, like Philip Morris, off 7 percent, are down.
In the past when analysts were cutting profit forecasts at close to the fevered pitch of early this year, it was a sign of excessive pessimism and was always a good time to buy stocks. But in those instances, there were other signs of pessimism, most notably share prices that had declined sharply or, at best, gone nowhere for a sustained period of time. And, Mr. Pucci notes, valuation measures generally indicated stocks were cheap.
Those conditions do not apply now. And that could mean that this recovery, when it comes, will not be as enjoyable for shareholders as the recession was.

HEADLINE: Keeping the Pipeline Filled at Merck

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

DATELINE: RAHWAY, N.J.

 BODY:
Every company has its legends. At Merck and Company the latest is about Proscar, the new drug that shrinks enlarged prostates and is awaiting Government approval. It involves a remote Caribbean mountain village with a population of male pseudohermaphrodites and an obscure medical paper about them. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, seems never to tire of telling the story, and anyone inquiring about Proscar's prospects as the company's next billion-dollar megadrug is sure to hear it from other Merck executives as well. And no wonder, since the Proscar legend says a lot about survival in the bare-knuckles competitiveness of the drug industry these days, illustrating how basic research and unrelenting patience must be combined to bring a drug to market.
The story goes like this: In 1974, Dr. Julianne Imperato-McGinley of Cornell Medical College in New York told a conference on birth defects about a group of hermaphroditic children in the Caribbean. Appearing sexually ambiguous at birth, they were raised as girls. But at puberty they grew external genitalia and developed deep voices and male musculature. Her research group had found that a genetic trait caused a deficiency of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. This suppressed levels of the male hormone dihydrotestosterone, causing alteration of the male children's sexual development. 
 In the fall of 1975, copies of a monograph about the conference landed on the desks of Dr. Vagelos, then Merck's basic-research chief, and Glen Arth, a senior Merck biochemist. Like mosquitoes homing in on a picnic, they seized on a phrase in Dr. Imperato-McGinley's description of the children's physical characteristics when grown: "The prostate, however, remains small . . ."
Here, then, was a possible clue to a drug that would shrink an enlarged prostate, something that Merck -- and nearly every other drug company -- wanted to develop. If levels of dihydrotestosterone could be lowered with a drug that inhibited the enzyme's action, that drug would find an eager market among the 15 million American men plagued by enlarged prostate, an embarrassing and often painful condition which can block urine flow, interrupt sleep and cause serious infections.
 
Almost on the Market
 The rest, as they say, is history. Earlier this month, a scientific advisory committee at the Food and Drug Administration voted to recommend Merck's new prostate drug, Proscar, as safe and effective. The committee action makes it highly likely that the drug will win final F.D.A. approval, probably this summer.
On Wall Street, Merck in recent years has come to be regarded as almost god-like. Proscar seems likely to only burnish that image. Some analysts are predicting the drug will be generating $1 billion in annual revenues by 1996. If so, it will be following on the heels of other Merck blockbusters: Vasotec, a blood-pressure drug with $1.75 billion in sales last year, and cholesterol-lowering Mevacor, with $1.09 billion.
In fact, Merck is so wildly successful that increasing numbers of analysts, investors and competitors have begun to ask: How long can it keep winning?
"The big question for Merck is, 'What are you going to do for an encore?' " said Marc O. Mayer, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, who, like most pharmaceutical-industry analysts, likes Merck's near-term prospects. On the other hand, said David Lippman at Dean Witter Reynolds, "I like Merck but I like Bristol-Myers Squibb better."
Pressures for lower drug prices are growing as fierce as the competition among the big multinational companies -- Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Sandoz -- all of which are pouring billions of dollars into finding and marketing new drugs.
The pharmaceutical industry is also under increased scrutiny because of recent questions about the safety of products -- for example, Dow Corning's silicone breast implants and Upjohn's Halcion, a sleeping pill. But even industry critics generally give Merck good marks for its integrity and credibility. Merck "tends to be a lot less doctrinaire and more willing to consider the notion that safety sells products," said Linda Lipsen, Washington legislative counsel with Consumer's Union.
More bothersome is what Merck's next big drug after Proscar will be. "Merck does not appear to have other potential billion-dollar drugs that might be approved in the next two to three years," said Ronald Nordmann of Paine Webber Securities. Dr. Vagelos said he has the same concern, but he can take comfort from the fact that none of Merck's big drugs will lose their price-protecting patents until 1997, making it possible to keep its $1 billion-a-year research machine rolling, and to gear up for after-patent marketing. "It's a game we play," he said. "When patents end, we race to maintain the product flow."
And so far, Dr. Vagelos, a 62-year-old physician and biochemist who came to Merck in 1975 after stints at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., and Washington University in St. Louis, has a reputation for keeping Merck ahead of the pack. Profits rose 19 percent last year, to $2.12 billion on sales of $8.6 billion. The stock, having been split twice in just over five years, closed on Friday at $148.25.
 
The Price Pressures
 Drug prices have been increasing for years at double the general inflation rate. Seeking to blunt Congressional threats to crack down on the trend, Merck was the first to announce, in April 1990, its own price restraints and discounts for government programs for the poor.
Dr. Vagelos vowed that Merck's prices would rise no faster than overall consumer prices. Securities analysts note that Merck, which has 19 drugs each adding at least $100 million to annual sales, can well afford to take such a statesmanlike stance.
As for Proscar, which many patients are expected to take daily for the rest of their lives, Merck executives plan to use the occasion of F.D.A. approval to "make a statement." As Dr. Vagelos put it, "We plan to have a price that is affordable to the great majority of people throughout the developed world."
On top of the pricing pressure, Merck is also having to cope with what amounts to a sea change in how drugs are purchased. The nation's half-a-million active physicians are losing authority over prescriptions as hard-bargaining hospitals, employer-insurer groups and health-maintenance organizations dictate decisions and force price discounts.
Dr. Vagelos said the company is "working on promotion and marketing approaches that will reduce our costs and ultimately reduce prices." As it becomes less important for Merck to visit individual doctors, Merck will obviously need fewer sales people. But change "won't happen overnight," Dr. Vagelos said. "It may take years to get there."
In the meantime, Merck is planning a marketing blitz for Proscar, which must be taken for several months before showing results.
The goal, of course, is to wean urologists away from the alternatives, like Hytrin. Hytrin, an Abbott Laboratories blood-pressure drug, seems to bring immediate relief of prostate symptoms, but it has not been shown to shrink the prostate itself as Proscar promises to do. Pfizer has a similar blood-pressure drug called Minipress.
Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham is conducting large-scale tests of its own prostate drug. Merck is rushing to develop a second-generation product to protect the Proscar franchise.
Inevitably, said Joyce Albers, an analyst at First Boston, "competition will gobble up some of the market" for Merck's big products. She noted that four similar drugs -- Bristol-Myers's Monopril, Warner-Lambert's Accupril, Hoechst's Altace and Ciba-Geigy's Lotensin -- are chasing Merck's best-selling blood-pressure treatment, Vasotec.
Vasotec, prescribed for people who have had serious heart attacks, is still far ahead of the others, Ms. Albers noted, and could pull further ahead if the F.D.A. approves its application for treating the less seriously ill.
As for Merck's cholesterol-lowering Mevacor, its other big earner, Bristol-Myers Squibb has dispatched squadrons of sales people to issue a challenge with Pravachol. The Bristol-Myers entry was approved by the F.D.A. Oct. 31 and sales may reach $400 million in 1992, analysts said.
Seeking profit-generating buffers, Merck has been entering into joint ventures that could produce revenue by mid-decade. DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical is developing new drugs from DuPont's well-stocked research pipeline, like the heart drug losartan. Merck and Johnson & Johnson are developing over-the-counter versions of Merck drugs like the ulcer treatment Pepcid to create new business as patents expire.
Merck is already benefiting handsomely from the American rights it obtained to sell the products of AB Astra, an innovative Swedish drug maker. Astra's Prilosec, another ulcer treatment, is already generating more than $200 million a year for Merck and the two companies plan to extend their partnership.
Dr. Vagelos said Merck is looking for other alliances and partnerships. "It does not make sense for the No. 1 company to have only 5 percent in worldwide market share and 9.5 percent in the U.S.," he said.
 
The Medical Process
 The F.D.A. committee's favorable decision on Proscar, delivered on Feb. 4, followed a dozen years of laboratory and animal experiments and then three years of testing the drug on more than 1,600 men through clinical trials around the world.
The prostate, a walnut-sized gland in the pelvis, produces fluid that helps to nourish and transport sperm. The gland surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder through the penis.
More than 70 percent of men have enlarged prostates by the age of 65, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. Men who live into their mid-80's have a 90 percent chance of developing the condition.
Urologists say about 25 percent of BPH cases can be life-threatening and up to 40 percent need surgery. A prostatectomy to treat BPH is the most common surgical procedure in American men over age 50; about 400,000 are performed each year at a cost of $3 billion.
Dr. Logan Holtgrewe, president-elect of the American Urological Association, said that while Proscar's expected approval appeared encouraging, the enlarged prostate is a long-term disease. "We don't know how these drugs are going to play in the long run," he said.
Seeking to answer such questions -- and obtain scientific ammunition for its marketing efforts -- Merck is starting a four-year study involving more than 3,000 patients at 100 medical centers. It will, not incidentally, introduce dozens of influential physicians to the new drug.
In the data presented to the F.D.A. advisory committee, Merck said that Proscar reduced prostate gland size by at least 20 percent in more than half of patients after six months.
The company said 57 percent of patients who took the drug once a day for six months had improved urine flow and 71 percent experienced lessened urinary distress symptoms. Of these, about one-third had improvement considered to be excellent.
As to side effects, Merck said there could be danger to a male fetus in a woman who had been impregnated by a man taking the drug. And sexual dysfunction, mainly impotence, among patients taking Proscar was twice the rate found in those in the same age group who were taking a placebo drug. The dysfunction was "reversible" if a patient stopped taking the drug.
So far, Proscar has not been shown to either prevent or treat cancer of the prostate, which strikes 122,000 men a year and kills 32,000. But Gary H. Rasmusson, the Merck biochemist who synthesized Proscar, said the company hopes to develop a cancer drug using approaches somewhat similar to that of Proscar.
 
The 'Dream Team'
 Dr. Vagelos, who must retire at age 65 in November 1994, is nurturing a group of younger executives he calls his "dream team." They include Richard J. Markham, 41, marketing director; Edward M. Scolnick, 51, research director; John L. Zabriskie, 52, manufacturing chief, and Jerry T. Jackson, 50, who supervises animal and farm drugs, vaccines and deals with other drug makers.
Dr. Vagelos grew up in the shadow of Merck's Rahway headquarters, serving coffee and pie in the family luncheonette after classes at Rahway High School. He waited on tables to help pay his way at the University of Pennsylvania and the College 0f Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University.
After joining Merck, he immediately applied his faith in the notion that important therapies could be based on drugs that would manipulate human enzymes. The work that produced Proscar was just one example. "The same strategy gave us Mevacor," he said.
When he retires, Dr. Vagelos will be out of the loop at Merck for the first time in 19 years. But he expects Proscar to remain part of his life. "Like a lot of males, I'll be taking the drug," he said.
 
 
THE JAPANESE CONNECTION
 Unlike many American companies, Merck sees Japan as an opportunity, not a threat. Its Banyu unit is No. 11 among drug makers in Japan, the world's second-largest pharmaceutical market after the United States.
Banyu's 1991 sales were $800 million, representing 10 percent of Merck's worldwide revenues. Merck acquired majority ownership of Banyu in 1984, becoming the first and only American company to take control of a "first-tier company on the Japanese stock exchange," as P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, put it. It may also be the last. Dr. Vagelos recalls that after the deal the chief executive of a major Japanese company, whom he declined to name, said crisply: "It will never happen again."
Banyu hopes to be one of Japan's five largest drug makers by the year 2000. It will benefit this year from the recent approval in Japan of Zocor, one of Merck's two cholesterol-lowering drugs. In a uniquely Japanese setback, approval of Proscar "probably lost two years," Dr. Vagelos said, because of "laboratory aberrations," now corrected, he said.
In Japan, drug makers hand over new products for testing by an independent, Government-paid professor. Japan does not accept F.D.A.-approved testing, and the F.D.A. seldom accepts Japanese testing.
Japanese doctors make much of their money by filling their own prescriptions. The Government pays for all drugs, and sets prices, starting high for new drugs, but cutting prices for older products every two years. Merck's antibiotic Primaxin, for instance, took a 16.9 percent cut in 1990.
Merck is opening a new cancer and heart research laboratory at Tsukuba in April. It licenses one of its big products, the ulcer treatment Pepcid, from Yamanouchi of Japan. Analysts said Pepcid generated $595 million in 1991 sales for the American company.

HEADLINE: At Work;
When Japan Inc. Comes to America

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Jiro Ishizaka has an American-style work schedule. Does this mean that Mr. Ishizaka works a little Tuesday through Thursday, but saves most of his energy for planning, executing and recovering from a weekend carouse -- the portrait of the typical American worker drawn recently by a Japanese politician?
Not exactly. Mr. Ishizaka, the Los Angeles-based chairman of the Union Bank, which is 75 percent owned by the Bank of Tokyo, is a self-described "salaryman." Like other Japanese salarymen, he puts in a long day at the office. His schedule, Mr. Ishizaka believes, makes him much like many Americans. "Look at lawyers in the U.S.," he said. "They work so hard. They don't mind working through the night." 
 It is not at all clear that Mr. Ishizaka approves of anyone working through the night, and his sympathy seems to fly against the received wisdom that the cultures of work in Japan and the United States are antipodal. So does a survey of Japanese executives in the United States done recently by the Japan America Society of Southern California and Manning, Selvage & Lee, a public relations firm. It found that 94 percent of the 100 respondents had modified their management style as a result of living and working in the United States. And, the survey said, the executives had come to value the very American qualities -- assertiveness and individualism, for example -- that are often said to exasperate Japanese managers.
Japanese executives and Americans familiar with how Japanese companies do business abroad expressed little surprise at the survey's results. "As long as you do business here, you have to adapt to American practices," said Leo Shinozaki of the information arm of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations. And no one thinks the dark, Satanic offices of Japan Inc. are going to empty out as salarymen start following their bliss or that the intricately braided ties between Tokyo and its corporate outposts are likely to come unbound anytime soon.
But to Americans accustomed to being on the rump end of Japanese public opinion, the idea that the Japanese find something to admire in their work culture comes as a surprise. "We didn't go in with any preconceptions," said Chris Doyle, who worked on the survey and said he was startled by the results, particularly by some of the respondents' suggestions: "Have equal opportunities for everyone." "Be more outspoken." "Stop thinking about seniority and how long you work for a company." "Be more openminded, have a more open system." "Have a more enjoyable personal life." "Emphasize play as well as work."
Will the national reptile of Japan soon change from Godzilla to the lounge lizard? Executives say that adapting to the style of the host country is simply commonsensical. "Americans working in Tokyo likewise have to adapt," Mr. Shinozaki said. Mr. Ishizaki, in his precise English, truncates a familiar phrase but the sentiment comes through: "You do as Romans do."
Nevertheless, the survey appears to be a very small indicator of an evolution in Japanese social attitudes taking place far from the feverish domain of Japanese-American economic relations. Change comes even to cultures with as abiding a respect for tradition, and bureaucracy, as Japan, and many say Japanese living abroad, especially in America, are the vanguard of that change.
"They return from their first or second assignment and give lessons to people who are still there," said Masaki Murakami, a general manager of Mitsui and Company in New York. For young Japanese, the fissures caused by cultural and political enmity are closing: "Younger people have so much exposure to America. They have learned from the American way." Mr. Murakami said he is more willing to delegate authority than he used to be and -- heretically -- no longer assumes a company should retain executives for life if they are unproductive.
All of this confirms the feeling of Union Bank's Mr. Ishizaka that Japanese and American styles are converging not diverging -- and that the generation entering the work force now will accelerate the convergence. Joseph Brunetto, president of JapanAmerica Communications, a publisher in Hartsdale, N.Y., compares the current restless generation of Japanese to Americans who came of age during the 1960's. "They grew up affluent. They are more expressive and they think of themselves more," said Mr. Brunetto, who lived in Japan for several years. They rebel by not going into companies, by traveling and by living in the United States. "These things would not have happened 20 years ago in Japan," he said.
 
 
 
THE DAMAGE DONE BY POLITICIANS
 The contretemps over Japanese criticism of American work habits has discomfited many Japanese executives in the United States. "It's a touchy subject," said Masaki Murakami, of Mitsui and Company. "Japanese companies are in an awkward position, and I think Americans working in the companies feel a little strange."
Some executives worry that with a few ill-chosen buzz words politicians at home have managed to undo years of business diplomacy. "Japan is the friend, not the enemy of America," said Jiro Ishizaka, chairman of the Union Bank, sounding like a man trying to make peace between a cobra and a mongoose. Mr. Ishizaka, who arrived in the United States on the day Richard M. Nixon was elected to his second term, has learned one of the most valuable American management techniques. He declared the recent cycle of criticism and wounded feelings between Japan and the United States overblown and blamed the news media: "The media always takes the most negative side," he said.

HEADLINE: Stop Beating Up on Employees

 BODY:
To the Editor:
When will corporate America wake up? Workers cannot give their most productive and creative performances within a system that holds them in utter contempt. ("Take This Job and Love It," Jan. 26) The International Business Machines Corporation has an annual review process that will assign failing grades to 10 percent of its workers. That I.B.M. is not unique is an American disgrace. Corporate America has a long tradition of beating up its workers, and this tradition is responsible for much of the economic malaise infecting this country. 
 Rather than inspiring employees to find new solutions to company problems, punitive grading systems insure that American workers will continue to be preoccupied with personal survival and spend most of their creative energies cultivating their bosses. But no matter how skillful, at I.B.M. 10 percent of the work force is set up to fail. Whether a worker survives or is turned out, most will vow never again to pour their hearts and souls into any kind of a corporate endeavor. I wonder if the real motivation of I.B.M.'s management is to turn workers into scapegoats for the company's well-publicized downturn.
Corporate America will become competitive only after it drums fear from the workplace and invests in systems allowing workers to win, not lose. When that happens, there will be no stopping us.

HEADLINE: Coins

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:

Ration Coupons as Money
The breakup of the Soviet Union has created hope among collectors that each of the emerging republics will create several new coins and bills. So far this hasn't happened, and Ukraine's new use of rationing coupons as money doesn't go a very long way toward diversifying the currencies. 
 Ukraine has done the expedient thing and simply monetized what was in fact the main currency circulating there, although not officially recognized. Its old food-rationing tickets are now the unofficial money and are called coupons.
Rubles of the former Soviet Union are still in use throughout Ukraine, but Ukraine says that Russia didn't supply it with enough rubles in January to meet the higher demand for notes caused by rising prices. The shortage forced the Ukrainian Government to use the rationing tickets it had on hand as currency. Ukraine plans to issue a real national currency, to be called the hryvnia (pronounced HRIV-nee-uh), later this year.
The ration coupons were originally used to deter residents of the other republics, mostly Russians, from entering the Ukraine, snapping up Ukrainian goods cheaply and then returning to Russia. But lately, all salaries in the Ukraine are being paid in equal proportions of rubles and ration coupons.
The coupons, a little less than half the size of a United States dollar bill, show St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev on the reverse. The front shows one of Kiev's founders, the denomination, and the word for coupon prominently displayed.
While these coupons fall under the numismatic category of emergency money, they still make up an officially recognized currency that trades at 16 to the dollar on the black market. But collectors, international banks and probably Ukrainians themselves are likely to be more comfortable with the hryvnia when it finally appears.
 
Trial $1 Coins Struck
 While Russia and the Ukraine struggle to straighten out their currencies, the United States Congress is again wrestling with the problem of the $1 coin. A proposal to stop printing dollar bills has been on the Congressional agenda for several years.
Those arguing for the dollar coin cite its usefulness for toll and vending machines. They also cite the high cost of printing paper money, which lasts only about 18 months while a coin typically circulates for about 20 years.
Those who oppose the introduction offer the example of the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which was minted only from 1979 to 1981, and was discontinued because of its unpopularity. Some thought it too small; previous silver dollars had been 50 percent larger. Others thought making the Anthony dollar compatible with vending and toll machines made it so similar in size to the quarter that they could not be distinguished easily. At any rate, 400 million of them sit idle in Government vaults, waiting for either a better day or a melting pot.
To promote public interest in a gold-colored $1 coin, the Olin Brass Corporation of East Alton, Ill., has struck a pattern piece of one possible design of a new clad coin and offered samples of it to the House Coinage Subcommittee for testing. Olin Brass now supplies the United States Mint with the copper-nickel alloy used in quarters, dimes and half-dollars.
Two examples of the trial coins were struck, one made of an alloy of copper, nickel and zinc, the other of aluminum and bronze. Both have a golden color and feel different from a quarter when touched blindly in a purse or pocket.
Olin's design features a Minuteman on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. There is no denomination, so these trial coins cannot be confused with legal coins. Of almost 1,000 trial pieces minted, only about 200 have been handed out. Most of those were distributed for testing in vending machines and as souvenirs to members of the Coin Coalition, a group that advocates the adoption of a $1 coin.
Olin Brass says it isn't sure what to do with the rest, and may simply melt them down. So far the company hasn't given or sold any examples to coin collectors, not even collectors who are also company stockholders.

HEADLINE: Lives and Loves of Tall, Charismatic Presidents

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Social scientists," Leslie Hawke states (letter, Feb. 2), "should not ask whether or not Gov. Bill Clinton has had an affair, but whether or not there is a correlation between poor political leadership and infidelity. My guess is that they would find no correlation -- but what if they uncovered the opposite?" 
 We have been studying Presidential leadership from George Washington through Ronald Reagan. Our findings on this question are that there is no direct correlation between Presidents who have mistresses and objective measures of effectiveness in handling international, social-domestic or economic issues.
However, there is an indirect relationship. Presidents who are tall and have a reputation for being highly charismatic tend to have mistresses. Presidents who are tall and charismatic also tend to be better performers and to be rated as great or near great in surveys of political scientists. All of these findings are statistically significant, indicating that they could not have occurred by chance. Therefore, Presidents who are tall and charismatic are more likely to have mistresses and to be effective. As Ms. Hawke points out (and our data support her conclusion), "People who run for President are risk takers, and they love a conquest."
Perhaps having a mistress goes with the territory covered by effective Presidents.

HEADLINE: We Need a Real National Rebuilding Program

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It looks as if we will not see prosperity for a long time. The programs proposed are bits and pieces, which may be of help, but are more likely to give us what was called stagflation in the 1950's -- the continuation of an economy operating far below capacity. Something needs to be added to provide more jobs and invigorate the flow of goods and services.
An enormous area where unfilled needs might be used as the catalytic agent is the infrastructure. We have not properly maintained our assets nor kept pace with the requirements of change. 
 We are far behind in building and maintaining roads. Our bridges are a danger and a disgrace. Our schools have depreciated from lack of repair and are out of balance with population changes. Waste disposal is a critical problem. Many areas are sadly in need of decent low-cost housing. Our cities and towns have reached a frightening point of reduced staff and delayed maintenance.
In all these areas, the needs are clear, and there undoubtedly are plans for action in the files that could be quickly put to work.
The Federal Government is the only source for leadership in these national problems. However, it is difficult for it to act effectively so long as we are determined not to use the Government's borrowing capacity for these purposes. So far as economic recovery is concerned, we seem to be in a kind of gridlock.
It is a failure in recognizing our real priorities when the use of the nation's credit is allowed to prevent action needed to deal with economic recovery and the sorry state of our infrastructure. We need an effective government program aimed at providing a massive increase in jobs and purchasing power.
The program problem is not an either-or matter. The proposed bits-and-pieces analysis would still be carried forward. My suggestion is for a major addition to provide rapid action that would strengthen our infrastructure and put thousands to work. The direct and indirect effects of such pump priming would be widespread and visible.

HEADLINE: For Some Seeking Presidency, Winning Isn't the Only Thing;
Another Campaign? Feelings Are Mixed

BYLINE: States News Service

DATELINE: Washington

 BODY:
THOUGH Senator Bill Bradley and Thomas H. Kean, then the Governor, are better known among those who filed as possible Presidential candidates in 1988, there were several other New Jerseyans who actually ran for President that year. They look back on the campaign with mixed feelings.
James R. Messenger of Piscataway, an Emmy Award-winning television producer, will not even discuss his 1988 race, which he said cost him $15,000 of his savings and taught him a few things about major party support of lesser-known candidates. 
 But Mr. Messenger, whose film work has twice earned Academy Award nominations, did send a reporter his well-designed press packet outlining a complete Presidential platform, as well as a statement explaining why he was no longer involved in politics.
"I ran as a Democrat for President in order to try and introduce into the Presidential campaign the true issues facing this nation," he said. "Unfortunately, no one was interested."
Although Mr. Messenger had sought major party support, he said official response was confined to a state party official announcing that he "didn't have a chance" to win a single vote.
"That was the extent of 'help' from the Democratic Party," Mr. Messenger said. "With all due respect, I have nothing else to say."
But there were some positive results. William Marra of West Milford, a philosophy professor at Fordham University, was the Right to Life Party candidate and the nation's ninth-highest vote-getter in the last Presidential race, earning 22,560 votes.
An articulate speaker who ran on a "Family First" platform, Professor Marra said minor party candidacies were needed to broaden the national debate, which he said remained fixed on economic issues.
He said he would probably not run again "unless someone comes up to me with $16 million in campaign funds," adding that he doubted that this would happen. "I never had any illusion that I would win, but I was glad to do what I could to call attention to other issues. But once is enough."
James Mac Warren, then a Jersey City resident, received 11,435 votes in 1988 as the Socialist Workers Party candidate. Though the national campaign was grueling, he said, it was "a very interesting experience."
"What you've got to understand is that most of the people we appeal to are those who have lost all interest in the political process," he said. "They see the other candidates as Tweedledee and Tweedledum."
Now living in Chicago, Mr. Warren said he would consider running again, if asked.
Running a minor party candidacy could also be considered fleeting fame. It was in 1984 that Dennis L. Serrette, also of Jersey City, received 50,000 votes as the first Presidential candidate run by what is now the New Alliance Party. In 1988, he became the only minor party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states, receiving 201,430 votes in the process.
But after months of searching in response to a reporter's inquiry, party officials have been unable to locate Mr. Serrette, who they say has not been seen nor heard from in years.
But there will always be Henry Krajewski, the pig farmer from Secaucus who ran for President several times beginning in the 1950's. "His legacy," said David A. Bositis, at thea senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political Studies in Wasahington, "is that his campaign buttons and souvenirs have become one of the rarest items among political memorabilia nationwide."

HEADLINE: WINTER GAMES;
Democrats Dread a Season Without Heavy Hitters

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H.

 BODY:
The not-so-secret secret of this year's Democratic Presidential campaign has been the reluctance of the party's A Team to take the field.
Is that judgment too harsh? Well, here's what Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska thinks of his main rivals, according to a radio commercial broadcast in New Hampshire this weekend: Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas? "His campaign is in trouble." Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts? "Another Massachusetts candidate who's strong in the Northeast but has little support in the rest of the country." Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa? "The kind of old-style Democrat who's failed before." All this from a candidate who himself has struggled to attract the support of one Democrat in 10 here -- yet still touts his electability. 
 "The campaign in this state began with the perception that this was a second-rate field," said Richard Winters, a political scientist at Dartmouth College. "During the last three or four months, the candidates haven't matured much. They haven't demonstrated a lot of depth. Some of them, like Clinton, haven't shown much judgment. So the initial impression has not been weakened, except for Tsongas, who has come into his own precisely because he has seemed calm and articulate and steady when the others have not."
The exigent voters of New Hampshire may have decided that none of the active combatants quite fills the bill. That's what many of them tell reporters who ask, and the polls strongly suggest that they are prepared to deliver an inconclusive verdict on Tuesday, with no runaway winner and no one knocked completely out of the race. Muddle, in other words. A much longer campaign than originally anticipated. And lots of pressure on the non-runners to think about late entries, as perilous a course as that obviously is.
 
Missing Personages
 Once upon a time, you could make a list of the Democrats' big guns, and it would be more or less the same as the list of Presidential contenders. In 1960, almost all the heavy hitters ran -- Johnson, Symington, Humphrey, along with a much less senior figure named John F. Kennedy. This year, the active field includes a former senator who left office in 1984, two relatively junior senators, a small-state governor and Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, a former governor who left office in 1982.
Absent from that list are Mario M. Cuomo of New York, the ranking Democratic governor; leading senatorial figures such as George J. Mitchell of Maine, Al Gore of Tennessee, Lloyd Bensten of Texas and Sam Nunn of Georgia; and the dominant figures in the House, including the speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.
One reason for the weak Democratic field, of course, is the vagaries of political timing. When Mr. Gore, Mr. Gephardt, Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and others were making their go/no go decisions, President Bush seemed all but unbeatable; only a few weeks later, he seemed highly vulnerable as the recession took an ever firmer hold on the country. But a larger factor, surely, has been the collapse of the party apparatus since 1972. Party elders once played a key role at several points of the nominating process, discussing among themselves the available talent, encouraging or discouraging candidates according to their views of what would appeal to the electorate, looking for skeletons in candidates' closets.
The process wasn't perfect by any means, but it provided a rudimentary screening process. Now there is something approaching self-selection for Presidential hopefuls, limited only by the ability to raise enough money to compete in Iowa or New Hampshire and some sort of minimal credibility.
With the proliferation of primaries, the role of the convention and the smoke-filled room has been minimized. The choice has usually been made long before the delegates assemble. In theory, the importance of primaries might have put a premium on having a national reputation before the campaign begins, but in fact television advertising, that maker of instant if insubstantial reputations, has made that unnecessary. It has also made money-raising one of the principal if least visible campaign activities.
Candidacies have become poll-driven and consultant-crafted, and those relatively new technologies have made long apprenticeships less vital. So a man like Bill Clinton, known only in his small home state and in professional political circles a matter of months ago, could not only run this year but find himself widely proclaimed, months before any votes were counted, as the front-runner, probable early victor and answer to his party's prayers for a new approach. Clearly, he has outstanding qualities, including an incisive, well-organized mind and a gift for leadership; the Rhodes scholarship selection committee recognized that when he was a lad. But under the old system, he would have found it hard to project them onto the national screen from Little Rock.
Under the old system the party elders would have looked into the reports, which everyone in politics had heard, about Mr. Clinton's marital problems and draft record, and at least tried to evaluate whether they were serious impediments to a candidacy. Under the old system, in which the candidates tended to be people already known to the public, the revelations that have undercut Mr. Clinton's standing might have been less damaging.
Only superficially known or understood, the out-of-nowhere candidate is vulnerable to being blown off course by the first puff of bad news.
None of this completely explains why many people think Mario Cuomo, say, is a man of substance and Bob Kerrey, say, is not. Most Americans, including those who want him to run, would be hard pressed to name Mr. Cuomo's main accomplishments as governor, and many Americans know that Mr. Kerrey is an authentic war hero. Yet the New Yorker is widely seen as the heavyweight.
Some people are natural leaders, whether in football or Wall Street or national politics, and people sense it. They are born dancers, not awkward yokels who get through Arthur Murray's and forget the steps the minute they step onto a real dance floor. And some people seem to embody or at least to make credible connections to party and national tradition, while others seem manufactured, all too ready to mouth tomorrow today's poll reports.
It may be that Mr. Tsongas, now widely considered the pace-setter, will move steadily through the primaries and win the nomination, or that one of his active rivals will. But that seems unlikely to many, which is one reason why the "unauthorized" write-in campaign on behalf of Mr. Cuomo, who delights in its every move, attracted so much attention last week. If he or any of the others is to jump in, it would have to be soon; many filing deadlines have already passed, and others lie just ahead.
"If Bill Clinton doesn't weather the storm, you'll see a groundswell for others, and the best positioned is Gephardt," said Representative Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat. Mr. Bentsen says he's as reluctant as ever, but when he was asked in Texas the other day whether he was happy with his decision not to run, he said, "Some days I am and some days I'm not."
For the moment, it's mostly talk. There are reports of discreet inquiries by "friends" of possible candidates, meaning members of their staffs, as to the possibilities in South Carolina, Maine and California. The Draft Cuomo Committee is working on Massachusetts and Illinois and Missouri.
These things usually come to nothing. But in the years since Vietnam fractured Democratic comity, stranger things have happened. This is the party, after all, that nominated George McGovern and Jimmy Carter, neither of whom, a year before the event, seemed to those ubiquitous party leaders to have any business in the race.

Rating the Field, In the Imitable Style of George H.W. Bush

 BODY:
One way to understand a political campaign is to put yourself in the place of a candidate. Maureen Dowd, a Washington correspondent of The Times, last week asked several Bush advisers to say, as frankly as they could, what they are telling the President about the Democratic Presidential field in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary -- and what Mr. Bush himself thinks of his would-be opponents. Ms. Dowd was inspired to submit the results in the style that has come to be known as Bushspeak.
 
Memo from George Bush Re: The Competition
Mother told me not to gloat. Don't use the Big I. Still, got to gloat a little. In secret. Sure, I know things are looking b-a-a-a-d for the home team right now. Approval ratings cratering. Voters in New Hampshire very angry at me about the economy in the ditch and raising taxes and running around with my pals, Mikhail and Boris and Kiichi and Francois. Pat Buchanan, tattling on me for being a moderate, says I'm like a 5-year-old and can't handle Congress. Oh yeah? Serves him right if John Sununu takes his place on "Crossfire." 
 Didn't think that protectionistic thing and that phony swagger would go over. Buchanan is saying I'm not Reagan II, I'm Skull and Bones I, and at the campaign they joke that it's a rumble between the Dead End Kids and Greenwich Dancing Class. But it won't be too funny if Buchanan gets 37 percent in New Hampshire and 25 in Super Tuesday, as my friends on the right are predicting. Watching that guy's "Read My Lips" makes me go ballistic.
But then I look at the Democrats, acting so weird and crazy, and I know we're going to be able to keep our snorkel above the waterline and get another four years. My campaign guys say we should feel lucky. Democrats didn't send in their first team, and the second string is having a power outage.
Clinton -- history. Paul Tsongas? Bring him on. Bye-bye wimp issue. I wish he'd stop reminding people that I didn't know what a supermarket scanner was. But anybody who likes the capital gains tax cut can't be all bad. There are a couple of worry warts in our polling office who say that Tsongas fits the profile of the kind of candidate voters want: No lies. No excess promises. The fact that he isn't smooth means he doesn't come across as a real politician, and that's good. They're worried that Tsongas might have some kind of reverse chic, and then we'd have to go with reverse reverse chic, but they don't know what that means yet.
Not worried, though. Not worried. Not worried. Message: Not Worried. The voters had their choice between hyperthyroid and no thyroid in '88 and they chose me. No one here believes that the Democrats will ever let Tsongas be the nominee anyhow. Once he goes South, he's dead meat. The South'll never go for another short, preachy Massachusetts liberal with a funny name who believes in gay rights. O.K., he wasn't a governor, but are we sure he didn't furlough anybody?
Harkin. What's that Jim Croce song? Meaner than a junkyard dog. He'd be the easiest to beat, but he'll burn himself up before I get to him. Dinosaur. Windbag. Don't like him, and hate it when he calls me George Herbert Walker Bush and the Vice President J. Danforth Quayle. It's bad manners. People should leave those kind of personal insults to staff.
Jerry Brown has a good message on the outsider thing but he's out there with the floating rings of Jupiter. I mean, what's with the turtlenecks?
My guys were worried about Bob Kerrey in the beginning. Thought he had the best story and could get the baby boomer vote.
Got mad at Kerrey for going nasty on the flag-burning thing in 1989. Accused me of exploiting the issue for my own benefit. I admire the young man's heroism in Vietnam, but what's with that guy? Think it comes down to desire. I'm willing to do what I have to do to get re-elected. He doesn't seem to have it in his gut. I agree with Eddie Mahe, who said, "You can have a kid playing class A or class AA ball and then they hit the big leagues and it falls apart."
Pamela Harriman will probably be reconvening everybody out at her farm this week. As Ed Rollins says, "If Clinton goes down, this field ain't it."
Wouldn't mind if Lloyd Bentsen got in. He beat me for the Senate once, but I could take him this time. He's no George Bush.
Gephardt? Tried to kiss and make up, and he's been helping me out with some legislation on Capitol Hill. Doro dates his aide, Bobby Koch. Don't know if he'll be my son-in-law, but there's a connection there. But Dick would get so personal and cutting. I just wouldn't like it.
Of course, the one who would really drive me nuts is Cuomo. My guys are divided about him, with some saying he's formidable and others saying he's overrated.
Cuomo is indecisive and geographically undesirable and he can't do retail politics. Can you see Mario Cuomo sitting on a hay stump in the middle of a wheat field or eating a tamale at a Texas barbecue? You think my pork rinds and country music was a stretch? Wait until the South gets a load of Teilhard de Chardin.
They say I'm thin-skinned and obsessed about the media. Bet he'd spend most of his time on the trail racing for the papers and magazines to see what was being written about him.
Using the hot line to Albany to encourage the Republicans up there to keep the pressure on, to make Cuomo's life as unpleasant as possible. Don't want him turning my horseshoe pit outside the Oval Office into a basketball court.
He's still flirting with getting in, and if he did, it would be class warfare. We'd get so far under each other's skin that some people would call it a transplant.
Cuomo told one columnist that I make him feel like the guy who comes to clean the swimming pool. Well, he tries to turn me into a cross between Rudy Vallee and Marie Antoinette. Calls me "the guy in the white shoes." Says I'm "throwing bon bons to a starving nation." Those kind of snide, cheap attacks send me up the wall.
But if he could get to me, I could get to him, too. In his Harvard speech the other night he sounded like just another Doom-and-gloom-o-crat, defending welfare and tax hikes. If he tried all his semantic voodoo mumbo-jumbo with me in a debate, all that stuff about "Pelagianism" and "palliatives" and "econometric models" and "the cyclical gods of the economy," I'd just turn to him and say, "Lighten up, Mario. Come over to the White House and we'll throw some 'shoes. And by the way, if you're so smart, why is New York such a mess?"

When the Bad Guy Is Seen as the One in the Green Hat

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When he bought 56 acres in Commerce City, Colo., in the 1970's to make room for his expanding business, Kenneth S. Valis believed he was investing in the future of the Colorado Paint Company. But in the 1980's, when a landfill that bordered on his property was found to be an abandoned toxic waste dump, Mr. Valis's purchase suddenly turned into a nightmare caused not by pollutants, but by the Government's environmental protectors.
Under provisions of the 1980 Superfund law giving the Environmental Protection Agency broad powers to clean up toxic dumps, the agency put a lien on Mr. Valis's property, erected a fence around it, dotted the landscape with monitoring wells, pumps and piping and then barred any other use of the ground while the dump was being cleaned up, a process that could last 30 years. 
 Last November, Mr. Valis filed suit in the United States Claims Court in Washington, charging that the Government's cleanup work was tantamount to seizing his property, and demanding just compensation.
Across the country, cases like this are fueling a broad movement to roll back the Government's authority to enforce environmental laws. The steadily growing strength of the environmental movement, culminating in enactment of the Clean Air Act in November 1990, is now encountering a backlash in Congress, the courts and in the streets. For example, loggers in the Northwest who have been protesting Government restrictions on cutting the region's last virgin forests to protect endangered spotted owls have succeeded in turning the issue into a moral question over a family's right to earn an honest living. A committee of Bush Administration Cabinet secretaries is set to resolve the dispute later this year.
"What we're talking about is advancing the notion of balanced environmental protections," said Jackie Lang, spokeswoman for the Oregon Lands Coalition, a group in Salem that represents forest industry workers, property owners, logging companies and other users of natural resources. "We're finding that most of these environmental laws are pushed by professional environmentalists. They are power-hungry people who put plants and animals above middle America."
George T. Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, said the backlash is being driven by conservative groups that believe environmentalism has replaced Communism as the No. 1 enemy. "They have fixed on environmentalism as the green phase of international socialism," he said. "It's flying in the face of what's happening in the world and it's flying in the face of what business is doing in this country. The business community is looking toward the 21st century. This movement is looking to drag us back to the 19th century."
 
City Slickers
 The strength of the property rights movement, as it is often called, comes from the joining of the old wings of the 1970's Sagebrush Rebellion in the West -- miners, loggers, ranchers and energy companies -- with private landowners in the East and South. Many of those living in rural regions east of the Mississippi River were once city slickers who moved to the country only to discover that their land had been declared a restricted wetland, lay near an unknown toxic waste site or was home to an endangered species.
Among the leaders of the movement is Peggy Reigle, who left her job as vice president of finance at The Daily News in New York and bought an abandoned 138-acre farm for $400,000 on the eastern shore of Maryland in 1988. She wanted to sell 14 lots and discovered that the wetland laws barred her from developing at least part of the land and scared buyers away. She is now chairman of the Fairness to Landowners Committee, a group of 8,800 property owners in 30 states whose aim is to limit protection to only the most valuable wetlands, allowing development on the rest. "It's a national crisis," she said. "Landowners, and I mean moms and pops, not oil companies and miners, are being abused by restrictions that no longer make sense. Their lives have been devastated and their land is being held hostage by these laws."
Up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, the councils of government are taking note of the backlash. After complaints by landowners that rules for developing low-lying forests and other wetlands were too strict, President Bush last summer proposed changes that would make half of the nation's wetlands eligible for development.
In the United States Claims Court, conservative judges appointed by President Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, are beginning to rule in favor of property owners. Late last year, in the largest award to date, the Department of the Interior was directed to pay a Wyoming coal company $150 million because it barred the company from mining coal in a protected area.
Lawyers representing environmental groups say that if the trend continues, the cost of enforcing ecological protections could cripple the Government's regulatory programs. But other legal experts say the decisions are a logical result of the judicial concern that in aggressively enforcing its environmental laws the government is overstepping its authority and violating basic rights.
 
'Reasonable' Limits
 "These decisions reflect the view that our constitutional legal system can accommodate property rights and environmental protections," said Roger Marzulla, a former Assistant Attorney General who helped shape the Reagan Administration's policy on environmental regulation and property rights. "Where there are environmental gains that overwhelm constitutional liberties, it is perfectly reasonable to set some limits."
In Congress, a telling indication of the property movement's influence is the reluctance of environmental leaders in the House and Senate to open the 1972 Clean Water Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act to amendment. Although the statutes are due to be renewed this year, lawmakers of both parties say the property rights movement has attracted considerable support for new amendments that could weaken both laws.
"The mood in Congress is not currently friendly to environmental initiatives," said William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. "The mood was already negative before we began to encounter economic problems, and it's gotten worse in the last few months."
The attack of the property rights movement comes at a vulnerable time for environmental groups. After a decade of rapid expansion that led to ever larger staffs and the construction of plush national headquarters in Washington, New York and San Francisco, groups like the National Audubon Society, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation find themselves in the uncomfortable position of being identified with the establishment -- the regulators enforcing the stronger new laws.
"The property rights backlash is the most important challenge to the modern environmental movement that has appeared in years," said Erik J. Meyers, general counsel of the Environmental Law Institute in Washington. "What's been surprising though is that the environmental groups have done almost nothing to counter it."
Environmental leaders around the country agree the movement is losing its edge. "We have become complacent, and the organized interests that are winning on some of these issues should have been expected," said William R. Neil, assistant director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society. "Anybody who doubts that should see how much ground we lost on the wetlands issue, which we thought was in the bag."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Stressing Foreign Policy Could Cut Both Ways

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
President Bush has always been supremely conscious of his place in history, insisting on conducting what he considered his statesman's duties long after his political advisers told him he'd better pay more attention to domestic matters.
Mr. Bush does want to be re-elected, and he recognizes that economics, not diplomacy, is driving the 1992 campaign. But his aides say he is convinced of two things: There is not much he can really do about the economy, even though he knows he must appear to be trying, and his greatest strength as a candidate is his record as Commander in Chief and diplomat. 
 Indeed, former President Richard M. Nixon had some advice that Mr. Bush might well find palatable: Push foreign policy as hard as possible. "People are feeling safe enough in the world that they just might feel they can afford the luxury of a Democratic President," Mr. Nixon told a group of reporters recently.
But for Mr. Bush, following such a course is a formidable challenge this year, for his strength in foreign policy could yet turn into his greatest weakness.
To maintain his obvious heavy advantage over the Democratic field, Mr. Bush not only has to address economic issues. He must also find ways to make expertise in foreign affairs relevant, or at least remind Americans of his accomplishments on the world stage.
And he has to do that without raising questions about which of Mr. Bush's driving forces is dominant: his vision of himself as the world's leader or the imperative of being re-elected. As Mr. Bush starts talking more about foreign affairs, as he certainly will after the Democrats choose a candidate with few or no credentials in foreign affairs, it may become difficult to tell foreign policy and politics apart.
Clearly, undertaking some adventure overseas would invite accusations of playing politics with national security, especially if it involved, say, new fighting in Iraq. On the other hand, Mr. Bush could argue that he cannot abandon his duties and that scheduled events -- a drug conference this month, a Russian-American summit, a meeting of the industrialized democracies in July -- are in the national interest and obligatory. But even that has perils. "I hope the economy is better by the time Bush gets back into foreign policy heavily, because if it isn't, he may find himself severely criticized for not staying at home and dealing with our problems," said John P. Sears, a former campaign manager for Ronald Reagan.
In addition, each foreign policy issue facing Mr. Bush has the potential of putting him in a double bind.
It is in Mr. Bush's interests on one level to talk about the Persian Gulf war, which he does at every opportunity. But he may simply be reminding voters that Saddam Hussein remains in power. "It's a clear negative if he doesn't get rid of him," said Senator John C. McCain, Republican of Arizona. But another Republican, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, said it would be tough to take on Mr. Hussein. "If Saddam makes a bad move or it's discovered that he's much farther along in nuclear development than we thought, I don't think Bush would hesitate to whack him. But I don't think he wants to for the very reason that he would be criticized for doing it for political purposes."
 
Acting Presidential
 Mr. Bush's advisers believe his leadership in the West's response to the breakup of the Soviet Union can reinforce his image of acting Presidential, and he is to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia by mid-summer. "Letting people know he is doing everything he can to demolish those weapons of mass destruction that are laying all over the former Soviet Union could be a big plus," Senator McCain said. But the Russians just do not seem so threatening, and Mr. Bush will be hard-pressed to give Mr. Yeltsin much financial help.
In July, the leaders of the industrialized democracies will gather in Munich to discuss trade issues. Mr. Bush can demonstrate his diplomatic skills and drive home a favorite point: that foreign policy and domestic policy are inextricably tangled. The problem is, he stumbled badly on his last trade outing, in Japan; the last thing he and his campaign want is for him to come back again with nothing concrete to offer.
The Middle East could offer Mr. Bush some political relief -- if Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's efforts to get real peace talks moving succeed. But that is no sure thing, and Mr. Bush seems content to stay out of this diplomatic snarl, apart from saying his "new world order" made the talks possible.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush can try to find the proper balance between showing he cares about the economy and being Presidential abroad. He can also do what he has been doing, which is to try to stir patriotic sentiments over the gulf war and take credit for ending the cold war. But Mr. Bush is left sounding at times almost as if he is pleading when he makes his case for Americans to stay attuned to foreign affairs.
"The America we know is a country ready to take on the world and rise to new levels," he said last week. "Never in this nation's long history has America turned its back on a challenge and we are not going to start now. A proud America will never be protectionist. It will never be protectionist."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Customers Feeling Less Than Friendly To Friendly Bankers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Several weeks ago, with a record number of homeowners seeking new mortgages to take advantage of low interest rates, Bank of America imposed a hefty new fee on refinancing applications in California. To the San Francisco-based bank, which was struggling to keep up with the immense demand for refinancing, the fee was a reasonable way to discourage all but serious customers from applying, especially since the fee would be applied to the transaction's closing costs or refunded if the loan was rejected.
But to many consumers, the fee -- 1.5 percent of the loan amount, up to a maximum of $3,000 -- was yet another example of arrogance and high-handedness at financial institutions. "It's outrageous," said Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, a consumer advocacy group in San Francisco. "In the eyes of the consumer, the bank is saying, 'We're so big that you don't have a choice, and if you want to do business with us, you'll have to toe the line.' " 
 Indeed, despite some overall success by banks in improving their service, the relationship between customers and financial institutions often seems more tenuous, and sometimes more hostile, than ever before.
Consumers have plenty to gripe about. Their local savings and loan may well have failed, and they are paying with tax dollars for the $300 billion bailout of the industry. Their bank may well have merged with another, often forcing them to do business with a company they did not choose, or cope with a local branch closing.
People pay $20 or more in some cases for bouncing a check. Many are still paying a 20 percent interest rate on their credit-card balances, even though general interest rates, and the rates paid on savings accounts, are the lowest in decades. And if they have tried to refinance a mortgage recently, as hundreds of thousands of homeowners have, they probably found the process slow and expensive. "There is no question that there is anger on the part of consumers towards financial services companies," Mr. McEldowney said.
The growing resentment comes at a time when banks need customers more than ever. "Service quality is very much on the minds of most of the bankers I talk to," said Joe Belew, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group in Washington. "Banks are trying to serve their customers better because there is more competition out there. Detroit makes auto loans and the phone company offers a credit card. Consumers have more choices than ever before."
Banks have also been motivated to treat customers better because retail banking -- selling savings and checking accounts, credit cards and loans to consumers -- is a far more attractive business right now than most other aspects of banking. That has remained true even though many banks, including Citibank, have recently been troubled by recession-inspired problems with consumer loans. Loans to real-estate developers have proven to be a disaster in recent years. Big corporations have increasingly eschewed bank loans, opting instead to raise money on Wall Street or by issuing their own paper. And banks in this country learned that loans to foreign countries were too risky.
 
Customers vs. Cutbacks
 The drive for customer service, however, has often run head on into the push by banks to reduce their costs by closing branches, laying off workers and encouraging sometimes reluctant consumers to use teller machines instead of tellers. A number of years ago Citibank barred all customers in New York with balances of under $5,000 from using human tellers, relegating them to the cold if perhaps more efficient and cost-saving world of automation. The move infuriated customers, and Citibank was forced to reopen its teller lines to everyone.
A survey done last year for The American Banker newspaper by the Gallup Organization found that 66 percent of those surveyed were "very satisfied" with their financial institutions. The results suggested that customer satisfaction was increasing after having declined several years earlier.
Richard Beebe, a spokesman for Bank of America, said the bank now gives bonuses to branch employees based in part on service quality. Training procedures now stress the importance of calling customers by name, knowing the banks' services and being courteous.
So why did Bank of America slap new fees on refinanced mortgages? To improve service, Mr. Beebe said. The bank has been overwhelmed with applications, he said, and much of the work going into processing them is for naught when customers choose to go somewhere else for a loan, or to wait a little longer to see if rates drop further.
"People expect when they go into any kind of home-loan transaction that it will take some time. But when the system gets as full as it is now, it takes longer and longer, and people get frustrated," Mr. Beebe said. "We want to direct our resources to customers who are most serious about refinancing with us so we can provide them the highest level of service."
Consumer advocates say that many other banks have set much more moderate fees for the same purpose. They also wonder about how the bank will treat its customers during and after its pending $4 billion merger with the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles, the largest banking merger to date. Bank of America has not provided any details yet, but the merger is expected to involve large-scale branch closings and the layoff of thousands of employees from the combined companies.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
A New Attempt to Get Ireland Going Again

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY

DATELINE: DUBLIN

 BODY:
In his time, Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey was castigated for being an over-spending populist, and praised for streamlining Irish finances and nourishing the modest boom of the late 1980's. Few leaders before him in this country's 70 years of independence had dominated Irish political and economic life as Mr. Haughey, who was forced out last month from the post he had held for 8 of the last 12 years amid economic recession and allegations of corruption among his friends.
Stories of Mr. Haughey's conviviality and wit are being retold now with fondness, and some sense of metaphor. There is the time, some 20 years ago, he told his drinking chums, that he was stopped by a policeman while driving the wrong way on a one-way street. 
 "Did you not see the arrows?" the stern officer said.
"Arrows?" the dashing politician replied, "To tell the truth, guard, I didn't even see the bloody Indians."
Mr. Haughey's successor is hoping for better luck. Albert Reynolds, a former finance minister who has in his time dressed up as a cowboy and sung country and western, knows the arrows of Irish political life. He has probably two years to get the country moving again before the next general election.
The country of 3.5 million people he is trying to revive has a mixed view of itself and its social and economic problems. On one hand, Ireland is among the 30 wealthiest nations in the world. But it is one of the poor members of the European Community, down at the bottom of the 12 with Portugal and Greece. The Irish countryside is still a series of dream-inducing green hills, lakes, bays and fields, unspoiled by pollution, as the Industrial Revolution missed this country and left it largely unspiked with smokestacks, its rivers and streams full of clean fish.
But there are also growing suburban slums and an unemployment rate of 20 percent. Perennial social issues like divorce and the availability of condoms are expected to face renewed heated debate in Parliament, where politicians who want change also do not want to be seen as opposing views of the Roman Catholic Church in a country that is 95 percent Roman Catholic.
The social and economic roots of Ireland's condition are tangled, but traceable. As a Catholic country, where the church opposes contraception, Ireland has the highest birth rate in Europe. And it has heavy emigration. In the late 1980's, young Irish men and women were finding work in America, Britain and Australia, leaving here at a rate of about 30,000 a year. They sent home millions to their families and, by staying abroad, kept unemployment relatively low. But the world recession hurt, especially in America, drying up construction and hotel jobs. Ireland's net emigration dropped to zero in 1990.
 
New Job Sources
 Each year the good Irish school system puts about 25,000 new people in the job market, but the country only produces about 2,500 new jobs. Officials like Desmond O'Malley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, feel that the youth of Ireland will help supply labor well into the next century to European countries like Germany, whose populations are getting older. Mr. O'Malley, leader of the Progressive Democrats party, whose support enables Mr. Reynolds to head the Government, also runs the International Development Agency, which has drawn hundreds of American and other foreign companies to Ireland, creating several thousand jobs in recent years.
But most officials, and foreign experts, feel that Ireland's economy will remain a function of the world economy, and that for now the country must hope that the European Community continues its heavy subsidies -- and that Irish agriculture adjusts to competition in the new Europe, learning, for example, to produce chocolate candy instead of raw milk, free-range lamb instead of scrawny mutton. The country, says Michael Cuddy, an economist at the University of Galway, must lose its "begging bowl" mentality.
With the economy such a preoccupation, most Irish push to the back of their minds the problem of violence in Northern Ireland. Mr. Reynolds, and other officials, however, have begun to indicate that the European Community might eventually assume a role in settling the civil war there.
The principal social issues here remain divorce and the distribution of condoms. In 1985, the nation rejected a proposal to allow civil divorce. Now, many officials say, the mood has changed and a referendum would approve divorce legislation if it provided for reconciliation attempts before a divorce was granted.
The condoms issue has had its ludicrous aspects. Liberals cite the rise in AIDS as a reason for making condoms more widely available. Conservative forces put out a pamphlet titled "67 Reasons Why Condoms Spread AIDS," which produced the threat of a counter-leaflet, "67 Reasons Why Motorcycle Helmets Spread Head Injuries."
In the upcoming debate, the most popular official, President Mary Robinson, may have difficulty getting her opinions across. Before her election she was an avowed liberal on social issues and favored a law to permit divorce. But as President, she is restrained by the Constitution from taking part in politics.
That job belongs to Mr. Reynolds, a 56-year-old former businessman who as a pet-food manufacturer was so assiduous as to taste the product himself. Now to get them to accept budget-cutting, revenue-raising reforms, Mr. Reynolds will have to cajole and sweet-talk his countrymen. He once even serenaded them, going on television in 1972 to sing a country ditty, "Put Your Sweet Lips a Little Closer to the Phone."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
The Winds of Peace Buffet Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
A rich mix of history and fate combined to create the specialized culture of military manufacturing that has thrived in Connecticut. Since the Revolutionary War, when George Washington bought his cannon here, through the days of Samuel Colt's Civil War arms empire, the Winchester trench mortar of World War I and later the Seawolf nuclear submarine, hundreds of Connecticut companies and hundreds of thousands of residents have found a niche in supplying the tools of war.
But the onslaught of the recession and the end of the cold war are forcing a stressful re-evaluation of the old military connections with Washington. Layoff announcements from both Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine maker in East Hartford, and the General Dynamics Electric Boat division in Groton have crystallized the concerns, as the state braces for 16,400 layoffs from those two companies alone over the next six years 
 In the Federal fiscal year that ended last September, Connecticut fell from its accustomed rank of No. 1 in Department of Defense spending per capita to No. 2, with only $1,289 per person in the state, down from nearly $1,800 in recent years. Massachusetts is now in first place. The 1990 number compares with $462 per capita in New Jersey and $378 in New York.
The vulnerability goes deeper still. The Department of Commerce estimated several years ago that about 70 percent of all manufacturing in Connecticut was defense oriented, either through direct Federal contracts, subcontracts with other companies or basic metals manufacturing used for weaponry.
The ungainly term that has become the rallying cry, from politicians in Hartford to the shop floors and boardrooms of the military companies, is "diversification." But industry experts, workers and elected officials say the word is misleading because it makes the harsh choices facing Connecticut seem easily managed.
The stickier reality, they say, is that Connecticut must decide all over again what it will be, especially when confronting a long-term decline in military spending. For companies, it means more than new products; it means changing the culture and learning how to sell products in the open marketplace. For the state government, battered by its own prolonged fiscal crisis, it means triage, using limited funds to help some companies and not others.
For many individual workers, like Michael Martin, diversification means deciding whether to abandon the home state or stick it out. Mr. Martin, who is 45 years old, lost his job last September as a quality-control manager after 24 years at the United Nuclear Corporation's naval products division in Montville. The company lost its Navy contract making nuclear engines for submarines in 1990, and by next January all but about 35 of its 1,150 employees will be dispersed.
 
An Exodus
 So far, Mr. Martin has drawn a job-search line in a 50-mile circle around his home in Waterford. This spring he'll widen it, and if nothing turns up by summer, he'll move. About 50 percent of all white-collar employees at the company have already left the state, according to United Nuclear officials who have tracked the exodus. Hourly blue-collar workers, by contrast, have mostly stayed, partly because new employers will help with moving expenses for executives, but usually not for shop-floor workers.
Most of Mr. Martin's former colleagues who have found jobs have taken pay cuts. United Nuclear's personnel manager, Holly Ellis, who will lose her own job at the end of this year, said for most blue-collar workers, who have retrained in fields ranging from cooking to fixing cars, earning 70 percent of the plant's average $15 an hour wage is about the best that can be hoped for.
The state's efforts at helping have been hampered by questions of whom to help and by how much. Of a $10 million diversification fund set up last year, only $200,000 has been awarded, to help a company preparing a study on how to diversify. Other proposed grants, including a $3 million award to Textron Lycoming, a tank-engine maker in Stratford, have come under sharp attack.
"Why should we invest when they didn't?" asked State Representative William R. Dyson, co-chairman of the General Assembly's appropriations committee. "A billion-dollar operation and we pay them millions to think about another way."
 
First, Layoffs
 Although there are some conversion success stories, they are few. A Wallingford company that made strongboxes to protect communications hardware in war conditions is trying to use that technology to protect utility equipment in severe storms. An engine-parts maker in Waterbury bought commercial Scandinavian technology and has landed a contract with Caterpillar.
For many of the large companies, however, the first option has been to shed workers, then try to build on what is left.
Without financial assistance, "many companies will define conversion as going from 15,000 to 5,000 employees," said the Rev. Kevin D. Bean, an Episcopal priest who has studied the state's military dependence for the last decade, and has served on various state panels studying the issue.
Another factor is time. A recent national survey of military contractors conducted by the Winbridge Group, a consulting concern in Cambridge, Mass., said that of those companies that have already tried to diversify, 65 percent needed at least a year after completing initial studies to bring a product to market.
Michael J. Cahill decided he couldn't wait. Mr. Cahill, a 45-year-old engineer, worked in military jobs for 16 years and was laid off twice, most recently by United Nuclear. Last year he moved to Florida to take a job at a strictly civilian engineering firm. But he said he had an additional reason to leave. His wife, Leonor, worked for a bank, another badly battered Connecticut industry. Last year alone 20 banks failed in the state.
"She didn't lose her job, although she probably would have," Mr. Cahill said.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
How Can You Tell a Recovery When You See One?

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Everybody's doing it, peering through the thick fog of dismal economic data, company layoffs and gloom-and-doom punditry for glimmers of an economic rebound. For those who would like to join the search for early signs of economic revival here are some suggestions about where to look.
Start with a glance at the calendar. Post-World War II recessions have tended to be relatively short, a year on average, while expansions have been relatively long. On that score, a recovery is overdue. The last wave of economic expansion crested in July 1990. Technically, the recent recession ended last spring, when the economy stopped shrinking, but actual recovery remains painfully stalled, especially for the approximately 9 million people out of work. 
 Or take a look at stock prices. When the market goes on a tear, millions of investors are betting on economic recovery and higher profits. True, Wall Street has occasionally panicked, predicting slumps when only slowdowns appeared. But it has never risen more than a few percentage points during a post-World War II recession without presaging an economic recovery. The Dow is up more than 12 percent over its early December level.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady likes to scan the papers for earnings turnarounds. They're straws in the wind, he says, showing that some of the forces that originally knocked the economy down -- bloated costs, too much inventory, shopped-out consumers -- are starting to dissipate. His favorite example: in the fall Goodyear Tire had a 10-fold profit gain from the prior year.
Keep a close eye on Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. Easier money and lower rates, which the Fed can deliver, help end downturns by making life easier for debtors and making it cheaper for companies and households to borrow. The money supply -- cash, checking and saving accounts as well as money market mutual funds -- is growing briskly after months of going nowhere. But short-term interest rates -- the cost of borrowing money for a few months -- are lower now than in a decade and a half. Three-month Treasury bills are paying less than 4 percent. The cost of long-term loans hasn't come down nearly as much but has still returned to the levels of the early 1970's, with 30-year Treasury bills paying less than 8 percent. Smaller interest payments are already making corporations a bit flusher and refinancing by homeowners has added up to billions of dollars in new buying power.
Keep a close tab on how consumers are feeling. They account for two-thirds of the economy and their mood swings have been unusually important in the current slump. When they brightened after the gulf war victory last spring, so did the economy. When they turned morose in the wake of corporate layoffs last summer and fall, spending and the economy stalled.
Alas, as of the moment, the bad mood shows no signs of lifting. The latest reading from poll takers at the University of Michigan shows that consumers remained in the dumps in the first half of February.
 
Signs of Life
 But the gloom hasn't stopped home buyers -- especially first-time buyers who are seeing the lowest mortgage rates since they got out of college -- from making down payments. Housing, incidentally, has led the economy out of every recession in post-war history. Home buying lifts demand for everything from appliances and carpets to venetian blinds. It also encourages builders to dig new foundations and hire back unemployed construction workers. And the buyers who come back to the market put a floor under sagging house prices.
So what's happening now? The moribund housing market is showing signs of life, although they're still pretty hard to detect in markets like California and New York City, which were hot in the 1980's. Housing starts are up from their lows last year in every major region of the country except the West. Single family housing starts are up 41 percent since they bottomed out last year.
Look at the neighbor's driveway. If there's a new pickup parked there, breathe a little easier. Once the economy is on the way to recovery, car sales typically pick up. That's what they've been doing in the last few weeks, though it's far too early to tell if they will have more staying power than they did last summer.
Take a stroll at the mall. Retail sales are not, strictly speaking, a leading indicator. But with consumers calling the shots these days (in the last recession, they kept stubbornly spending), buying is probably a more sensitive indicator of where the economy is heading. The Government reported last week that consumers were out buying in January. And the same report said that consumers hadn't been quite as penny-pinching between Thanksgiving and Christmas as was initially reported.
A series of declines in new applications for unemployment insurance are among the most reliable indicators that the economy is getting healthier, says Erich Heinemann, chief economist of Ladenburg Thalman, a brokerage house. Such claims have been creeping down for the last couple of weeks.
Some important numbers tell more about where the economy has been than where it is going. Joblessness typically keeps rising after recoveries begin -- partly because businesses keep staffs lean until they're sure that the orders will keep coming and partly because workers who dropped out of the labor force during the recession start looking for work again.
 
No Sure Things
 No sign, taken by itself, is a sure thing. A good way to hedge your bets is to look for a substantial and sustained rise in the so-called index of leading indicators compiled by the Commerce Department. But don't expect the sight to cheer you. After rising handsomely last year, the index has lately been slipping.
What are the pros predicting? No growth yet and maybe even another dip in the current quarter. But just wait until Memorial Day. The Blue Chip consensus of 51 economic forecasters expects a modest rebound, at a 3 percent or so annual rate, in the year's second half.
Most of the signs aren't there yet. If more bright spots fail to appear, the economists are betting that the Federal Reserve will keep pushing down rates until they do. Not a bad bet in an election year.

HEADLINE: Fiscal and Political Forces Move Pakistan to Seek Afghan Peace

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 15

 BODY:
After nearly 13 years of war in Afghanistan, the Pakistani Government has moved decisively to end the conflict, which has left more than a million people dead, devastated the country's economy and driven three million refugees, nearly a fifth of the country's population, across the border into Pakistan.
A vital supporter of the fundamentalist Islamic guerrillas in Afghanistan since Soviet tanks roared into the country in December 1979, Pakistan late last month abruptly ceased supplying arms to the rebels and endorsed United Nations efforts to end the fighting and bring democracy to the country.
 
Economic Motivations
 In doing so, Islamabad is no longer insisting on the installation of an Islamic government in Afghanistan. Instead, Pakistan now favors a United Nations plan to bring together all the factions, including representatives of the former Communist Government in Kabul, to form an interim government that would rule until elections could be held. 
 Pakistan's shift has been brought on in large part by its urgent desire for a stable Afghan government that can serve as a bridge to economic and political ties with the new Central Asian republics formed from the old Soviet Union. Many leaders in those republics are wary of Islamic fundamentalismin neighboring countries and within their own borders.
Other factors motivating Islamabad are the growing burdens placed by the three million Afghan refugees within Pakistan, the continuing ineffectiveness of the guerrillas and the staying power of the Afghan Government of President Najibullah three years after the withdrawal of Soviet forces.
"This is most significant because it marks a shift in Pakistan's attitude because for the first time it represents a political solution," said Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali, Minister of State for Economic Affairs and in large measure the intellectual force behind the change.
Pakistan's shift, in the view of senior western diplomats here, clears away the last major obstacle to ending the fighting. Nonetheless, senior Pakistani officials and diplomats caution that the ethnic, regional and political fragmentation of rebel groups may make it difficult, if not impossible, for a peace plan to succeed.
Only three of the seven main rebel groups in Pakistan have endorsed the peace process, and fundamentalist guerrilla leaders led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar have publicly rejected it.
In September, Washington and Moscow agreed to halt all weapons shipments to both the United States-backed guerrillas and the Soviet-backed Kabul Government on Jan. 1. Pakistan, however, declined to embrace the accord signed by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the former Soviet Foreign Minister, Boris D. Pankin.
 
A Political Tack
 Since then, Pakistan's approach has been shaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the glaring failures of the guerrillas on the battlefield. It has awakened to the probability that a military solution can never be achieved.
"We are looking for a steady political settlement of the problem," said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in an interview. "We have announced the support of the United Nations resolutions. We now favor very strongly a meeting of the jirga," a traditional gathering of tribal groups that has become a centerpiece of the United Nations plan.
He said he hoped that "all concerned, including the U.N., will use their best efforts to organize this. Only that will lead to a political settlement."
The shift dovetails with Washington's interest in checking the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. To some degree it is an expression of Pakistan's desire not to further alienate the United States, which is pressuring Islamabad to abandon its effort to develop nuclear arms. Pakistan, stung by American legislation cutting off military and economic aid, has gone out of its way to accommodate American concerns on other issues.
 
A Matter of Little Choice
 Riaz Mohammed Khan, soon to be Islamabad's first ambassador to Kazakhstan and a long-time policy-maker said, "The most important element was the change in the Soviet Government's attitude on an interim government. Once they accepted it, the U.N. could put forward a plan."
Pakistan's support for the guerrillas stemmed as much from its abhorrence of the Communist Government in Kabul as its own determination to conduct an Islamic war of justice, a jihad, that would bring Islamic rule to Afghanistan, an objective pressed relentlessly by Pakistan's fundamentalist parties. Even now, the parties are taking the Government to task for abandoning the guerrillas. But most officials and observers felt there was no choice.
"The Mujahedeen showed they couldn't do anything," said Maleeha Lodhi, the editor of The News, the country's newest and suddenly most successful newspaper. "Basically all the old options were exhausted."
Last year, when it became clear that the United States and the Soviet Union were going to end their involvement in Afghanistan, the guerrillas launched two major offensives, one against the provincial capital of Jalalabad and the other against the town of Gardez. In both cases, the rebels were decisively beaten back by the Afghan army.
"The lesson of Gardez is that the jihad is over," said a Western diplomat in Peshawar. "I don't think we'll see anymore large-scale fighting. The Mujahadeen just can't get anybody to fight anymore. The jihad is over. They lost."
But Mr. Ali, the Minister of State for Economic Affairs, said that Pakistan's decision to abandon a military solution had less to do with the Mujahedeen than the changes in Central Asia. It is becoming clear, he said, that Pakistan's economic fortunes will be tied to opportunities in countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.
"Basically, this was triggered off by my Central Asian visit," he said of a trip he led late last year. "They said there could be no meaningful relations with Pakistan until the Afghan problem is settled."
Already India, Pakistan's principal commercial competitor in South Asia, is moving aggressively through Central Asia. Pakistan, which places great stock in its Islamic credentials, is hoping to appeal to the Central Asian republics in part as a natural ally, and in part as an economic partner and an entrepot to the world.
Mr. Ali said that if the war ends, the road linking the republics through Afghanistan to Pakistan can be opened. He said he hopes to persuade the World Bank to finance a rail line from the republics to the port of Karachi. "This opens all of Central Asia," he said.
But he said Central Asian leaders told him repeatedly that they had no desire to see a fundamentalist government imposed in Kabul.
"Central Asia," he said, "sent us a signal: . . . 'if you try to force a solution, we will continue to supply weapons.' This was totally misread by the Mujahedeen."
The guerrillas' misreading of the republics' resolve to back Mr. Najibullah, even though Moscow had withdrawn support, was one frustration that proved decisive for Pakistan.
Another came during a visit to Islamabad by the Russian Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, last month. Pakistan had promised that five Russian prisoners of war would be turned over to him, but rebel leaders refused to give them up.
"That triggered off a whole new thinking in Pakistan," Mr. Ali said. "People began asking, are these people worth it? These people have become the biggest obstacles in the peace process and in finding a solution to the Afghan problem."
 
Grand Assembly Proposed
 Then on Jan. 25, Siddique Kanjo, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, announced that Pakistan was throwing its support behind the United Nations peace plan, a move Ms. Lodhi called the "first major foreign policy decision" by the year-old Government. Under the proposal, a gathering of 150 Afghans from all factions, a Loya Jirga, or Grand Assembly, would meet in April and form a smaller body that would function as an interim government until elections could be held. In the meantime a cease-fire would be imposed.
The ground rules exclude "controversial personalities" like President Najibullah, although his Government would be represented. Although he is one of the few national figures in Afghanistan, the rebels' hatred of Mr. Najibullah makes any role for him in a future Afghan Government extremely doubtful.
After weeks of frantic shuttling among Kabul, Islamabad, Teheran and the refugee camps in Peshawar, Benon Sevan, the representative of Secretary General Boutros Ghali who is trying to encourage the delicate political choreography necessary to bring all parties together, gave voice to the first glimmers of hope.
"The chances for a political settlement to this 13-year conflict are looking brighter than ever," said Mr. Sevan, who has spent five years trying to replace bullets with dialogue.
The Islamic fundamentalist Government of Iran, which supports two Iranian-based Afghan guerrilla groups in addition to those in Pakistan, has its own Afghan refugee problem and has expressed support for the peace plan.
However, Pakistan's decision to support Mr. Sevan's efforts was met by hostile comments from the religious right and the hard-line fundamentalist Afghan resistance groups, including the three largest and best-armed factions. The leader of rigorously fundamentalist Hezbe Islami, Mr. Hekmatyar, said, "I'm surprised to hear Sevan expressing 'optimism,' because out of 25 Mujahedeen groups based in Iran and Pakistan, 22 have flatly told him that they will never attend such an assembly."
But Pakistanis and diplomats here say that only Mr. Hekmatyar's faction and two others pose a challenge. And even if the factions refuse to go along, the Pakistanis say they have no intention of letting the fundamentalists scuttle the peace plan.
"If Benon Sevan fails in convincing these three gentlemen, then these three people will be bypassed," said Mr. Ali, "and they will become tribal brigands. This is something governments in Afghanistan have always lived with. They will be a little pocket somewhere. Everything will move ahead. They will not be allowed to be an obstacle."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK REPORT FINDS DRUG ABUSE RIFE IN SHELTERS

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Eighty percent of the homeless men housed in New York City's vast armory shelters and 30 percent of the adults in shelters for families use drugs or alcohol, most commonly cocaine, , an extensive survey by a mayoral commission has found.
This is the first survey of the homeless in city shelters to include widespread urine testing as well as face-to-face interviews in which the residents were questioned about drug and alcohol abuse. What emerged was a portrait of a far more troubled population than had previously been documented. Only a minority of the homeless needed just housing to get back on their feet, the survey found.
 
New Agency Is Sought
 In addition to extensive drug and alcohol use, the survey found, the city's homeless are hobbled by interwoven afflictions: extreme poverty, mental illness, AIDS, domestic violence and lack of education and job skills. The survey, which tested and interviewed about 1,000 of the city's 15,500 adult shelter residents, was conducted over three weeks for a mayoral commission studying the problems of the city's shelter system. 
 Citing the new evidence, the commission, headed by Andrew Cuomo, is calling for a complete overhaul of the city's efforts, including a new agency or authority to run the system, more small shelters with specialized services and new rules that would give permanent housing only to those who successfully complete treatment or training, depending on the need.
The commission's 118-page report was delivered to Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday. A copy was obtained by The New York Times.
A mayoral spokesman, Leland T. Jones, said Mr. Dinkins was pleased that the commission had "reaffirmed" the Mayor's advocacy of smaller, service-enriched shelters. He said Mr. Dinkins wanted to study the creation of a new agency to run the system "to test the theory against the reality and see if it's the best way to go."
Mr. Dinkins will meet with the commission chairman, Mr. Cuomo, on Tuesday, and will probably release the report on Wednesday, Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Cuomo, who runs a nonprofit group that operates shelters for families and who is the son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, declined to comment on the report until the Mayor had a chance to review it.
The commission's survey found differing drug use among various segments of the homeless population. The urine testing was anonymous and voluntary. Such testing generally detects drug use in the previous three days. No one was paid to participate, the report said.
 
Previous Surveys
 Over all, urinalysis of 525 men in an array of shelters, including smaller ones for people with special needs, found that 65 percent of them tested positive for alcohol or drugs, mainly cocaine. In the large barracks-style shelters, the incidence was even more common: Fully 80 percent of the men there had drugs or alcohol in their systems, again mostly cocaine.
Another 495 adults, mainly women in family shelters, were tested. In the family shelters that offered more services and privacy, drug or alcohol use was 26 percent, compared with 34 percent in the large congregate shelters. As in the shelters for homeless single people, cocaine was overwhelmingly the substance detected through urine testing.
Previous research that relied on interviews had suggested that drugs were not so pervasive. A recent survey conducted for the city found that only 18 percent of the adults in singles shelters said they were using drugs, though officials said at the time that they believed that figure underestimated the problem.
In analyzing the new data, the commission cautioned that there was tremendous diversity within the population of drug users. Some are addicted and will require long-term residential rehabilitation, while others need outpatient care, acupuncture or methadone, the panel said. For yet others, the report said, drug use is a symptom, not a cause, of homelessness, which can be traced to a knot of problems including poverty and lack of skills, as well as the general evaporation of decent-paying manufacturing jobs in the New York region.
The report noted that some of the homeless appeared to have had a drug problem before they entered the system. But others appeared to have become ensnared once they were in the shelters, which have become notorious as dangerous places where drugs are often sold openly.
George McDonald, an advocate for the homeless and one of the three commissioners who drafted the report, said yesterday that the bleakness and violence of the armories, like Fort Washington in upper Manhattan, had contributed to the high levels of crack abuse among homeless men who often spend years in such shelters.
"They do it out of despair and desperation and the utter hopelessness of the situation," he said. "They feel worthless."
Already, the highlights of the commission's recommendations, which were disclosed by some commissioners two weeks ago, have drawn praise from elected officials including City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and the Borough Presidents of Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx.
But the highlights were criticized by members of the Dinkins administration -- including Deputy Mayor Cesar A. Perales, who said he was not convinced that the commission's ideas would work. Since then, Mr. Dinkins has said the recommendations intrigue him.
 
Mayor's View
 Mr. McDonald said yesterday that the Mayor had told him that he "would be surprised by the consensus" for the commission's recommendations within his administration.
In its report, the 22-member commission harshly criticized the city's current shelter system as an exorbitantly expensive failure that fosters dependency rather than helping the homeless overcome their often crippling problems.
In particular, the commission assailed "the absurd waste and inhumanity" of the armories, where the city's Human Resources Administration spends $18,000 a year for a single man to sleep on a cot in a room with 900 other men.
The commission's report calls the $53,000 a year that city spends to keep a family in a barracks-style shelter where they have little or no privacy and few services "simply another expensive handout."
"The system was not, and is not, designed to empower a family to escape persistent poverty and dependence on government programs," the report stated.
The survey found that the typical family in the shelter system was headed by a young black or Hispanic woman with a very young child. Typically, the mothers themselves had grown up in families on welfare. One in five had been physically or sexually abused. One in 10 had spent time in foster care.
Almost one-third of the families had never had an apartment of their own and more than a third had no high school diploma and had not worked in the last year. Four of 10 families had either a mental health or drug abuse problem.
The commission called homeless single men and women "a forgotten population." While the city has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars upgrading its system for families, homeless single people -- possibly an even needier population -- have been relegated to dangerous shelters with almost no services.
"It is not enough to provide only 'shelter' to these vulnerable and troubled individuals," the report said. "Many of them need significant social services and medical attention."
Of homeless single people, 94 percent were minorities, half had served time in jail and one-fifth had been homeless for five years or more.
For these men, the commission advocated expanding the use of programs modeled on the Federal Job Corps, which provides education, training and counseling.
The commission counseled the Mayor to modify the new plan for homeless men and women that he proposed last October. The Mayor's plan, which called for the city to build and nonprofit groups to run 24 small, specialized shelters in mainly middle-income residential neighorhoods, ran into strong opposition from elected officials and city residents afraid to live near the homeless.
Instead, the commission advocated that nonprofit groups build and operate the new programs. Drug-treatment centers would probably not be placed in residential neighborhoods but in commercial or mixed-use areas or outside the city entirely, the report said.
The commission contended that private agencies could do the job better and more efficiently, while specialized programs would help the city qualify for more Federal funds to pay for drug treatment and job training.
The cost savings and increased revenues would mean that the city could provide more services to the homeless and build 5,400 units of emergency and permanent housing -- 50 percent more than the Mayor had proposed -- at the same $280 million cost as the Mayor's beleaguered five-year plan.
The commission said its approach would allow the city to pay for 1,100 more drug- and alcohol-treatment slots and 763 more permanent units.
The commission also contended that the city should ask more of the homeless themselves, even as it provides them with enriched services.
To address concerns that families living doubled up have declared themselves homeless as a way to obtain subsidized permanent housing, the commission would require the homeless to document their poverty and lack of housing alternatives before being granted shelter. Now such requirements are not generally enforced.
The commission also would require the homeless to complete treatment or training programs before placing them in permanent housing or providing them with a voucher to obtain housing in the open market.

Chart: A Portrait of the Homeless
 
Demographic, Social and Economic Background
 
Shelter residents are only slightly less educated than the general population. In family shelters, 55 percent said they completed high school and 13 percent attended college. In the single shelters, 20 percent of men and 30 percent of women attended college.
 
More than 40 percent of adults who headed households in family shelters reported having three or more children. Nationally, 27 percent of women report having three or more children.

Fifty-three percent of family shelter residents came from households that received public assistance, 19 percent were physically abused, 10 percent spent time in foster care and 18 percent lived with someone who abused drugs or alcohol.
 
At shelters for single residents, males were more likely to have been in jail -- 55 percent -- than either female residents of single shelters -- 29 percent -- or adults in family shelters -- 15 percent.

Homeless History

Almost 90 percent of the families became homeless within the last two years; half of the single ones did. Twenty-two percent of homeless single residents became homeless more than 5 years ago, compared with 4 percent of families.
 
Fourteen percent of the families said they had stayed in a street, subway or park sometime during the year before entering the shleter system, with 43 percent saying they had stayed there for a month or more during that year.
 
A large proportion of families -- 31 percent -- and singles -- 27 percent -- had never had a house or apartment of their own.

Health and Mental Health

Poor health is a serious problem for a large proportion of residents of both single and family shelters. Twenty-one percent reported a serious or chronic health problem, and about 25 percent reported having been hospitalized in the last two years.
 
A sizable proportion of reswidents of family and single shelters reported receiving treatment for mental health propblems. Ten percent of family shelter residents and 12 percent of single shelter residents said they had been hospitalized for a mental or an emotional problem.

Employment

About a third of the family-shelter resident reported working in the last year, and 72 percent said they were employeed in the last three years.
 
Single residents are more likely to have worked recently than residents of family shleters. Fifty-five percent report of the singles said they worked during the last year, compared with 32 percent of family-shelter residents. (pg. 44)

HEADLINE: The 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Surging in New Hampshire, Tsongas Is the First to Marvel

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 15

 BODY:
Before the last candidate debate, Paul E. Tsongas was in a practice session with his aides when he suddenly asked a question that sent the room into a hush.
"What do I say if they ask me, 'Did you ever?' " the sad-faced candidate said. 
 His aides leaned forward, shocked and intrigued that the blandest of the candidates was concerned about the spicy topic of marital infidelity.
"Well, did you ever?" one of his aides asked.
"Well, no," the candidate replied, "but I'm afraid if I say that, I'll sound too self-righteous."
While the other candidates in the Democratic field worry about being too slick, too cosmic, too mean and too flaky, Mr. Tsongas worries about being too pious.
And the terrified Democratic hierarchy worries about Mr. Tsongas. In a scene reminiscent of the movie "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," the candidate keeps plodding relentlessly along the trail, gaining ground, as the party leaders look over their shoulders with fear and grudging respect, wondering, "Who is that guy?"
 
Sign of Party's New Age
 That guy is the unlikeliest of front-runners -- a bland former one-term Senator from Massachusetts who suggests that his campaign theme should be the soundtrack of "Les Miserables" and who decided he ought to be a President at a time when not even his fellow Greek-Americans would return his phone calls begging for money.
And the fact that he is where he is shows what the Democratic Party has come to: It is the age of self-anointment and hand-made campaigns.
Mr. Tsongas's ambition -- or "purpose," as he calls it -- was not born in a smoke-filled room. It began in a germ-free room at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where Mr. Tsongas spent six weeks in isolation recovering from radical lymphoma therapy and deciding that he wanted to do something special with whatever time he had left. He still counts the number of days since he first felt a lump in his groin on Sept. 29, 1983: 3,058.
He did not think of running for President himself at first. He suggested to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York that he run and talked to Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. But in the end, with the sound of one hand clapping, Mr. Tsongas decided to take his beloved 86-page pamphlet, "A Call to Economic Arms," covering everything from a recycling ethic to spirituality, and run himself.
Mr. Tsongas says he believes that despite the fact that the nation andparty took years to recover from the Jimmy Carter malaise message, the voters are ready for someone unvarnished who will tell them to take their economic medicine without the sugar-coating of middle class tax cuts.
"The country knows that there's been a lot of glitz and morning-in- America years and the net result of not facing up to reality is what they're looking at now," he said. "And there comes a point in everyone's life when they get scared and say: 'Enough. Hey, we're grownups. Tell us the truth. We can handle it.' "
Last night, at a crowded 51st birthday party for Mr. Tsongas at a Holiday Inn here, his doctor, Tak Takvorian, was citing an invitation for the candidate to be the host of "Saturday Night Live" as an indication that he's ready for prime time.
But when Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas stumbled a second time and the spotlight swung to Mr. Tsongas this week in New Hampshire, he was nowhere to be found. To the utter astonishment of the pundits, his public schedule was nearly empty on Tuesday and empty on Wednesday.
Riding in his campaign van on Thursday, Mr. Tsongas was asked how he spent his day off. Without looking up from his favorite task, signing copies of his economic booklet, he replied: "I took my daughter to school. I went swimming. I spent three hours on the phone. In the evening, I spent some quiet time with the kids. I heard all the horror stories about overscheduling on the Dukakis campaign and I don't want to run around like a chicken without a head, exhausting myself and making no progress and looking haggard on television."
Mr. Tsongas, whose doctor says he has been free of cancer for five years, knows questions are raised about his health when he keeps light schedules. But he has his own way of dealing with the health issue, and it is, as usual, straightforward.
He has entered the national Masters and Y.M.C.A. swimming competitions with the strenuous butterfly stroke, not a stroke he usually swims, as "a political statement."
 
Reporters at the Y
 On Thursday at the Concord Y.M.C.A., Mr. Tsongas allowed the cameras and reporters to come with him while he went swimming.
An embarrassed Mr. Tsongas took off his sweat suit, stripped down to his bikini Speedo, and did a few laps while boom microphones hung over his head and reporters tried to ask questions without falling in the pool.
What if Roger Ailes, the conservative political consultant, and the Republicans spread rumors about his health? he was asked.
"I've issued a challenge to Roger Ailes: 50 yards of the butterfly, kiddo," Mr. Tsongas said, as he stood at the end of the pool.
When one reporter suggested that such a challenge might finish off the Falstaffian Mr. Ailes, Mr. Tsongas shrugged, saying, "If it happens, it happens."
Mr. Tsongas gets tired of being asked about his recurrent cough, and tells reporters that it is simply from a dry throat, and that Mr. Clinton has the same thing. But Dr. Takvorian says the explanation is that because of the candidate's "history of radiation," his throat tends to get drier.
While Mr. Tsongas says he knows he has to change if he wants to run the sort of campaign that could survive in the South and West and challenge President Bush, he still seems too caught up in the wonder of his sudden surge to do more than enjoy it.
"I intend to make lack of charisma the chic phenomenon of 1992," he said.
 
Marketing Plainness
 His earnest discussion of issues and his dry, self-deprecating humor delivered with Bob Newhart timing have worked well for him in small group meetings with well-informed, flinty New Hampshire voters.
But now Mr. Tsongas is struggling with the notion of how to market plainness as a national identity.
He seems to believe on some instinctive level that even though the Democrats are dubious about whether nebbish power will carry him to the convention, he must stay a minimalist.
"If I begin to be a man of many notes, then I get lost in that," he said.
His only bows to political sophistication so far: He has acquired a dozen red striped ties, a totem he respects so much that when he sees others wearing red striped ties he accuses them of wanting to be his vice president. For debates, he has learned how to sit up alertly at the table with hands folded and look directly at the moderator.
He has also learned to smile more, even though he feels like "a smiling baboon" sometimes. "Even Mario Cuomo told me to smile more," he said.
 
Sense of Amazement
 No one is more amazed at his new status than Mr. Tsongas himself, who, like the proverbial tortoise passing the hare, looks around him with a slow, blinking bemusement at the vagaries of fate.
He laughs at a newspaper column declaring of his candidacy, "I've seen the future and it isn't pretty," and he says: "You know what my reaction to this is? Wonder. If I had not lived through this, I would not have believed these things are possible."
Although the crowds and cameras have arrived, the short, pale, balding candidate is so low key that he often sidles into the midst of voters and handlers before they even know he has arrived. The stealth campaigner stands quietly, waiting for the attention to come to him, a stark contrast to politicians like Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Clinton, who force themselves upon a room.
The late-night comedians are already having a field day. Johnny Carson joked that Mr. Tsongas's slogan should be "Paul Tsongas: The Only Candidate Who Can't Get Babes."
But unlike Michael S. Dukakis, who left Democrats and Greek-Americans traumatized with his robotic delivery and failure to fight back against George Bush, Mr. Tsongas has an engaging wit. He knows that humor may leaven his preachiness and his dour economic message.
At his birthday party, his campaign played a song by the Capital Steps comedy group, "The Sounds of Tsongas," sung to the tune of "The Sounds of Silence," that suggested the candidate was boring, the voters were snoring and "the words you can profit from are written by a dweebish nerd."
 
An Egotistical Streak
 Of course, with his rising status come tougher questions, and Mr. Tsongas sometimes gets tetchy when asked about his former lobbying activities and his support of nuclear power, an unpopular position among Democrats in this state.
Those who have followed his career have noticed an egotistical streak, a moral certainty, buried within the self-deprecation, and that could turn out to be a political weakness.
At a fund-raising event one night, he told his listeners that before his surge in the polls, he sometimes wondered why he was running and felt this way toward the American public, "If they want to go to hell, let 'em go."
And at Dartmouth College last week, he snapped at a young man who talked about the dangers of radiation, referring to a nuclear plant run by a utility company that includes Mr. Tsongas as a board member.
"Don't ever lecture me about cancer," he told the student in an atypical meltdown. "When you've had it and dealt with it, then we can have a discussion."
It was the sort of thin-skinned reaction to criticism that has been rare in a campaign where Mr. Tsongas has been largely ignored. But those who have watched him over years say this sanctimonious streak is likely to surface more as he comes under more intense scrutiny.
Recalling the Dartmouth incident in an interview the other day, Mr. Tsongas said softly: "The cancer thing is very close to the surface. The one thing this campaign has done is bring a lot of old memories and emotions very close to the surface that, in normal life, are pretty far down in my psyche."
About his Democratic rivals who have promised tax cuts and easier economic nostrums, he said: "To hell with them. They all took the easy cop-out. So to hell with them."
Mr. Tsongas's no-Santa-Claus prescription for the country reflects his own fate. It is a realism shaped as much by illness as by political experience.
So as he leaves these taciturn parts for states that like a little show business with their politics, he observes, "Whatever happens, happens," and he adds, "This is when the brutal part starts."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: New Hamsphire;
DEMOCRATS OFFER EMOTIONAL DRAMA IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Feb. 15

 BODY:
The New Hampshire Democratic primary contest has produced a final weekend of emotional campaigning, with much of the drama coming from the personal appeals of two men: Gov. Bill Clinton, battling to prove the endurance of a candidacy that began with great hopes, and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, almost tearfully thanking his supporters for carrying him farther than he was ever expected to go.
Mr. Clinton campaigned with passion and seeming abandon, hoping that his campaign had now bottomed out after the furor over his draft history and was on the upswing. 
 "I want these people to see me out there working hard, reaching out to them and fighting until the last dog dies," the Arkansas Governor said today as he and his wife, Hillary, stalked the voters of Manchester, cornering every passer-by, greeting every child.
"I'm going to go out there and keep trying to cut through to the people, to tell them that I have the best message, the best record, and the best chance to change their lives," he said.
 
A Chant for '92
 Mr. Tsongas came close to tears today as he thanked campaign workers for sticking with him. "I'm so grateful," the former Massachusetts Senator said. "Without you, there would be no campaign, no credibility. I hope you feel what I feel about you."
Sounding almost awed by the status he has achieved by moving past Mr. Clinton in the New Hampshire polls, Mr. Tsongas chanted, "Three more days, three more days."
The emotional pitch of the Democratic race had its counterpart on the Republican side today as President Bush, in his most direct assault yet on his challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan, accused the conservative commentator of distorting Mr. Bush's record.
The polls this weekend show Mr. Tsongas at the head of the Democratic pack, followed by Mr. Clinton, with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska neck and neck for third place.
The Kerrey campaign has all but conceded the top spot in the New Hampshire race and is hoping to emerge from the state with enough support to go to the primaries in the West. Speaking today in Concord, Mr. Kerrey seemed relaxed and insisted he was confident of moving on.
"I look forward to debating Paul Tsongas in South Dakota," Mr. Kerrey said, referring to the Feb. 25 primary there. "It will be a much different debate."
 
Sticking to the Issues
 As with many New Hampshire primaries, political fortunes have shifted time and again in these final days. And no one is making hard predictions about the outcome after a nationally televised debate on Sunday night, an event that is expected to be a rough collision of candidates going for broke. Among the many variables is the strength of the write-in vote for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.
This is, in short, a classic New Hampshire primary, in which about 125,000 Democrats in this quirky, atypical state -- 98 percent white, ranked 40th in population -- test and torment a handful of candidates and define their party's Presidential future.
Whatever else comes out of this primary, the voters have set the framework for the national debate, forcing the candidates to produce an array of economic plans and to stick to the bread-and-butter issues that seemed lost in the 1988 Presidential campaign. Many of the voters here seem dazed by how quickly their boom of the 1980's turned to bust.
Marie Mullikin, a Derry resident who became a symbol of economic distress when she presented Mr. Harkin with a fat sheaf of home-foreclosure notices in her community, said in an interview this weekend: "This is going on all over the country, and the President says there is nothing wrong. Mr. President, there is."
All the candidates were closing with economic appeals. Mr. Kerrey's television commercials said he was running for President because "the dream of prosperity for the middle class has been shattered." And Mr. Harkin, who has escalated his attacks on his rivals in recent days, was denouncing his opponents for backing special "fast track" authority for President Bush to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
Mr. Harkin, who is campaigning as the voice of traditional Democratic values and is hustling to make the cut here as a major contender, used as his backdrop today a rubber and tire plant where workers were notified this week that the factory would close within a year and more than 200 jobs would be transferred to Mexico.
Mr. Tsongas said at his rally in Manchester that his campaign was also about "jobs, jobs, jobs," although his economic proposals are far different from Mr. Harkin's -- including a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment. And Mr. Clinton was touting his record in Arkansas "for better jobs and better education."
 
Sparks at the Finish
 Veterans of Presidential campaigns have long predicted that once the 1992 race got started, it would be a rocket sled ride, and on this, at least, they were right. No one has had a wilder ride than Mr. Clinton, who has turned these final days into a quest for political redemption. He had shot to the top of the polls here as the man with a plan for economic renewal and a keen sensitivity to the grievances of the middle class. Then came the allegation from a supermarket tabloid that he conducted a 12-year affair with a singer, and the tempest over whether he sought to avoid the draft in 1969.
For all his denials, Mr. Clinton was transformed from the man with a plan to the man with a past. All the character testing and background checking that played out over months for the candidates of 1988 has been compressed, for Mr. Clinton, to a few harrowing weeks. "Had it been any other candidate, he would have been out of the race," George Bruno, one of the Governor's New Hampshire advisers and a former state Demoratic chairman, said this weekend. "But he keeps coming back; he's very up."
Mr. Clinton is racing around the state, trying to undo the damage; the man who worried about the effect of his draft record on his "political viability" at the age of 23 is not about to let go now.
"Now I feel like we're back to where we started in this campaign," he said this weekend, straight into the camera, in a 30-minute call-in program that is part of his strategy to reach over the news media and talk directly to the voters. "Me, the people of New Hampshire, and the issues."
One of Mr. Clinton's new television commercials asserts, "He's been tested in ways the other candidates haven't," and urges, "Take another look."
Mr. Clinton asserted today that despite the draft issue his support in the South would hold firm; a round of primaries will be held there on March 3 and 10. "I feel very comfortable about where we will be when the dust clears," he said.
He shied from predictions about Sunday's debate. "Based on what's happening this week," he said with a resigned smile, "I've learned not to anticipate anything."
Equally intense are the men and women around Mr. Clinton, young Democrats who came to believe much of their early, glowing press and can smell the White House after 12 years in the political wilderness. To the Governor's allies, his careful politics -- the straddling between left and right, the attempt to reach out to the middle class and make a new Democratic case for a more active Federal Government -- represents a last, best hope for a return to power.
By this weekend, many analysts were saying that Mr. Clinton had staunched his political bleeding, although Mr. Tsongas retained his lead in the local polls. "Clinton has asked for a second chance," said Gerry Chervinsky, a poll taker who conducts nightly surveys for the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV in Boston. "And as I sit here today, I can't say it's over yet."
 
Ranking in the Polls
 In a poll published today in The Globe, conducted Thursday and Friday, Mr. Tsongas was at 32 percent, Mr. Clinton at 25 percent; Mr. Harkin and Mr. Kerrey at 11 percent each and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California at 5 percent. The poll was based on a sample of 400 people considered likely to vote in the Democratic primary on Tuesday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Polls released tonight suggested, however, that Mr. Clinton's support had begun to fall again. Still, polling in New Hampshire is mercurial, and Sunday night's debate is expected to have an enormous impact on the race.
Frank Greer, Mr. Clinton's media consultant, argues that the Governor is in the race for the long haul. "If we finish second or third, this is a campaign that has the message, the strategy, the resources, and the organization on the ground that means we will still win the nomination. We are the only campaign that can say that."
While the sleek, well-financed front-runner stumbled, the spotlight turned to the quintessential dark horse. Mr. Tsongas entered this race back in April as a regional favorite, and many expected him to fade as the contest developed. Instead, he has become a safe harbor for many voters, a reflection, in part, of the other candidates' difficulties in making a case.
Mr. Tsongas has carved out a niche as the economic truthteller of the party; he is not running to be Santa Claus, he says, to hand out tax cuts to the middle class, which most of his rivals propose. Economic recovery will be hard, he says, and in this state, dotted with foreclosure signs and closed shops, where nearly everyone has been touched by recession, there is a rough credibility to that message.
Still, some analysts say Mr. Tsongas is not fully capitalizing on his moment to present himself as a potential President, whose campaign can transcend his region -- a question that is widely asked in the party outside New Hampshire. He has stuck to a remarkably light schedule in recent days, which Mr. Chervinsky described as "a big mistake" and a missed opportunity to "close the sale."
Today, Mr. Tsongas talked with high emotion to his supporters, who have worked this state for months. He talked of the purpose that drove his campaign, the commitment to the economic measures essential for the next generation. Rather than think of "November, November, November," he said, his campaign was following "a vision to govern."
Mr. Kerrey has remained philosophical despite polls that show him lagging. "I'd like you to know that I'm not at all, and in fact it's my nature not to get, discouraged," he said at a dinner Friday night. "I understand that the good people of New Hampshire wait quite a long time to make up their minds. They decide at the last minute. Sometimes they decide and change, decide and change, a little bit like Governor Cuomo of New York."
And Mr. Harkin kept battling to the end -- and defended his strategy of hard-hitting attacks on his opponents. "I'm campaigning hard on my record," he said, "on my vision and program to get America back to work again. If that's tough, well, I'm sorry. It's a tough world out there."
All of this is playing out in a small state that has become a theme park for elections, where every snow-covered hill and town hall becomes a potential backdrop for the television cameras. Call it Primaryville -- a place that exists until Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Rockefeller Family Tries to Keep A Vast Fortune From Dissipating

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
The Rockefeller name is synonymous with the summits of wealth and philanthropic largesse. The family has founded museums, universities, philanthropic foundations, and some of the country's biggest national parks.
But, like so many Americans, the Rockefellers -- albeit on a grander scale -- are worried that their future generations may not be able to enjoy the life or influence the family now has. And so they have begun a vigorous effort to bolster their fortune, which they currently estimate at $5 billion to $10 billion. 
 For decades, the family quietly collected the interest on billions of dollars, and gave away hundreds of millions. What changed? Some family members pressed for access to the core of the fortune to increase their income. The climate for investment soured and produced lower yields. And most important, as the family grew, so did the number of people with claim to a piece of the fortune.
"Historically our goal has been the preservation of wealth rather than the amassing of wealth, but now that the client base is moving to 100 there is a new emphasis on growth," said David Rockefeller Jr., one of the many great-grandchildren of John D. Rockefeller, the family patriarch and America's first billionaire.
In trying to rebuild their legendary wealth, the Rockefellers for the last few years have made numerous and substantial private investments in Asia, Latin America and Europe. They have created a formal corporate structure under which most of their diverse business enterprises operate. And they are slowly increasing the level of risk they are willing to take in the quest for higher returns on their investments.
The family fortune has accustomed the Rockefellers to living very well indeed. But for most of this century, they have also a unique level of power and prestige that has gone hand in hand with their wealth and their tradition of philanthropy. As each generation splinters the family fortune, it is becoming harder for the family to maintain its status.
Currently, family members personally donate about $50 million a year to various causes, while foundations endowed by the family give away about $17o million each year. "The work here is to rebuild the per-capita wealth," David Rockefeller Jr. said. "But will we find another Standard Oil? Probably not."
John D. Rockefeller, an accounting clerk, became one of the richest and best-known men in the world by turning a $4,000 investment in an oil refinery business into a large stake in the Standard Oil Company, which grew into a formidable monopoly. It was broken up into smaller companies that were the predecessors of Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and others. By 1914, Mr. Rockefeller was worth more than $1 billion (adjusted for inflation, that would be about $13.8 billion today). In 1917, he gave his only son, John Jr., $460 million (about $5 billion in today's dollars).
In 1934, John D. Rockfeller Jr. established trusts for his daughter and five sons that consisted of oil company stocks and real estate holdings. These trusts still hold the bulk of the fortune. Another set of trusts were set up in 1952 for his grandchildren, the fourth generation of the family. When family members die, their trusts divide into new trusts for their children.
In the last three years, the family has hired a new team of professional money managers. They oversee Rockefeller Financial Services, as the new family holding company is called, and are also developing a money management business for institutions and wealthy families who want to invest along with the Rockefellers.
The 200 or so professionals who manage the family fortune are known within the family as either "the family office" or "Room 5600," the number of the suite where they work on the 56th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. These advisers also handle the family members' income taxes, philanthropic pursuits and legal work, insure their huge art collection and help write speeches for family members.
 
The Fourth Generation Takes the Family Torch
 The changes in the family's investment strategy also reflect the nearly complete passing of the family torch from the famous Rockefeller brothers to their children, the fourth generation. The changes are also an attempt by David Rockefeller Sr. to provide some direction to the fourth and fifth generations of Rockefellers, who are not likely to be the nexus of wealth and influence that their parents and grandparents were.
Most of the Rockefeller money is tied up in various trusts that keep the principal out of the hands of the beneficiaries, who live off the substantial interest. Some of the 1934 trusts, which hold the bulk of the fortune, will end with the death of the fourth generation, and some fifth-generation family members will immediately get possession of huge fortunes.
With that in mind, the family, prodded by David Rockfeller Sr., determined that it was time to create a structure that could provide direction, sophisticated advice and options for family members as they prepared for the 21st century.
David Rockefeller Jr., who is 50 years old, recently succeeded his father as chairman of the Rockefeller Financial Services. Virtually all the family's investments, with the important exception of Rockefeller Center, are overseen by Rockfeller Financial Services.
The mortgaging and sale of interests in the 12 original buildings in Rockefeller Center in 1985 and 1989, respectively, was one instance in which the family withdrew some of its core wealth that was tied up in real estate that paid no dividends. That complex deal, which gave the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan a majority position in Rockefeller Group Inc., the company that owns the buildings, allowed the family to take $2 billion out of their New York real estate portfolio at the peak of the 1980's property market.
The money was put into the trusts that hold most of the family wealth and greatly increased the interest income that some family members collect annually.
 
'If You Don't Have It You Can't Give It Away
 "Until the very recent past people didn't care too much whether the company was making money as long as their account was doing well," said John Harris, the chief executive of Rockefeller Financial Services. "It had to become more of an institution and David and Laurance kicked off a study of the family office three years ago that reached the conclusion that a certain critical mass and growth was needed.
"If you don't have it, you can't give it away," said Mr. Harris of the family's prospects for continued philanthropy. "It's a little like the royal family. Charles and Diana, for example, spend most of their time raising money for philanthropy."
The Rockefeller offices are in many ways quite modest, even pinched. It consists of a warren of small individual offices, the furnishings largely nondescript. But on the walls are European paintings and works of African art that would do many a museum proud. David Rockefeller Sr.'s modest suite, for example, is dominated by a large Chagall painting.
Rockefeller Financial Services has five main arms. Rockefeller & Company is the money management arm, with over $3 billion in its care, more than two-thirds belonging to members of the family. Each participating family member has a separate account that is managed according to his income and growth needs as well as tolerance for risk in investments.
David Rockefeller Jr. said the family hoped for a 10 percent annual return on its investments and was looking abroad for opportunities.
There are also several pooled funds that combine various pieces of the family fortune. Several hundred million dollars in Rockefeller & Company comes from large institutions like universities that invest some of their endowments with the Rockefeller family office.
Rockefeller & Company has been managing institutional money for about 10 years but only recently has begun to make money management a source of profits for the family. For its institutional clients, the company has about 15 percent of the money in fixed-income securities and cash, 51 percent in large stocks, mostly European, 31 percent in small stocks and 3 percent in private joint-venture deals.
For the family, the company has roughly 8 percent of its money in 14 joint venture deals in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Most of the money is in equities, with roughly 35 percent in large capitalization stocks, another 30 percent in fixed-income securities and the balance in an array of small capitalization stocks, private deals and cash. The Rockefellers believe that the best returns in the next few decades will be in the developing nations of Asia and Latin America.
Among the 14 ventures are Elex Computer Inc., in South Korea, which distributes Apple Computer Inc.'s equipment in Asia and also provides consulting services to businesses, and Gwalia Consolidated Inc., an Australian mining company with a large gold mine and valuable properties.
A second family arm is Venrock, the family's enormous venture capital arm. It has invested in more than 70 small technology companies in Silicon Valley and New England. Eleven of those start-up investments were brought to the public markets last year, allowing the family to take some profits and make 1991 one of Venrock's most profitable years since Apple Computer went public.
So far this year one Rockefeller-backed company, Gilead Sciences of Foster City, Calif., has gone public. Two others, Opta Food Ingredients Inc. and Agridyne Technologies Inc., have registered to make initial public offerings.
A third arm is the Rockefeller Trust Company, the only private trust incorporated in New York State. It manages nearly 300 family trusts, a few of which are philanthropic.
Another arm is the Rockfeller Insurance Company, which provides family members with liability coverage for their work as directors and officers of many corporations and charities.
The fifth arm is Acadia Risk Management, an insurance broker that places policies for the family's enormous art collections, real estate and private planes. David Rockefeller Sr.'s art collection, alone, was valued at $500 million several years ago.
Only David, 76, and Laurance, 82, survive from the family's third generation, which included Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, former Vice President and Governor of New York, Winthrop Rockefeller, former governor of Arkansas, and John D. Rockefeller 3d. Until the early 1980's there was no organized Rockefeller family business to speak of, only a handful of extremely wealthy individuals who lived off the income generated by trusts and who informally shared the costs of running the family office.
Laurance Rockefeller has pushed for greater access to the family fortune. He was also central in pushing the trustees to complete the Rockefeller Center deal. Described as a deeply introspective man, he is currently the biggest philanthropist in the family, parting annually with tens of millions of dollars for environmental causes, hospitals and universities.
 
Donations Often Exceed His Income
 In June 1990, for example, he pledged $21 million to create a Center for Human Values at Princeton, his alma mater. He has also given about $40 million to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. Laurance is believed to have given away more than $200 million of his own money, and according to Mr. Harris, his donations often exceed his income. He has even managed to persuade the trustees of the 1934 trusts to allow him to invade his trust and give away part of the principal.
The Rockefellers are not alone in contending with low rates of return on many investment vehicles of the 1980's. Many people with big money are on the prowl for places to put some of it.
"In the 1980's with investments in the stock market, the bond market, initial public offerings and real estate you almost couldn't go wrong," said David Horn, a senior vice president of the Northern Trust Company, which provides administrative and consulting services to wealthy families. "In the 1990's you're seeing the collapse of some of these investments and so you're seeing families at this level trying to fight the ravages of taxes and inflation by reaching into riskier direct investments."
He added: "Unless you do some pretty innovative things and look at nontraditional way to grow assets, having a few billion dollars now won't be enough if you have the kind of philanthropic world vision that the Rockefellers do."
Granted, none of the younger Rockefellers are impoverished. But some want more income from the family's wealth. Only two of the fifth-generation Rockefellers are direct beneficiaries of the 1934 trusts, which generate most of the annual income. The 1952 trusts support mainly the fourth generation. In the fifth and sixth generations, most members are supported by small trusts their parents and grandparents set up at their birth.
Some of the younger Rockfellers have demonstrated an interest in business. Peter Rockefeller, for instance, a 34-year-old grandson of Nelson A. Rockefeller, is studying for a master's in business administration at Dartmouth's Amos Tuck School, and 31-year-old Steven Rockefeller Jr. recently completed an M.B.A. at Yale's School of Management. The latter, whose father apparently gave him shares in the company that owns most of Rockefeller Center, is one of the few members of the fifth generation whose income increased substantially with the mortgaging of the property and the sale of the company to Mitsubishi.

HEADLINE: U.N. Finds Haitians Who Fled Anew

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 15

 BODY:
United Nations officials said today that interviews at a United States-run refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were turning up numerous cases of Haitians who fled their country and were intercepted and returned, only to flee a second time from what they said was repression by the army or police.
The statements from these people, gathered by officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, contrast starkly with the Bush Administration's position, repeated in arguments before the Supreme Court on Friday, that there is no evidence of mistreatment of Haitians who are forcibly returned to their country.
 
'Specially Targeted'?
 The United Nations refugee specialists said that in recent days 35 Haitians who fled their country a second time aboard small boats have already been identified, and one official predicted that "many more will be emerging." 
 These Haitians are not on a list of 41 people at Guantanamo who officials say will soon be allowed into the United States to pursue political-asylum claims.
The 41 all say that they have fled twice. But they left Haiti together on Jan. 9, raising questions among some officials whether they concocted their stories as a group. United Nations refugee experts said that those more recently identified as having fled a second time came from different areas of Haiti and left individually.
"The one outstanding feature of all their stories," said a United Nations official who is familiar with the interviews, "is that they say they have been specially targeted as being repatriates who have denounced the Haitian authorities to the U.S. I can't assure you that they are all telling the truth, but having listened to them carefully, I have no reason to doubt them."
Since the refugee crisis began in October, the month after a coup deposed Haiti's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Washington has insisted that most of more than 15,000 people who have fled Haiti are economic refugees, not political refugees.
On Friday, Justice Department lawyers submitted to the Supreme Court the results of Government investigation into the claims of 4 of the 41 refugees seeking asylum. The Court is hearing an appeal from immigration-rights groups hoping to prevent or postpone the Haitians' return.
State Department officials and diplomats said that these four refugees were chosen because their accounts of repression in Haiti offered the most detail of arrests, manhunts and killings. But they said that field investigations in Haiti turned up nothing that would corroborate their accounts and much to rebut them.
 
Coffee, and No Sympathy
 "In one case, one of our officers had coffee with two of the people who had supposedly disappeared," a State Department official said. "In another case, one of the refugees who said he had been a political activist alleged that he had taught at a particular school. We went to the school and they had never heard of him. We talked to local activists and they had never heard of him."
Immigration-rights advocates strongly criticize the Government for focusing on only 4 of the 41 cases and said all the claims of political persecution in Haiti should be investigated before more people are sent back.
A leader on the Haitians' behalf, Arthur C. Helton, director of the refugee project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said: "The United States authorities are hopeful that any concern at the Supreme Court can be assuaged by preliminary investigations into four individuals and a general assurance that thorough investigations will now occur.
"But it is increasingly clear that the political decision to pursue forced repatriation with a vengeance has overwhelmed even these disturbing reports of abuses, and there is no reason to believe serious attention will ever be paid to the claims of these individuals."

HEADLINE: Baker's Trip to Nations Unready for Independence

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TASHKENT, Uzbekistan, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's journey through six former Soviet republics began a week ago in Moldova with a small scene that set the tone for the whole trip. When Mr. Baker's sleek white-and-blue Air Force 707 rolled up to the V.I.P. terminal at Moldova's main airport, there was no one at the bottom of the stairs to greet him.
Karen Groomes, Mr. Baker's protocol aide, descended the stairs first, looked around, and saw five men standing stiffly about 30 feet away, staring at Mr. Baker's plane with that deer-caught-in-the-headlights look in their eyes. It seems that the Moldovans had entertained few state visitors recently, and they had forgotten the drill. Ms. Groomes gently motioned them to come to the bottom of the stairs to receive Mr. Baker in the manner to which he is accustomed. 
 Similar scenes were repeated throughout the Caucasus and Central Asia, as though these outlying republics, which for 70 years were run from Moscow, were taking their first tentative steps in international diplomacy by playing host to the American Secretary of State. These encounters in Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan seemed to underscore just how unprepared for independence so many of these republics are.
 
Robbed of a Transition
 "The coup plotters won; in the end they got their revenge," said a senior American diplomat based in Moscow, referring to the Soviet officials who plotted the failed coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in August. His argument was that the coup, by triggering the rapid breakup of the Soviet Union, robbed it of the transition period it need to go from a union run and dominated by Moscow to a collection of self-governing, self-sustaining independent countries.
"They needed two, maybe three years to make the transition," the diplomat said. "But thanks to the coup boys, it all just happened overnight, before anybody was really ready."
In the European republics of the former Soviet Union the statues of Lenin have all been toppled from their pedestals, but in the Central Asian republics, such as Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, the statues are all still standing. As much as these republics resented Moscow's domination of their affairs, they were also dependent upon it for guidance and sustenance, and many of them have not yet quite figured out how to fill the power void.
Passing by the Lenin statue still standing in the heart of Tashkent, an Uzbek Foreign Ministry official accompanying reporters traveling with Mr. Baker remarked: "We are not independent in our minds or in our habits. In many ways, we remain the same."
 
Every Republic for Itself
 But without Moscow to provide food and distribution, it is turning into an every-republic-for-itself competition. In Dushanbe, Tajikistan, food rationing had to be instituted two weeks ago because Ukraine stopped shipping its sugar and Kazakhstan began charging exorbitant prices for its meat.
When the President of Tajikistan, Rakhman Nabiyev, summoned his Cabinet for an emergency meeting two weeks ago to deal with the food crisis, he confessed to his public, "We have little experience in such affairs, but we should look for and find ways and methods of lowering the prices, especially of basic foodstuff."
Mr. Baker's conclusion from his trip, aides say, was very simple: Some of these new countries are going to make it, and others are going to join the swelling ranks of third world basket cases, just limping along. Those that are most likely to make it, he concluded, are those like Turkmenistan that have economies based on agriculture, oil, gas and minerals, on the assumption that it is easier to privatize an economy based on agriculture and energy than an industrialized economy, which will have to modernize if it is to compete on the world market.
The problem of transition is compounded by the fact that every leader in the outlying republics with whom Mr. Baker dealt seemed to have the same biography: Former senior Communist Party boss who managed to switch hats quickly enough in the last year or two and to pass himself off as a reformer. These former apparatchiks are now overseeing the transition to a market economy in most of Central Asia.
 
The Ethnic Problem
 Another factor that will determine which of these republics flourishes and which does not will be how they handle their ethnic problems. Here again, Moscow's iron fist keeping the lid on nationalist tensions and Moscow's role as a neutral referee are missed in some ways.
Mr. Baker began this trip in Moldova seeking assurances from its Government that it would not discriminate against its Gagauz minority, a Turkic -Christian people living in the republic, as well as its Russian minority. Both groups have tried to split from Moldova now that it has split with Moscow and is talking about unification with Romania.
From Moldova, Mr. Baker flew to Yerevan, Armenia, where the focus of his talks was Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of Azerbaijan with a majority population of Armenians who want to reunify with Armenia but are being stopped by Azerbaijan because 30 percent of the people of the enclave are Azerbaijani. Azerbaijan has cut off all food and energy supplies to Armenia.
Mr. Baker, apparently suffering from a splitting headache after two days of wrestling with such issues, was asked at a news conference in Yerevan if he had any plans to visit Nagorno-Karabakh to try to mediate. His categoric answer seemed to stun his hosts.
"I do not plan to go to the region, or to the autonomous republic myself, either on this trip, nor do I have any plans to go there in the future," he said.
 
No Complications Needed
 Mr. Baker's only advice was to say to Armenians and Azerbaijanis that "the job of creating a new, independent nation and bringing it into the community of nations and establishing a free-market economy is a big enough job in and of itself. It does not need to be burdened with, or complicated by, a continuing dispute regarding Nagorno-Karabakh."
Because these outlying republics are still headed in many cases by Communist Party bosses, and because some of them have difficult ethnic problems. dealing with them from Washington's perspective will be very complicated.
The United States wants to have relationships with the Central Asian states, if for no other reason than because they are rich in strategic resources like uranium and oil, and to forestall Islamic fundamentalist expansion into this area.
Mr. Baker tried to win commitments from each of these leaders to various democratic and market principles as a condition for American diplomatic contacts. Yet as he did so, he seemed to discover that relations with them are, for the near future, going to be based less on their desire to embrace American values, and more on America's decision to turn a blind eye to some of their behavior -- from reports of torture of political prisoners in Azerbaijan to the intimidation of opposition leaders, as happened while Mr. Baker was in Turkmenistan.
Reporters traveling with Mr. Baker were told toward the end of his trip: "It is probably true with respect to all of these new nations that as they emerge from totalitarianism and seek to become democratic, their performance is not going to be spotless. But there are a number of goals and objectives that we have to keep in mind, and we need to reconcile these in the best way that we can and approach the emergence of these new nations in a manner that best serves the interest of the United States, and in a manner that does not in any way sacrifice our principles."

HEADLINE: Poland Again Saddles Up the Steed of Reform

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, Feb. 15

 BODY:
After riding to power on growing public opposition to Poland's economic reform program, the new Government is reluctantly embracing the main tenets of its predecessors.
An economic program to be announced Monday promises a loosening of the money supply and a bit of help for the ailing state sector. But Premier Jan Olszewski's Government is insisting that the total deficit will be held to 5 to 6 percent of the gross national product, slightly more than 1991. 
 The big question, however, is whether the package will meet the budget austerity requirements of the International Monetary Fund. Forgiveness of half of Poland's $45 billion foreign debt, tentatively agreed upon last year, depends on receiving the Fund's imprimatur. A senior Polish official warned that the plan to be announced Monday may not satisfy the fund.
The I.M.F. suspended a three-year agreement with Poland last year after targets for money supply growth and budget deficits vastly exceeded projections. Fund representatives told Polish economic planners this week that Poland must live within its means. Such restraint was lacking in the past year, when real wages rose 3 percent -- about $200 monthly -- even as productivity fell sharply.
"I wonder if the I.M.F. realizes how difficult is the social and political situation of this country," said the senior official. "We need to have a sensible budget, but we need to preserve democratic processes, and one need has to be balanced against the other."
During the campaign, Mr. Olszewski called for renegotiation of Poland's deal with the I.M.F. Now he is boxed in by a budget deficit, faces growing opposition within his own Parliament, and has found little room to maneuver.
Once the poster-child of post-Communist economics for its bold program of "shock therapy," Poland has lately been the focus of anxious concern in the West. The private sector has boomed since the program began on Jan. 1, 1990, while state businesses, particularly companies dependent on trade with the Soviet Union, have collapsed.
A majority of the winning candidates in last year's parliamentary elections ran against the reform plan. Public opinion polls document a steady drop in the public's support for faster privatization, and Government forecasters predict that unemployment, now at 11 percent, will reach between 17 and 19 percent by the end of the year.
Recently, President Lech Walesa delivered a ringing speech at the Council of Europe in which he blamed Western Europe for flooding the Polish market with goods while failing to invest.
Immediately after the speech, he called in Western reporters to assure them that the comments were not aimed at the United States and that the country had no intention of seriously deviating from its economic reforms.
Zdzislaw Najder, chief adviser to Mr. Olszewski, insisted the new Government is proposing important changes in emphasis, particularly in the area of protecting potentially profitable state-run industries. But he also acknowledged that the rhetoric of last year's Parliamentary campaign has long since collided with the realities on Poland's national balance sheet.
When the Olszewski Government took office, Mr. Olszewski immediately called the budget deficit of more than $1.6 billion "catastrophic" and said that it would take two months for his Government to come up with a plan.
Those results are to be unveiled next week. Drafts of the proposal call for faster privatization, lower interest rates and the printing of additional money to revive failing state-run enterprises. The state companies would be protected both by more direct intervention from the central Government and such anti-import measures as required labeling in the Polish language.
The key vote will come on a proposed budget within a month. "This Government can propose a budget that is very austere," said Piotr Nowina-Konopka, senior member of the Democratic Union party, which holds 14 percent of the seats in the Parliament and is drawn from the center left wing of the Solidarity movement. "And if it's a non-austere budget, we won't vote for it, and Olszewski will be brought down."

HEADLINE: Political Formula for a Tax Proposal

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The tax bill put forward by House Democrats as an alternative to President Bush's proposals has three underlying purposes, and the first is plainly the most important: to make a political argument for the Democrats about tax fairness.
The second goal is to do that without harming the economy by generating excessive stimulus or creating tax loopholes. And the third goal, where it can be done at little fiscal or political cost, is to clean up the the tax code a bit. 
 Democrats are stating their political argument loudly. Republicans do not believe in a fair tax code, proclaimed the bill's author, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "The Democrats are thinking about the middle class," he said.
To a politician, rather than an economist or demographer, the nice thing about his middle class is that it is so big that hardly any voters are left out. Democrats say their preliminary figures show that only the top 1 percent of taxpayers would pay more taxes in 1992 and 1993; the other 99 percent would pay less.
 
Bush Pushes His Plan
 Mr. Bush disagrees. In Nashua, N.H., today he argued that when taxes on the rich were raised "that hits the little guy over and over again." Later in New Boston, N.H., he said Congress should "set aside politics" and pass his proposal instead of theirs.
Politicians, of course, reach for their wallets when they hear another politician telling them to put aside politics.
Indeed, the Democrats' bill would probably not exist at all if this was not an election year. Most of the advice Mr. Rostenkowski's committee got last December in hearings was to do nothing and wait for the recession to end. He has made no secret of his personal agreement with that view, while adding "the politics of it isn't going to allow us to do that."
And the slogan of middle-class tax relief has been chanted so loud, so often by so many Democrats that a Congress they control is not going to produce a bill that cannot claim that philosophy.
That guaranteed a committee rejection of Mr. Bush's call for reducing taxes on capital gains from a maximum of 28 percent to 15.4 percent. Most of the money that proposal would give taxpayers would go to individuals with incomes over $100,000, many of whom do not even slide into Mr. Rostenkowski's large middle class.
Instead, the Democrats' bill tries to take what the appears to be the two strongest arguments for capital gains cuts and use them, inexpensively, for more modest changes.
 
Accounting for Inflation
 Mr. Bush said today in Nashua he wanted a capital gains cut "so that business can invest and hire more people." Democrats are generally skeptical that a cut in capital gains taxes would lead to much productive investment, but their bill would reward investors if that happens. It would cut the tax, to 14 percent, but only for new investments in small businesses, held for at least five years.
The other part of the Democratic bill would index new investments against inflation for capital gains purposes. Under current law, if someone bought $10,000 worth of stock and sold it for $15,000, after holding it for four years while the cost of living went up 20 percent, equivalent to $2,000 of the stock's value, the capital gains tax would apply to the entire $5,000 profit. Under the Democratic proposal, the capital gains tax would apply only to the $3,000 not attributable to inflation.
But including some kind of capital gains rate cut is also a political strategy. A substantial minority of Democrats find more appeal in changing the law than in using it as an issue against Republicans, and Mr. Rostenkowski wants to keep as many of them as possible with the party when his proposal goes against the President's on the floor at the end of the month.
There are at least two other ways that both Mr. Bush's original big package and the short list he now talks most about helped set the Congressional agenda. Two relatively small items absorbed intact in the bill are the provision to allow first-time home buyers to tap Individual Retirement Accounts without the ordinary 10 percent penalty, and measures to encourage mortgage investment in real estate.
 
Debate on Tax Credit
 While campaigning Mr. Bush talks most about his proposal for a $5,000 tax credit for first time house buyers. In New Boston today he said "it would mean 1,000 new housing starts, 2,000 construction jobs." The Ways and Means Committee Democrats disagreed. They said the credit was too small to lead to new construction or sales, while being big enough to cost the Treasury more than $6 billion over six years. They did go for the I.R.A. measure, figuring some individuals could draw enough out of their funds to buy houses, and calculating that it would cost only $1.3 billion.
Mr. Bush also speaks enthusiastically of a proposed accelerated depreciation plan for new investment. "That's money to buy equipment to upgrade the plants, to create new jobs now," he said in Nashua.
The Democrats responded with a one percentage point cut in corporate tax rates. "We're rewarding winners," said Representative Thomas J. Downey of Long Island, pointing out that companies that did not make money did not pay taxes and therefore would not benefit from this rate cut.
But the details are a means to a political end, and a worthy political disagreement. Mr. Bush today accused the Democrats of wanting to use the tax code to "redistribute the wealth."
Mr. Rostenkowski might not have chosen that term, but can hardly dispute the charge. He said Friday that his Chicago constituents were enthusiastic "about the tax cuts that they were going to enjoy, at the expense of the wealthy."

SCHWARZENEGGER ASSAILS BUCHANAN

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GOFFSTOWN, N. H., Feb. 15

 BODY:
The Bush campaign finally got out the "B" word today, but it took a bigger man than the President to do it.
Appearing at President Bush's side in this suburb of Manchester, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mr. Bush's loyal heavy lifter, did what Mr. Bush has been avoiding for weeks: He mentioned Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who is challenging the President in the primary on Tuesday, by name. 
 Mr. Buchanan's attacks have clearly stung Mr. Bush, and the President today indirectly accused him of spreading "flat, outright lies." But Mr. Bush, who ran a heavily negative campaign here and across the country in 1988, has made a tactical decision not to do that this year in New Hampshire, and Mr. Buchanan's name can never be read on the President's lips.
"We want to make sure that when it comes Tuesday, February 18th, that you all go out there and help the President and pump up his vote," Mr. Schwarzenegger told a crowd in a school gymnasium that got to its feet, cheered, whistled, squealed and generally gave the movie star a much bigger ovation than it granted the President.
 
'Send a Message to Pat'
 "I want you to vote, and at the same time send a message to Congress," said Mr. Schwarzenegger, who is chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. He grinned as he borrowed a line from "Terminator 2," his latest hit. "At the same time, send a message to Pat Buchanan: 'Hasta la vista, baby.' "
After the event Bush aides simply smiled with satisfaction when asked if the campaign had put Mr. Schwarzenegger up to it. But the Bush campaign was counting on Mr. Schwarzenegger's appearances this weekend to build up an enthusiasm that has been notably lacking from the President's campaign events here.
Mr. Schwarzenegger accompanied Mr. Bush to New Hampshire for a final weekend of campaigning in which he scrambled today to recover from accusations that he had abandoned a popular proposal to increase the tax deduction for children.
Mr. Buchanan pursued the attack today, running a new television advertisement that accused the President of not taking the extra $500 deduction seriously because he dropped it from a seven-point list of urgent economic measures that he gave Congress this week. "Don't be fooled again," the ad says. "It's George Bush that's taxing and spending your future away."
 
Some Indirect Criticism
 But having made the purely tactical decision not to use a negative commercial that had been prepared on Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Bush confined himself today to indirectly criticizing Mr. Buchanan for criticizing him. Although Mr. Bush lumped his Republican challenger with the Democrats, it was clear that the President's comments were aimed chiefly at the man who had spoiled his hopes of coasting through the primary season unscathed.
"I really honestly believe that the people of New Hampshire are a little bit tired of all these negative advertisements and all the attack-dog tactics coming from the left and coming from the right," said Mr. Bush, who made a last-minute rally here four years ago with commercials that attacked Senator Bob Dole and then ran a heavily negative general election campaign against Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.
Just as Mr. Dole complained that Mr. Bush's ads in 1988 distorted his record, Mr. Bush complained today that Mr. Buchanan's ads were misleading.
The President did not miss a chance to take an indirect slap at Mr. Buchanan. At the Goffstown school, he criticized "some of my opponents" who are calling for a freeze on Federal spending. That, he said, would take money from the Social Security checks of the elderly. The only candidate calling for such a freeze is Mr. Buchanan.
 
Bush on the Defensive
 The charge that Mr. Bush was not seriously pushing the extra $500 deduction has become the focus of Mr. Buchanan's last-minute assault on the President, who has been battling accusations that he is not doing enough to help ordinary Americans. And much of Mr. Bush's day was devoted to defending himself against the charge instead of taking the offensive on his own proposals, as he had hoped.
At each stop today, Mr. Bush waved above his head a copy of the thick bill that he submitted to Congress. "Yesterday, I'm told New Hampshire voters were subjected to flat, outright lies about this plan," the President said. "This plan includes many things, including deductions for student loans and tax relief for families for children."
"It's in there," he said over and over again. "It's in this bill."
Responding to Mr. Buchanan's accusations, Bush aides acknowledged that the President had said in his State of the Union Message that the $500 deduction was needed "right away." They said he did not include it in his smaller package, which he wants Congress to pass by March 20, because the deductions would not be recorded until next year and therefore do not immediately stimulate the economy.

HEADLINE: In Corner of Asia, Hope for New Trading Center

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUNCHUN, China

 BODY:
Frozen cornfields and mud-brick villages now dominate the landscape around this remote town, where a shallow river called the Tumen marks the intersection of the borders of Russia, North Korea and China.
As local peasants huddle for warmth on the kang -- the beds built over fireplaces in each room of their cottages -- officials in a half-dozen Asian capitals are considering an extraordinary plan for jointly developing this bleak spot into an international trading center that would rival Rotterdam as the world's busiest port. 
 The United Nations is helping organize discussions of the project, called the Tumen River Area Development Program. Whether or not the trading center is ever built, the discussions are already bringing together nations that were once cold war enemies.
The Tumen River -- now a sheet of ice on which peasant children skate -- delineates the border between China and North Korea and between Russia and North Korea. The project would straddle the area where the three nations converge, creating a duty-free shipping and processing zone covering up to 4,000 square miles, a bit smaller than Connecticut. Enthusiasts say this multination zone would become the trading locus of northeast Asia.
 
'A Pretty Good Chance'
 "It's got a pretty good chance of becoming reality," Ding Shicheng, an architect of the project, insisted in an interview in the provincial capital, Changchun. Mr. Ding, a scientist and Government official whose large office is full of maps and statistical abstracts from countries in the region, has been backing the project since 1984. Only in the last 18 months have international discussions begun with the United Nations and foreign countries.
"China wants to see this happen," Mr. Ding added. "So does North Korea. The Soviet Union is having some problems, but the project would be good for Russia, and I think they'll support it. Mongolia and other nations will also back it, along with the U.N., so with all these countries supporting it, it's more than just an idle hope."
While the zone would consist of land from just the three countries bordering on the Tumen River, any other nation would be invited to invest in the program or use the port. In particular, the plans call for Mongolia, a landlocked nation of mountains and desert, to build a rail line to trade through the port. Japan and South Korea would be involved in planning and financing the project, and together those six nations are the central players in the discussions, although China also welcomes investment from the United States, Taiwan and Europe.
So far it is unclear whether project supporters like Mr. Ding are visionaries or dreamers. No comparable international project exists anywhere, and construction would probably cost $35 billion or more, most of which would have to be raised abroad. There is little indication that any companies or countries are willing to invest such huge amounts in a remote part of China, in bankrupt North Korea and in a hinterland of unstable Russia.
 
Worth the Cost?
 "It's a dream," a Japanese official said. "From the Japanese businessmen I've talked to, I don't think they're prepared to invest in it."
The problem is that while the presence of an efficient new port would benefit each of the countries in the region, it is not clear that it is worth the astronomic cost or that it would benefit investors. Foreign companies and banks are already leery of investing in factories in Russia or North Korea.
Roy D. Morey, the director in Beijing of the United Nations Development Program, which is financing an $825,000 preliminary study of the proposal, said that while much remains uncertain, he believes that the project is feasible. He said the countries in the region are highly complementary: Japan and South Korea have capital but lack natural resources, while Mongolia, North Korea and the adjacent parts of China and Russia abound in resources like lumber and minerals but lack the money to develop them or transport them to world markets.
Access to foreign markets, capital and expertise has already transformed China's southeast from farming villages into a manufacturing belt with one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The decline of old animosities -- between Japan and Russia, China and Russia, North and South Korea, China and Mongolia, North Korea and Japan -- now inspires hope that in the aftermath of the cold war, southeast China's success can be replicated in the northeast.
"If there hadn't been the changes that have taken place in the last year and a half, people would regard this as a pipe dream," Mr. Morey said. "Now it may still not happen, but it certainly is worth $825,000 of risk money to be put up by the U.N.D.P. to further investigate the key issues."
The Tumen River project management committee will meet for the first time in late February, in Seoul, South Korea. Every country involved in the project, including North Korea, is expected to attend, just as each country attended preparatory meetings in Mongolia and North Korea.
The proposals now under review call for a 20-year development period, including construction of about 10 terminals scattered among ports in the three countries. One terminal would handle all the grain in the region, another the timber, a third the oil, and so on.
There would even be a passenger terminal for cruise ships, plus a new international airport. Plans also call for several five-star hotels, 100-car trains, an upgraded highway network, three major new electricity plants, fiber-optic telecommunications systems, "smart" office towers run by computers and new plants to provide potable water and to dispose of waste.

HEADLINE: Argentina's President Turns Economics Into Poll Approval

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 11

 BODY:
A year ago, plagued by inflation, scandal and criticism for pardoning military officers accused of human rights violations, President Carlos Saul Menem seemed in political trouble. His approval rating had plunged just below 20 percent, the lowest since his election in 1989.
Now, after leading the economy to its lowest rate of inflation in more than 20 years and managing to stay pretty much untainted by allegation of corruption against aides, Mr. Menem is riding a wave of support seldom seen in this country. 
 He won a major victory in midterm elections last fall and made a successful visit to the United States in November. By December, his approval ratings had shot up to 70 percent, despite scandals that are widely regarded as his greatest political vulnerability.
Mr. Menem's economic plan, which stops excessive printing of money, cuts Government payrolls and sells state-owned companies, received a 74 percent approval rating.
 
Mooting Checks and Balances
 But economists and political scientists warn there could be a downside to the President's growing popularity: the weakening of institutions that are able to check the misuse of power.
"We have an enormous concentration of power now in Argentina," said Miguel Angel Broda, an economist. "It is not in the Cabinet, or in the Economy Ministry or in Congress. It is directly in Carlos Menem. He has the kind of power that Charles de Gaulle had in France."
The opposition Radical Party is divided and casting about for a platform. The unions have been weakened by privatization and new labor laws. The military's budget has been slashed. And while Mr. Menem's party has effective control of both houses of Congress, his style of ruling by decree often removes legislators from policy decisions.
Mr. Menem's economic efforts, though, have produced results. Argentina is to receive a $3.2 billion three-year loan from the International Monetary Fund next month, and bankers say that by the end of the year, a critical settlement with creditor banks could be negotiated to reduce Argentina's foreign debt by as much as 40 percent.
The stock market has soared, and a rising tide of foreign investment is coming into the country.
 
Uncomfortable Issues
 But many political analysts here predict that once the overall economy is stable, popular concern will turn to other issues -- like corruption, chronic poverty and the plight of retirees, many of whom have had their monthly benefits cut to $100 by Government austerity measures.
The President's most vulnerable point seems to be corruption. Almost weekly, new allegations are made against senior officials.
Last month, Mr. Menem finally asked for the resignation of Miguel Angel Vicco, his close friend and presidential secretary, who has been accused of owning part of a company that sold 47 tons of tainted powdered milk to Government aid programs. Mr. Vicco denied owning any part of the business.
So far, the President has used what seems to be a formula for handling corruption charges against top aides. At first he vigorously defends the aides, complaining that the press is controlled by Communists. As the charges become more credible, he begins to back off. If aides are indicted, he asks for their resignations.
 
Court Action Lags
 Still, little has come of these corruption cases. The Argentine courts proceed slowly, and prosecutors and lawyers often assert that judges are either paid off or come under political pressure, rendering the judicial system all but powerless.
"The public sees him as being surrounded by corruption," said Felipe Nougera, a partner in the polling firm of Mora y Araujo, Noguera & Associates.
In addition, many people wonder whether the President himself is linked to any of the scandals.
"He has been dodging bullets for a long time," Mr. Noguera said. "Someday, one is going to hit him."

HEADLINE: 250 March in Rain to Protest Teaneck Verdict

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J., Feb. 15

 BODY:
About 250 blacks staged a milelong march and a 50-minute rally in a chilling rain here today to protest the acquittal of Gary Spath, a white Teaneck police officer, in the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old black youth, Phillip Pannell, here nearly two years ago.
"We were set up -- perpetrated," the dead youth's father, Phillip, told the crowd huddled under umbrellas in front of the Teaneck Municipal Building. "We said we'd go through the system, and once again the system failed us." 
 Mr. Pannell noted that Officer Spath has two children and said he hoped he could "feel my pain."
"I got somebody missing," he shouted through a bullhorn. "My daughter Natasha has somebody missing. My wife Thelma has somebody missing."
 
Sharpton's Marchers Bused In
 The protest occurred without incident. About half the marchers were from Teaneck and nearby towns, and about half arrived with the Rev. Al Sharpton in two buses from New York City. Almost all the marchers and onlookers were black.
The two main speakers at the rally -- Mr. Sharpton and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry of Teaneck, both advisers to the Pannell family -- admonished the crowd to avoid violence and refrain from marching to Officer Spath's home in the nearby community of River Edge. Mr. Sharpton had suggested during a rally last week that he might organize a future march to Officer Spath's home.
Black residents active in protesting the shooting have urged Mr. Sharpton in recent days to abandon that idea. In a speech today, Mr. Sharpton ruled out going to Officer Spath's home.
"We refrained from doing that out of our own dignity," he told the crowd. "Don't lose your dignity and imitate your oppressor."
An all-white jury of 10 men and 2 women acquitted Officer Spath of one count of manslaughter on Tuesday after about eight and a half hours of deliberation. Mr. Sharpton called the verdict a "sham."
"We cannot accept a kangaroo court that would make Alabama and Mississippi blush with shame," he said.
 
'The System Don't Listen'
 Clusters of blacks watched from sidewalks and windows as the protesters walked south on Teaneck Road, a main commercial thoroughfare, from Bryant School, near the site of the shooting on April 10, 1990. Some cheered, some shook their heads, and most did not join in the march.
"The system don't listen to people walking down the street," said Malik Jacques, a 17-year-old student at Teaneck High School. Another onlooker, Kendal Brown, said, "I don't know what this is going to accomplish."
The marchers were restricted to the front steps and lawn of the Municipal Building. The rest of the municipal complex, including the police headquarters and library and parking lot behind them, were cordoned off. Police officers with riot helmets and nightsticks stood in front of headquarters to prevent a melee like the one that began in the parking lot the night after the shooting and ended in a milelong rampage up Teaneck Road by hundreds of black youths.
Dorothy Hackett, 31, came to the Municipal Building today from neighboring Hackensack, site of the trial, with her 10-year-old son Antonio. She said she hoped the speeches would be a lesson for her son.
"I'm hoping he realizes that people speak out for what they want and say it nonviolently," she said.
One of the few whites in the crowd at the Municipal Building, Robert Stefan of Teaneck, said he had been involved in community dialogues after the shooting. "The vast majority of Teaneck residents do not support the racial radicals, including Mr. Sharpton, who come here to further their own political or economic goals," he said.

HEADLINE: Daunting New Task: Helping Minority Companies

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
When Mayor David N. Dinkins announced last week that he wanted to insure that businesses owned by minorities or women receive a larger portion of city contracts, his motive was clear: to broaden opportunities for those who have been disadvantaged.
But the experience of many other cities, as well as several states and the Federal Government, suggests that it is much easier to articulate goals in government contracting than to achieve them, many experts say. 
 "This is an extraordinarily complex challenge that the city is facing," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that develops housing for working-class New Yorkers.
Mr. Dinkins said he had ordered agencies to develop programs to increase minority representation in the awarding of more than $5 billion a year in city contracts. The Mayor said he wanted the city ultimately to award more than 20 percent of its contracts to businesses owned by minorities or women, without resorting to quotas.
 
New York One of the Last
 New York is one of the last of the country's large cities to create such goals. The Federal Government began encouraging the use of businesses owned by minorities and women in 1968, and New York State has had comparable programs for years.
Some local agencies, including the Transit Authority and the Transportation Department, have long been required to observe Federal and state guidelines when they use Federal or state money for construction.
Many experts said the Dinkins administration should learn from the experience of other cities and other levels of government as it creates its own program. There have been many problems, ranging from the use of fronts that masquerade as minority-owned companies but are really owned and controlled by whites, to reluctant bureaucrats who fail to enforce contracting goals, to slow payment by government agencies, which can force a fledgling business into bankruptcy.
"None of the programs work smoothly, but some do work," said Timothy Bates, chairman of the graduate program in urban policy analysis at the New School and an economist who studies minority-owned businesses.
"I'd say Atlanta is the obvious success," Dr. Bates said. "Los Angeles works well. Chicago, after many painful years, is starting to work well."
The use of fronts has been a problem everywhere, most often in construction, Dr. Bates said. A general contractor, who is often responsible for insuring that 10 percent or 20 percent or even 30 percent of his subcontractors are owned by minorities or women, will declare an employee a 51 percent owner of the new company, Dr. Bates said.
"It's just a game," he said, with the paper owner having no real financial and managerial control. Cities with good compliance on minority contracting "often turn out to be those using fronts," Dr. Bates said.
There are ways of screening out fraudulent companies. Harriet R. Michel, the president of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, which links major corporations with minority-owned suppliers, said her agency carefully examines a company's stock certificates and financial records to determine its authenticity.
It can be more difficult to ascertain the real ownership of businesses owned by women, Ms. Michel said, particularly in states like New York and California that have community property laws. A woman may be fronting for her husband, she said, and such practices can be hard to ferret out.
Authenticity has been the most persistent problem, but not the only one. Bureaucrats are often resistant to change, either because they are reluctant to work on behalf of companies owned by women or minorities or because they are set in their ways.
A half-dozen audits by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan demonstrate that many New York State agencies have not been vigilant about achieving affirmative-action goals.
For example, Mr. Regan's auditors found that the prime contractor in a project by the Metro-North Commuter Railroad to repair the roof of Grand Central Terminal listed four minority-owned subcontractors. None of the subcontractors were certified by Metro-North's parent agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as authentic minority-owned companies, and none appeared to be certifiable, the Comptroller's report said.
Many financial requirements make it hard for new, small companies to compete for government contracts. Experts said the city would have to create strategies to help fledgling companies owned by minorities and women overcome obstacles.
Ms. Wylde's organization has created a program for minority subcontractors who want to become builder-developers. It includes help from banks and the state's mortgage agency and advice from "mentors," established developers who help the minority contractor but have no financial stake.
Ms. Wylde said the city should devise similar public-private partnerships to help companies owned by minorities and women to obtain credit, capital and other essentials.

HEADLINE: The 1992 Campaign;
Difference Among the Democratic Candidates

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
The five main Democratic Presidential candidates agree with each other more than they disagree. All, for example, favor much more Federal involvement in areas like education and health. To one degree or another, they support grants or tax breaks to help develop specific industries. They emphasize more Government spending on what they call "infrastructure" -- highways, sewer systems, airports and the like. The Democrats also believe abortions should be basically unrestricted. But on the following issues, they take somewhat different approach.
 
MAIN THEME
Brown: The country's policies across the board are misguided because the system is corrupt and politicians are greedy.
 Clinton: The middle class has suffered most from the mistaken policies of the last 12 years, and that must be reversed.
 Harkin: Old fashioned liberalism is the wave of the future.
 Kerrey: The first step toward economic and social revival should be comprehensive national health insurance.
 Tsongas: The Government should work with business and not at cross purposes.
 
TAXES
 Brown: Replace the existing income tax system with a flat, 13 percent tax on all income and a value-added tax, similar to a national sales tax, on business transactions. Deductions allowed only for mortgage interest, rent and charitable contributions. Temporary amnesty for tax evaders. Give business a tax cut for hiring workers from poor neighborhoods.
 Clinton: Cut income taxes of middle class by several hundred dollars a year and offset the cost with tax increases of unspecified size on those with incomes above $200,000. Cut capital gains tax for investment held at least five years in new businesses. Give investment tax credit to small and medium sized businesses. Expand earned income tax credit. Prohibit businesses from writing off the cost of excessive salaries and bonuses for executives.
 Harkin: Give no tax cut to middle class or reduction in capital gains tax. Provide investment tax credit for specified industries.
 Kerrey: Give two-year refundable tax credit worth 20 percent of Social Security and Medicare taxes, which would save a family earning $30,000 about $400 a year. Increase taxes by an unspecified amount on incomes above about $200,000. Allow tax credit for investments in plants and machinery. Cut capital gains tax by not taxing the part of the profit attributable to inflation. Impose a 4 percent payroll tax on employers and 1 percent on workers to pay for national medical insurance.
 Tsongas: Do not cut income taxes. Tax capital gains on profits from stocks at progressively lower rates depending on how long the stock is held and impose an even lower rate on gains from investments in small businesses. Raise income taxes on the wealthy. Increase the gasoline tax by 3 cents to 5 cents a gallon. Give temporary investment tax credit. Provide more favorable tax treatment of individual retirement accounts.
 
MILITARY AFFAIRS
 Brown: Cut the military budget in half over the next five years.
 Clinton: Cut military spending by one-third over the next five years. Stop production of the B-2 bomber and the Star Wars missile defense system.
 Harkin: Reduce military spending and the size of the armed forces by half over the next 10 years. Cancel B-2 bomber but continue to develop weapons that might stimulate a useful commercial industry like the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. Rely more on the National Guard and Reserves.
 Kerrey: Reduce military spending more than President Bush wants but avoid a meat-ax approach and be careful that the military is large enough and well enough equipped to meet any possible threat.
 Tsongas: Reduce military spending by an unspecified amount. Cut overseas bases rather than those at home. Require economic rivals like Japan and Germany to bear a larger share of the cost of their own defense. Stop selling weapons to third-world countries and persuade allies to do the same.
 
HEALTH
 Brown: Install a national health insurance system that bypasses private insurance companies. Emphasize preventative care, "acupuncture, chiropractic and wellness programs."
 Clinton: Require employers to provide insurance coverage for workers or pay an additional tax into a public fund to cover the uninsured. Establish a Government board to regulate medical-care prices.
 Harkin: Bring labor, business and Government experts to a negotiating table to work out the best form of comprehensive national health insurance.
 Kerrey: Abolish Medicare, Medicaid and the existing employer-based insurance system. Pass revenue from new taxes to the states. Allow people to choose insurance from their state's plan or from private policies that meet minimum Federal standards. Pay the private companies a fixed amount based on the number of people they enroll. Have doctor and hospital fees set by the state governments.
 Tsongas. Enroll everyone in a group like the company where they work and provide a public plan for those who are not part of another group. Have private insurance companies and health maintenance organizations bid for contracts from the groups. Let sophisticated purchasing agents employed by the groups decide which plan is best for their members in terms of fees and services.
 
TRADE
 Brown: Has not stressed this issue the way the other candidates have.
 Clinton: Says he is basically a free-trader. Blames the Japanese for about one-quarter of the United States's trade difficulty, and says this country should retaliate if Japan does not change its ways. Otherwise, says businesses, workers and the Government must work together to compete better in international commerce.
 Harkin: Supports tougher enforcement of existing trade laws and new forms of retaliation if necessary to force trading partners to open their markets to American goods. Voted against giving President Bush authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
 Kerrey: Favors whatever steps are needed to force other countries to open their markets. Voted to give the President authority to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
 Tsongas. Says trade restrictions are counterproductive. Believes the only way the United States can compete in international commerce is to improve the quality of its own products. Foreign companies should not be allowed to take over certain strategic industries in the United States.
