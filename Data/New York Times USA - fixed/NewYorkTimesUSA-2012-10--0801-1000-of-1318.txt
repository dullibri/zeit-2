HEADLINE: You Don't Work as Hard as You Say You Do

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Americans tend to overestimate their working hours by about 5 to 10 percent, according to a Labor Department study, with the biggest exaggerators being people who work longer weeks. 

 BODY:
Americans tend to overestimate how many hours they work in a typical week by about 5 to 10 percent, according to a Labor Department study, with the biggest exaggerators being people who work longer weeks.
The study compared people's estimates for how much time they spent working against a time diary they were asked to keep of all their activities. Whether because of faulty memories or a desire to sound more industrious (or some combination of the two), most respondents systematically overestimated how much time they spent at work.
The typical person who reported having worked 40 hours, for example, actually worked closer to 37. The report found that "The greater the estimate, the greater the overestimate"; people who said they worked 75 hours actually worked closer to 50 hours. (That's an overestimate of 25 hours, or 50 percent!) At the other end of the spectrum, people who worked relatively few hours (under around 25) actually ended to underestimate their hours. 
Here's a chart taken from the report showing the number of hours that survey respondents said they worked on the horizontal axis, and the amount by which they over- or understated their actual hours:
The study notes that overestimates of working hours have been found in other countries as well, including Belgium, Russia, China and Japan.
Americans are also bad at properly estimating their time spent on other activities, including housework. A 1998-2001 national diary study found that people grossly exaggerated how much time they spent on housework. Men estimated spending a total of 23 hours on housework per week, versus the 10 hours they actually spent when forced to keep a time diary. Women estimated 32 hours versus 17 hours in the diary.
The margin of exaggeration for work hours has changed over time. It spiked in 1985, when the average person overstated his or her time spent working by 6.2 hours.

HEADLINE: Most Battleground States See Drop in Unemployment Numbers

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Several battlegrounds states, including Nevada, Florida and Ohio, saw large drops in unemployment over the last 12 months, the government reported Wednesday. 

 BODY:
Several battlegrounds states, including Florida, Nevada and Ohio, saw large drops in unemployment over the last 12 months, the government reported Wednesday.
The latest state-by-state numbers, the last batch before the election, show that Nevada actually saw the largest drop of any state. The unemployment rate declined by 1.8 percentage points between September 2011 and September 2012, although the state still has the nation's highest unemployment rate, 11.8 percent.
Florida and Ohio also ranked among the 10 states with the largest drops in unemployment, down 1.7 percentage points and 1.6 points respectively. 
Other battleground states lagged behind. New Hampshire was one of only six states that saw an increase in unemployment, although its situation is the mirror image of Nevada's - it still has one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates.
The table shows the September unemployment rate and 12-month change for each of the nine states that The New York Times regards as tossups. A letter T in a state's ranking denotes a tie.

HEADLINE: Weighing New Risks, 25 Years After the Crash

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The 25th anniversary of Black Monday has prompted some remembrances -- as well as warnings that big market risks remain. 

 BODY:
Wall Street looks very different nowadays than it did on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 23 percent in a single day. But 25 years -- and one global financial crisis -- later, market experts are still warning of risks to the system.
In the aftermath of the Black Monday crash came the rise of a new, computerized force for destruction, writes Floyd Norris in his column in The New York Times. High-frequency traders, which today provide much of the stock market's liquidity, are more sophisticated than the old system, but they're also less reliable when trading gets rough, Mr. Norris writes.
That potential for damage was on display on May 6, 2010, when computerized selling brought about a dizzying flash crash, and also this year, when a malfunction at Knight Capital caused prices to spin out of control.
 One often hears these days that ordinary investors are giving up on stocks. Spooked by the financial crisis and the flash crash, investors have taken $440 billion out of equity mutual funds in the United States since 2008, Bloomberg News says, citing data that it compiled with the Investment Company Institute.
Indeed, experts point out that big risks remain.
"In 1987, everybody tried to go to the exit at the same time, but the exit door wasn't big enough," the longtime trader E.E. Geduld, known as Buzzy, told Bloomberg News. "Fast forward to 2012. The volumes we can handle are gigantic, but the exit door hasn't changed in size."
The 25th anniversary of the crash has prompted some remembrances.
For a sense of the mood at the time, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have both published images of their front pages from the following day. "Does 1987 Equal 1929?" a headline in The New York Times asked. (It didn't.)
One well-known trader, Arthur Cashin, who ran floor operations for Paine Webber at the time, wrote this week that the day after Black Monday was actually "far more dangerous. It was the day that the wheels almost did come off the locomotive."
The man overseeing the New York Stock Exchange was John J. Phelan Jr., the chairman, who was commended for keeping the exchange open on Monday even as stocks were tanking. He personally rang the closing bell. (Mr. Phelan died this August.)
Mr. Norris, who in 1987 was the stock market columnist for Barron's, recounts being on the Salomon Brothers trading floor.
"Near the end of that Monday, I remember looking up and seeing dozens of young investment bankers lining the trading floor," he writes. "There was really nothing for them to see; the ticker tape rolling across the side wall was hours behind actual trading. But many no doubt wondered if their world was coming to an end."
Some traders recalled being unable to a tell what was going on. Others couldn't quite believe what was happening.
James B. Stewart, now a columnist for The New York Times, said he was on vacation in France at the time. He recalled on CNBC on Friday that he saw the headlines and thought, "They must have gotten it wrong."

HEADLINE: Community Colleges Cannot Be Overlooked in America's Quest for New Scientists

BYLINE: BECKY WAI-LING PACKARD


HIGHLIGHT: "The United States needs to grow and diversify its science and engineering work force to be competitive in the new global economy," the author writes, "and community colleges play an increasingly important role in this process." 

 BODY:
 Becky Wai-Ling Packard is a professor of psychology and education at Mount Holyoke College, where she is also the director of the Harriet L. and Paul M. Weissman Center for Leadership. 
The United States needs to grow and diversify its science and engineering work force to be competitive in the new global economy - and community colleges play an increasingly important role in this process.
More than 50 percent of lower-income and racial-minority students, and 40 percent of all students, start off at community colleges. However, not many students enter community colleges thinking they will become scientists, engineers or mathematicians. Only about 10 percent even consider this pathway. And the majority of those will pursue a different field as their studies progress.
The situation is even more severe for women. Of the 500,000 associate's degrees earned each year by women at community colleges, only 5 percent are in STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and mathematics. A recent report from the United States Department of Commerce found that, over all, women with STEM jobs earned one-third more than women with comparable educations in non-STEM jobs.

Even with community colleges in the national spotlight (increasing the numbers of students enrolled), far too often this discussion focuses on short-term, one-year training programs. These are not equivalent to an associate's degree or to a transfer-based program that leads to a four-year degree. The majority of new job openings are in STEM fields, and these careers require four-year degrees.
There is clearly a need to demonstrate to community college students, especially women, that studying science disciplines is a viable academic or career path. The community college transfer pathway can take them to four-year degree programs, where they will gain the further knowledge and skills they need to enter the work force as trained professionals or go on to graduate studies.
But, transferring from a community college to a four-year school is not happening as often or quickly as it could. And the United States needs that talent now.
We're taking a closer look at this at Mount Holyoke College. With funding from the National Science Foundation, we studied the community college transfer pathway in science and engineering. We followed about 200 students in Massachusetts, observing their progress and the directions they have taken. We also spoke to professors, deans, employers and families. We looked at course catalogs, program descriptions and transfer policies.
Among the questions we asked: How do students get on track to transfer? How do they persist in their science and engineering goals after transfer?
We've learned that students are working many hours to make ends meet. Finances really matter. Students need flexible workplaces and colleges to make it work. Four-year institutions in particular have not fully recognized the changing demographics of students.
Community college faculty members are caring, invested teachers who launch their students into science and engineering. But if students don't get early advising about transfer options and opportunities, they are likely to take the wrong classes, and then a science or engineering major may view that path as impossible, because of the burden of extra time and cost. This happens more often than one might think.
Successful transfer depends on alignment between the community colleges and the four-year college. Currently, that type of alignment is the exception rather than the rule. Too often, students who are promising future scientists leave their major because particular credits did not transfer, or because they do not feel invited into the science community at four-year institutions, not because they don't have the talent.
The next step is doing something with these findings. At Mount Holyoke, we have launched a National Science Foundation-financed initiative that will provide women from community colleges with a path into our college's science programs. We have built a program heavy on advising, peer networks and coursework designed to get students up to speed quickly and excited about studying science. We would like to use the model we are building to help other four-year colleges and universities do this effectively, particularly for young female scientists.
While there are similar programs around the country helping community colleges, few are STEM-specific. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill runs the Carolina Student Transfer Excellence Program, which enables community college students to transfer into and graduate from U.N.C. And the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor has organized a program in which new transfer students are eligible to have a transfer mentor to help smooth their transition into the university.
By working with community colleges and understanding the needs of the students who want to pursue studies in science disciplines, four-year institutions can improve transfer experiences and help grow the nation's science and engineering work force.

HEADLINE: Inspiration Is the Sincerest Form of Flattery

BYLINE: PETE WELLS


HIGHLIGHT: Chefs borrow ideas all the time; the good ones will add a riff of their own; ideas grow and morph; cuisine evolves. 

 BODY:
 Update Appended 
Not long after I wrote about Katy Peetz's watermelon radish dessert at Blanca, a blogger pointed out on Twitter that it looked "awfully similar" to a dessert served last year at Dirt Candy, Amanda Cohen's vegetable restaurant in the East Village.
Ms. Peetz made watermelon radish gelato in September, while Ms. Cohen had a watermelon radish sherbet on the menu from July to December of last year. Radish ice cream isn't exactly as common as chocolate chip. On the other hand, it is possible to imagine that two chefs, both fond of vegetables and both regular visitors to the twilight zone between sweet and savory, arrived at the idea independently.
But there was something else: both desserts were garnished with red bits of sour watermelon gummy candies. That looked like quite a coincidence to me. It struck Ms. Cohen that way too. In an e-mail, she said that when she saw a photograph of the Blanca dessert, her first reaction was, "That looks familiar!" But she didn't seem put out by the similarity.
"One thing that I want to be clear about is that I don't think that she stole my dish," Ms. Cohen wrote. "Chefs, myself included, are constantly inspired by things they eat and dishes they read about. I've written a cookbook and released lots of recipes into the wild, and I don't have a patent on any of them.
"From time to time, a Dirt Candy recipe, or a riff on a Dirt Candy recipe, will show up on a menu somewhere, and it always makes me happy and proud. Making dishes is a conversation that chefs are having with each other, and it's always nice to feel like someone's seen what I'm doing and found it worth engaging with. And more power to Blanca. It looks like they're making some amazing food out there." 
When I interviewed Ms. Peetz a few weeks ago about the origins of her dessert, she did not mention any outside inspiration. But if it's true that she was taking part in a conversation, to use Ms. Cohen's term, it's clear that Ms. Peetz was holding up her end of it. She had ideas of her own, good ones.
The dessert at Dirt Candy had a crunchy, pastry element: beignets stuffed with pink jelly made from watermelon and watermelon radish. Ms. Peetz had a crunchy pastry of her own, and it was completely different: a macadamia crumble that was like pecan sandies made with another kind of nut. The macadamias danced very gracefully with both the watermelon and the watermelon radish.
Unlike Ms. Peetz's dessert, Ms. Cohen's included a watermelon sorbet. And Ms. Peetz had come up with a stunning garnish, a thin chip of watermelon radish that was lightly sugared. It tied together the conceit of the dessert; its green edge and speckled red core made plain how the watermelon radish got its name, and made the dessert's leap from radish to melon work on a visual as well as a verbal level.
Certain words make journalists and their editors jumpy. Words like first, last and greasiest. All it takes is one reader pointing out something that was earlier, or later, or greasier, and you're publishing a correction.
One word that makes me jumpy these days is "original." I have seen a number of dishes that struck me as brand-new, never-before-seen innovations, only to find out later that they bore a striking resemblance to another chef's work. I agree with Ms. Cohen that this kind of thing happens all the time, and that it's generally healthy and good for creativity.
This is an argument that Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman make in their new book, "The Knockoff Economy." The authors study the role of imitation in fashion, finance, comedy, football and professional kitchens, asking how these industries can thrive without the same level of intellectual property protection given to music and literature. They conclude that stealing ideas in those fields doesn't discourage innovation. "Major industries survive and even thrive in the face of copying," they write, "and in some cases copying makes them richer and more productive."
I think they're right, at least about restaurants. Chefs borrow ideas all the time; the good ones will add a riff of their own; ideas grow and morph; cuisine evolves. Some day, watermelon-radish ice cream may be as popular as molten chocolate cake. And that, I imagine, will be just fine with Ms. Cohen, as long as everybody remembers where the idea came from.
 6:02 p.m. | Updated This afternoon, I spoke with Ms. Peetz, who said that the first time she had heard of the Dirt Candy dessert was earlier this week when she read about it on a blog. She called the coincidence "weird." When she first put the dessert on Blanca's menu, she said, "I thought it was one of the most innovative desserts I'd ever done." She said she has never been to Dirt Candy but respects Ms. Cohen as a "very innovative chef with vegetables."

HEADLINE: Immigration and American Jobs

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: Rather than displacing native workers, the availability of cheap immigrant labor can help create jobs for Americans as well, researchers have concluded. 

 BODY:
Of all the economic dynamics buffeting the American middle class, immigration might seem the easiest to explain: as millions of poor immigrants from Latin America poured illegally into the country seeking work, the conventional wisdom goes, they competed with more expensive American workers, displacing them from their jobs and undercutting their wages. 
This understanding of immigration helped propel a vast increase in the Border Patrol's budget over the last two decades to stop immigrants on their way in. It was the rationale for proposals to build a long, tall fence along the southern border. President Obama, who in 2008 said he would push for a law that would grant many of these immigrants legal access to jobs in the United States, instead deported a record number of immigrants working here illegally. 
But this explanation of the impact of immigration is mostly wrong. 
For years, economists have been poring through job market statistics looking for evidence that immigrants undercut less-educated Americans in the labor market. The most recent empirical studies conclude that the impact is slight: they confirm earlier findings that immigration on the whole has not led to fewer jobs for American workers. More significantly, they suggest that immigrants have had, at most, a smallnegativeimpact on the wages of Americans who compete with them most directly, those with a high school degree or less.
Meanwhile, the research has found that immigrants - including the poor, uneducated ones coming from south of the border -- have a big positive impact on the economy over the long run, bolstering the profitability of American firms, reducing the prices of some products and services by providing employers with a new labor source and creating more opportunities for investment and jobs. Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California at Davis, estimated that the wave of immigrants that entered the United States from 1990 to 2007 increased national income per worker by about $5,400 a year on average, in 2007 dollars. He also concluded that the wave had a small positive impact on the average wage of American workers, by lifting the overall economy. If immigrants hurt anyone, it was the previous cohort of immigrants, with whom they most directly compete in the labor market.
These conclusions may seem to fly in the face of the laws of supply and demand. But they are not quite so odd. They can become obvious, in fact, once we take into account the response of American companies, and workers, to the inflows of cheap foreign labor. 
The belief that immigration would simply displace American workers relies on the assumption that employers would do nothing but replace their costly domestic labor force with cheap imports. But that's not typically what happens. For one thing, immigrants and domestic workers are not identical. Even the least-educated Americans are likely to be more fluent in English - better at talking with bosses or communicating with customers. When a contractor in Fresno expands into roofing, it will not just need a bunch of cheap immigrant roofers. It will also need an American supervisor and maybe an extra clerk. 
Faced with a new, different pool of workers, companies often invest to reap the higher profits that the labor allows. Contractors, for instance, will be able to take on projects that would not have been profitable paying higher wages to domestic workers - like the roofing example in Fresno. This provides new opportunities for immigrants and for more highly paid domestic workers alike. 
Mr. Peri and Chad Sparber of Colgate University found that American workers in states with large shares of less-educated immigrants gravitate toward occupations like cashiers and bank tellers, waiters or sales floor clerks, which require more communications skills. Foreigners, in turn, stick to manual tasks and physical labor. By encouraging this specialization and capital investment, immigration contributes to productivity growth. 
In other words, immigration can produce domestic jobs. Restaurants are much less common in Norway than the United States because Norway lacks the cheap labor - making a dinner out in Oslo prohibitively expensive. In many New York restaurants, the American waiters and hosts owe their jobs to the underpaid illegal immigrants in the kitchen, whose low wages allow the restaurant to exist. The vast agricultural industry in the Central Valley of California might not exist without cheap immigrant farm workers who make it profitable.
There are victims of immigration. Immigrants can displace domestic workers - before business investment starts rising and creating new jobs. This is particularly notable in economic downturns, when demand and business investment are depressed. Some displaced workers may not be able to fit in the reconfigured labor market, even if new investments kick in and the economy as a whole benefits. A 50-year-old American janitor with no high school degree may find it hard to make the transition to another job when immigrants move into the building maintenance business.
This dynamic potentially causes a small negative impact on the wages of less-skilled workers - but it's also possible that this impact is positive. A study by Mr. Peri and Gianmarco Ottaviano of Bocconi University in Milan concluded that the immigration wave into the United States from 1990 to 2006 changed the wages of American workers with no high school degree by somewhere from minus 0.1 percent to plus 0.6 percent. 
But over the long term, most less-skilled American workers are likely to benefit. Immigrant workers, in fact, may help their American peers resist the forces of globalization and technological progress that have been walloping the American middle class. 
Those nostalgic for strawberry fields harvested by well-paid Americans ignore the fact that without the cheap foreigners, there might not be American strawberry fields. Chances are, it would be cheaper to import the strawberries. When the bracero program ended in the 1960s, tomato growers in California responded to the sudden shortage of Mexican immigrant farm workers by deploying a new mechanical harvester and a tomato that could be cut by machine.
These days, the problem of low-wage immigration seems academic. Since the financial crisis in 2009, poor immigrants from Latin America have been mostly leaving the United States, unable to find a decent job here. American workers might want them back. "If some firms don't expand because this labor isn't there," Mr. Peri says, "they will create less jobs for native workers."

HEADLINE: A Veteran of Fusion Science Proposes Narrowing the Field

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A veteran of decades of fusion research narrows the field. 

 BODY:
After reading yesterday's post on the brewing fight over funding for nuclear fusion research, Robert L. Hirsch, who directed the country's fusion energy program in the 1970s through the Atomic Energy Commission, got in touch to describe how his views of the prospects of harnessing fusion as a practical energy source have evolved. (Just in case you missed it, here's a link to an interesting comment on the fusion post sent by John P. Holdren, the science adviser to President Obama.)
Hirsch attached a speech he just gave at the 14th meeting of an American and Japanese working group focused on the fusion approach called inertial electrostatic confinement (some research on this method was covered in a 2007 Times article).
The speech, in which Hirsch questions the utility of the most prominent international experiment at the moment, the ITER project in France, is reproduced below as a "Your Dot" contribution (I added a few links for context):
 Where to Look for Practical Fusion Power 
Robert L. Hirsch
Presented at the 14th U.S.-Japan IECF Workshop, October 16, 2012.
We learn; we learn more; we learn throughout life. Some learning is easy; some is very difficult. After my experience in fusion research and many other energy technologies, I feel that I've learned where we might look for practical fusion power. Part of that learning comes from where practical fusion power is not likely to be found.
Fusion is not like fire, although some fusion researchers seem to think so. Fire became a major source of energy for early humankind, partly because it provided special capabilities, and it had essentially no competition. Also, there were no cost or environmental issues to be concerned with when humans discovered fire and learned to use it. Fire worked; it was convenient, and it did wonderful things when measured by then-existing lifestyles.
Fusion research started after World War II at a time when it was felt that science had wonderful things to provide for humankind. The potential cost of fusion power was not an issue. The wonders of the atom, or more properly the nucleus, were felt to be unbounded. Fusion was the fundamental energy source in the universe, powering the sun and the stars. Wonders awaited.
Many outstanding people turned to the pursuit of fusion power. A number of fusion concepts emerged and were investigated. Soon it became painfully clear that practical fusion power would not happen quickly. First, we had to develop the science of plasma physics.
After decades of effort, a great deal has been learned and accomplished, but a practical fusion power concept has not been forthcoming. Note that I said "practical fusion power." Unlike fire, fusion power has to compete against a number of other options. The word "practical" means that a fusion power system must be desirable, based on the realities of the society into which it will be introduced.
An unfortunate problem today is that many people in fusion research believe that producing a fusion-something that simply works is the goal, but that is definitely wrong! Fusion power and fire are distinctly different.
Let's consider some specific criteria for practical fusion power. In 1994, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute - EPRI - convened a panel of utility technologists to develop "Criteria for Practical Fusion Power Systems." The result was a four-page folder that outlined "Three principal types of criteria:"

        
Economics,
        
Public Acceptance, and
        
Regulatory Simplicity.
The criteria are almost self-explanatory, but let me quote from the Economics Criteria: "To compensate for the higher economic risks associated with new technologies, fusion plants must have lower lifecycle costs than competing technologies available at the time of commercialization." Details for the criteria are given in the report, which I commend to anyone motivated to help develop fusion power.
Against these criteria, let's consider tokamak fusion, the centerpiece of which is ITER - the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor - under construction in France. As we know, it's an enormously large machine, which is generally considered to be a prototype of a practical fusion power plant.
Comparing the ITER and the core of a comparable commercial fission reactor shows an enormous difference in size - a factor of 5-10 -- ITER being huge by comparison to a fission reactor core.
It is known in engineering and technology development that the cost of a finished machine or product is roughly proportional to the mass of the device. Eyeballing ITER compared to a fission reactor core, it's obvious that an ITER-like machine is many times more massive. Yes, you can argue details, like the hollow bore of a tokamak, but the size of the huge superconducting magnets and their heavy support structures provides no relief.
Bottom line - On the face of it, an ITER-like power system will be much more expensive than a comparable fission reactor, so I believe that tokamak fusion loses big-time on cost, independent of details.
Next, consider the fact that deuterium-tritium fusion inherently emits copious neutrons, which will induce significant radioactivity in adjacent tokamak structural and moderating materials. Accordingly, a tokamak power system will become highly radioactive as soon as it begins to operate and, over time, radiation damage will render those same materials structurally weak, requiring replacement.
In the U.S., as elsewhere in the world, we have a Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will almost certainly be given the task of ensuring that the public is safe from mishaps associated with tokamak power system failures. Expected regulation will require all kinds of safety features, which will add further costs to tokamak power.
While the character of the plasma in a tokamak power reactor will not likely represent a large energy-release safety issue, the superconducting magnets would contain a huge amount of stored energy. If those magnets were to go normal - lose their superconducting properties - the energy release would be very large. It can be argued that the probability of that happening will be small, but it will nevertheless not be zero, so the regulators will require safety features that will protect the public in a situation where the magnets go normal, releasing very large amounts of energy.
Accordingly, it is virtually certain that the regulators will demand a containment building for a commercial tokamak reactor that will likely resemble what is currently required for fission reactors, so as to protect the public from normal-going superconducting magnet energy release. Because an ITER-like tokamak reactor is inherently so large, such a building will be extremely expensive, further increasing the costs of something that is already too expensive.
Next, there's the induced radioactivity in the structure and moderator of a tokamak power reactor. Some tokamak proponents contend that structure might be made out of an exotic material that will have low induced radioactivity. Maybe, but last I looked, such materials were very expensive and not in common use in the electric power industry. So if one were to decide to use such materials, there would be another boost to cost, along with an added difficulty for industry to deal with.
No matter what materials are chosen, there will still be neutron-induced materials damage and large amounts of induced radioactivity. There will thus be remote operations required and large amounts of radioactive waste that will have to be handled and sent off site for cooling and maybe burial. That will be expensive and the public is not likely to be happy with large volumes of fusion-based radioactivity materials being transported around the country. Remember the criteria of public acceptance.
I could go on with other downsides and showstoppers associated with tokamak fusion power, but I won't. It is enough to say that tokamak fusion power has what I believe are insurmountable barriers to practicability and acceptability.
By the way, my arguments assume that tokamak physics and technology works well and is reasonably simple, meaning that not many more components will have to be added to the system to allow it to operate on a steady basis for very long periods of time between the long shutdowns needed to change out radiation-damaged, radioactive materials.
What I've just described is not a happy story. At some point, probably in a matter of years, a group of pragmatic power industry engineers will be convened to seriously scrutinize tokamak fusion, and they are virtually certain to declare that it cannot become a practical power system. That will certainly be a calamity for the people involved and for the cause of fusion power.
Let's review what I've said. First, we have to recognize that practical fusion power must measure up to or be superior to the competition in the electric power industry. Second, it is virtually certain that tokamak fusion as represented by ITER will not be practical.
So where are we likely to find practical fusion power? First, we must look for a concept or concepts that are inherently small in size, which means high plasma density. Second, we must look for something that can be based on a low or zero neutron fusion reaction. One example is the proton-boron reaction.
We know some things about proton-boron fusion. First it requires much higher temperatures that deuterium-tritium. Second, it cannot be based on a Maxwellian plasma particle distribution, because theory tells us that the plasma radiation losses (Bremsstrahlung) from a very high temperature, Maxwellian, proton-boron plasma will kill the concept.
That means that a proton-boron plasma must be non-Maxwellian, and it must be fashioned in such a way that normal inter-particle scattering reactions can be managed on an on-going basis.
For this audience, the requirements for practical fusion power sound like they could be met by Inertial Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) fusion. As you well know, IEC is a family of possibilities from gridded systems to magnetically constrained systems and on and on. They can in principle be very high density and therefore small, and they could have plasma distribution control as an element. I can't help but wonder if IEC just might be the key to practical fusion power.
In conclusion, in the early days of the U.S. fusion research, the program was classified secret and called Project Sherwood. One explanation for that name was, if it works, it sure would be wonderful.
I hope that you and others will be able to help make it happen.
Thank you.
PS. These thoughts were painful to formulate. As a past leader of the U.S. federal fusion program, I played a significant role in establishing tokamak research to the U.S., and I had high hopes for its success. Realities have emerged to dash those hopes. When we learn unpleasant things, it is incumbent on us to speak up, even when it hurts.

HEADLINE: The Free Men of Color Go to War

BYLINE: TERRY L. JONES


HIGHLIGHT: In the fall of 1862, a group of Louisiana blacks became the first to muster into the Union Army. 

 BODY:
As in all things, 19th-century New Orleans was a world apart from much of the rest of the South. When the Civil War began, it had a large population of so-called free men of color, citizens descended from French and Spanish men, on the one side, and slave women on the other. 
Colonial-era slave codes granted them complete equality; the "hommes de couleur libre" could own land, businesses and even slaves; they could be educated and serve in the military. They created a niche for themselves in the Crescent City's multicultural society and became important to Louisiana's defense, maintaining their own militia units that served in various Indian wars and against the British during the Revolutionary War.
After the United States acquired Louisiana in 1803, the status of the free men of color changed significantly. Louisiana's Constitution of 1812 specifically restricted the right to vote to white men who owned property. The free men of color could still own property and serve in the militia, but they were left out of politics, and their status began to decline. Nonetheless, they once again volunteered to defend their homes during the War of 1812 and bravely fought for Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. 
A week after civil war erupted in April 1861, some of New Orleans' free men of color offered to form military companies to protect the state against the Union. In an announcement published in the Daily Picayune, the men declared that they were prepared to defend their homes "against any enemy who may come and disturb its tranquillity." The Daily Crescent newspaper declared: "Our free colored men ... are certainly as much attached to the land of their birth as their white brethren here in Louisiana. ... [They] will fight the Black Republican with as much determination and gallantry as any body of white men in the service of the Confederate States."
Soon afterward, hundreds of free men of color gathered in the street to show their support for the Confederacy. A regiment known as the Native Guards was soon formed and mustered into the state militia, but the Confederate government refused to accept them into the national army. All of the regiment's line officers were of African descent, although Gov. Thomas O. Moore appointed a white officer to command it. 
Popular history clams that many of the Native Guards were wealthy slave owners who were members of New Orleans' upper class, but that is not true. While a few might have been well-to-do and owned slaves, and some certainly were related to prominent citizens, the 1860 census shows that a vast majority were clerks, artisans and skilled laborers - lower middle class at the time. 
The black militia disbanded when Union forces occupied New Orleans in the spring of 1862. After the Battle of Baton Rouge in August, Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, the Union's military governor of Louisiana, requested reinforcements to defend New Orleans, but none were forthcoming. In desperation, Butler informed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton that he planned to raise a regiment of free blacks. On Sept. 27, 1862, Butler mustered the First Regiment of Louisiana Native Guards into Union service, making it the first sanctioned regiment of African-American troops in the United States Army. 
It has generally been assumed that the African-Americans who joined Butler's Native Guards were the same ones who had served earlier in the state militia regiment by the same name. Butler, in fact, claimed that was the case. As a result, historians have questioned the sincerity of the black militiamen who volunteered for Confederate service in 1861. Their supposed change in loyalty seems to indicate that their offer to fight for the South was made only to protect their economic and social status within the community; to not volunteer would make white neighbors suspicious and possibly lead to retaliation. Some Native Guards said as much to Butler and others.
Military service records, however, call this assumption into question. Despite Butler's claim to the contrary, a vast majority of his Native Guards were not free men of color but slaves who had made their way into Union lines. James G. Hollandsworth Jr., a professor at the University of Southern Mississippi who wrote the definitive study of the Native Guards, found that only 108 of the 1,035 members of the Louisiana militia regiment, or about 10 percent, went on to serve in the Union's Native Guards. This would seem to indicate that a large number of the black militiamen were indeed sincere in their desire to fight for the South and defend their homes against invasion. 
(That's very different, of course, from saying that a large number of African-Americans voluntarily served in the rebel army, a claim made by some. The men of the first Native Guard had unique circumstances and motives that should be understood in their specific context, and not extrapolated to the entire black free and enslaved population. One extensive study of Louisiana's 65,000 Confederate soldiers identified only 15 who were known to be of African descent.)
While most of Butler's Louisiana Native Guards were runaway slaves, some were free men with connections to prominent white families. During an inspection, the Native Guards' white colonel told another officer: "Sir, the best blood of Louisiana is in that regiment! Do you see that tall, slim fellow, third file from the right of the second company? One of the ex-governors of the state is his father. That orderly sergeant in the next company is the son of a man who has been six years in the United States Senate. Just beyond him is the grandson of Judge_______ ... ; and all through the ranks you will find the same state of facts. ... Their fathers are disloyal; [but] these black Ishmaels will more than compensate for their treason by fighting it in the field."
Later, the Second and Third Regiments of Native Guards, likewise made up overwhelmingly of former slaves, were mustered into service. In July 1863, the three regiments were brigaded together in what became known as the Corps D'Afrique. All three regiments had white colonels, but the line officers in the First and Second Regiments were black, while the Third Regiment had both black and white officers. 
These Louisianians were the only black officers in the Union Army, but their racist superiors eventually purged most of them. To weed out incompetence, all officers in the Army had to pass an oral examination given by a board of experienced officers; those who failed either resigned or were stripped of their commissions. Army examiners routinely failed black officers or harassed them to make them resign their commissions. By war's end only two African-American officers remained on duty in the entire army, and both were with the Louisiana Native Guards. 
Like all African-American soldiers who served in the Civil War, the Native Guards suffered from blatant discrimination. Not only were they paid less than white soldiers, they were also issued inferior arms and rations, and white soldiers often insulted and harassed them. 
Despite their poor treatment, the men served well, and they became the first black soldiers to see combat in a major battle when the First and Third Regiments attacked the Confederate defenses at Port Hudson, La., on May 27, 1863. Most of the men fought bravely in their baptism of fire, and the Native Guards suffered 169 casualties in the attack. Afterward, the bodies of the dead were left to rot between the lines. 
Why that happened is a matter of dispute. In her book This Republic of Suffering, the Harvard historian Drew Gilpin Faust claims that Confederate sharpshooters prevented Union soldiers from retrieving the Native Guards' dead during a truce that was arranged for that purpose the next day. On the other hand, the historian Lawrence Lee Hewitt, from Southeastern Louisiana University, and the late Arthur W. Bergeron Jr., the former manager and curator of Port Hudson State Commemorative Area, wrote in their book "Louisianians in the Civil War" that the Union soldiers "inexplicably" failed to collect their dead on that part of the field. The stench of decaying bodies became so great that the Confederates finally requested permission from Union Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks to bury the dead Native Guards themselves. According to Hewitt and Bergeron, "Banks refused, claiming that he had no dead in that area."
Northern newspapers and magazines wrote extensively about the black soldiers' bravery at Port Hudson, although they greatly exaggerated their success. A Harper's Weekly illustration showed the Native Guards mounting the rebel breastworks and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. But in fact, none of the black soldiers got anywhere near the Confederate position, and their entire attack may have lasted only 15 minutes. In contrast to the Native Guards' heavy casualties, the Confederates who turned back their assault did not lose a single soldier.
Rather, the most significant contribution the Native Guards made at Port Hudson was demonstrating to their white comrades and superiors that African-Americans would fight as well as white soldiers. In the days following the doomed attack, many officers and men made note of the Native Guards' bravery and heavy losses. General Banks told his wife, "They fought splendidly!" Col. Benjamin H. Grierson wrote, "There can be no question about the good fighting quality of negroes, hereafter, that question was settled beyond a doubt yesterday." Largely because of the Native Guards' service at Port Hudson, Union officers began recruiting African-Americans for combat roles.
The three Native Guards regiments went on to further glory in the war. After serving in the 1864 Red River Campaign, they were re-designated the 73rd, 74th and 75th United States Colored Infantry. When the Union Army attacked and captured Fort Blakely, Ala., in April 1865, it was the Native Guards who led the charge. Afterward, one Union general wrote, "To the Seventy-third U.S. Colored Infantry belongs the honor of first planting their colors on the enemy parapet." Capt. Louis A. Snaer, a free man of color, led his men in the successful assault on Fort Blakely. Commending his courage, Snaer's commanding officer wrote, "Captain Snaer fell with a severe wound at my feet as I reached the line. He refused to sheathe his sword or to be carried off the field. ... No braver officer has honored any flag." 
The Louisiana Native Guards were mustered out of service soon after the last Confederate surrender, and many of its veterans became active in Reconstruction politics. One, P. B. S. Pinchback, became America's first black governor when, in 1872, he filled out the remaining term of the impeached Louisiana governor Henry Clay Warmoth.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts for Job Creators

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON and OWEN ZIDAR


HIGHLIGHT: Cutting taxes for the lower 95 percent of the population will stimulate economic growth and job creation far more than cutting taxes for the top 5 percent, two economists assert. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. Owen Zidar, a doctoral student in economics at the University of California, Berkeley, was previously a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers and, in 2008-9, an analyst at Bain Capital Ventures. 
The centerpiece of Mitt Romney's tax plan is an across-the-board 20 percent cut in marginal tax rates. This cut, along with a few other tax changes Mr. Romney has endorsed - such as repeal of the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax - would reduce federal tax revenue from personal income and payroll taxes by an estimated $3.6 trillion to $3.8 trillion over 10 years. 
The total is closer to $5 trillion when Mr. Romney's proposed cut in the corporate income tax rate to 25 percent is included. About two-thirds of this amount would go to taxpayers making $200,000 a year or more - about 5 percent of all taxpayers.
Extending the Bush tax cuts for high-income earners, as Mr. Romney proposes, adds another trillion in lost revenue and increases the share of the benefits going to the top 5 percent. Even if the cost of the Romney tax cuts for the top 5 percent is covered by base-broadening measures, as Mr. Romney promises - but as President Obama and many others assert is mathematically impossible - does it make sense to devote trillions of dollars to lowering income taxes for the top 5 percent? Is this an effective way to create jobs?
Mr. Romney appears to think so. His plan rests on the assertion that lower taxes for high-income taxpayers will increase economic activity and employment - that lower taxes for job creators create jobs and will do so quickly. This assertion, while superficially convincing and ideologically compelling, is not supported by the evidence.

If tax cuts for high-income earners generate substantial real economic activity and job creation, then we should expect to see two things in the data. First, employment growth should be stronger in the years after tax cuts for these earners. Second, parts of the country with a larger share of high-income earners should experience stronger employment growth after national tax cuts for these taxpayers, because the places where they live receive a larger share of the national tax cuts. 
What do we actually see after combing through a half-century of economic data? Neither of these predictions is borne out.
The graph below, based on our research, shows the relationship between the cumulative change in income and payroll tax liabilities for the top 5 percent over a two-year period as a share of gross domestic product and employment growth in the two years after the change. 
The graph and the regression analysis on which it is based reveal that there is no link between income tax cuts for the top 5 percent and subsequent job creation. (We also examined the relationship between tax cuts for the top 10 percent and subsequent job creation and found the same result.)
The table below highlights three of these tax changes -- the Reagan tax cut of 1982, the Clinton tax increase of 1993 and the Bush tax cut of 2003 - and subsequent employment growth. Strong employment growth followed the Reagan cut, but the employment growth following the Clinton tax increase exceeded the employment growth following the Bush tax cut, which was comparable in size to the Reagan cut.
Job growth at the state level after national tax cuts for high-income earners confirms the absence of a strong link between such cuts and the pace of job creation in the next two years. 
The next graph shows no substantial link between tax cuts for the top 10 percent and the pace of job creation at the state level. Employment growth in states with a large share of rich people, such as Connecticut or New Jersey, was not much faster, on average, than it would have been otherwise after the Reagan and Bush tax cuts for the top 10 percent and wasn't much slower, on average, after the Clinton tax increase on this group.
If there really were a strong link between job creation and tax cuts for high-income "job creators," we should be able to see the effects somewhere. But we have found no evidence that such cuts lead to substantially faster employment growth at the national, state or even ZIP-code level. 
Tax cuts for everyone else are a much more effective path to job creation. Our research found a statistically significant and positive relationship between tax cuts for the bottom 95 percent and job growth at both the national and state levels. The graph below shows the relationship for the national data. Our results indicate that almost all of the stimulative effect of income and payroll tax cuts on job creation in the short to medium run result from such cuts for the bottom 95 percent. 
Lower-income taxpayers spend a higher share of their tax cuts. Many of these taxpayers often have more difficulty borrowing money and tapping into their housing wealth than higher-income individuals. These demand-side forces explain why consumption goes up much more after tax cuts for the bottom 95 percent than after equivalently sized cuts for the top 5 percent. An increase in consumption, which still accounts for about 70 percent of G.D.P., fuels increases in demand, and that leads companies to create more jobs. In survey after survey, businesses confirm that changes in demand are the primary determinant of their employment decisions.
Investment also increases after tax cuts for the bottom 95 percent, suggesting that shifting moderately size tax cuts to the bottom 95 percent from the top 5 percent isn't a zero-sum trade-off between consumption and investment.
Instead, an increase in demand and economic activity because of an increase in consumption also makes investment more attractive, especially in difficult economic conditions.
Over all, our research shows that tax cuts for the bottom 95 percent are much more effective than tax cuts for the top 5 percent at increasing job creation in the subsequent two years. 
Other analysts reach similar conclusions. For example, the Congressional Budget Office and Mark Zandi, Moody's chief economist, find that tax cuts for lower-income recipients generate larger increases in employment per dollar cost to the federal budget than comparable tax cuts for high-income taxpayers in the short run. 
What about the long run? A recent report by the Congressional Research Service found no clear relationship between cuts in marginal tax rates that primarily benefit high-income taxpayers and economic growth and job creation. A recent review by three distinguished academic economists also found no convincing evidence that real economic activity responds materially to tax-rate changes on top income earners, although such rate changes do affect their tax-avoidance behavior. 
Cross-country comparisons also do not show a close link between top marginal rates and growth. While these studies don't find large effects in the long run, we note that these long-run effects are harder to measure and are thus more uncertain. 
Nevertheless, if the priority is to create a substantial number of jobs over the next presidential term, evidence from the last half-century strongly suggests that tax cuts for the top 5 percent won't work. Tax cuts for working families, tax cuts directly aimed at expanded hiring or increases in infrastructure investment would have much more bang for the buck and would cost much less in terms of forgone revenue and deficit reduction in the future.
With elevated unemployment, weakness in Europe and slowing growth in emerging economies, fiscal measures that actually increase economic activity and employment in the near term are required. Our research shows that tax cuts for the rich do not meet this standard.

HEADLINE: Chinese Economy Should Lay Off the 'Cheesecake'

BYLINE: BETTINA WASSENER


HIGHLIGHT: The mixed economic data from China this week had analysts scrambling for metaphors. Send us your favorites. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The sprawling Chinese economy is hard to read at the best of times. This week, as I wrote here, a flood of data painted a complex picture: shades of gloom (the slowest expansion in years) mixed with nuggets of optimistic - or at least less bad - news (a stabilization in September).
Analysts, left scrambling for metaphors, spiced up their commentary with a mix of old favorites and new creations. 
Almost all of them spoke of "bottoming out," "stabilization," or both. 
The teams at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch resorted to the phrase "green shoots." 
Standard Chartered titled its research note "China - A glimmer of dawn."
UBS dampened any hopes for a V-shaped or U-shaped rebound, and went, instead, for the letter L, saying any rebound would be "modest at best and nothing to write home about." 
And IHS Global Insight in Beijing commented that at least "those fearing a hard landing will be able to sleep a little better tonight."
Top metaphor marks, though, go to Arthur Kroeber of the analytics firm GK Dragonomics, whose analysis this week of the challenges facing China concluded that the country needed to go on a diet: "For the last decade China enjoyed a delicious and fattening diet of cheesecake. This was all right for a while, but now the risk of arterial sclerosis looms, and a strict corrective regimen of broccoli is called for. It is not as tasty, but much healthier in the long run."

HEADLINE: Media Agency Leaders Respond to Newsweek Decision

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The magazine's decision to proceed as an online-only publication has gotten the attention of Madison Avenue, which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars through the decades to buy advertising pages in the magazine. 

 BODY:
The decision by Newsweek to end its print edition on Dec. 31 and proceed as an online-only publication certainly got the attention of Madison Avenue, which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars through the decades to buy advertising pages in the magazine.
Here are reactions to the decisions from five senior executives at some leading media agencies:
 Brenda White, senior vice president and publishing activation director at Starcom USA, part of the Starcom Media Vest Group division of the Publicis Groupe: "This was not a surprise in light of Newsweek's business challenges over the last several years. I am encouraged by their new digital strategy and look forward to hearing consumer reaction to the translation of the Newsweek brand."
 Barry Lowenthal, president at the Media Kitchen, part of the Maxxcom Global Media division of MDC Partners: "It was just a matter of time. But what IAC did was brave. Newsweek is a famous brand and IAC is a digital company that knows how to leverage digital brands. Newsweek probably has a better chance of succeeding at IAC as a digital-only play."
"Print just doesn't matter. What matters is great content served over the right platform. For many of us, news belongs in the digital format. Hopefully Newsweek can flourish as a digital-only publication."
 George Janson, managing partner and director for print at GroupM, the WPP unit that oversees media agencies including MEC, MediaCom and Mindshare: "The jury is still out as to whether a pure digital play for the Newsweek brand is a sustainable business model. The site will need to have scale, a unique point of differentiation and exclusive, breaking news if it is to prosper. A huge issue is whether consumers will pay for a digital-only subscription to the Newsweek brand."
"Also, is Barry Diller going to invest the resources needed to create a world-class news gathering organization to compete against some of the other global behemoths like Time, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, or is this a complete re-imagining of the Newsweek brand as we know it?"
"This does not portend the demise of print in the very short term. Newsweek has been struggling for the past several years. Obviously Diller took a long-term look at the future for Newsweek's print edition and didn't like what he saw."
"There are a number of weekly magazines whose print products are faring better and who have created business models 'beyond the page' such as The Economist, Time and The New Yorker. Some of these long-established brands such as The New Yorker have had success in developing robust mobile and tablet platforms that are attracting younger people to their brands."
 Robin Steinberg, executive vice president and director for publishing investment and activation at MediaVest, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe: "It's evident we've experienced a paradigm shift in how consumers engage and connect with content, and news content specifically. As such, this is a progressive move for Newsweek as they transform their product and business model to support the multitude of devices and screens where consumers and advertisers invest plenty of time and money."
 Bryan Fuhr, senior vice president at Havas Digital North America, part of the Havas Media unit of Havas: "Newsweek was the first publication my parents gave me. The decision by Newsweek to cease printing is an occasion to reflect not only on changes in the way society gets its news, but also how advertisers and brands can continue to support the need for great commentary and analysis."
"The work Daily Beast and Newsweek have done to lead the industry forward is very exciting. We are eager to see how the Newsweek brand continues to reshape itself."

HEADLINE: At Charity Dinner, Self-Deprecation and Plenty of Zingers

BYLINE: SHARON OTTERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Al Smith white-tie charity dinner stayed true to form on Thursday, injecting a dose of levity into a bare-knuckled campaign for president. 

 BODY:
Applause filled the Waldorf-Astoria ballroom as a parade of 70 of New York's most powerful people strode onto the dais at the Al Smith Foundation dinner on Thursday night. There were millionaires and billionaires, politicians and union leaders, talk-show hosts and pundits.
The cheers grew for Ann Romney, and built into a warm ovation for her husband, Mitt Romney. As the president walked in, the crowd of 1,600 rose to their feet. They remained standing and clapping as Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the leader of the Archdiocese of New York, arrived, and as the cardinal inched his way toward his seat, President Obama helped him into his chair.
Alfred E. Smith IV, the master of ceremonies for the evening, took the podium and announced, in his raspy voice, that he would be the evening's "referee." Setting the tone, his first dig was at Mr. Romney.
"I want to say a special welcome to all the accomplished women here tonight," he said. "It's good to see you made it out of those binders." There was some laughter, but it was restrained, as if people were not yet sure how Mr. Romney would take the joke.
The program moved forward, and the room started to vibrate with the sound of 1,000 salad forks clinking against 1,000 porcelain plates.
Cardinal Dolan and Mr. Obama, on his right, leaned into each other, laughing about something, their shoulders nearly touching. The Romneys, at the start, looked a bit less comfortable. But after a while, Cardinal Dolan turned to his left and with a grin, engaged Mr. Romney, who smiled back.
Of all the local politicians, it was Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo who got the most attention from the night's heavy hitters. Both candidates and the moderator found the temptation to poke fun at his rumored interest in running for president in 2016 too much to resist.
Mr. Smith, the M.C., started it off: "The governor is working on some material for his 2016 Al Smith Dinner speech. I notice he gets closer and closer to the podium every year. It's like 'Jaws.' Dah dum, dah dum."
Then Mr. Romney, reflecting on the similarities between himself and Mr. Cuomo said: "A very impressive fellow, but he may be getting a little ahead of himself," he said of New York's governor. "Let me get this straight: here's a man who has put in one term as governor, and happens to have a father who was a governor, and he thinks that's enough to run for president?"
Still, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was not forgotten, particularly his easy-to-tease ban on large sugary drinks.
"Of course, I want to raise my glass to Your Honor, Mayor Bloomberg," said Mr. Smith. And he pulled out a 72-ounce Big Gulp and tipped it over his own face.
And keeping with the semi-somber, but still funny, note that Mr. Obama kept striking, he said: "Win or lose, this will be my last political campaign. So I'm trying to drink it all in. Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg will only let me have 16 ounces of it."
The candidates' speeches at the Al Smith dinner tend to follow a pattern. First, poke fun at yourself. Then, skewer some of your opponent's flaws. Finally, wrap it up with the equivalent of a verbal hug, by saying that deep down, you respect the other candidate, particularly as a father and a family man.
But this year, Cardinal Dolan, in his speech, managed to work in a bit more substance. After joking about his girth (his favorite humor
subject) and the message that Pope Benedict XVI told him to bring to the candidates (it was in Latin, he said, so he didn't understand it), he sermonized about the legacy of Al Smith and how he had "a tear in his Irish eyes for what we would call the 'uns'" of the world.
"The unemployed. The uninsured. The unwanted. The unwed mothers. The innocent fragile unborn baby in her womb. The undocumented. The unhoused. The unhealthy. The undereducated," he said.
Religious liberty is the core value of our nation, he said, but that does not leave government without a role. "Government, Al Smith believed, should be on the side of these 'uns,'" he said, prompting applause from the well-heeled crowd.
So who was funnier? Who gave the best speech? Lingering amid the aromas of chocolate and passion-fruit syrup and coffee in the towering ballroom at the end of the night, the audience was divided.
Some thought Mr. Romney had by far the stronger delivery. "The president seemed a little bit flat, as if he were tired, or maybe missing Michelle," said Edward J.T. Kenney, an executive vice president at Mutual of America. "I think he misses her when she's not there. Where was she?"
Others thought Mr. Obama had been more, in a word, presidential.
"The president was serious, interesting, respectful, and was truly a leader," said the Rev. John Duffell, a longtime parish priest in Manhattan. "I thought he was self-effacing, and that Romney was a little hostile and political."
It was true that the two men had seemed to take different approaches in their 10-minute speeches. Mr. Romney stuffed his chock-full of zingers for President Obama and his policies, of the sort that he seemed eager to deliver.
Don't be surprised, Mr. Romney told the audience, if the president mentions the monthly jobs report that showed a "slight improvement" in the numbers. "He already has a compelling new slogan," he continued.
"You're better off now than you were four weeks ago."
"The president's remarks tonight," he added, "are brought to you by the letter O and the number $16 trillion," riffing on the Sesame Street theme that he raised in the first debate.
President Obama, meanwhile, was mostly self-deprecating, even self-critical. He opened and closed with jokes about his performance at the first debate.
"It turns out that millions of Americans focused in on the second debate who didn't focus in on the first debate," he said. "And I happen to be one of them." He added: "I particularly want to apologize to Chris Matthews," referring to the MSNBC commentator who was sitting directly behind him. "Four years ago, I gave him a thrill up his leg. This time around, I gave him a stroke."

HEADLINE: State's Jobless Rate Falls for First Time in Nearly a Year

BYLINE: DANNY HAKIM


HIGHLIGHT: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo received some good news when the state's unemployment rate dipped, though it remains above the national average. 

 BODY:
New York's jobless rate fell for the first time in 11 months in September, a welcome sign for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, though the state's rate remains well above the national average.
Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that New York was the only state in the nation with a statistically significant increase in its unemployment rate over the last 12 months, through August, according to the federal household survey. The Cuomo administration has pointed to more positive statistics, notably the federal payroll survey - those numbers have offered a more favorable picture of New York's job growth.
Last month, however, there was improvement in the household survey. New York was one of 41 states to report a decline in unemployment, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released state numbers for September on Friday morning. New York's jobless rate is now 8.9 percent, compared with 7.8 percent nationwide. The state's rate fell from 9.1 percent in August.
One state that did not fare nearly as well was Ohio, a key swing state in next month's election. The state suffered one of the largest decreases in employment in the nation, losing 12,800 jobs from August to September. New York, by contrast, added more than 10,000 jobs in the same period, according to the payroll survey, which does not measure agriculture or the self-employed.
"The jobs data is still obviously uneven," said Edmund J. McMahon, senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative research group. "The story is still one of fairly pronounced unevenness regionally. Downstate, the city is still much stronger than the suburbs, and upstate you have these islands of growth - Rochester and the capital region - and then rest is not great."

HEADLINE: Obama Says His Opponent Has a Case of 'Romnesia'

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's riff, at a rally of about 9,000 supporters at George Mason University, was just one part of a strategy clearly focused to continue to appeal to women voters. 

 BODY:
FAIRFAX, VA. - Taking liberties with his opponent's last name,President Obama fired up a campaign rally here on Friday by blaming "Romnesia" for Mitt Romney's seemingly shifting positions on women's rights and other issues.
"Now, 18 days before the election, Mr. Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year," Mr. Obama said, before offering his admittedly nonexpert medical opinion. "We got to name this condition that he's going though. I think it's called Romnesia."
Mr. Obama's riff, before about 9,000 supporters at George Mason University, was just one part of a rally clearly focused to continue to appeal to women, a key demographic in this all-important swing state. After an introduction by Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, Mr. Obama emphasized in his remarks that he had proven himself the best candidate for women.
"When the next president and Congress could tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come, you don't want someone who has to ask for binders of women," Mr. Obama said, referring to Mr. Romney's remarks during Tuesday's presidential debate. "You want a president who has already appointed two unbelievable women to the Supreme Court."
Mr. Romney's campaign responded quickly, issuing a statement by Barbara Comstock, a Republican state lawmaker in Virginia.
"Women haven't forgotten how we've suffered over the last four years in the Obama economy with higher taxes, higher unemployment, and record levels of poverty," Ms. Comstock said. "What is really frightening is that we know a second term for President Obama will bring devastating defense cuts that will cost Virginia over 130,000 jobs, more burdensome regulations and the biggest tax increase in history on our small businesses and families."
Mr. Obama also criticized Mr. Romney for changing his positions on abortion, energy and other issues. Touting the benefits of his health care law, the president reassured the crowd that "Romnesia" is curable.
"If you come down with a case of Romnesia, and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your Web site, or the promises you've made over the six years you've been running for president, here's the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions."
Along the line snaking through the campus, volunteers repeatedly urged supporters to sign up to help, waving forms and reminding everyone within earshot that Virginia is a battleground state this year. Highlighting that fact, this rally was Mr. Obama's 16th visit to Virginia in 2012.
Evelyn Wilson arrived more than three hours before the rally to claim her spot in the stadium on a cool, damp morning. Ms. Wilson, who traveled from nearby Reston, Va., with her husband to show her support for Mr. Obama, said she had been bombarded with robocalls, including the one that alerted her to this event.
Ms. Wilson, 69, said that this election could have major implications for women's rights among other important issues.
"A Republican win could set us back more than 60 years and reverse all the things we fought for and marched for," Ms. Wilson said, citing the need to protect Roe v. Wade.
The fight for female voters intensified this week after the town-hall-style debate in New York, which included a question about equal pay for women that prompted a clash between the candidates over who could best serve women's needs.
That debate spilled onto the airwaves, with the Romney campaign immediately releasing an ad contending that Mr. Romney does not oppose contraception and believes abortion should be legal in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother. The Obama campaign hit back against that argument, using a clip of Mr. Romney from a CNN debate in 2007 in which Mr. Romney said he would be "delighted" to sign a bill banning all abortions.
 Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Newspapers in Salt Lake City, Tampa and Denver Endorse Obama

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney may be something of a Utah native son, but The Salt Lake Tribune tossed its support to President Obama, in an editorial titled "Too Many Mitts." 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney may be something of a Utah native son, having helped turn around the 2002 Salt Lake Olympic Games, attended Brigham Young University and once owning property there. But on Friday, The Salt Lake Tribune tossed its support to President Obama, in a editorial titled "Too Many Mitts."
Though the endorsement begins by acknowledging Mr. Romney's Utah and Salt Lake Olympics bona fides - "Romney managed to save the state from ignominy, turning the extravaganza into a showcase for the matchless landscapes, volunteerism and efficiency that told the world what is best and most beautiful about Utah and its people," reads the second paragraph - the tone quickly changes. The editorial calls Mr. Romney a "shape-shifting nominee" and adds that the major question of the campaign is, ""Who is this guy, really, and what in the world does he truly believe?"
"Politicians routinely tailor their words to suit an audience," reads the editorial. "Romney, though, is shameless, lavishing vastly diverse audiences with words, any words, they would trade their votes to hear." 
The Tribune editorial page, which endorsed Mr. Obama four years ago but went with President George W. Bush before that, concludes: "Therefore, our endorsement must go to the incumbent, a competent leader who, against tough odds, has guided the country through catastrophe and set a course that, while rocky, is pointing toward a brighter day. The president has earned a second term. Romney, in whatever guise, does not deserve a first."
Mr. Romney's campaign declined to comment on the endorsement. 
Mr. Obama picked up two other major newspaper endorsements Friday; both The Denver Post and The Tampa Bay Times threw their support to the president.
The Denver Post cited Mr. Romney's secretly recorded comments at a closed fund-raiser in May, in which he said he believed that 47 percent of Americans consider themselves "victims" and are dependent on the government, as one of the factors in their decision. 
"His comments on the 47 percent of Americans who refuse to 'take personal responsibility and care for their lives' were a telling insight into his views and a low point of the campaign," The Post wrote. "Obama, on the other hand, has shown throughout his term that he is a steady leader who keeps the interests of a broad array of Americans in mind."
The Orlando Sentinel, however, endorsed Mr. Romney, a flip from its 2008 support of Mr. Obama.
"We have little confidence that Obama would be more successful managing the economy and the budget in the next four years," The Sentinel wrote. "For that reason, though we endorsed him in 2008, we are recommending Romney in this race."

HEADLINE: After Brief Role as Battleground, Indiana Exits, Stage Right

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, Indiana swung 22 percentage points to the left. But Mitt Romney is expected to win the state easily this year. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it's changing. Here is Indiana, the Hoosier State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Brian Howey, editor and publisher of Howey Politics Indiana; and Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. 
Between the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, Indiana swung 22 percentage points to the left, from favoring the Republican George W. Bush by 21 points in 2004 to President Obama by a single point in 2008. It was the the largest swing -- in either direction -- by a nonhome state since the 1992 election.
But the Hoosier State's barely blue tinge faded quickly: Polls show Mitt Romney carrying it by double digits this year.
Indiana has not become a swing state. 
The 2008 results -- the first victory by a Democratic presidential candidate in Indiana since 1964 -- were not caused by a shift in the state's political fundamentals. Instead, 2008 was somewhat of an anomaly, caused by the intersection of mostly external factors and a favorable political environment for Democrats nationally. 
First, the state's Democratic primary in May, a hard-fought contest between Mr. Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, established a campaign infrastructure and raised enthusiasm among local Democrats, Mr. Downs said.
"The energy that was created in May was not that difficult to translate into November," he said.
Geography also played a role. Indiana's western neighbor is Mr. Obama's home state, Illinois, and the Obama campaign was headquartered in Chicago. Volunteers from Illinois flooded across the border, while Indiana Democrats -- who in past presidential contests had left Indiana to help campaign in neighboring battleground states -- stayed to work in their home state.
At the same time, Senator John McCain's campaign chose not to vigorously defend the state. "There was not a really good McCain structure," Mr. Downs said.
The economy was a factor as well. About one in five Indiana jobs are based in manufacturing, one of the highest proportions in the country. As the economy fell apart before the election, manufacturing was one of the first sectors to be hit, and Indiana's jobless rate climbed faster and higher than the nation's. Hoosier voters were particularly keen on voting for change.
More generally, there was latent Democratic support in Indiana. 
"Indiana is a red-leaning, ticket-splitting state," Mr. Howey said, "and Hoosiers are not afraid to vote for the Democrat at the state level if they think that they're the better candidate."
Voters may have been accustomed to pulling the G.O.P. lever in presidential campaigns, but picking a Democrat wasn't a completely alien concept. Indiana had Democratic governors from 1989 through 2004, and this year's Senate race between Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, and Richard Mourdock, a Republican, is a tossup, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast.
In other words, Democratic presidential candidates had underachieved in Indiana until 2008, when Mr. Obama very much overachieved. The Obama campaign doesn't have all those factors working in its favor this year, and the Hoosier state will most likely revert to its default partisan position: a reliably red state in presidential elections.
The Democrats have two main strongholds in Indiana. The first is Indianapolis, which has become much more Democratic-leaning over the last 10 to 15 years, Mr. Howey said, as more affluent, conservative-leaning voters moved to the suburbs.
In 2004, John Kerry carried Marion County, which consists almost entirely of Indianapolis, by about 6,200 votes. In 2008, Mr. Obama overwhelmed Mr. McCain in Marion County by roughly 106,000 votes.
The other Democratic-leaning area is Northwest Indiana, a region of working-class manufacturing towns that also had a sharp rise in the Democratic vote from 2004 to 2008. Gary's Lake County is solidly blue, while the counties stretching from Gary east to St. Joseph County and the University of Notre Dame in South Bend are more marginally Democratic-leaning. Mr. Obama carried Northwest Indiana comfortably in 2008, but outside of Lake County the region is usually less left-leaning. 
The rest of Indiana -- outside of several counties dominated by university towns -- is reliably Republican, particularly in presidential elections. The suburban communities in the "doughnut counties" that surround Indianapolis have become one of two bases of Republican power in the state. The doughnut counties are home to traditional suburban Republicans, fiscally conservative and family-oriented voters who tend to be more focused on issues like education than abortion and same-sex marriage, Mr. Howey said.
That contrasts with more socially conservative Northeast Indiana, the other base of G.O.P. support. The region around Fort Wayne, a mix of suburban, exurban and rural areas, is home to some of the most conservative voters the nation, Mr. Howey said.
 The Bellwether: Vanderburgh County 
Evansville's Vanderburgh County, in southwest Indiana, has been a strong bellwether for the statewide vote in the last two presidential elections. It was one percentage point to the left of the state in 2008 and 2004, after being three percentage points more Democratic in 2000.
Southwest Indiana was historically dominated by "Butternut Democrats," Indiana's version of the socially conservative, working-class white voters in Southern states like Georgia and Alabama who were solid Democrats for generations but have been trending Republican. The realignment toward the G.O.P., just as in the South, happened first at the presidential level and then in state and local races.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Romney is a 100 percent favorite to carry Indiana, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, and Indiana's brief flirtation with Mr. Obama appears to have ended. In fact, one dynamic that may have helped Mr. Obama in 2008 may be hurting him now: Indiana's willingness to oust incumbents.
"Hoosier voters are willing to throw the bums out no matter who they are," Mr. Howey said.
The Indiana House of Representatives has shifted hands several times over the past decades, Mr. Howey said. So have several Congressional seats, and the incumbent governor was defeated in 2004. Just this year, Indiana Republicans ousted Richard G. Lugar, one of the Senate's longest-serving members, in a primary.
Indiana's seeming unwillingness to give incumbents the benefit of the doubt is working against Mr. Obama this year, particularly as Indiana's jobless rate, at 8.3 percent, recently swung above the national average.

HEADLINE: In Goldman Case, Re-examining Foreign Sales

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: A new federal judge is reconsidering whether to reinstate charges against a Goldman Sachs executive that were thrown out because the questionable securities were sold outside the United States, and therefore did not come within the federal securities laws. 

 BODY:
One of the first cases to come out of the financial crisis involved fraud charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Goldman Sachs and one of its mid-level executives, Fabrice Tourre.
The case involved a synthetic collateralized debt obligation tied to subprime mortgages that lost most of its value within months of being sold. Goldman settled the case by paying a $550 million penalty, but Mr. Tourre has continued to fight the charges. He faces a trial date of July 15, 2013.
Now, a new Federal District Court judge in Manhattan, Katherine B. Forrest, has been assigned to preside over the case after it was transferred from the docket of Judge Barbara S. Jones. No reason has been given for the transfer. Judge Jones conducted the trial of Bernard Ebbers, former chief executive of WorldCom, sentencing him to 25 years in prison after his conviction.
Judge Forrest has been on the bench for only one year, receiving her judicial commission on Oct. 17, 2011, but she is no stranger to closely watched cases. Last month, she issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the federal government from enforcing a law authorizing indefinite military detention.
The issues in Mr. Tourre's case are certainly less controversial, but not less difficult in figuring out the reach of the federal securities law. 
Last week, Judge Forrest held a hearing after the S.E.C. asked to revisit a ruling of Judge Jones that had dismissed part of the complaint in light of a subsequent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The charges related to the sale of the C.D.O. by Goldman to a German bank. Judge Jones concluded that the transaction took place outside the United States, and therefore did not come within the federal securities laws. 
In Morrison v. National Australia Bank, the Supreme Court limited the application of the primary securities fraud provision, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to only those transactions conducted on a stock exchange in this country or "domestic transactions in other securities." The lower courts have struggled to figure out exactly what comes under that second category.
In dismissing a portion of the S.E.C.'s complaint, Judge Jones interpreted the Morrison opinion to require showing that a party to a transaction had incurred "irrevocable liability" to purchase or sell the security in the United States if the trade was not conducted on a domestic stock exchange. Although Goldman was the underwriter of the C.D.O., a Cayman Islands-based issuer was the actual seller to the German bank, so Judge Jones concluded there was no connection to this country to allow the S.E.C. to pursue its claim.
The S.E.C. claims that a more recent decision by the appeals court expanded the test for what transactions can come under the federal securities laws. In Absolute Activist Value Master Fund Ltd. v. Ficeto, the appeals court said that the transfer of title to securities in the United States could also be sufficient to bring a case in federal court. The S.E.C. argues that the closing on the Goldman C.D.O. transaction took place in New York and that should be sufficient to allow the claims related to the German bank to proceed.
To make things even more complicated, in reaching its decision the appeals court cited with approval Judge Jones's opinion dismissing claims under the "irrevocable liability" test. Whether there really is a broader test from the Absolute Activist decision is something Judge Forrest will have to figure out.
A brief filed by Mr. Tourre's lawyers disputes whether the dismissed charges can be reinstated, and argues that the parties conducted discovery of foreign witnesses on the assumption that the claims related to the German bank would not be litigated. If Judge Forrest finds in favor of the S.E.C. and reinstates the dismissed claims, then there is a chance that discovery will have to be reopened and the trial could be pushed back.
As per its bylaws, Goldman is paying for Mr. Tourre's lawyers, and the prospect of the case going to trial cannot be a pleasant one for the firm. In addition to the rising legal costs, which could run into the millions of dollars, the case will dredge up issues regarding how the firm put together and sold the C.D.O. right before the financial crisis, which will not cast it in a favorable light. 
The stakes are even higher for the S.E.C., so any advantage it can gain in the case against Mr. Tourre is important. 
An earlier trial on securities fraud charges against a midlevel Citigroup banker for selling a C.D.O tied to subprime mortgages resulted in a finding against the S.E.C. 
The defendant's lawyers offered a "Where's Waldo?" defense, claiming he had only a minor role in a questionable securities offering. Mr. Tourre occupied a similar position at Goldman, and is likely to claim that he was only a bit player in putting together and marketing a C.D.O. that was reviewed by a far more senior executives who have not been named in the case.
If the S.E.C. is unable to hold individuals liable for the sales practices of Wall Street firms, it raises questions about whether it can effectively police the financial markets.
As Judge Forrest wades into a Mr. Tourre's case, her rulings are sure to come under the microscope to see how she handles a high-stakes securities fraud case.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Prices Fall as Economic Concerns Persist

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Brent crude prices fell on Friday for the fourth straight session, dragged down by fresh global economic concerns and expectations that a major Canadian crude oil pipeline to the United States would restart on schedule. Concerns about the lack of progress on a Spanish bailout dampened risk appetite, helping send equities and commodity markets lower and lending support to the dollar. Oil prices initially turned negative in early trade following news that the TransCanada Corporation expected to restart the 590,000-barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline to the United States market over the weekend.

HEADLINE: Focus on the Personal Economy

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah, and is the director of investor education at BAM Advisor Services. His book, "The Behavior Gap," was published this year. His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog. 
As many of the social structures we have relied on in the past for retirement seem to disappear or appear vulnerable (company pensions and Social Security to name two), we're becoming increasingly more responsible for our own financial futures. But at the same time we're overwhelmed with information about how to handle our money.
Never before have we had so much information at our fingertips about how to handle money, and never before have so many of us felt out of control. Sorting though this noise is more important than ever before, not only for our financial futures but for our mental health.
Think I'm overstating the problem?
In 2011, IDC Digital Universe published a study, "Extracting Value from Chaos." It found we have 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 billion terabytes) of data floating around. What does that look like?
Every person in the United States tweeting 3 tweets per minute for 26,976 years nonstop
Every person in the world having over 215 million high-resolution MRI scans per day
Over 200 billion high definition movies (each 2 hours in length), which would take one person 47 million years to watch if that person watched for 24 hours a day
The amount of information needed to fill 57.5 billion 32 gigabyte Apple iPads.
In 2012, that number is expected to grow to 2.7 zettabytes.
Obviously, it's easy to get distracted. And based on the questions I get, people are really distracted when it comes to money.
Should I buy this stock?
What do you think the market will do?
Will Europe go down in flames?
Will the economy ever recover?
But what if instead of asking those questions, we asked just these questions:
How much can I save?
How is my portfolio allocated?
Can I pick up some extra work this month?
Can I start a little business on the side?
By asking these questions we switch our focus to things we have at least some control over. We start to focus on our personal economy, instead of the global economy. Our personal economy becomes the filter for all the noise. Things like Europe, the market, and individual stocks drop off our radar. Instead, we focus on information that helps us with the one thing we can control: ourselves.
Obviously with so much noise, it can be incredibly hard to get this focused. But the sooner you figure out the value of this filter, the faster you'll be able to make sense of the noise.
So besides burying your head in the sand, what have you done to filter the noise?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Working Longer in the Developed World

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THROUGHOUT much of the developed world, people are working more years than they used to. Many are retiring later, presumably because they need the money.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this week released its latest figures on the proportion of people in older age groups working, showing that some European countries, whose social welfare systems had made possible early retirements, have begun to keep more people on the job.
In 2003, less than a third of German men age 60 to 64, and less than a sixth of German woman of the same age, were working. In the numbers for 2011 released this week, more than half of the men and a third of the women had jobs. 
But as can be seen in the accompanying charts, it is still relatively rare for Germans over 65 to continue working.
Italy is one country that seems to have avoided change. In 2001, about 30 percent of men in their early 60s had jobs, as did 11 percent of women. A decade later, the figures were virtually identical.
Older workers in the United States have long been more likely to have jobs than their European counterparts. But since 2008, the proportion of American men in their early 60s who are working has fallen by three percentage points, to 54.7 percent, as a weak economy limited hiring. But the proportion of men with jobs in the 65 to 69 age bracket has continued to rise as men who could do so delayed retirement.
The proportion of men in their early 60s with jobs also fell in Iceland, Portugal and Turkey. In Greece, the proportion of men in their early 60s with jobs fell to 37.5 percent in 2011 from 44 percent in 2008.
In many countries, said Anne Sonnet, a senior economist at the O.E.C.D. and team leader of its older workers review, ''the main problem for older workers is to be hired'' for new jobs, not to keep jobs they already have. ''There is almost no job mobility for older workers.''
The figures were released for the 34 countries in the O.E.C.D., which includes all the major developed countries and some countries that have developed since the organization was established half a century ago. But the group still does not include such rapidly growing countries as Brazil, India and China.
Ms. Sonnet said the recession that enveloped the world in 2008, and that seems to have returned in some European countries, was different from earlier downturns in the 1970s and 1980s in that countries did not encourage early retirements of older workers to make jobs available to younger people.
She sees longer working years as a good thing in a world where life expectancies have risen. ''For the society, it is very important to work longer to avoid higher social costs from having to pay retirees for many, many years,'' she said in a telephone interview.
There remains a large diversity in employment patterns, a diversity that is growing in Europe. While Germans are more likely to keep working into their 60s, their French neighbors still generally quit before they reach their 60th birthdays. In 2011, just one in five Frenchmen age 60 to 64 still held jobs, as did one in six women.
Of the 34 O.E.C.D. countries, only Hungary, with 17.9 percent of men in their early 60s holding jobs, had lower employment among men in that age range. At the other extreme, more than 70 percent of men 60 to 64 were working in Iceland, New Zealand, Chile and Japan.
In five countries -- Slovakia, Belgium, Spain, France and Hungary -- fewer than 10 percent of men in their late 60s had jobs, In four others -- Mexico, Iceland, Chile and South Korea -- more than half of those men were employed.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: In Most Countries, People Work Longer: The length of work lives has risen in most developed countries over the last decade, as some countries pushed up minimum retirement ages. But in some countries, including the United States, the proportion of people in their early 60s with jobs has declined, reflecting the poor economy since the financial crisis. (Source: O.E.C.D.)

HEADLINE: Home Resales Retreat From a 2-Year High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Home resales retreated in September from a two-year high, a reminder that America's housing sector is a long way from a full recovery despite recent signs of improvement. 
Existing home sales fell 1.7 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.75 million units, matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll, data from the National Association of Realtors showed on Friday.
Housing has been a relative bright spot in the nation's economy this year, and Friday's data did not point to a reversal in that trend. The reading for August was revised slightly higher to show resales at a rate of 4.83 million units.
The median price for a home resale rose 11.3 percent from a year earlier, to $183,900. The rise in prices appears to be a result of tight inventories and a downward trend in sales made under distressed conditions like foreclosures.
To support the economy, the Federal Reserve began a program last month to buy housing-related debt, an action that has driven mortgage rates to record lows. Fed policy makers meet next week, but are unlikely to take new steps.
The economy has shown signs of faster growth recently, with the jobless rate falling and retail sales picking up. Threats to that momentum remain, however. The United States government is on track to tighten fiscal policy in January, while Europe's debt crisis also looms heavily.
Tight inventories have helped support home prices in recent months.
The nation's stock of existing homes for sale fell 3.3 percent last month, to 2.32 million units. At the current rate of sales, inventories would be exhausted in 5.9 months, the lowest rate since March 2006, the Realtor's association said.
This week, Goldman Sachs estimated growth in the housing sector would most likely add about a quarter of a percentage point to economic growth this year and half a point in 2013.
Much of the economic lift comes from the building of new homes, although existing-home sales also help growth as people go out to buy furniture and real estate agents reap more in commissions.

HEADLINE: Free Speech Is One Thing, Vagrants, Another

BYLINE: By MALIA WOLLAN

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif. -- Hardly a stranger to political movements, this is a city that has championed free speech, no nukes, the antiwar movement and now: no sitting on the sidewalk.
During years of economic downturn, cities across the country have reported rising vagrancy and rushed to pass laws banning aggressive panhandling, giving food away in public parks and even smelling foul.
This bastion of populist politics is no exception. The City Council and mayor have put a measure on the November ballot that would ban sitting and lying on commercial sidewalks from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., at the risk of a $75 citation. 
''These laws are an example of a startling national trend to criminalize homelessness,'' said Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, an advocacy group.
In a 2011 survey of 234 cities, the group found that 40 percent prohibited camping, 33 percent banned sitting and lying down in public places and 53 percent outlawed begging. Recent examples of laws intended to shoo off, keep out, or otherwise restrict the homeless are everywhere. In July, Newport Beach, Calif., a seaside city south of Los Angeles, instituted rules banning public library patrons who smell, park their shopping carts near entrances or sleep in the library. In April, Denver passed a law forbidding ''urban camping.'' In March, Philadelphia prohibited charities from distributing free food in public parks, a rule that was recently suspended after church groups sued the city.
Other municipalities have removed park benches, closed public restrooms and banned sleeping in cars.
''Making it a crime just to sit here?'' griped Chris Escobar, 23, who left Miami five weeks ago after losing a job as a delivery driver for a sandwich shop.
''This is not the Berkeley I've heard about my whole life,'' said Mr. Escobar, who hitched a ride west with only a backpack, a yellow dog named Marley and a tiger-striped kitten on a leash. ''This is not the Berkeley I came for.''
That might come as welcome news to proponents of the city's Measure S and some business owners along Telegraph Avenue, where Mr. Escobar and his ilk spend most days hunkered down on the sidewalk with their belongings, pets and cardboard signs.
''Some people don't come to Telegraph or downtown to shop or eat because they are intimidated,'' said John Caner, chief executive of the Downtown Berkeley Association, a group representing commercial property owners.
Some small-business owners say they hope the measure will curb what they describe as roving bands of nomadic youths, many of whom openly use and deal drugs, keep pit bulls, panhandle and scare off potential customers.
Several small businesses, including a coffee shop and a gelato store here, fault the homeless crowd for a recent 30 percent drop in business.
But opponents of Measure S say such blame is misguided. ''When economic times are hard there is a tendency to scapegoat,'' said Bob Offer-Westort, an organizer of the groups opposing the measure, which include dozens of clergy members and the student government at the University of California, Berkeley.
On any given night in the United States, there are an estimated 650,000 people like Mr. Escobar without an indoor place to sleep. At last count, Berkeley had some 680 homeless people, far exceeding the 135 beds available year-round in local emergency shelters. Many cities are similarly stretched, unable to provide services to the growing number of people seeking help. Last year, 86 percent of the cities surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported an increase in requests for emergency food assistance. City officials here say they already spend $2.8 million annually on services for the needy.
But the Obama administration has cautioned cities against trying to cope with homeless populations by passing laws against ''act of living'' crimes like sleeping or sitting.
In March, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, a group of 19 federal agencies including the Departments of Justice, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development, issued a report warning that such measures can be costly, ineffective and lead to lawsuits. ''Criminalization policies further marginalize men and women who are experiencing homelessness, fuel inflammatory attitudes, and may even unduly restrict constitutionally protected liberties,'' the report read.
In recent years, advocates for the homeless have filed suit, and in some cases received multimillion-dollar settlements, after cities cleaned up indigent encampments, in some cases destroying the property of the homeless. The courts found such actions violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Ordinances prohibiting begging have been found to violate the First Amendment right to free speech. Other lawsuits have been filed on behalf of the homeless for violations of the Cconstitution's equal protection clause.
''What cities are doing is criminalizing behavior, not homelessness,'' said James Brooks, a program director at the National League of Cities. ''Cities are acting under state law to create safe environments.''
Proponents of Berkeley's measure say it is modeled on best practices culled from the experiences of cities like Seattle; San Francisco; Santa Monica, Calif.; and Santa Cruz, Calif.
''Out here you can't sleep, you can't find a place to go to the bathroom, cops are always telling you to move,'' said Josh Keys, 35, who has lived on the street in most of those cities. For now, he is on Telegraph Avenue.
Last year, Mr. Keys was ticketed for sitting on the street in Santa Cruz but he says he has no intention of paying the fine. He has been homeless since he was a teenager. If a city gets too cold or restrictive, he moves on. ''When you're homeless, you feel like a hunted animal,'' he said.

HEADLINE: How to Catch Fish and Save Fisheries

BYLINE: By CARL SAFINA and BRETT JENKS

 BODY:
TOP environmental ministers from scores of countries all over the world are meeting this week in Hyderabad, India. Their goal: to reach agreement on how to protect 10 percent of the world's ocean.
Actually, they had set that goal two years ago under the Convention on Biological Diversity. You might be thinking, here we go again -- easy to agree on goals; hard to agree on how to meet them.
But it matters. The U.S. Commerce Department just declared major fisheries in New England, Alaska and Mississippi a ''disaster.'' Another new study found that Australia's Great Barrier Reef has lost half its coral since 1985. British and French fishermen have clashed as boats from Britain sailed into French waters on the hunt for scallops. But that bell tolls not just for the fishermen -- it tolls for us as well. Fish are the primary source of protein for an estimated one billion people around the world. 
The journal Science recently published the first comprehensive analysis of more than 10,000 fisheries -- roughly 80 percent of our global fish catch. The conclusion: fish populations worldwide are swiftly declining. This global analysis paints a stark new picture of a global ocean fished to exhaustion in an increasingly hungry world.
So, why are we hopeful? It's because the analysis of global fisheries has a silver lining. We have not reached a point of no return. We have time. Solutions exist.
The good news is that many large commercial fisheries are already benefiting from the improved management of the last decade. The harder problem is with smaller-scale fisheries that local communities rely on for food and income. The fact is that small-scale fishers -- who fish within 10 miles of their coast -- account for nearly half of the world's global catch and employ 33 million of the world's 36 million fishermen, while also creating jobs for 107 million people in fish processing and selling [pdf]. Mostly poor, they live mainly in areas lacking fisheries management, monitoring and enforcement. No one is in a position to formally declare their fisheries ''disasters.'' They must just endure their situation. Or -- take control of it.
A rising tide of local communities is doing just that. Here's the emerging recipe proposed in that same Science study: Give local fishers exclusive access to their fishing grounds in the form of territorial use rights, or TURF.
In exchange for the privilege of exclusivity, local fishermen agree to establish and protect no-take zones. Results include increased fish populations, richer marine habitats, and coastlines less vulnerable to climate change -- and more food for people.
Unleashing the self-interest of local fishermen to advance both conservation and economic development can create one of those rare win-win scenarios.
A growing body of research shows that fish populations inside a no-take zone can more than quadruple. Fish numbers outside the reserve can double. And, exclusive access enables investment and better management, increasing the catch's value.
It works. We've visited several local fisheries in Mexico and the Philippines this year -- with heads of leading research institutions, NGOs and government agencies -- and in each case, we witnessed increasing fish populations, increased catch value and better-protected reefs.
TURF reserves are not a silver bullet. They might, however, be the silver buckshot. With nearly one billion people reliant on the ocean for their primary source of protein, stakes are high. If the most fish-dependent nations adopted widespread networks of TURF Reserve, they can potentially create enough fish recovery to feed hundreds of millions of people.
That's a big if, however. The solution is not to fix a small number of fisheries. We need thousands of TURF reserves in dozens of countries just to get the ball rolling. Ultimately, we need a commitment of governments, foundations, NGOs and the private sector to forge a major investment in near shore fisheries in the developing tropics. The coastal communities themselves must unfurl the ocean's silver lining.
Protecting 10 percent of the world's oceans is no small task. TURF reserves offer one solution to start us down that path. But they are neither complicated nor expensive. Clearly this problem -- and the opportunity -- is bigger than all of us. And there are a billion reasons for us to act like it.
Carl Safina is founding president of the Blue Ocean Institute at Stony Brook University, where he is an adjunct professor in marine sciences. Brett Jenks is the president and chief executive of Rare, a global conservation organization based in Arlington, Virginia.

HEADLINE: FIAC Art Fair Opens in Paris

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

 BODY:
PARIS -- Comparisons may be odious, but they kept cropping up as FIAC -- the French acronym for the International Contemporary Art Fair -- opened its doors Wednesday for a V.I.P. preview under the glass dome of the Grand Palais here, hard on the heels of London's Frieze show last week.
The quick spin of the global contemporary art carousel has put the Paris-London rivalry in ever sharper focus, particularly since 2006 when FIAC moved into the vast light-soaked arena of the 112-year-old Grand Palais, bolstering its appeal. 
''Much better than Frieze,'' said Anke Kempkes, director of New York's Broadway 1602 gallery, who volunteered the comparison without being asked. ''London was too full, too hectic, too much going on. Collectors want quality, they want concentration.''
Despite a sluggish economy and the threat of new French taxes on works of art, the early turnout for FIAC -- which runs through Sunday -- was strong. By Wednesday evening, a throng of well-dressed special guests was pressing its way in and around 180 stands, from 24 countries, spilling into a newly renovated space on the Grand Palais's upper floor, known as the Salon d'Honneur.
''I overheard someone say, 'Everyone is here,''' said Jennifer Flay, FIAC's director. ''Everyone.''
The suggestion, of course, is that some big-name collectors -- from Europe and beyond -- had already been through. By late Wednesday, several gallery owners were reporting positive results.
The Tornabuoni Arte gallery reported four early sales -- including works by Lucio Fontana and Dadamaino, one for &#x20ac;250,000, or $326,000. An unnamed museum had already expressed interest in a large map of the world, made of stitched pieces of cloth, by Alighiero Boetti, the Italian artist honored this year by a retrospective show this year at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
The Continua gallery of Italy reported that a 2006 work by the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei -- a large ceramic bowl filled with pearls -- had sold for &#x20ac;300,000, and a work of sculpted figures by the Cameroon-born artist Pascale Marthine Tayou had gone for &#x20ac;85,000. A mesmerizing sculpture by Anish Kapoor in translucent red alabaster, priced at 750,000, or $1.2 million, was still unsold.
At the other end of the scale, more modestly priced works were also going fast: cut-outs artfully made from book covers by Georgia Russell, a Paris-based Scottish artist, displayed at the Karsten Greve gallery, of which three were already sold by Wednesday, at prices between &#x20ac;16,000 and &#x20ac;18,000.
As in other years, FIAC has spawned a host of outdoor works across the city. This year, a giant inflatable Stonehenge, a work entitled ''Sacrilege,'' by the British artist Jeremy Deller, has proved to be an attraction for all ages on the Esplanade in front of Les Invalides.
Sculptures, conceptual installations and performances will be held at several outdoor Paris locations, including at the Jardin des Plantes, and at the Tuileries Gardens, where a 14-seat cinema inside a shipping container, known as a Cinphmre, will show a dozen films by artists daily during FIAC.
A number of galleries at the Grand Palais took the opportunity to exhibit high-priced works by Pablo Picasso (seven in all), Joan Mir (five), Alexander Calder (10), Kurt Schwitters (five) and other modern masters.
At the stand of the Paris-based Galerie Denise Ren, a painting by Josef Albers, with overlaid squares in tan, gray and turquoise, was quickly reserved for &#x20ac;600,000, according to the gallery director, Franck Marlot.
''We have more important works this year,'' Mr. Marlot said, ''perhaps fewer, but more important.''
FIAC has long mixed its contemporary offerings with works of early modern art, an historical approach, which until now, had distinguished it from the Frieze fair in London. This year, however, Frieze added its own look at the past, with Frieze Masters, a separate show at a different location, which exhibited works made before 2000.
In years past, FIAC too had juggled with two locations, the Grand Palais and the Cour Carre at the Louvre. Since last year, the fair has regrouped. ''The galleries want to be together,'' Ms. Flay said.
Gary Waterston, a London-based director of the Gagosian gallery, which this year brought a 1946 Picasso, a Frank Stella and a painting by Andy Warhol made from sprayed urine to FIAC, said the Grand Palais is a key attraction.
''All galleries enjoy this experience,'' he said, waving his hand toward the 45-meter, or 150-foot, ceiling. ''You have a real sense of location. You know you're in Paris.''
The addition of the Salon d'Honneur, opened this season for the first time since 1937, has been used to focus on a subset of galleries from different countries that have been in existence for 15 to 20 years.
''They are the tastemakers, the people known for discovering artists,'' Ms. Flay said. Among the exhibits in the Salon are a pair of fast-spinning carwash brushes, a work by Lara Favaretto at the Franco Noero gallery's stand, and an installation of a bathroom, complete with a half-empty wine glass, a bubble bath, spilled face powder and other detritus from a night out, by Mac Adams at the GB Agency of Paris.
On the upper floor, in galleries linked to a grand staircase by a newly accessible walkway, a younger generation of artists from all over the world -- including this year, from Dubai, Turkey, Hungary and Romania -- were showing less established, sometimes riskier works.
It was the Reena Spauldings Fine Art gallery's first time at FIAC, with a special showing of abstract art by the Cologne-based artist Michaela Eichwald, who had hand-carried her large canvases to Paris from Germany.
''I thought everyone was playing it very safe in London,'' said John Kelsey, a director from Reena Spauldings, which is based in New York's Chinatown. ''We wouldn't have done this show there. It's too risky, there's no consensus on the work. In London, you have to calculate everything.''
''Here in Paris, we don't worry,'' he added. ''We just brought an artist that we love.''

HEADLINE: New York State Registers Drop In Jobless Rate

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
New York State's jobless rate fell for the first time in 11 months in September, a welcome sign for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, though the rate remains well above the national average. 
Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that New York was the only state in the nation with a statistically significant increase in its unemployment rate over the last 12 months, through August, according to the federal household survey. The Cuomo administration has pointed to more positive statistics, notably the federal payroll survey - those numbers have offered a more favorable picture of New York's job growth.
Last month, however, there was improvement in the household survey. New York was one of 41 states to report a decline in unemployment, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which released state numbers for September on Friday. New York's jobless rate is now 8.9 percent, compared with 7.8 percent nationwide. The state's rate fell from 9.1 percent in August.
One state that did not fare nearly as well was Ohio, a key swing state in the presidential election. The state had one of the largest decreases in employment in the nation, losing 12,800 jobs from August to September. New York, by contrast, added more than 10,000 jobs in the same period, according to the payroll survey, which does not measure agriculture or the self-employed.
"The jobs data is still obviously uneven," said Edmund J. McMahon, senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative research group. "The story is still one of fairly pronounced unevenness regionally. Downstate, the city is still much stronger than the suburbs, and upstate you have these islands of growth - Rochester and the capital region - and then rest is not great."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall As Earnings Disappoint On Wall St.

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The growing list of downbeat financial announcements from American companies generated on Friday the worst stock sell-off in nearly four months.
General Electric and McDonald's disappointed analysts and sounded cautionary notes about future global economic growth. That came on the heels of weak reports on Thursday from the technology giants Google and Microsoft.
With the shadow of the 25th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash hanging over the market, share prices began dropping Friday morning and fell all day, leaving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 1.66 percent, or 24.15 points, to 1,433.19. It was the worst single day for the index since June 21, when investors were worried about the European debt crisis. 
Corporate earnings have served as perhaps the strongest engines of economic growth since the financial crisis, and have helped fuel a broader market rally. The benchmark S.& P. index is still up 14 percent for the year.
While analysts have expected profits to grow at a slower rate, they are now concerned about slowing revenue, which can be a purer indicator of economic health. Among the quarter of the S.& P. companies that have reported earnings so far, revenue rose just 0.8 percent, below the 1.5 percent that had been anticipated.
''This is an indication of what consumers are doing globally, and investors clearly don't like it,'' said Kim Caughey Forrest, a portfolio manager at the Fort Pitt Capital Group. ''The consumer has decided not to spend that marginal dollar.''
Despite those concerns, Friday's sell-off lacked the panic that has been a part of so many other big down market days over the last few years. This time around, shares moved down in an orderly fashion, and after it was over, some traders and investors said that while they were prepared for company profits to grow at a slower pace, they were not worried that earnings would disappear.
''It's really a paring back of recent optimism, as opposed to a pessimism that will last for weeks,'' said Ryan Larson, the head stock trader at RBC Global Asset Management. ''This is a normal healthy thing for the markets to go through.''
One major threat is increasingly hanging over conversations across Wall Street: the fiscal cliff that the economy could go over if Congress and the White House do not find a way to avert looming tax increases and spending cuts by the end of the year. While the deadline has been expected all year, most investors have pushed it aside and assumed that politicians will reach a compromise.
''Now it's becomes a more immediate issue, and everybody realizes it is going to be hanging over the market but not resolved,'' said Ed Clissold, the chief global strategist at Ned Davis Research.
Mr. Clissold said he expected investors to think more about the fiscal cliff as the election approached, particularly if neither of the candidates talked about how they planned to deal with the problem.
The recent choppy market has come at the same time that several reports indicate that the economic recovery may be gaining firmer footing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday that the unemployment rate fell in 41 states -- the latest indication that the job picture may be improving. While data on existing-home sales on Friday came in lower than expected, most signs point to the housing market emerging from its long slide.
The bigger economic worries have generally come from abroad. Spain's prime minister gave the market pause on Friday when he said that he had not yet decided whether to request a full bailout from the European authorities. But Spain is expected to take assistance if its situation grows worse.
The chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Jim O'Neill, said Friday that his models showed the global economy gaining momentum for the first time since late last year.
But for the immediate future, the focus continued to be on corporate profits and revenue.
At General Electric, analysts who expected revenue to rise $1.6 billion from the quarter a year ago were disappointed when they rose only $1 billion. Shares of the company dropped 3.4 percent on Friday, but they are up nearly 23 percent for the year.
The biggest disappointment this earning season has come from the technology stocks that have led the markets up for most of the year. Apple was heralded earlier this year when its stock market capitalization rose above $600 billion. But since hitting a high in mid-September, its share price has fallen 13 percent, bringing its market capitalization down to the more pedestrian $571 billion.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was hit by the steepest drop among the indexes on Friday, declining 2.19 percent, or 67.24 points, to 3,005.62. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 205.43 points, or 1.52 percent, to 13,343.51.
Many executives have been warning that future revenue and profits may end up growing more slowly than they had expected as a result of a recession in Europe, and the slowdown in China and elsewhere in the developing world.
So far, 17 companies have given what is known as negative guidance for future profit growth, and none have given positive guidance, a Thomson Reuters analyst, Greg Harrison, said.
The chief executive at McDonald's, Donald Thompson, said Friday morning that so far fourth-quarter sales were ''currently trending negative.''
Taking a step back, corporate profits are still expected to grow this year, though just in the single digits, rather than the double digits that have become common over the last three years. What's more, most analysts expect that profit growth will go back up to the double digits in 2013.
''We had a great year so far, and perhaps it did get ahead of itself,'' said Ms. Caughey Forrest of Fort Pitt. ''This was a rational pullback based on rational information.''

HEADLINE: McDonald's Profit Falls as Sales Growth Slows

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
McDonald's posted its worst quarterly restaurant sales growth in nine years on Friday, lifting the curtain on the fast-food industry's fight for customers in a weak economy. 
The world's biggest fast-food chain is battling more than the bleak global economy that is curbing appetites for its hamburgers, salads and smoothies. Resurgent chains like Burger King Worldwide and Yum Brands' Taco Bell are challenging McDonald's in the United States with revamped menus, celebrity endorsers and a renewed focus on low-priced food.
McDonald's domestic market falls just behind Europe as the company's top region for sales.
''You have a scenario where the overall pie is shrinking, and companies are competing aggressively to take their piece of it,'' Sara Senatore, a Bernstein Research analyst, said.
Third-quarter net income at McDonald's fell 3.5 percent to $1.46 billion, or $1.43 a share, from $1.51 billion, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. It missed analysts' average estimate by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Total sales slipped 0.2 percent to $7.15 billion.
When asked to explain why the third quarter's results lagged even those put up during the height of the financial crisis, McDonald's chief executive, Don Thompson, attributed the results to the tougher battle for customers and economic challenges in each of the company's major regions.
That confluence of factors forced McDonald's to miss Wall Street's earnings estimates for the second quarter in a row. It also warned that sales at established restaurants, a closely watched gauge of restaurant performance, were down so far this month.
''When the economic crisis began in 2008, few people thought the environment would still be as uncertain and fragile as it is today,'' Mr. Thompson said.
He added that the company's market share was flat or up in all major markets.
McDonald's stock fell 4.5 percent to close at $88.72,
The impact of a stronger dollar, which decreases the value of sales overseas for American companies, trimmed earnings by 8 cents a share.
McDonald's global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 1.9 percent, the first gain of less than 2 percent since the second quarter of 2003.
That result just missed the 2 percent increase that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected because of shortfalls in the United States and the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.

HEADLINE: Recycling Helps, but It's Not All You Can Do for the Environment

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
LIKE most households, we recycle pretty religiously. It's easy, though, because our town in suburban New York allows us to throw pretty much everything into one bin, and it gets picked up at the curb.
Recycling has become so automatic that if we're out and there's no place to recycle that soda can or bottle, it feels slightly illicit to just drop it in the trash. It's like littering. You just don't do it.
Lately, however, I started wondering -- are we really doing anything with all this recycling besides feeling better about the stuff we buy?
Much of the discussion has focused on the economic impact. That issue has been batted back and forth with mixed results, although most experts now agree that cities have become more experienced and more effective -- and therefore made it more cost-efficient -- to recycle most products rather than dump them in landfills. 
I'm more curious about what impact it has on other environmental behavior. And when I started looking at that more closely, I discovered that there's an intense debate going on about this issue.
Recycling ''is good civic behavior,'' said Samantha MacBride, an assistant professor of public affairs at Baruch College, City University of New York, but it's oversold as a panacea to a whole host of environmental ills, from overflowing landfills to global warming. ''I wouldn't say that people who do recycling feel they've done everything they can by participating, but they think there's a lot more being achieved than there actually is,'' she said. Nationally, said Professor MacBride, who is the author of ''Recycling Reconsidered'' (MIT Press, 2011), recycling prevents only about one-third of all trash from ending up in landfills.
Partly, she said, that is because people are not recycling everything they can. Partly it's because the recycling model in most municipalities of picking up a bin with all the recyclables mixed together, especially the plastics, doesn't work well.
''There's a huge range of plastic materials and hundreds of different resins,'' Professor MacBride said. ''We need markets and processes to route them back into production and for the most part, those processes don't exist.''
So some plastics are sent in bales to China and developing countries, and some are disposed of in landfills.
The emphasis, she said, has to be much more on regulating and recycling waste from manufacturers rather than consumer waste.
The other problem is that while ''recycling is a wonderful thing to do if we're comparing it to throwing stuff away, it has become a reward for consumption,'' said Michael Maniates, a professor of environmental science at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania.
Gernot Wagner, an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund and author of ''But Will the Planet Notice: How Smart Economics Can Save the World,'' (Hill and Wang, 2011), agrees. ''There's a well-documented phenomenon known as single-action bias, where people do one thing and move on,'' he said. ''People don't explicitly think, 'I've recycled a cup and solved global warming,' but rather once they've done an action like recycling, they feel consciously or subconsciously like they've done their part.''
Or as the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions, which is affiliated with the Earth Institute at Columbia University, says on its Web site: ''Although recycling is important, it should be but one activity in a series of behavior changes aimed at reducing climate change. Switching to wind or other renewable energies, consuming less meat, conserving daily energy use and eating locally grown food are other effective ways to mitigate climate change, to name but a few. However, if individuals and institutions participate in recycling programs, they may be prone to the single-action bias and feel like they are already doing enough to protect the environment.''
Hold on there, said Allen Hershkowitz, senior scientist and director of the solid waste project at the environmental organization the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''I've never dealt with a person or company who said, 'We recycle so we don't have to do anything else.' It's, 'We recycle, what else can we do?' ''
In his role as an adviser to the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, among others, he said he found that recycling was ''an entry activity that leads to other activities such as buying recycled, energy effectiveness and fan education.''
Juliet Schor, a professor of sociology at Boston College, said that a number of European studies had demonstrated that people who bought green products or did some sort of similar ''conscious consumerism'' didn't stop there, but continued on with other types of environmental activism.
A study conducted by Professor Schor and a graduate student, Margaret Willis, and published recently in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, called ''Does Changing Light Bulbs Lead to Changing the World? Political Action and the Conscious Consumer'' looked at the concern that ''individual action substitutes or 'crowds out' civic and collective action.''
Part of the study included 2,271 survey responses from people identified as being ''conscious consumers'' through an ecologically oriented nonprofit organization the Center for a New American dream. These respondents, largely white, female and highly educated, were asked questions like how often (ranging from ''never'' to ''very consistently'') they engaged in such activities as choosing to drive less, contacting government representatives to express an opinion and buying local or green goods.
While the study didn't look at recycling in particular, it found that those who chose to do individual green actions were also more involved in other broader political activism.
But Professor Schor said she was troubled that recycling ''is what they're teaching kids in school is going to save the world.''
And that was the point Professor MacBride wanted to emphasize.
''We don't want to hear the bad side of recycling,'' Professor MacBride said. ''That's a child's view of the world. It's time to grow up.''
So what can we do? Remember that there's two other Rs -- reduce and reuse -- that are far too often ignored.
''As it has turned out 'reuse' is something that our kids learn in school as part of the 'three Rs,''' Professor Maniates said. ''But it has no resonance or meaning in mainstream or popular environmental politics and living. I brought my hangers to the dry cleaner and said, 'Maybe you can reuse these' and they said, 'Sure, we'll recycle them.' ''
David N. Pellow, a professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, offered a similar perspective. ''I would urge people to buy fewer things, buy higher quality, fix things when they're broken. I would encourage people to recycle as a last stage after they've done all these other things.''
And remember not to buy into single-action bias. As Mr. Hershkowitz said: ''We are dealing with a gigantic problem and there is no one large undertaking that any individual or business or country can do to solve our ecological problems. It will take billions of people making highly intelligent ecological choices.''

HEADLINE: A Tell-All On Goldman Has Little Worth Telling

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
When Greg Smith resigned in March as an executive director and vice president of Goldman Sachs with an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times, he leveled some sweeping charges: Goldman's culture was ''toxic and destructive''; the firm promoted ''morally bankrupt people''; and -- most devastating to any professional organization -- Goldman Sachs bankers were ''ripping their clients off.''
Mr. Smith's letter clearly hit a popular nerve, coming as it did during a devastating financial crisis in which Goldman emerged as the rich, arrogant and unfeeling perpetrator of much of the financial wreckage still afflicting Americans. And it's hard to quarrel with Mr. Smith's overriding message: Wall Street should put clients interests' first or risk oblivion. Indeed, that was Goldman Sachs's own credo, ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' 
But stripped of its incendiary conclusions, Mr. Smith's manifesto was curiously short on facts. Other than the now-infamous reference to muppets -- ''I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as 'muppets,' sometimes over internal e-mail'' -- there were no examples of a toxic culture at work, no actual names of morally bankrupt people and no examples of a client getting ripped off. Mr. Smith declined to elaborate after the article was published, heightening suspense and no doubt fueling the literary bidding that reached a reported $1.5 million for a book that would deliver the goods.
That book, ''Why I Left Goldman Sachs,'' goes on sale on Monday. Despite tight security, copies of the book have been circulating, and I read one. The book not only fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions, but he admits changing ''names or descriptors'' for some (but not all) people and acknowledges that what he does disclose is ''from memory.''
He says he has tried ''to retain the spirit'' of what actually occurred. This makes it nearly impossible to verify much of what he says.
Beyond that, from his perch on the equity trading desk he seems to have had a narrow view of the institution where he worked for nearly 12 years. His disillusionment comes across as heartfelt, but much of it seems to have come less from his own experiences than from news reports about the firm's behavior in deals he wasn't involved in.
Mr. Smith's book might even bolster Goldman's reputation. After all, if Mr. Smith is the ultimate insider, and this is as bad as it gets -- Mr. Smith in a hot tub at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas with a topless woman -- then he hasn't made much of a case.
But Mr. Smith isn't in much of a position to exonerate Goldman, either. The firm was deeply enmeshed in nearly all aspects of the financial crisis and its causes, including mortgage-backed securities. And after an injection of taxpayer support, it managed to profit handsomely and pay the lavish bonuses that Mr. Smith shared in. But you won't find that story in ''Why I Left.''
Mr. Smith declined to discuss any of this before his scheduled appearance on Sunday on ''60 Minutes.'' Goldman Sachs responded to some of my questions with copies of parts of their internal investigation and made several employees available.
Potential problems with Mr. Smith's approach surface almost immediately. The first paragraph of Chapter 1 describes ''an intern named Josh'' who's being ''grilled'' and asked to explain risk arbitrage but ''was floundering badly.'' Josh, Mr. Smith adds, is the son of a billionaire.
There was no ''Josh'' in Mr. Smith's group of interns, and only one son of a billionaire: Teddy Schwarzman, son of Stephen Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive of the asset management firm Blackstone Group.
''I was never grilled on risk arbitrage, or asked to give a presentation on it,'' Mr. Schwarzman said when I contacted him this week. ''I realize it was a long time ago, but I would certainly have remembered it if I had floundered.'' Nor did anyone else in the class I spoke to recall such an episode.
Mr. Smith also recounts what purports to be a verbatim exchange between a Goldman vice president and a fellow intern named Brynn Thomas who graduated from Brown University. Brynn is interrogated and humiliated by her lack of knowledge about Microsoft, and ''starts to tear up and runs out of the room.'' Goldman said it has no record of anyone named Brynn Thomas, and other members of Mr. Smith's intern class said no one by that name was in his class. Nor did they recall any such incident. ''The program wasn't that cutthroat, and it certainly wasn't abusive,'' said Mr. Schwarzman, now a movie producer. ''No one ever ran out of a room crying. They were trying to recruit us and also to shape us. They had high expectations, but I learned a tremendous amount.''
(The actual person apparently described in the anecdote, a Brown graduate named Ebony Thomas who was an intern with Mr. Smith, didn't respond to requests for comment.)
On the larger issue of whether Goldman was ''ripping off'' clients, his principal evidence is that while he was working in London in the two years before his resignation, Goldman was urging clients to buy or sell options on European banks while countries like Greece and Portugal were in the midst of debt crises. In Mr. Smith's telling, Goldman was trying to get clients to take positions that Goldman was trying to get rid of, which Mr. Smith describes as ''axes.'' ''The firm believes, deep down, that one outcome is going to transpire, yet it advises the client to do the opposite, so the firm can then take the other side of the trade and implement its own proprietary bet.''
But Goldman officials told me the firm never acted as a principal on any of those trades, and Mr. Smith doesn't provide any specific examples where it did. Moreover, they noted, Mr. Smith sold United States equities and derivatives while he was in London, not European ones, so he would have had no direct knowledge of European options trading.
Mr. Smith also faults Goldman for constantly changing its views on the outlook for European banks, requiring clients to keep trading and presumably generating more commissions for the firm. ''No thinking client could believe that conditions on the ground could change that frequently. It was so obviously misleading and disingenuous,'' he writes. But Goldman officials said that anyone immersed in the European debt crisis and government responses at the time would understand that conditions changed frequently, and it was Goldman's obligation to keep clients informed.
As for muppets -- a mildly derogatory term common in British slang -- Goldman officials said they had conducted an exhaustive search after Mr. Smith resigned. They said they found only one such reference to a client, and it was about educating the client, a midsize European bank, not taking advantage of it.
The mere mention of Mr. Smith invokes passionate reactions at Goldman, but much of the initial anger seems to have dissipated. People I spoke to who had been close to him felt hurt, wronged and saddened by a broadside from someone they considered a friend and colleague, dedicated to the firm and its values, who was hard-working, reliable and humble. He seemed, they said, the last person to attack the firm and its culture.
One of Mr. Smith's fellow interns said, ''I thought he loved the firm and its culture.'' The former intern, now a managing director, said he helped organize a going-away party for him at SPiN, a Manhattan club with 17 Ping-Pong tables. (Mr. Smith was a table tennis champion in his native South Africa.) ''In his book he makes every element of our intern program seem demeaning,'' the former intern said. ''It was intense and stressful, but it was fun. And we learned so much.'' He showed me a yearbook he had saved from that summer with several photos of a beaming Mr. Smith.
The Goldman officials I spoke to all asked not to be named because they didn't want to be drawn into a public debate about the book.
A partner who said he acted in many ways as Mr. Smith's mentor and was in regular contact with him until shortly before he left, said: ''He never raised any issue with me. I had no inkling. I thought he'd settled in in London and was doing fine. I know he was disappointed he hadn't been made a managing director yet, but he just wasn't ready. For some people it's a sprint, but it took me 18 years to make managing director and 20 years to make partner. I told him to keep at it and good things will happen. Serve clients and they'll serve you. Give them good ideas. London was a great opportunity for him, and I thought he was excited.''
One thing Mr. Smith was clearly unhappy about was his compensation, which had peaked at $500,000 and, like the compensation of most Goldman employees, had recently declined slightly. After he asked for a $1 million bonus, his supervisor wrote in an e-mail, ''Greg Smith off the charts unrealistic, thinks he shld trade at multiples, we told him there's v little tolerance for reactions like that and he needs to tone it down.''
The partner told me this week: ''He was an outlier in London. Most people were disappointed but realistic. He had a complete disconnect from the macro environment. Europe wanted to outlaw bonuses. They were discussing bonus caps. We were laying people off. People were very sensitive to this.'' The former intern added, ''I was floored; I was beyond shocked'' by Mr. Smith's resignation and accusations. ''He was making $500,000 at the age of 26 or 27 at a time when people were being laid off, and he complains? I can only conclude he was motivated by personal gain. The firm has been under attack, and I think he's being opportunistic. None of it feels virtuous to me.''
Virtuous or not, ''Why I Left'' will surely not be the last word -- good or bad -- on Goldman. Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader at the center of a now-infamous subprime mortgage deal, is scheduled to go on trial for civil fraud next July. Unlike Mr. Smith, Mr. Tourre was involved in a deal in which Goldman misled investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission has said. That deal has come to embody many of the excesses of the subprime mortgage bubble -- something that actually did help cause the financial crisis. Mr. Tourre has denied any wrongdoing and is on unpaid leave from Goldman while studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago and doing volunteer work in Rwanda.
Mr. Tourre hasn't signed a seven-figure book deal, but he could surely get one -- and if he does, it could be a tell-all worth reading.

HEADLINE: Weighing the Odds Of Disability, For Insurance Purposes

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
OF all the types of insurance people are thinking about, disability insurance may be the last on the list.
One reason is that most people who have it got it through their employer and have given it little thought. Another is that people are not likely to go out and buy it on their own because it is so expensive, the exception being certain occupational groups, like doctors. Yet it does serve an important purpose in replacing a portion of your salary if you get hurt or become sick and are unable to work for several months or more.
Still, figuring out the real risk of becoming disabled is difficult. My colleague Ron Lieber wrote a Your Money column about the various and divergent estimates in 2010.
According to the Social Security Administration, a 20-year-old in 2011 had a 30 percent chance of being disabled for at least six months before retirement. That is a fairly scary statistic, but I couldn't help thinking it was slightly misleading. After all, someone who moves refrigerators for a living is at greater risk for the most common disability claim -- muscular-skeletal injury, according to Sun Life Financial -- than someone who works in an office. But the second most common cause for a claim, cancer, doesn't care what you do for a living. 
If you are like me, you also wonder about the likelihood of an insurer paying a disability claim. Will it pay promptly when you submit the proper paperwork or give you the runaround until you give up, as was the case with one insurer, Unum, several years ago?
And to be clear, I am talking about private disability insurance. Anyone who is working and paying into Social Security is eligible to apply for Social Security disability insurance, though the average benefit is only $1,188 a month.
So how do you make an informed decision?
THE COST The first thing anyone who has looked into buying disability insurance has probably been struck by is the cost.
Dallas L. Salisbury, president and chief executive of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a public policy research group in Washington, said that the cost for coverage in a group policy runs about $16.30 per $1,000 of coverage with a waiting period of 30 days and a maximum benefit of $15,000 a month. For individuals buying their own policies, he said, the cost is $18.60 per $1,000 of coverage but with a 90-day waiting period.
That may seem comparable, but it's not. The 90-day waiting period is like a higher deductible on your homeowner's insurance, and it makes the policy considerably cheaper than it would otherwise be. The 90 days is also long enough to eliminate most smaller, short-term claims.
Compare that with the costs for life insurance, which Mr. Salisbury said typically are about 22 cents per $1,000.
Chris Quinn, vice president for the employee group benefits division at Sun Life Financial, said another way to think about it was that the premium was 1 percent of someone's salary in a group plan and 3.5 percent of that salary in an individual plan.
Mr. Salisbury said that while the number of disability claims had remained constant for decades, the costs remained high because of the small pools of people with disability insurance and the fact that insurance companies might be obliged to make payments for decades.
''The old theory was as soon as fewer people are doing backbreaking work, there will be fewer claims,'' Mr. Salisbury said. ''But it turns out more people are doing damaging work. Take carpal tunnel syndrome from repetitive usage. Some of the old theories hadn't contemplated computer keyboards.''
The cost of policies that increase someone's disability payment above the typical 50 to 60 percent of income is even higher. The reason, Mr. Salisbury and others said, is what is called adverse selection bias: the people most likely to buy additional coverage are likely to have some condition or family history that makes them believe they will need it.
THE CALCULATION The decision for most people on whether to buy an individual policy or add to an employer-sponsored one comes down to a personal risk assessment.
David Ropeik, a consultant and teacher who has written two books about assessing risk, said that when he and his wife had young children and were contemplating buying additional disability insurance, they decided against it.
''We engaged in the process because we were worried about it in the first place,'' Mr. Ropeik said. ''If we had been more emotionally worried, we would have fantasized about worst-case scenarios. We were fortunate that our incomes could support the other one if something happened.''
But Mr. Ropeik was careful to say that he was not arguing against buying disability insurance. ''Our willingness to spend money to defray our worry depends on who we are as individuals,'' he said. ''It's not a waste of money if you never collect. You're buying something. You're getting a value.''
For some people like Jonathan Skinner, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College who has done research on disability coverage around the world, that value is peace of mind. He said he bought as much additional coverage as he could under the college's plan.
''As an economist, I'm happiest to insure the things that are rare occurrences that don't cost much to insure against,'' he said. ''The disability top-up gives me peace of mind 100 percent of the time.''
When I asked him how someone steeped in economic reasoning could want to have maximum coverage for a low-probability event, he said, like others I spoke to who had done the same, that he had been driven by fear.
''The thing I fear the most is becoming disabled and requiring outside care that's really expensive,'' he said. ''I don't want my wife and my family to drop what they're doing and take care of me.''
What both Mr. Ropeik and Professor Skinner did, though, was ask whether they could maintain their lifestyles if they could no longer work. But most claims do not last that long.
Sun Life said claims on policies with a 90-day waiting period last about three years, while those filed on policies with a 180-day waiting period run to 4.5 years. But insurers are quick to point out that every company is paying claims on people in their 20s who will be on disability until their policies end, usually at 65.
Andy Sullivan, senior vice president for disability and small market business operations at Prudential, said most people went back to work in two years. ''If they go beyond that 24-month point, you see the extension of the disability to several years,'' he said.
To help people make their own calculation, the Council for Disability Awareness, a trade group backed by the insurance industry, created a calculator called What's My Personal Disability Quotient. When I put in some basic information about myself, I was told that I had a 12 percent chance of becoming disabled for at least three months.
Barry Lundquist, president of the group, said the site was created using the same actuarial tables that disability insurers use to price policies. But he, like everyone I spoke to in the industry, cautioned against taking consolation from a low percentage chance.
''The important take-away is that we all have a disability risk that is too high to ignore, whether 5 percent or 50 percent,'' he said. ''The potential loss of income is usually in the millions of dollars considering one's career earnings potential.''
THE PAYOUT Of course, people do get disabled and collect payments.
What struck me was how frank insurers were about trying to get people back to work quickly so they could stop making payments. This is good -- who wants to be loafing around? -- but it also ran counter to how I imagined disability insurance working.
''We have incentives in our program that offer transition benefits,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''We now include rehabilitation incentives. If you go back to work and it's at a lower salary, we'll augment your salary for some period of time. The incentives we provide are focused on the notion that most people want to be back at work.''
This was the case with Linda Hatchett, who is 62 years old. But not all of these programs work out as planned. An experienced dialysis nurse in Nashville, she fell and broke her hip last year. She rested for several months, and then her doctors decided her hip needed to be replaced. While she was recovering, her job was eliminated.
In January, her hip healed, she started looking for a job that would use her skills but not be too strenuous. Sun Life offered her career counseling and she accepted a lump sum settlement from it in April, thinking she would easily find a job. But it hasn't happened yet, despite a lot of networking.
''The longer I'm out of work, the more scary it becomes,'' she said. ''I love to work. I miss it. Financially, we've had to scale back.''

HEADLINE: How Best to Lift People Out of Poverty

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Wrong Way to Help the Poor'' (Op-Ed, Oct. 11):
Gary E. MacDougal rightly questions if the current patchwork of public programs is the best way to improve the prospects of our country's 46 million poor, which includes 22 percent of all children.
But he widely misses the mark when he suggests that Representative Paul D. Ryan's proposed budget would make things better. 
In making his case, Mr. MacDougal cites my work at the Institute for Educational Leadership. During a 1995 Congressional hearing, policy makers stepped into the shoes of a working-poor family applying for help from 20 public programs. Astonishingly, even the very people who had created the laws couldn't figure out how to make them work.
But funding cuts or block grants that starve programs will not reduce complexity or improve results. We need a more thoughtful look at the largest programs -- from Medicaid to nutrition programs and tax credits for low-income families -- so they really do lift this generation and the next.
Whether you are liberal or conservative, that's the American way.

To the Editor:
The tired call to replace the welfare state with block grants to states does not take seriously the nature of both poverty and the economy.
Gary E. MacDougal's thought experiment -- dividing the total spending on poverty by the number of poor people -- is highly misleading; for example, it fails to consider the number of people lifted out of poverty by such programs.
Though the experiment packs rhetorical punch, substantively it is as weak as his larger argument supporting block grants as the answer to poverty. Some states might do a great job, but others surely would not.
Destroying the federal safety net in the name of federalism would have tragic consequences, particularly for poor children and families, and should be rejected on moral and social grounds.

To the Editor:
Gary E. MacDougal is right that candidates should pay more attention to poverty and that low-income families too often face a confusing maze to get help. However, the budget proposed by Representative Paul D. Ryan, which relies on cost shifts to states, should not be the discussion's starting point.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid played a critical role helping people in this recession. Block grants would make these programs far less responsive in the next recession, as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families was less responsive in this recession.
Mr. MacDougal is right to focus on results -- children who are healthy and school ready, adults with the skills needed to compete.
But block grants won't get us there. Instead, we should learn from community programs, such as Harlem Children's Zone and the Strive Partnership of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky, achieving these outcomes by coordinating services to families, even if the services are financed by different programs or delivered by more than one institution.
ELIZABETH LOWER-BASCH Policy Coordinator Center for Law and Social Policy Washington, Oct. 11, 2012
To the Editor:
While Gary E. MacDougal makes some good points, I am left speechless and utterly confused by his statement that Pell grants ''are more focused on promoting education than stemming poverty.''
Have I missed something? Is education no longer a way up the proverbial socioeconomic ladder?

HEADLINE: Jockeying Begins for Cabinet Positions With the Election Just Weeks Away

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator John Kerry headed to Camp David on Friday to spend the weekend with President Obama. Senator Rob Portman has been on and off Mitt Romney's plane for weeks and will spend the next few days with him in Florida.
Each senator is playing the other party's nominee in rehearsals for Monday's final debate, as Mr. Obama seeks to keep his job and Mr. Romney tries to take it away. Left unspoken is that both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Portman may also be unofficially auditioning for jobs of their own.
Mr. Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is one of two leading candidates for secretary of state if Mr. Obama wins, according to White House officials. Mr. Portman, a budget director under President George W. Bush who now represents Ohio, is seen by Republicans as a potential treasury secretary in a Romney administration.
Never mind that the race for president is hardly over. The race for choice positions in the still-theoretical next administration is on. With two and a half weeks until the election, the subtle and not-so-subtle positioning has intensified into a multifront struggle for the fruits of a victory not yet won, according to three dozen Democratic and Republican insiders who described the situation on the condition that they not be named. 
In keeping with Washington etiquette, the contenders publicly deny any ambition for appointments and insist their only focus is on winning the election. But they are meeting friends in the White House for coffee, volunteering for campaign work, raising their profile through speeches and television appearances, and dropping hints about availability come November.
''People are jockeying like mad but they have to be careful because to some degree this administration has frowned on explicit, overt jockeying,'' said a former Obama administration official. Similarly, word has gone out to donors from Mr. Romney's Boston headquarters not to ask for jobs until after the election.
Most intense has been the struggle to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is stepping down. On the Democratic side, Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, was the clear front-runner for months. After the deadly attack on a Libya diplomatic post, the White House sent her to the Sunday television programs, raising her prominence for a possible promotion. But the move backfired when she described the assault as an outgrowth of protests only days before the government shifted its explanation and called it a terrorist attack.
Mr. Kerry signed letters to the administration requesting information about the attack but issued a statement defending Ms. Rice. It is a mark of Washington cynicism that even a statement defending her was seen by some as an effort by Mr. Kerry to undercut her by keeping attention on the matter. The Obama team has rallied behind Ms. Rice, saying she reflected information from intelligence agencies, but it recognizes that she now could face a confirmation fight from Senate Republicans.
Mr. Kerry bolstered his standing with a fiery convention speech for Mr. Obama and has had more face time with the president during debate preparations in recent weeks than Ms. Rice probably has in a year. While some Democrats blamed him for Mr. Obama's poor performance at the first debate, the president told advisers it was not Mr. Kerry's fault. But if the Senate is closely divided after the election, the White House may be reluctant to risk his seat, particularly if Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, is defeated, because Mr. Brown could then jump into a special election for Mr. Kerry's seat.
Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, would like to be secretary of state, friends say, but would face confirmation questions about security leaks and his past work for Fannie Mae, the mortgage company at the heart of the housing meltdown, and he has told Mr. Obama he wants to stay in his current post. A dark horse discussed in the White House is Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns, a career diplomat.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner also plans to leave after the election. Jacob S. Lew, the White House chief of staff, is deemed the odds-on favorite to take over. Others mentioned include Erskine Bowles, co-chairman of Mr. Obama's deficit reduction commission; Roger Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary; Laurence D. Fink, chairman of BlackRock, the giant money management firm; and Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale.
If Mr. Lew goes, Mr. Obama would need a fourth chief of staff. David Plouffe, his senior adviser, would be a logical choice, but he wants to leave after the election. Valerie Jarrett, a close friend of the first family, might want the role, but she has detractors. Mr. Donilon turned down the job once before but could be pressed again.
Also mentioned are Michael Froman, the president's international economics adviser; Robert Bauer, the former White House counsel; Ronald A. Klain, the former vice-presidential chief of staff now helping with debate preparations; and Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides.
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. are expected to leave, although they may wait until after the inauguration, perhaps even six months or a year into the new term.
Mr. Panetta, who flies home to California every weekend, is eager to retire but may see through a looming struggle over military spending first. Waiting in the wings are Michle A. Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defense who would be the first woman to run the armed forces, and Ashton Carter, the current deputy secretary. Democrats said Mr. Donilon or Mr. Kerry might be considered.
Mr. Holder had been thought ready to go but may hang on to avoid looking like he was driven out by controversy over a botched anti-gun operation. The main internal candidate to succeed him is Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, whose supporters have spread word of her interest.
The Romney side is more in flux. A transition team called the Readiness Project led by former Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah has assembled lists of candidates but no one has been interviewed, aides said. That has not stopped the lobbying, though. Transition team members are inundated with calls and e-mails.
Mr. Romney would draw from his campaign circle for White House staff. Mr. Leavitt seems a likely chief of staff, although Senator Portman is also mentioned. Richard Williamson, a foreign policy adviser, may become national security adviser, while another aide, Dan Senor, seems likely to get a top position, perhaps working for a Vice President Paul D. Ryan. Bob White, a longtime Romney friend and campaign chairman, could be senior adviser. Either Eric Fehrnstrom or Kevin Madden could be press secretary.
The competition for secretary of state has exposed an ideological rift. When Robert Zoellick, the former World Bank president, was tapped to run the national security transition team, it ignited protests from conservatives who viewed him as too moderate. They prefer John R. Bolton, the outspoken former ambassador to the United Nations, although he could not win confirmation even for that post during the Bush administration and had to be installed by recess appointment.
Other options include Mr. Portman; Robert M. Kimmitt, a former undersecretary of state and deputy treasury secretary; or even Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the hawkish independent from Connecticut who caucuses with Democrats. Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota had been held up for a top job but effectively bowed out to take a private-sector position starting Nov. 1.
To run the Treasury Department, Mr. Romney could tap, instead of Mr. Portman, Mr. Zoellick, Mr. Kimmitt or R. Glenn Hubbard, the Columbia Business School dean. Former Senator James M. Talent of Missouri is seen as a possible defense secretary. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia could be attorney general, as could Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Senator Orrin G. Hatch and former Senator Robert F. Bennett, both of Utah, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida all are in the mix.

HEADLINE: Campaigning in Virginia, Obama Presses Fight for Women's Vote

BYLINE: By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
FAIRFAX, Va. -- President Obama reached out to female voters in this battleground state on Friday, saying that Mitt Romney would ''turn back the clock'' on women's rights and accusing him of developing ''Romnesia'' by conveniently forgetting his most conservative positions.
''Mr. Severely Conservative wants you to think he was severely kidding about everything he said over the last year,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We've got to name this condition that he's going through. I think it's called Romnesia.'' 
The president mocked Mr. Romney's remarks about recruiting women to serve in his cabinet when he was governor of Massachusetts, saying, ''You don't want someone who has to ask for binders of women.'' His campaign also released a television advertisement accusing Mr. Romney of not wanting to hire schoolteachers or reduce classroom sizes for students.
Mr. Obama delivered his speech to 9,000 supporters at George Mason University here before heading to Camp David to prepare for the final presidential debate on Monday. Mr. Romney held a rally late Friday in Daytona Beach, Fla.; he was spending the weekend in the state ahead of the debate.
Mr. Romney responded at a campaign rally in Daytona Beach, Fla., late Friday, by saying that Mr. Obama's was reduced to ''silly word games.''
''Have you been watching the Obama campaign lately?'' he said. ''They've been reduced to petty attacks and silly word games. Just watch it. The Obama campaign has become the incredible shrinking campaign. This is a big country with big opportunities and great challenges, and they keep on talking about smaller and smaller things.''
Mr. Romney received the endorsement of The Orlando Sentinel on Friday, four years after the paper endorsed Mr. Obama for his first term.
Editors of the paper said, ''It verges on magical thinking to expect Obama to get different results in the next four years.''
But newspapers in Denver, Salt Lake City and Tampa, Fla., all endorsed Mr. Obama on Friday. The Salt Lake Tribune, which endorsed the president four years ago, called Mr. Romney a ''shape-shifting nominee'' and asked, ''Who is this guy, really, and what in the world does he truly believe?''
The editorial boards' decisions arrived as new data from the federal government this week showed the unemployment rates in most battleground states have fallen, in some cases significantly, during the past 12 months.
In Nevada and Florida, the unemployment rate dropped by nearly two percentage points, though joblessness in both states remained above the national average, which is 7.8 percent, according to state-by-state numbers released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In Nevada, the unemployment rate is now 11.8 percent, and in Florida, it is 8.7 percent.
Several other battleground states -- including Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Wisconsin -- saw smaller drops in unemployment. But in all of those states, the unemployment rate is well below the national average.
The economic improvement, and the perception among voters that things are getting better, has helped bolster Mr. Obama even as a strong performance in the first debate has given Mr. Romney a lift going into the final month of the race.
The fight for female voters intensified this week after the town-hall-style debate in Hempstead, N.Y., which included a question about equal pay for women that prompted a clash between the candidates over who would better serve women's needs.
That debate spilled onto the airwaves, with Mr. Romney's campaign quickly releasing an ad contending that he does not oppose contraception and believes that abortion should be legal in cases of rape and incest, and to save the life of the mother.
The Obama campaign hit back with its own ad, featuring a clip from a CNN debate in 2007 in which Mr. Romney said he would be ''delighted'' to sign a bill banning all abortions. (He went on to say that he believed the country was not ready for that.)
At the rally here, Mr. Obama criticized Mr. Romney for changing his positions on abortion, energy and other issues. Proclaiming the benefits of his health care law, the president reassured the crowd that ''Romnesia'' was curable. ''If you come down with a case of Romnesia and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your Web site, or the promises you've made over the six years you've been running for president,'' he said, ''here's the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions.''
Mr. Romney's campaign quickly issued a statement from Barbara J. Comstock, a Republican state lawmaker in Virginia.
''Women haven't forgotten how we've suffered over the last four years in the Obama economy with higher taxes, higher unemployment and record levels of poverty,'' Ms. Comstock said. ''What is really frightening is that we know a second term for President Obama will bring devastating defense cuts that will cost Virginia over 130,000 jobs, more burdensome regulations and the biggest tax increase in history on our small businesses and families.''

HEADLINE: Revenue Lags at G.E., but Profit Rises 8% in Quarter

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
General Electric on Friday reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter revenue, hurt by unfavorable exchange rates, and set a cautious tone for 2013, saying it expected the tough economic environment to continue. 
The company reported a 2.8 percent rise in sales, to $36.35 billion. Revenue was down at its aviation and health care arms, while the stronger dollar crimped total results by diminishing the value of its foreign sales.
Third-quarter net income increased 8 percent, to $3.49 billion, or 33 cents a share, compared with $3.22 billion, or 22 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the profit was 36 cents a share, meeting the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters.
G.E., the maker of electric turbines and jet engines, stood by its forecast for full-year earnings to rise at a double-digit percentage rate. It said full-year sales would be up just 3 percent, down from a previous forecast for 5 percent, reflecting continued efforts to cut back the GE Capital finance arm and exchange rate fluctuations.
Among G.E. units, the energy arm had the biggest revenue growth, with a 12 percent increase in the quarter.
The company is not counting on any significant improvement in the world economy next year.
''We're not assuming that Europe gets any better,'' the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, told investors in a conference call. ''We're looking at '13 being kind of like '12, with the big variable being the fiscal cliff.''
The fiscal cliff refers to $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases that could take effect at the end of the year if lawmakers fail to reach a deal on reducing the federal deficit.
G.E. does not expect those cuts to take effect, Mr. Immelt said.
''We're making the same assessment most people do, that somehow it gets resolved,'' said Mr. Immelt, who is a top adviser to President Obama on jobs and the economy.
Shares of G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., fell 78 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $22.03.

HEADLINE: Strategizing for the President, and Her Corporate Clients, Too

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and ERIC LIPTON; Kitty Bennett and Tom Torok contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the rarefied world of political consultants who straddle the line between campaign adviser and corporate strategist, Anita Dunn has few peers.
As a confidante of President Obama and a senior campaign adviser, Ms. Dunn has helped prepare him for the debates this month, plotted campaign strategy and acted as a surrogate of sorts in attacking Mitt Romney for a ''backward-looking attitude'' on issues like women's rights and health care.
She and her colleagues at SKDKnickerbocker, a communications firm, have built a growing list of blue-chip companies -- food manufacturers, a military contractor, the New York Stock Exchange and the Canadian company developing the Keystone XL pipeline -- willing to pay handsomely for help in winning over federal regulators or landing government contracts. Some clients and lobbyists who have teamed up with SKDK say they benefit from the firm's ability to provide information about the Obama administration's views. 
''It is difficult to penetrate this administration,'' said Jason Mahler, a lobbyist for the computer technology company Oracle, which was part of a coalition that hired Ms. Dunn's firm to push for reduced tax rates on offshore profits. ''Anyone that has an insight into what they are thinking or their strategy or thoughts on issues we are working on is helpful, and they provided that.''
SKDK executives said that Ms. Dunn, who declined to be interviewed, was scrupulous about separating her political work from her corporate agenda, and that she followed White House ethics rules barring her from appealing on behalf of clients.
What the firm offers, said Hilary Rosen, an SKDK partner who is also a high-profile Obama ally, is help in navigating the political landscape in Washington.
''It is not that people assume we can talk to the White House to influence them on policy,'' Ms. Rosen said, ''but that we understand progressive Democrats, including the administration -- how they communicate their own message, think about their message -- and therefore we understand how things will play.''
Still, Ms. Dunn's dual roles show the limits of Mr. Obama's attempts to change the culture of Washington. Even as he pledged to curb the influence of special interests in the capital and has restricted the role of lobbyists in his administration, the president and his top aides continue to rely on political operatives like Ms. Dunn who also represent clients seeking to influence public policy.
''He's gone in the right direction,'' said James Thurber, a professor at American University, referring to measures that opened more White House records to public scrutiny and that slowed the revolving door between government and lobbying firms. ''But in the wide sweep of things, he didn't really change Washington that much.''
The rules, for example, do not apply to the army of consultants, advisers, communication strategists and others who represent clients with federal agendas. Unlike lobbyists, they are not required to disclose their activities, clients or issues, a freedom that has allowed them to become even more influential in recent years, ethics experts say. (Coincidentally, Ms. Dunn's husband, Robert J. Bauer, who was White House counsel from late 2009 to 2011, helped shape and put in place some of the ethics measures.)
Like Ms. Dunn, some other top Obama campaign advisers are both insiders and outsiders.
Erik Smith, a senior media adviser for the Obama campaign, is the founder of a communications and issue advocacy firm whose current and former clients include Citigroup, Ford, Delta Air Lines and Genentech.
Jim Margolis, another senior campaign adviser on media strategies, has an outside consulting firm that promotes his work ''at the intersection of politics, advertising and advocacy.''
And Broderick Johnson, a senior Obama aide, is a former lobbyist who has a consulting shop promising ''a wealth of public and private relationships'' that corporate clients can use ''to secure useful intelligence.'' He is taking a leave from the consulting shop while he is with the campaign.
But it is Ms. Dunn, 54, a former White House communications director, who has the highest profile. Incisive and sharp-witted, Ms. Dunn acts as a sounding board for Mr. Obama and his campaign.
''Who is a smart, aggressive woman who has been at the top of strategic battles for president, gubernatorial and Senate races? Anita Dunn would be near the top of the list,'' said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic consultant.
After starting her career in politics answering phones as an unpaid White House intern in the Carter administration, she ended up on Capitol Hill, working for Senator Bill Bradley before joining the firm now called SKDKnickerbocker in 1993. In the years since, she has served as a Democratic strategist and a communications specialist for Senator Tom Daschle, Representative Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats in Congress.
She was an adviser to Mr. Obama's upstart presidential bid in 2007, and has been a central player in defining his public image, taking a leave of absence from her firm in April 2009 to take over as Mr. Obama's communications director.
She left the White House in November 2009 to return to SKDK.
She and her husband, who is now the top legal adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign, form a Washington power couple who regularly attend White House social events. After leaving the administration, she continued to confer with leading officials, according to government records, including Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser; Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner; Jay Carney, the press secretary; Elizabeth Warren, who was a special adviser on consumer protection and is now a Senate candidate in Massachusetts; and Christina D. Romer, who was the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Ms. Dunn regularly attends closed-door political strategy briefings with top Obama aides; White House records show she has visited more than 100 times since leaving her communications job. She is now serving as a paid adviser to the Democratic National Committee.
Both the White House and the campaign defended Ms. Dunn's involvement. Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said the administration ''in all instances'' took steps to avoid any conflicts of interest. Adam Fetcher, a campaign spokesman, said it was ''nonsense to think'' that a communications consultant like Ms. Dunn should be precluded from doing campaign work because she had outside clients.
Her consulting firm has thrived. SKDK focused for years on media campaigns for Democratic candidates, but soon after her return from the White House, it announced a ''major expansion'' emphasizing strategic communications and advocacy work for businesses.
Nearly doubling in size to 60 employees, the firm hired a dozen Washington insiders tied to the Obama administration or the Democratic Party, including Ms. Rosen, a former lobbyist; Jill Zuckman, a senior Transportation Department official; and Doug Thornell, a former senior aide to House Democrats. And it took on corporate clients including General Electric, AT&T, Time Warner, Pratt & Whitney, Kaplan University and TransCanada, which is developing the Keystone XL pipeline.
The firm has also helped run industry coalitions seeking to influence federal policy on particular issues, working with lobbyists and other media specialists that represented companies like Oracle, Google, Disney, Pepsi and Microsoft.
Josh Isay, a managing partner at SKDK, attributed the firm's success in communicating challenging policy issues to a team that has ''decades of experience working in the highest levels of government, the news media, corporate America, labor and political campaigns.''
Sometimes the firm has been at odds with the Obama administration, as when it worked with food manufacturers and media companies in an attempt to block guidelines intended to curb food commercials for unhealthy products like sugared cereals that are aimed at children. The administration ultimately dropped the proposed limits, after the coalition successfully pushed lawmakers to oppose the plan.
Executives at SKDK said their work did not extend beyond devising ways to drive public opinion in a way that benefits the campaigns -- by setting up Facebook pages and Web sites and lining up favorable news media coverage. While SKDK promotes Ms. Dunn's prominent role as an Obama adviser on its Web site, it said it had never traded on its White House access to help clients.
''Anita would not be welcome at the White House as often as she is if she was over there selling them on issues,'' said Ms. Rosen, a frequent White House visitor herself. She and others at SKDK said the firm pointed out to clients that it did not lobby and noted the prohibitions on Ms. Dunn at the White House.
A half-dozen clients and consultants working with the firm, who asked not to be named because the work for the corporate clients was supposed to be confidential, said information provided by SKDK that was not publicly available had been instrumental in planning strategy.
Two consultants involved in the children's advertising project said Ms. Dunn provided guidance on the likelihood that the administration and the Federal Trade Commission would back away from the proposal. In helping the New York Stock Exchange seek approval for a merger with a German exchange, SKDK's associates told corporate partners that the Obama administration did not appear to have objections, participants said.
And working on behalf of Pratt & Whitney, a military contractor, SKDK told other consultants that the administration appeared unwilling to move aggressively to kill a deal forcing the company to share a multibillion-dollar jet engine contract with General Electric, several participants said.
Among its biggest assignments was representing a business coalition seeking to reduce tax rates on about $1 trillion in offshore earnings. Ms. Rosen told members of the corporate team that the Treasury Department was unwilling to go to bat for the idea, one participant recalled. SKDK and several senior Treasury officials say they never discussed the issue.
But an official with knowledge of the issue said Ms. Rosen had spoken by phone with Jake Siewert, then a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, asking whether there was any chance that the administration would allow such a plan to be included in a debt deal then under discussion. Mr. Siewert told Ms. Rosen that the idea had no administration support, acccording to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Ms. Rosen acknowledged that she probably spoke to officials at the Treasury press office to learn the administration's public position on the tax plan.
When The New York Times asked the Treasury Department last week about its contact with SKDK on the issue, that inquiry was forwarded to the firm within an hour.

HEADLINE: As China Weighs Shifting Economic Policy, a Rivalry for Its Stewardship

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Edward Wong contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Advocates for far-reaching economic policy changes in China have long pinned their hopes on Wang Qishan, a cagey former banker with a reputation for forcing difficult decisions through recalcitrant bureaucracies.
When Zhu Rongji was prime minister of China from 1998 to 2003, dismantling thousands of state-owned enterprises while opening the path for a boom in private enterprise, Mr. Wang was the protg at his side. When the SARS virus began running unchecked through the city of Beijing in the spring of 2003, Mr. Wang was named acting mayor and quickly brought the disease under control.
And when President Hu Jintao needed a vice prime minister in 2008 to manage day-to-day financial and economic policies and oversee economic relations with the United States, he turned to Mr. Wang.
But a number of Communist Party insiders say that with the approach of the 18th Party Congress, scheduled to begin on Nov. 8 and the forum for China to usher in a new leadership team for the first time in a decade, Mr. Wang's chances of being named to a top job with broad authority over the economy appear to be dwindling by the day. 
While the responsibilities of China's new leadership team have not yet been finalized -- and are not expected to be announced until the end of the Party Congress -- the emerging consensus is that Mr. Wang is likely to be promoted to a position on the Standing Committee of the Politburo, China's top decision-making body, but not to have day-to-day control of the bureaucracy that oversees China's still largely state-driven economy.
Insiders say they now expect that economic policy will be left mostly in the hands of Li Keqiang, who is set to replace Wen Jiabao as prime minister next year. Mr. Li, 57, is a highly educated official with an almost professorial style who is said to read voluminous economic policy reports in often minute detail.
But he has considerably less experience than Mr. Wang, 64, in handling crises or pushing through tough decisions that offend vested interests, said a longtime associate of both men. Mr. Li ''might not have the leverage to get things done,'' he said.
A broad consensus exists at senior levels of the Chinese government in favor of shifting the economy toward a more sustainable trajectory. That trajectory could rely more on domestic demand than exports, more on consumption than investment spending, more on small and medium-size private companies than state-owned enterprises and more on creditworthiness than political connections to allocate loans from the state-owned banking system.
But practically every specific policy change required to carry out that broad objective is blocked by a different interest group, often including the ''princelings'' -- children of current and former senior Chinese officials.
Indeed, Mr. Wen, the departing prime minister, has spent a lot of time talking about the need for economic changes, but has had little success in pushing difficult decisions through the bureaucracies of the Communist Party and the government.
Mr. Wang had been considered until recent days to be a strong candidate to become executive vice prime minister, an influential position with the main responsibility for putting in place policies on practically all nonmilitary issues. But while that cannot be entirely ruled out, opinion in elite circles seems to be moving quickly against him, said another admirer of Mr. Wang with high-level access in the Communist Party.
Party insiders with access to ministers and more senior officials said that Mr. Wang now appeared most likely to be made the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference -- a figurehead position at the head of a national advisory body. He also has an outside chance of becoming the chairman of the National People's Congress, which has important responsibilities for legal changes but a lesser role on economic policy.
Either position would confer membership in the Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Politburo, the nine-member panel that rules China and might shrink to seven members after the Party Congress. Indeed, both chairmanships are considered senior within the committee to the post of executive vice prime minister. But the two chairmanships have traditionally carried less administrative authority and actual power.
The leading candidate to become executive vice prime minister now appears to be Zhang Gaoli, the party secretary of Tianjin, a party insider said. He is an economist by training but has a reputation as a cautious official more preoccupied with maintaining political stability than with undertaking economic policy experiments.
The actual transfer of the prime ministership and vice prime ministerships will not take place until the National People's Congress next March. But the succession will be determined by the new membership and ranking within the Politburo Standing Committee.
Party insiders and China analysts suggest that Mr. Wang was edged aside in the brutal game of one-upmanship and back-scratching politics that takes place behind closed doors in the Politburo.
''The main concern is that if Wang Qishan is vice prime minister, then Li Keqiang could be in his shadow in economic policy,'' said one insider who deals regularly with senior officials. ''Wang is older than Li, and has more experience and standing, and that makes their relationship awkward.''
Willy Lam, a specialist in Chinese politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that personal animosity appears to exist between the two men. ''If Wang Qishan becomes first vice premier, that will set off a vicious power struggle between Wang Qishan and Li Keqiang,'' he said.
Two Beijing insiders who know Mr. Wang and Mr. Li said that the two men were not openly hostile to each other, but had radically different personal styles. Mr. Wang likes to take charge of issues and spend a lot of time talking through policies with colleagues, while Mr. Li is more cerebral and spends more time reading reports, they said.
One of them said that there had been a push in late summer by some party elders for Mr. Wang to be named prime minister instead of Mr. Li. But that push appears not only to have fallen short but possibly backfired by hurting relations between them, the insider said.
Cheng Li, the research director at the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, said that Mr. Wang ''always wants to do something and take the initiative.''
But that is not necessarily an unalloyed virtue in the consensus-driven upper circles of the party. Besides Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhang, the other candidates that political insiders and observers in Beijing say are favorites for Standing Committee posts are Zhang Dejiang, a vice prime minister and party chief of Chongqing; Li Yuanchao, the head of the Organization Department; and Liu Yunshan, director of the Propaganda Department.
Two other contenders, Wang Yang, party chief of Guangdong Province, and Yu Zhengsheng, party chief of Shanghai, have encountered growing opposition in recent weeks. But any lineup currently in vogue could change before the Party Congress.
The two people who are virtually assured seats are Xi Jinping, designated to be the next party leader and the country's president, and Li Keqiang, heir to the title of prime minister.

HEADLINE: Bubble, Bubble, Conceptual Trouble

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: What's usual versus what's necessary. 

 BODY:
We're living in the aftermath of a major financial crisis. Reinhart-Rogoff warned in advance that recovery was likely to be slow; so, with less historical detail, did I. And so it has proved.
But based on the discussion I've heard, both on the blogs and in forums like that House of Commons debate Monday, there's a lot of confusion even among economists about what the pattern of slow recovery from financial crisis is really telling us. Basically, there seems to be a confusion between saying that something is usual and saying that it is necessary. Those aren't the same thing.
Here's how I interpret what we see in the historical data: financial crises leave an overhang of private-sector problems, principally excessive debt on the part of some subset of economic agents -- households, in the case of the United States. Because these agents are either forced or strongly induced to slash spending, the "natural" rate of interest, the interest rate consistent with full employment, falls sharply -- and in the case of a severe crisis, falls well below zero.
What this means in turn is that conventional monetary policy, which normally bears most of the burden of economic stabilization, is no longer up to the job. 
Now, there are other policy options. You could use discretionary fiscal policy, a k a stimulus, to boost demand; you could use unconventional monetary policy to depress interest rate spreads and/or raise expected inflation, helping get past the zero lower bound problem. Historically, however, countries tend not to do these things, or not to do them on a sufficient scale. Why? Politics. Intellectual confusion. Inertia. Misplaced fears. 
Basically, it takes much more clarity and unity to pursue either discretionary fiscal expansion or unconventional monetary policy than it does to cut the Fed funds rate, and few countries manage to display that kind of clarity and unity. And that, in turn, is why it took a war to end the Great Depression; there's nothing special about military spending from an economic point of view, but as a political matter Hitler managed to override the usual objections to stimulus.
Which brings me to the conceptual confusions.
First, I get a lot of complaints that people like me are being inconsistent: we say that financial crises are usually followed by prolonged slumps, yet we also want to End This Depression Now! and claim that it could be done very quickly. But there's no inconsistency: there are simple policy actions that could quickly end this depression now, there were simple policy actions that could have quickly ended depressions past. The problem is that now and then policy makers tend not to take these actions -- which is why some of us write books.
Second, there's a lot of confusion about the difference between demand and supply. Over and over again one hears that we can't expect to return to 2007 levels of employment, because there was a bubble back then. But what is a bubble? It's a situation in which some people are spending too much -- and we can't expect those people to return to past spending habits. But this says nothing about whether other people can spend more, so that the economy doesn't suffer from inadequate overall spending. Larry Summers used to like to say that you don't have to refill a flat tire through the hole; indeed. Yes, highly indebted households in the US will have to spend less in future; but the government can spend more, we can have lower trade deficits, and in general there's no reason why aggregate demand needs to be low despite the past excesses of some players.
One last point: we still keep hearing the "structural" argument, that we have to expect prolonged high unemployment because it takes time to turn construction workers into manufacturing workers or whatever. One answer is that this portrait of the economy is factually wrong: job losses have not been concentrated in a few sectors or professions, they have been broadly spread across the economy. But there's also a conceptual answer: if shifting workers across sectors requires mass unemployment, how come the bubble years -- when we were moving out of manufacturing into housing -- weren't high-unemployment years? Why does moving into the bubble sectors mean more jobs, but moving out into other sectors mean fewer jobs? I've never heard a coherent answer.
Back to the main point: yes, the aftermath of crises is usually a bad time. But that's because the policy response to crises is usually lousy. We are repeating that story -- but we shouldn't.

HEADLINE: Oct. 19: After Romney Gains, Should Obama Concede Florida?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's gains in Florida call into question how vigorously the campaigns should be contesting it over the final two weeks of the campaign. 

 BODY:
The national tracking polls on Friday showed some improvement for President Obama. He made gains in the surveys published by Rasmussen Reports, Investors' Business Daily, Gallup and Public Policy Polling, while losing ground only in the online survey published by the RAND Corporation.
Both the favorable trend toward Mr. Obama in the Gallup poll and the unfavorable one for him in the RAND poll might be regarded as examples of reversion to the mean, since both polls had been outliers relative to the consensus. 
Still, it was among the better days of national polling for Mr. Obama since the Denver debate. On average between the six daily tracking polls and two other national surveys that were published on Friday, Mr. Obama held a nominal lead over Mitt Romney of 0.5 of a percentage point. The median poll, which reduces the weight given to potential outliers, had Mr. Obama up by 1.4 percentage points instead.
These figures are quite consistent with the FiveThirtyEight "now-cast," which calculates the current standing in the national popular vote based on all national and state polls. That method estimates that Mr. Obama would win the national popular vote by 0.8 of a percentage point in an election held today.
It was Mr. Romney, however, who made an overall gain in the FiveThirtyEight forecast on Friday. His chances of winning the Electoral College ticked up to 32.1 percent, from 29.6 percent on Thursday.

Part of the reason is the sharp decline in the stock market on Friday, a component of the FiveThirtyEight economic index. The economic index receives fairly little overall weight in the forecast at this late point in the election, but a sharp move in one of its components can still move the numbers some.
The more important factor, however, is that Mr. Romney had a fairly strong day in state-by-state surveys.
Mr. Romney led in 7 of the 12 polls from battleground states that we added to our database on Friday. 
Furthermore, he made clear gains relative to the previous edition of the same survey in several of the polls, which in most cases predated the Denver debate, improving his standing by 4.4 percentage points on average in polls that provided for a comparison. Especially on days with a heavy volume of state polling, they tend to predominate in the FiveThirtyEight forecast. 
Thus, just as in Thursday's forecast, when Mr. Obama's standing improved because of strong state polls despite middling national polls, the opposite was true for Mr. Romney on Friday. 
If you look at the table above, however, you may notice a more specific theme in the state polls. We added four Florida polls to the database on Friday, and Mr. Romney led in all of them, by margins ranging from one to five percentage points.
The FiveThirtyEight forecast does not yet account for a fifth Florida poll, from SurveyUSA, which gave Mr. Obama a one-point lead there but was published overnight after we ran the forecast. 
Still, Florida has been polled so densely that the overall trend has become clear: Mr. Romney has made larger-than-average gains in the state since the Denver debate, and has now become a definitive favorite there.
According to the FiveThirtyEight "now-cast" on Friday, Mr. Romney would be a 78 percent favorite to win Florida in an election held today. Projecting forward to Nov. 6 introduces a bit more uncertainty, but he's now a 69 percent favorite to carry the state on Election Day, according to the model.
Mr. Romney's gains in Florida call into question how vigorously the campaigns should be contesting it over the final two weeks of the campaign. Mr. Romney might consider relaxing his efforts there, while Mr. Obama's campaign might consider de-emphasizing the state.
Based on the FiveThirtyEight tipping-point index, Florida is now only the ninth-most-important state in the Electoral College math. There is only about a 2 percent chance that the decisive Electoral College vote will be cast in that state on Nov. 6.
This represents a significant decline: Florida had ranked as high as second on the tipping-point list at earlier stages of the race. 
Why is the forecast model so willing to dismiss Florida? It reflects a combination of Mr. Obama's recent weakness in the polls there -- and his comparative strength elsewhere.
Mr. Obama remains the overall favorite in the FiveThirtyEight forecast because he leads by at least 1.8 percentage points in states with enough electoral votes for him to carry 277. The closest of these are Wisconsin, Ohio, Nevada and Iowa.
Mr. Obama could afford to lose either Nevada or Iowa from his column, which would still leave him with 271 electoral votes -- just enough to win. 
He could not afford to lose both Iowa and Nevada without adding other states to replace them. Nor could he afford to lose Wisconsin or Ohio. It's still too soon -- and there is still too much intrinsic uncertainty in the polling -- to reduce the election down to these four states only.
Mr. Obama's next-best state is New Hampshire, where the forecast shows him with a tiny although much diminished advantage. Because New Hampshire has only four electoral votes, however, it comes into play only under relatively specific conditions. Were Mr. Obama to lose Wisconsin, for instance, while winning Ohio, Iowa and Nevada, also winning New Hampshire would give him 271 electoral votes. (In some other plausible scenarios, winning New Hampshire would only give Mr. Obama a 269-269 tie, which would probably go for Mr. Romney in the House of Representatives.)
Two other states, Colorado and Virginia, were virtually tied in the FiveThirtyEight forecast as of Friday. These provide Mr. Obama with some additional flexibility, since Colorado contains 9 electoral votes and Virginia 13. If he carried both states, for example, along with Iowa and Nevada, Mr. Obama could afford to lose Ohio, Wisconsin and New Hampshire and would still win the Electoral College.
There are no guarantees, obviously, in any of these states. But between the states in which Mr. Obama appears to hold a lead now (Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa and Nevada) -- themselves sufficient to provide him with a winning electoral map -- and the three others (New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia) that are roughly tied but could serve as backup plans for him, his electoral strategy remains reasonably robust.
The potential benefit of winning Florida is that it would allow Mr. Obama to circumvent the need to thread the needle quite so tightly. Ohio, for instance, is not quite a must-win state for Mr. Romney, in view of the forecast model. (Winning without Ohio would be difficult but not impossible for Mr. Romney; the same is true for Mr. Obama.) But Florida, with its 29 electoral votes, is very much a must-win for Mr. Romney.
If winning Florida represents a high-upside case for Mr. Obama, however, it also comes at considerable expense. 
Florida, because of its large population, is an expensive state to advertise in. And it is a state that probably does require a considerable advertising expenditure. Florida's population is large, but not especially dense, spread out in a number of exurban and suburban communities throughout the state. It's easier to reach voters through the airwaves there than by knocking on doors or appearing at campaign rallies. 
Finally, Florida is a state in which Mr. Obama has always been swimming upstream, since it is traditionally a bit Republican-leaning and since its economy remains weaker than those of the battleground states of the Midwest. The "state fundamentals" calculation that the FiveThirtyEight forecast considers along with the polls, which projects results based on each state's past voting history, demographics, economic conditions and fund-raising totals there, estimates that the most natural result would be a win for Mr. Romney by three percentage points.
Florida also has a history of fairly accurate polling; it is not a state, like New Hampshire or Nevada, that is known for producing Election Day surprises.
All of this should call into question whether Florida represents a wise use of resources for Mr. Obama. 
The same is partially true for Mr. Romney, although the situation is not quite symmetrical. If Mr. Romney were to disarm there first, while Mr. Obama's campaign continued to contest the state, Mr. Obama might improve the numbers enough to bring it closer to the national averages and improve the state's ranking on the tipping-point list. If the reverse were true -- and Mr. Romney kept pouring resources into the state while Mr. Obama did not -- it would presumably go from somewhat Republican-leaning to being even more strongly in Mr. Romney's column, but would not pass through the electoral tipping point.
Still, if the recent polls and the FiveThirtyEight forecast are right, Mr. Obama's efforts to compete in Florida mostly serve the function of a bluff. They might be enough to prevent Mr. Romney from taking the state for granted, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Florida will be central to the electoral math on Nov. 6.
There is an interesting counterpart to Florida in the form of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is another state in which Mr. Romney seems to have made above-average gains since the Denver debate. Still, the FiveThirtyEight forecast, and the consensus of polls in the state, put Mr. Obama about four points ahead there. Mr. Obama is more likely to win Florida than Mr. Romney is to win Pennsylvania.
And yet, Pennsylvania now ranks ahead of Florida on the FiveThirtyEight tipping-point list. It has a 6 percent chance of providing the decisive electoral vote, according to the model, against just a 2 percent chance for Florida.
Pennsylvania is close to being a must-win state for Mr. Obama, as Florida is for Mr. Romney. If Mr. Obama lost it, then even winning a number of other states -- including, for example, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Hampshire, as in the map below -- might not suffice to give him a winning path. (This particular combination of states would result in a 270-268 Electoral College win for Mr. Romney, for example.)
The reason that the forecast model views Pennsylvania as being more important than Florida is slightly more subtle than this, however. 
Both states offer high upside for the candidates. But Mr. Romney has more incentive to pursue the high-risk path in Pennsylvania because his alternatives are worse, meaning that his opportunity costs are lower. 
Mr. Romney certainly doesn't need Pennsylvania to win the election, but going for broke there is arguably a better strategy for him than having to pick off four or five states where they are now tied or where Mr. Obama holds a small lead. 
Mr. Obama, conversely, just needs to hold his ground in those same states. Trying to pull Florida back into his column would represent a heavier lift -- and probably an inferior strategy given the recent polls there.

HEADLINE: Ryan Campaigns in Coal Country

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Paul D. Ryan's appearance in Pennsylvania, added late into an existing trip to eastern Ohio, could be a sign that his strategists believe the campaign has stronger prospects there than once thought. 

 BODY:
MOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. - Black and gold threatened to outshine the campaign staples of red, white and blue during Representative Paul D. Ryan's swing through coal country on Saturday, whether it was the yellow leaves burning through the mountain fog or the "Terrible Towels" that his supporters twirled above their heads. Normally a sign of support for the Pittsburgh Steelers, the towels distributed in an airport hangar just outside the city were instead emblazoned with the team of Romney-Ryan.
There were not enough towels for all of the more than 800 people who turned out to see Mr. Ryan on Saturday morning, so many instead held signs that read "Pennsylvania Believes" (in the usual color scheme). Mr. Ryan's appearance in Pennsylvania - added late into an existing trip to eastern Ohio - could be a sign that his strategists believe the campaign has stronger prospects there than once thought. 
"Pennsylvania is going to send Mitt Romney to the White House," he told the crowd shortly after entering amid chants of "Here we go, Ryan, here we go!"
Mr. Romney's standing does appear to be creeping up, as polls show the gap between him and President Obama narrowing.
"He's here because they understand that Pennsylvania's in play," said Senator Patrick J. Toomey as he introduced Mr. Ryan.
A Republican elected in 2010, Mr. Toomey predicted that the Republican ticket would win Pennsylvania.
"We have a victory in reach that is not yet in hand," Mr. Toomey said. 
He urged the crowd to reach out to the "hundreds of thousands, if not more, Democrats and independents who share our values" and might be open to persuasion.
Conveniently for Dan Shepherd, his wife, Lynn, is one of those independent voters. She voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary, and John McCain in the general election that year. This time she went with Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, in the G.O.P. primary, and especially after the debates, she is leaning strongly toward the Romney-Ryan ticket, but she wanted to hear Mr. Ryan talk about their economic plan.
"I want to make sure it's not just smoke and mirrors," said Ms. Shepherd, whose son in college worries about getting a job after graduation and whose daughter in high school wonders about paying for college.
The front page of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette illustrated the complicated choice for Pennsylvania voters. The state's September jobless rate "eclipses" the national average, declared one headline. (Democrats blamed the Republican governor for the 8.2 percent figure, while Mr. Ryan told the crowd that the president's energy policy was costing thousands of jobs.) 
Another story, reprinted from The Los Angeles Times, said, "No evidence of al-Qaida role in Libya attack" - adding fuel to the debate over whether the White House was straightforward about what was known about the attack on Sept. 11 in Benghazi.
And at the bottom of the front page was an ad for the event that Mr. Ryan would attend next, 75 miles away through the Ohio Valley. In Belmont, Ohio, Mr. Ryan urged nearly a thousand rain-soaked supporters to vote early in a state whose dominant political color is indisputably purple.
An earlier version of this post misstated Pennsylvania unemployment rate. It is 8.2 percent, not 8.6.

HIGHLIGHT: How does the election look from the search window? 

 BODY:
Every election season, pollsters try to figure out the demographic makeup of the electorate in an election that hasn't happened yet. And every election season, pollsters are greeted with charges that their estimates are wrong. Republicans criticize 2012 polls that assume that African-American turnout will remain at its 2008 level. Democrats criticize 2012 polls that assume African-American turnout will be lower than it was. And that's just one demographic group.
It's hard to predict voter turnout because people are reluctant to admit that they will not vote. How reluctant? One recent estimate suggests that as many as two-thirds of people who will end up not voting tell pollsters that they will.
In my work in economics, I use anonymous, aggregate data from millions of Google searches in hundreds of media markets in the United States to measure variables on sensitive topics - racism, drug dealing and child abuse, for example - where people tend to be less forthcoming in surveys (to put it mildly).
My research suggests that by comparing Google search rates for voting information so far this year with search rates on comparable dates from previous elections, we might already be able to get a pretty good idea of the composition of the 2012 electorate.
Despite the ubiquity of Google searching, and searchers' demonstrated willingness to share their true feelings and unbridled thoughts on Google, what Americans are typing when they search remains surprisingly underutilized in political analysis. But Google can often offer insights unavailable elsewhere.
Some of what we learn is pretty silly. Every month, about 5,000 people ask Google about Mitt Romney's underwear choice (devout Mormons wear temple garments). But some of what we learn is disturbing. On Election Day in 2008, roughly 1 in 100 searches that included "Obama" also included "KKK" or "nigger."
Our thoughts are often superficial. "Paul Ryan shirtless" is currently Googled 9 times more often than "Paul Ryan budget." Don't ask me why, but "Paul Ryan shirtless" is Googled more frequently in blue states than in red. When we search for "Michelle Obama," we include the word "ugly" three times as often as the word "beautiful."
Politicians can map the geography of their popularity by looking at what they're called on Google. "Obama" is Googled more frequently in blue states, but "Barack Hussein Obama" is Googled more often in red states - just as "Willard Mitt Romney" is in the blue states.
How frequently people in a state searched for "Obama jokes" almost perfectly predicted the vote share of Mr. Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain. "Romney jokes," which typically focus on his wealth, are popular in Iowa and Ohio, two swing states in which Mr. Romney has struggled to connect with working-class voters. Never mind favorability; maybe what we need is a jokeability index.
Google search data also give some evidence suggesting that last-minute rumors had negative effects in the 2008 election. There were a number of states, like Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kentucky, in which Mr. Obama slightly underperformed in the final polls. Google search data offer one rather interesting correlation: these states had some of the largest search volumes for "Obama Muslim." And those searches, while not uncommon throughout the summer and early fall, rose substantially in the final days of the campaign, after many of the final polls were conducted.
Comparing the timing of our Google searches to outside events is often intriguing. Searches for "McCain life expectancy" rose to unprecedented levels the day of his controversial choice of the Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. They rose again after Ms. Palin's poorly received interview with Katie Couric.
Google data may also help us predict the composition of the 2012 electorate. Individuals may systematically deceive pollsters regarding their intentions, but actual voters are far more likely to Google phrases like "how to vote" or "where to vote" before an election.
By the middle of October, taking the frequency with which Google searches include "vote" or "voting" and comparing the number to those from the same days four years earlier strongly predicts where turnout will rise, stay the same or fall. If search rates for voting information were higher in the first half of October 2008 than in the first half of October 2004, voting rates tended to be higher in 2008 than in 2004. It's true for midterm elections, too. If search rates for voting information were higher in the first half of October 2010 than in the first half of October 2006, voting rates tended to be higher in 2010 than in 2006.
This predictive power was significantly stronger than that of other variables we might use to predict area-level turnout, like changes in registration rates or movement in early voting.
By comparing changes in search volume to area-level demographics, we can use this information to make predictions about turnout rates among different demographic groups.
To see how this works, consider what Google search data would have shown us by this time in 2008. Search rates for voting information that month were slightly lower than they were in October 2004. However, states in which Google searches were higher than they were four years earlier were overwhelmingly the states with some of the highest African-American populations -North Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. Within states, media markets with higher African-American populations - places like the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina, Augusta, Ga., and Jackson, Miss. - saw the biggest increases in voting-related searches from October 2004 to October 2008. The Jackson media market, with a 47 percent African-American population, saw a 56 percent increase.
An analysis of Google search data, in other words, would have made the unsurprising, and ultimately correct, prediction that black turnout was going to be substantially higher in 2008 than it was in 2004.
This methodology would have also correctly predicted a slight increase in Hispanic turnout. While the relationship was not nearly as strong as it was among African-Americans, parts of the country with greater Hispanic populations were Googling for voting information at elevated rates in 2008 compared with 2004.
Google search data, in October 2008, would not have predicted major changes in the age composition of the electorate. Before the election, some were claiming that Mr. Obama's presence on the ticket would lead to a substantial increase in youth turnout. However, in October, the media markets with the greatest proportion of individuals between the ages of 18 and 34 - Gainesville, Fla., and Salt Lake City, for example - were not Googling for voting information at significantly elevated rates. Youth turnout did not rise as much as it was expected to in 2008.
So what does Google suggest about 2012 this far into October? There is little evidence for a 2012 electorate significantly more favorable to Democrats or Republicans than the one that obtained in 2008. The data suggest that turnout, as always, will be elevated in some parts of the United States and depressed in others. Interestingly, turnout might be expected to be higher in Ohio in 2012 than it was in 2004 or 2008.
Of course, there are still two weeks of searches to come. And the methodology I am using is new and subject to many caveats. But the differences we see so far do not appear to predict large changes in demographics that might substantially affect the outcome of the election.
Areas with the largest black populations are, on average, Googling for voting information at rates similar to those of 2008, rather than 2004, levels. By this metric, it does seem that pollsters should assume a black share of the electorate similar to that of 2008, when African-Americans made up an estimated 12 percent of the electorate, rather than 2004, when it was 11 percent - a good sign for Mr. Obama.
There is nice news for Mitt Romney in the Google data, too: voting searches are higher in Idaho Falls and Salt Lake City, the two media markets with the largest Mormon populations. While neither Idaho nor Utah is a swing state, increased Mormon turnout might help Mr. Romney somewhat in two important swing states: Nevada (7 percent Mormon) and Colorado (3 percent Mormon).
Mr. Romney's supporters might also be pleased with the search rates for voting information in some areas with high evangelical populations. Google data predict that Lubbock, Tex., and Paducah, Ky., for example, may see increased turnout. This might alleviate the concern among Republicans that evangelical voters will turn out in lower numbers because of suspicions about Mr. Romney's Mormon faith or his lack of commitment to conservative social causes.
The Google data offer little evidence for any big changes in the age composition of the electorate: there is also not a meaningful change in voting-information search rates in areas with a high proportion of individuals 18 to 34, who tend to support Mr. Obama, or individuals 65 and older, who generally lean toward Mr. Romney.
Search rates thus far in October 2012, compared to the same days in October 2008, are a bit lower in areas with larger Hispanic populations. While Mr. Obama is more popular among Hispanics than Mr. Romney, the size of the correlation does not, as of yet, present a huge concern for Mr. Obama. Monitoring the data over the next two weeks, not to mention looking at Spanish-language voting searches, might tell us if this should become a significantly larger concern for his campaign.
Mr. Obama's opponents hope that the 2012 electorate will be less favorable to Democrats, more like the 2004 electorate. My early analysis of Google search data says: don't count on it.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton in Green Bay

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: He delivered the dream speech of a policy wonk, but never assumed the details would bore a general audience. 

 BODY:
GREEN BAY, Wis. - Get-out-the-vote events are usually as full of substance as high school pep rallies. But the guest speaker had other plans.
Bill Clinton took the stage at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay on Friday night and delivered an hour-long education in the real issues at stake in this election. He talked about Medicaid and financial reform and the student loan system with an appreciation for the granular not usually displayed by the man he was stumping for, President Obama.
It was the dream speech of a policy wonk, but Mr. Clinton never assumed that the details would bore a general audience, and they did not. The 2,200 people packed into the Kress Events Center - mostly students, whose flagging enthusiasm Mr. Obama desperately needs in this contested swing state - soaked up the details, laughing and applauding through discussions of derivatives, visibly grateful for a speaker who didn't condescend to them with the usual platitudes.

All his familiar rhetorical devices were there: the mustering of vast quantities of numbers and statistics to convey gravity, the bent-finger wagging, the dramatic flares like "I want you to listen to this." They were put to use for what he called "a little walk down fact lane," as he eviscerated some of the Romney-Ryan ticket's "greatest hits."
One was their plan to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which, he explained, addressed the problems that led to the 2008 meltdown. After a tour of the law's restrictions on trading of toxic derivatives, he noted that one of its most important provisions is one that Mitt Romney continues to oppose: "It says if these big banks crater again, there will be no bailout, there will be a structured orderly bankruptcy process," he said. "And this time mangers and shareholders will have to eat a lot of the losses."
Given Mr. Obama's record on the economy, he said, the election shouldn't even be close. "The only reason it is," he said, "is that Americans are impatient, they want things done the day before yesterday, and they don't understand why the economy is not totally hunky-dory again." That process, he said, would take at least seven or eight years.
He said, as he did at the Democratic National Convention, that Mr. Romney's plan to slash Medicaid and dump it on the states would hurt many middle-class nursing home patients who have no other way to pay for their care, and would be particularly hard on families with disabled or chronically ill children.
"They say this is not our problem, it's a state problem," he said. "Well, yes it is. They're all our children."
And he won a roar of approval from the students in the crowd when he blasted the Republican ticket for proposing to undo Mr. Obama's change to the student loan program. Now payments are based on a graduate's income.
"They want to repeal that," he said. "I can't make this up. I know it's hard to believe, but they want to give $60 billion to the bankers, raise the cost of student loans, raise the college dropout rate, and not guarantee Pell grants."
But he hadn't forgotten the purpose of the rally. The student loan issue alone, he said, was a reason for every student in Wisconsin to vote for President Obama. As he noted, early voting starts on Monday.

HEADLINE: Oct. 20: Calm Day in Forecast, but Volatility Ahead

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The FiveThirtyEight forecast is unchanged, but although something like a half-point shift is hard to detect in the polls, it is also potentially meaningful given how late it is in the race and how close the contest is. 

 BODY:
The FiveThirtyEight forecast is unchanged for Saturday, with President Obama maintaining a 67.9 percent chance of winning the Electoral College.
You'd have to stretch to find much in Saturday's national polls that would change your view about the condition of the race. Mr. Obama gained ground in three daily tracking surveys - from Public Policy Polling, Investor's Business Daily and United Press International - but lost ground in two others, from Ipsos and Rasmussen Reports.
The Gallup national tracking poll continues to diverge from the consensus and show a six-point lead for Mitt Romney among likely voters; Mr. Romney gained one point in the version of the survey among registered voters on Saturday.
Saturday's battleground state polls provided for a bit more action, but some of the numbers aren't quite as good for the candidates as they might appear on the surface.
Polls by Grove Insight, for example, had Mr. Obama with a three-point lead in both Florida and Wisconsin. But Grove Insight has had strongly Democratic-leaning numbers in its recent surveys, and these polls are about what you might expect given that tendency.
A SurveyUSA poll showing Mr. Obama with a one-point lead in Florida is really the slightly better result for him. Even so, Florida has had some very dense polling, so it will take quite a lot of evidence to push the model much off its current take on the race there, which projects a win for Mr. Romney by about two percentage points.
If a candidate holds a two-point lead in the polling average in a state, it's going to be pretty normal to see a few polls showing a tied race or his opponent up by a point or two, along with others that show him up ahead by a margin in the mid-single digits. That's pretty much what we see right now among the higher-quality polls of Florida, with Mr. Romney retaining the overall advantage.
The best number of the day for Mr. Romney was almost certainly the Public Policy Polling survey of Ohio, which had him down by one point there - improved from a five-point deficit in a poll they conducted there last week.
If this had been the only poll of the day in Ohio, Mr. Romney would probably have made an Electoral College gain on that basis, since the forecast is very sensitive to anything in Ohio.
There was another Ohio poll, however, from Gravis Marketing, which showed a tied race. Isn't that an even better result for Mr. Romney?
Not in this case, because Gravis Marketing polls have had a Republican lean of two or three percentage points this cycle. (Their prior poll of Ohio had shown Mr. Romney up by about one point.)
The FiveThirtyEight model adjusts for these "house effects" and so treats the Gravis Marketing poll as equivalent to showing a two- or three-point lead for Mr. Obama.
It also adjusts the Public Policy Polling survey of Ohio slightly downward for Mr. Obama - but Public Policy Polling has lost most of the strong Democratic lean that it had earlier in the cycle, and it has even been on Mr. Romney's side of the consensus in a few states like Iowa and New Hampshire. We now calculate their house effect as being only about half a percentage point in favor of Mr. Obama.
Still, if Saturday's polls were something of a wash, it's also hard to make the case that the polls have moved much toward Mr. Obama since Tuesday night's debate in New York.
Mr. Obama now holds a popular vote lead of one percentage point in the FiveThirtyEight "now-cast," an estimate based on both state and national surveys. He led by 0.8 percentage points by the same measure before the debate.
Although many of the surveys that are influencing the forecast preceded the debate, meaning that it will take another day or two before we can close the book on its effects, at the very least it seems clear that Mr. Obama will not see anything like the sharp break toward Mr. Romney that followed the first debate in Denver.
A gain of two or three points for Mr. Obama in the polls, for instance, would very probably have become obvious by now. Perhaps the debate was worth a half a point or a full point for Mr. Obama - these trends would be more difficult to distinguish from statistical noise - but it probably wasn't worth much more than that.
What makes this challenging is that although something like a half-point shift is hard to detect in the polls, it is also potentially meaningful given how late it is in the race and how close the contest is.
The most natural analogy might be to a baseball game. Scoring a run in the first inning is worth something, but it won't shift the win probabilities all that much: there's too much that can happen later on in the game.
We're now in the political equivalent of the eighth inning, however. A run scored in the eight inning is potentially much more important than one in the first.
The reason I say "potentially" is that it makes a tremendous difference depending what the score is. In a blowout, the eighth inning won't matter at all. A team down 9-1 is almost certainly going to lose; but so will one that gets a solo home run and trails 9-2 instead.
(The political equivalent: Walter Mondale, in 1984, improved to a 17-point deficit from a 20-point deficit in national polls after his first debate with Ronald Reagan. This may have helped him to carry his home state of Minnesota, and lose the Electoral College 525-13 rather than 535-3.)
But if the score is tied, or if it's a one-run game, a run scored in the eighth will make a huge difference.
That's where we find ourselves right now in the presidential race. This election is close and is likely to end up that way. There's about a 50-50 chance that the election will end up within 2.5 percentage points, according to the forecast, against only a 15 percent chance that either candidate will win by five points or more.
For this reason, the percentage estimates in the forecast are likely to be volatile from here on out.
Early in the year, we'd treat as a pretty big deal if a candidate's Electoral College win probability increased by a percentage point or more (for instance, to 63 percent from 62 percent). Now, changes like that are going to be fairly common, and there will often be larger shifts. Thursday, for example, was a good but hardly spectacular day for Mr. Obama in the polls, and that was enough to produce about a 5 percent swing toward him. Friday, however, brought a 2 percent shift back toward Mr. Romney, despite polling that seemed fairly mixed on the surface.
There are some other reasons the forecast is likely to become more volatile over these final two weeks. The FiveThirtyEight forecast is technically a combination of a polling-based model and a "fundamentals" model based on economic statistics and Mr. Obama's incumbency status.
The forecast is also designed, however, to weight the economic component less and less as time goes on, eventually defaulting to a purely poll-based model by Election Day. (The guiding principle behind this is simply that voters' views of the economy should be priced into the polling by late in the race.) Although the economic component of the model is dynamic - it can change as new economic statistics are released - it is generally less volatile than the polling component. (While there have been some ups and downs in the economic numbers, nothing has changed the basic story of an economy that is recovering, but slowly.) So as the polling component comes to predominate, the overall forecast will become more volatile as well.
Also, the model is designed to be more aggressive about buying into a potential change in the polls in the closing stages of the race.
Most people's intuition will lead them to overstate the volatility in the presidential race. Furthermore, they often do so for the wrong reasons - because they pay too much attention to one or two outlier polls rather than to the consensus evidence.
On the other hand, because we are often now getting 20 polls on a given day - instead of two or three - there is potentially more evidence to testify to a statistically meaningful change in the race if it is reflected in the polling consensus.
Furthermore, it is now late enough in the race that news events that produce what would ordinarily be a temporary "bounce" in the polls could carry forward to Election Day.
The writer Jazz Shaw joked recently, for instance, that he didn't think Mr. Romney's bounce from his debate in Denver would persist for more than another four weeks - just long enough, of course, that it might be enough to win him the election on Nov. 6.
Perhaps in some abstract sense, this is true. If Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama debated another 10 times, and the election were held next March, the Denver debate would be discounted by voters. But it won't be such a distant memory when voters go to the polls in 17 days.

HEADLINE: A Cab Tailored to Wheelchair Users

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
FOR 15 years, Amarjit Singh has worked in relative anonymity, driving his 12-hour shifts in a New York City yellow cab. Now he is the taxi industry's version of a rock star, thanks to his MV-1, the only purpose-built wheelchair-accessible medallion cab in the city.
Since May, when Mr. Singh began driving the MV-1 that he owns with his brother, Vikrant, tourists have snapped photos and customers have deluged him with questions about its spacious interior and smooth ride. Other drivers have asked about its fuel economy, repair record and how it withstands New York's pocked streets. 
''When I go to the airport, I have to prepare myself to be interviewed,'' Mr. Singh, who starts his shift at Kennedy International Airport, said with a chuckle. ''Sometimes a taxi driver will drive up and ask me about this car and what kind it is.''
Mr. Singh, though sheepish about his sudden notoriety, tells all comers that the MV-1 has a solid frame that provides a smooth ride, that its V-8 engine provides plenty of pickup and that it maneuvers well on the city's crowded streets. And by ordering his MV-1 outfitted to run on compressed natural gas, he had cut his daily fuel expenses by about a third compared with his previous cab, a Dodge Caravan.
The MV-1 has received high grades from mobility advocates working to improve taxi accessibility. Among its strengths is the positioning of the wheelchair ramp, which extends from the right side of the vehicle to the curb, a more convenient arrangement than a rear ramp.
''Everyone I know who's ridden in an MV-1 says it's a very smooth ride,'' said Jean Ryan, vice president for public affairs at Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York, who has tried out the cab's ramp. ''I think it would be a great taxi, and for Access-a-Ride,'' the by-appointment program of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
There are only 233 wheelchair-accessible medallion taxi cabs in the city, so finding one can be tough. For riders with disabilities, cabs like Mr. Singh's hold the potential that one day they will be able to hail a cab on the street instead of reserving a ride in advance.
The arrival of a fleet of wheelchair-accessible cabs like the MV-1 may be years away, though.
This spring, the Taxi and Limousine Commission chose the Nissan NV200 as the Taxi of Tomorrow, the vehicle owners must buy, starting next year, when they replace their cabs. The Nissan has been billed as roomier and safer, but retrofitting one to carry a wheelchair costs about $14,000.
John Walsh, chief executive of Vehicle Production Group, maker of the MV-1, said his vehicle was a more efficient solution. Built at the plant in Mishawaka, Ind., where Hummers were once made, the MV-1 does not need to be converted for access. Ford supplies 130 components of the MV-1, including the engine and transmission, so spare parts should be readily available.
''Ours is the taxi of today, it can be ordered and delivered,'' said Mr. Walsh.
Acceptance of the MV-1 is hindered by its cost, even to owner-drivers like Mr. Singh who have taken advantage of the lower cost of wheelchair-access medallions. While a new cab typically costs about $30,000, Mr. Singh paid $56,000 for his MV-1, he said, including $10,000 for the fuel system conversion to compressed natural gas.
As part of the accessibility conversion, he had to remove a jump seat, leaving only three seats for passengers -- a factor that costs him some fares. And while Mr. Singh saves on fuel, compressed natural gas is sold at few stations, so he must drive farther to fill up.
The city hopes to sell 2,000 more medallions for wheelchair-accessible yellow cabs and up to an additional 3,600 taxi permits for wheelchair-acccessible vehicles for use outside Manhattan. A lawsuit by taxi fleet owners has prevented the sales, though. In addition, the city created a dispatch service that lets riders call for a wheelchair-accessible yellow cab using a smartphone app, a Web site, a text message or a voice call.
At least in New York, it may be paratransit agencies that lead the way in buying the MV-1 to take advantage of its sturdiness and maneuverability. A fleet of 30 is being tested by the Access-a-Ride program, which is looking to replace its 1,400 retrofitted vans.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The featured speaker before the Kiwanis Club of Birmingham was Judge Roy S. Moore, well known for having lost his job as the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court after setting up a two-and-a-half-ton granite monument of the Ten Commandments in the courthouse rotunda.
Calling the United States Constitution a ''restriction on the fallen nature of man'' and quoting Thomas Jefferson, George Washington and Gen. Douglas MacArthur, among others, Judge Moore was making his case as the Republican nominee, once again, for the state's highest judicial office.
It was not exactly a plea for harmony and unity. There is a great moral divide in the country, he said, a division ''not just between Democrats and Republicans, but between Republicans and Republicans.'' 
There are plenty of Republicans in the state who may take issue with the particulars of Judge Moore's overall message, but on that last part they would agree.
Many in the Alabama business and legal establishment, a community that is overwhelmingly and faithfully Republican, are privately despondent over the prospect of a Moore victory and its effect on the state's image. Some are the same people who spent the last year quietly lobbying the governor and state lawmakers to tone down Alabama's strict immigration enforcement law, with limited success.
Like many other urban and suburban Republicans across the Deep South, they consider economic growth, not social issues, the priority. That motivated their longtime efforts to help create a Republican-controlled South.
''You've got to be careful what you wish for,'' said Tom Ingram, a Republican political consultant in Tennessee.
As the South is settling in once again to an era of one-party dominance, many Republicans are learning that governing is not quite the same as campaigning, and that total control does not always equal total agreement.
''I've been in politics for 30 years, and I saw firsthand after I was elected the split within the Democratic Party,'' said Eric Johnson, who was in the Georgia legislature for 15 years. ''Now you've got the rural conservative Republicans and the suburban moderates and libertarians. I don't think you have as broad an ideological split as the former Democratic majority had, but you certainly have a broader one than the Republicans are used to.''
It is hard to find anyone who believes that the different currents within the Republican Party will lead to anything like the battling factions that characterized the old one-party Democratic rule. Even before the civil rights era irreparably fractured Southern Democrats, the party was a collection of divergent and sometimes contradictory agendas, often pitting populists against conservatives.
But students of politics in the South have long predicted that similar, though less pronounced, fissures would develop when the Republicans gained dominance, said Glen Browder, a former Democratic congressman from Alabama and an emeritus professor of political science at Jacksonville State University.
Since the rise of the evangelical right, there has been a divide in the party between ''the chamber and the church,'' he said, or between the Chamber of Commerce interests that were once the heartbeat of Southern Republicans and the more populist, socially conservative electorate that fueled the party's rise to power. With a one-party South, the chamber element has learned that while they may have the money and the history, the social conservatives have the votes.
''It was easy for the business community to be a leading voice when they were a minority voice and trying to establish themselves,'' Professor Browder said, adding that the business community would learn to use its leverage with more savvy in future campaigns, when candidates come looking for money.
In Tennessee, where Gov. Bill Haslam's Republican agenda of economic development and education reform has been overshadowed by lawmaker crusades against Shariah law and the teaching of evolution and climate change, fund-raisers are learning this lesson, Mr. Ingram said. Long accustomed to giving money in statewide and federal races, some donors have begun to realize the need to put up money for state legislative races as well.
''Here you've got one party, one set of donors looking at their standard-bearers' agenda and saying: 'The fact that he's got a Republican majority may not be enough. It's got to be the right majority,' '' he said.
The race for Alabama chief justice is a rather extreme version of this dynamic. Among the lawyers and reliably Democratic groups in the campaign finance records of Mr. Moore's opponent, Judge Robert S. Vance Jr. of State Circuit Court, are a number of surprising names.
There is, for example, the Alabama chapter of the Associated Builders and Contractors, with a $5,000 donation. Since 2004, over 90 percent of its donations in state races have gone to Republicans.
''While ABC of AL traditionally supports Republican pro-business candidates, we feel Judge Vance is the most qualified candidate for the chief justice of the Supreme Court,'' Tim Hightower, a member of the group's executive committee, wrote in an e-mail. ''Is this a trend we are seeing among other associations in the state? Most certainly.''
Judge Moore's victory in the primary was a shock to many, because his opponents were well-regarded by both Republicans and Democrats and because he was badly beaten in his two runs for governor.
Judge Moore's initial Democratic opponent was a lawyer named Harry Lyon, who has run for offices on both party lines and was the only Democrat to qualify. Mr. Lyon proceeded to insult gay people as ''freaks,'' jokingly suggest the execution of illegal immigrants and call Judge Moore a demented devil worshiper.
This ultimately became too much for the state Democratic Party, which in August revoked Mr. Lyon's nomination. The party then backed Judge Vance, who entered the race late but whose name is prominent in state legal circles: his father, a federal judge and an early advocate of the civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1989 when a vengeful ex-convict sent a mail bomb to his home.
After entering the race, Judge Vance quickly raised nearly a half-million dollars, much of it from donors within his hometown, Birmingham.
Judge Moore has kept pace, and while he can count on some big-money benefactors (including the wife of the actor Chuck Norris, who gave $5,000), many of his donations are coming in small amounts from all over the country, $100 or $200 contributions from California, Maine, New York, Wyoming, even Hawaii.
In conversation, supporters tend to agree with his description of a basic divide in the country's moral life and say he is on the correct side of that divide, even if they do not always like his methods.
''I don't think the judicial system is really the place to promote any sort of religion,'' said Calvin Poole, a lawyer in Greenville. But he said he still considered Judge Moore better than the alternative -- that is, the Democrat.
''If we've got to pick between Image A and Image B, I would rather for our image to be that we're going to be outspoken and unapologetic on our view on the sovereignty of God,'' Mr. Poole said. ''I'd rather be wacky on that side than wacky on the other side.''

HEADLINE: Replying, Across Centuries, To a Theologian's Allegory

BYLINE: By MARTHA SCHWENDENER

 BODY:
A show at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Harbor last fall featured a portfolio of Francisco Goya's ''Los Caprichos'' etchings from 1799 exhibited alongside several prints by contemporary artists who had made their own versions of some of the prints. This fall, a show at the Heckscher Museum of Art in Huntington reverses that scenario by showcasing ''Robert S. Neuman's Ship to Paradise,'' a series of contemporary etchings and lithographs that respond to ''The Ship of Fools,'' a text written by the theologian Sebastian Brandt (1457-1521).
Brandt's work, written in German and published in Basel, Switzerland, in 1494, was an allegory in 112 chapters that outlined the vices keeping humans from reaching salvation and Paradise. Like Goya's series of etchings 300 years later, ''The Ship of Fools'' was deeply critical of the excesses and abuses of the Roman Catholic Church. (The ''ship'' in the title was a pun on the Latin ''navis'' or central ''nave'' of Western European church architecture, which mimicked the shape of a ship.) Brandt further borrowed the device of the fool, who was allowed to utter criticism without getting into serious trouble. 
More important for visual artists, the woodcuts accompanying Brandt's satirical allegory were the first commissioned works created by Albrecht Drer, one of Europe's great Renaissance printmakers. Drer's and Mr. Neuman's projects are as different as one might expect, given the gap of about 500 years. And yet, Mr. Neuman, like Drer, is a specialist in the printmaking medium: trained at what was then the California College of Arts and Crafts in the early 1950s, he actually bought the school's lithographic press -- although he sold it after receiving a Fulbright fellowship and heading off to Germany.
Mr. Neuman's ''Ship to Paradise'' series has one other major connection to Drer: the etchings are related to a commission by August Heckscher, grandson of the museum's founder, who operated a printing press in Maine. Small etchings were included with Heckscher's publication ''The Shyp of Fooles,'' a 1983 edition of Alexander Barclay's 1509 English translation of Brandt's work that featured Drer's woodcuts.
The current show at the Heckscher includes larger lithographs and etchings from Mr. Neuman's series, displayed alongside preliminary drawings and several metal etching plates. Befitting the work of an artist living in coastal Maine, just outside Acadia National Park, the prints take somewhat seriously the idea of a nautical ''Ship to Paradise.'' And yet, it is a secular and 20th-century understanding of the ''ship,'' rather than Brandt's Reformation-era religious one, with fragments of Maine's rocky coast present alongside images that conjure space travel or the drug trips of the 1960s.
One of the earliest works in the show, ''Ship to Paradise -- 3'' (1977), suggests a celestial ship or a meteor crashing through the sky. In the center, set against a black ground, is a rushing field of energy made up of lines and pinwheeling circles, and a column that suggests a ship's mast, but breaks off into different angles. Throughout the etchings there is a play between abstraction and representation, and you can detect the vestiges of pioneering abstractionists like Wassily Kandinsky, Surrealists like Mir and the New York School artist Arshile Gorky.
Other works suggest 1960s alternative comics and visionary architectural schematics. ''Ship to Paradise -- 4'' (1980) looks like an exploding vessel hovering in a field of yellow above what might be a town, drawn in triangle and pyramid shapes. With its fantastic, nonutilitarian appearance, the ''ship'' looks like some kind of imaginary-architecture model drawn by members of Archigram, or projects combining earthworks and ecosystems, like those of Juan Downey or Robert Smithson. Look closer, however, and an oar sticking out of the vessel connects it with our notion of a seafaring ship.
The other historical work that is often mentioned in conjunction with Brandt and Drer is Hieronymous Bosch's ''Ship of Fools'' (1510-1515), an oil-on-wood panel that Bosch created, possibly after Drer's frontispiece, which is now in the Louvre. In his essay accompanying the publication of ''The Shyp of Fooles/Ship to Paradise'' (the Brandt-Drer book and Mr. Neuman's prints were packaged together in August Heckscher's edition), which is reprinted in the current catalog, John C. Olin mused on Brandt's quotation of Psalm 107 from the Bible, which told of people who ''became fools through their rebellious ways,'' but eventually ''cried out to the Lord'' when they found themselves in a tempest.
Mr. Olin suggests a modern update in the poetry of W. B. Yeats, who wrote: ''Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,/the blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere/The ceremony of innocence is drowned.''
Slightly later prints from ''Ship to Paradise'' conjure the ambiguous, chaotic setup of Bosch's ''Ship of Fools,'' mixed with a modern understanding of abstract composition. ''Ship to Paradise (Tow),'' from around 1980, is mostly abstract -- but then a tow truck appears at the right-hand edge of the picture, like a Pop Art emissary dragging the whole Kandinsky-inspired composition off a cliff. In the end, Mr. Neuman's series of etchings does not do what is traditionally modernist, as Mr. Olin suggests, but what is essentially postmodernist: it skitters between different art monuments and moments of history, mixing and borrowing at will -- although Mr. Neuman's work is much more expressive and handcrafted than the celebrated forms of postmodernism that relied on a theory-driven or ironic analysis of mediums and messages.
Attempting to make sense of his work -- as writers and viewers are wont to do -- Lisa Chalif, the Heckscher curator, said in the catalog that Mr. Neuman's ''cautionary tale is as appropriate to our modern-day world of global economic challenge and political strife as Brandt's was five centuries ago.'' But with its unbridled drawing and visionary color, ''Ship to Paradise'' is also an argument for being artistically idiosyncratic and incautious.
''Robert S. Neuman's Ship to Paradise'' is at the Heckscher Museum of Art, 2 Prime Avenue, Huntington, through Nov. 25. Information: (631) 351-3250 or heckscher.org.

HEADLINE: Luxury Condos, Some Cloaked In Tradition

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM

 BODY:
BROOKLYN HEIGHTS, that enclave of impeccably restored brownstones lining narrow, leafy streets, has long been immune to the buzzy changes washing over communities beyond its borders. The local tone is set by entrenched institutions like the 102-year-old Brooklyn Heights Association and the even more august Brooklyn Heights Casino, whose tennis courts can be used as a ballroom and whose squash courts have spawned generations of talented young players.
But thanks in part to a more buoyant economy, changes are nibbling at the neighborhood's edges, particularly in the area residents call the north Heights. Although most of Brooklyn Heights falls within a historic district, the city's first, half a dozen projects that will bring pockets of luxury accommodations are moving through the pipeline. Prospective residents are being drawn by good schools and easy access to downtown Manhattan. Also in the works are new and refurbished hotel rooms, notably in the century-old Bossert Hotel, one of Brooklyn's most storied buildings. 
Four of the projects are on or just off Henry Street, the commercial strip that has traditionally played second fiddle to Montague Street, the neighborhood's main drag. The first to open its doors will be 20 Henry Street, at Middagh Street, where Canyon-Johnson Urban Fund is developing 38 luxury condominiums ranging from studios ($450,000 apiece) to four-bedrooms ($2.7 million) in the Peaks Mason Mints candy factory.
The project actually consists of two structures. One is the 1885 factory, which retains its original red-brick facade, exposed buttresses, oversized arched windows and chunky white ''Peaks Mason Mints'' lettering. The other, on the former courtyard, is a new building that will have floor-to-ceiling windows and garden penthouses.
''It's more like a Dumbo project, except it's in Brooklyn Heights,'' said Steven Rutter, the managing director of Stribling Marketing and Associates, who is handling the sales. The apartments will be relentlessly modern, with accents like teak vanities and free-standing soaking tubs. But the main lobby will resonate with echoes of the past.
''You'll be able to see some of the Southern white pine that was used when they built the place,'' Mr. Rutter said. ''And it's backlighted, so you can see the original sap.'' He keeps a chunk of the wood on his desk, ''because it makes a good paperweight.''
Among the residents who will start arriving later this year are Navin Chawla, who lives in Dumbo with his wife, Allison, and their 8-month-old daughter. ''I used to stroll by the site and then started doing research online,'' said Mr. Chawla, who is preparing to enter medical school. ''I liked that it was near the subway and near P.S. 8. And I liked that the building was modern but still had an old Brooklyn Heights feel.''
Echoes of the 19th century will also be felt next door at 30 Henry Street, where construction has begun on a ruddy brick building, accented with black wrought-iron Juliet balconies, that will contain five floor-through condominiums. A feature being touted in this parking-challenged neighborhood is a robotlike facility in the basement known as an A.G.V. (automated guided vehicles) garage, which stores and retrieves cars without human intervention. According to Harry Kendall, a partner of BKSK Architects, the building's designers, ''cars will be automatically whisked away, like a piece of dry cleaning.''
At 72 Poplar Street, a long-unused 100-year-old police station is being converted to a condominium containing 14 family-size apartments, with occupancy scheduled for 2014. David T. Ennis, the principal of the Daten Group, the developer, sees the target audience as ''urban hipsters starting families'' who seek a middle ground between the tradition-bound Heights and cutting-edge Dumbo to the north.
Here, too, the goal is to marry new and old in graceful fashion. ''The block has the feeling of turn-of-the-last-century Brooklyn,'' Mr. Ennis said, noting especially the faux-gaslight street lamps. ''We wanted to respect that.''
A few blocks away at 70 Henry Street, long the home of the Brooklyn Heights Cinema, plans are proceeding for a five-story building that will contain 15 to 17 rental apartments, mostly one-bedrooms, and will incorporate the movie theater in its ground and basement floors. Construction could begin in the spring, according to the designer, Randolph Gerner of Gerner Kronick and Valcarcel Architects.
As for the facade, ''of course it will be brick,'' Mr. Gerner said, in this case reddish-brown brick, along with large steel casement windows intended to impart a loftlike feel. ''We want a building that's appropriate and respectful,'' he added. ''We really want to do the right thing in this neighborhood, and that wouldn't be a 50-story glass tower.''
At Montague and Hicks Streets, work could begin by year's end on the planned conversion of the Bossert Hotel, which for decades stood at the heart of the borough's social life. A 14-story Renaissance Revival building, it is becoming available because the Jehovah's Witnesses, who have owned and operated it since 1983, are selling many of their Brooklyn holdings. The buyer is David Bistricer of Clipper Equity and the Chetrit Group, which plans to transform the Bossert into a boutique hotel with about 300 rooms.
The lobby, with its coffered ceiling and oversized columns topped by elaborate capitals, will be restored to the way it looked when the hotel opened, according to Gene Kaufman, the architect. ''We inherited a fantastic structure,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''It's a reminder of a time when people made ornate buildings. We want to recall that grandeur.''
A very different sort of grandeur will be on display at 60 Furman Street in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Just south of the bridge, Toll Brothers City Living and the Starwood Capital Group plan two mostly glass structures that will house 125 one- to five-bedroom condominium apartments (price tag: $800,000 to $5 million) and 200 hotel rooms. Amenities will include a screening room and, of course, spectacular views. Construction is expected to begin in the spring.
These new projects are arriving with predictable concerns from the community. Will the transformation of the Bossert bring parking problems? Will there be too much construction in the park? And perhaps most important, will these projects alter the neighborhood's character?
The answer to the last question, at least in some minds, is ''not necessarily.''
''It's true that Brooklyn Heights is very much of a community in which people belong to the same institutions, like the casino and the Brooklyn Heights Association,'' said Robert Perris, the district manager of Community Board 2. ''On the other hand, these new projects don't necessarily destroy that. In a way, they simply expand the size of the pie.''

HEADLINE: Don't Tell Dad, I'm Going to Cuba

BYLINE: By ANA HEBRA FLASTER. 
A writer working on a memoir about her family's journey from Cuba to New England.

 BODY:
Lexington, Mass.
I LIED to my father, told him we were on Cape Cod when, in fact, we were bouncing around the battered streets of Havana in our friend Jos's 1953 Chevrolet Deluxe, the one with the new Toyota engine but no working gauges on the dash. Nothing about Cuba is easy. Not the politics, not the crazy convertible peso and definitely not the getting there. But as a Cuban-American trying to connect with the last twigs of our family tree in Havana, the biggest obstacle I faced was my father's disapproval.
My working-class parents originally supported the revolution -- my mother even sold bonds and collected medicine for the rebels. But after it triumphed, politics became the center of life, and the new society demanded daily doses of vigilantism, denunciations and repression of the self. My parents muzzled themselves, applied for permission to leave the country, waited years for it to come, and finally, in 1967, immigrated to the United States. 
Now my 80-year-old father, like many older exiles, vehemently criticizes Cuban-Americans who return. Papi sees each dollar, bar of soap and laser printer we bring back to our families as power flowing into the Castro brothers' hands. When I told him I was considering a trip to Cuba, he fought hard to dissuade me, calling me daily from his home in New Hampshire. ''Don't you see you're keeping those bastards in power? Cuban-Americans threw $4 billion at that economy last year! You're legitimizing their repression! After all we did to get you out, now you want to go back?''
I did. Since I'd left as a 6-year-old, I'd been back only once, in 1999. I wanted to know my cousins. And now that the Obama administration had loosened some travel restrictions, I wanted my husband and son to see where I was from.
For months, Papi and I argued on the phone, over kitchen tables, side by side in cars. When the Cuban P-11 visa I'd applied for last April finally arrived in August, I cooked up a lie to spare him -- and myself -- some pain. If Papi asked for us, I told the 27 members of our family, say we're on Cape Cod, out of cellphone range.
We flew to Havana on one of the charters that brings hundreds of thousands of my cohort to the island every year. Immediately, my cousin Patricia and I fell into the kind of five-day-long conversation we'd spun on my last trip. My Jewish husband and son folded into her buzzing household like natives; in no time they were shirtless in the 95-degree heat, following the other men out to the front porch to sip caf from tiny cups and listen to the chants of street vendors selling sunglasses, ''with bifocals or without!'' I stayed inside with Patricia's kids, facing the fan, building a model of the solar system with Diego and sewing a princess doll for Vernica. Embargo-busting love was in the air.
On our last afternoon, we drove to my old barrio on the outskirts of Havana. Juanelo was never much to look at, but now the houses seemed to lean more than stand, and moldering stucco walls showed their bricks like bones. But the neighbors streamed out of their houses and the kissing began. They fed us stories about my grandparents, aunts and uncles, about my father playing baseball and my mother teaching children to read. The old women smelled of soap and wore clean cotton batas de casa. Holding my hand, Nena, 90 years old, told her daughter to run and get the pictures. The photos showed our family in New Hampshire over the years, photos my grandmother, aunt or mother had sent years ago.
Nena reminded me of an old woman I met at a market on my last trip to Cuba. She was selling necklaces of beans and seeds, coconut shell bracelets, trinkets. We were chatting when she stopped suddenly. ''You're from over there! You didn't forget us! Take anything from my table. My gift. But don't forget us! You see, when the old women there die, and the old women here die, it all ends.''
Of course, nothing will make up for the loss of that generation, but I am more optimistic about the future. As the older people on both sides of the Florida Straits die, so, too, will the bitter passions that helped fuel more than 60 years of stalemate between Cuba and the United States. Cuban-Americans my age are generally more politically flexible than our parents, and our peers in Cuba, despite the state's view of people like me as traitors who abandoned their country, seem curious and open to our return. And just last week, the Cuban government announced that it would change the law on exit visas, making it easier for Cubans to go back and forth between the island and America.
Nonetheless, many of my father's generation will die still waiting for their country to truly change. As their heirs, we face a choice: to focus on score-settling for our parents or to reconnect with and rebuild the Cuba they cherished.
I called my father when we landed in Miami, hoping the 1,300 miles between us might dull the reverb on the line when he heard where we'd really been. Instead, I heard a sigh. ''Mija,'' he said. ''Thank you. Really ... Who did you see?'' The wonder in his voice soothed me, washed me clean. Maybe it wasn't too late for my father, or for Cuba. I could share my treasures with him now, the stories, photos and messages from all my new cousins and the old women who would not forget us.

HEADLINE: 

 BODY:
The cover article last week, ''Board to Buyer: Nah. Not at That Price,'' described how a growing number of co-op boards in Manhattan are rejecting sales if they deem the price of the apartment too low. Following are edited excerpts of reader comments from nytimes.com:
Absolutely crazy. Many NYC co-op boards have long been power mad, but this is really pushing it. A co-op is only sticks and stones and the shareholders thereof, and a particular group of shareholders should not have the right to prop up the prices of their own apartments. What do they think ''market price'' means? 
Maguy, New York
One thing that I think all New Yorkers should know, and many do not, is that co-op boards are a peculiar New York creation. Generally, they do not exist anywhere else in the U.S. Yet, they are accepted as some sort of demi-gods in New York, ruling over who may buy and who may not.
Doug Terry, Maryland, DC Metro area
If this tactic inflates inventory, then ultimately prices will fall even lower; it then becomes a matter of whether boards can continue to resist a tidal wave they contribute to building.
Paul '52, New York, NY
In the co-op in California where my relative lives, there is a minimum sale price (which is quite low) and the board tells you what it is. None of this secrecy.
Uke, New York, NY
When a seller lists the apartment for less than market rate to move it, it impacts the entire co-op -- especially when it's significantly less than market rate. Realtors and buyers use ''comparables.'' So that second-floor apartment which sold for $100K less than market DIRECTLY impacts the ability of others in the same building to sell an apartment for what it's worth.
RoughAcres, New York
These boards should stop denying the realities of the housing market. Just because you would like the market price to be $X doesn't make it so. ...They should stick to ensuring that the buyer will pay maintenance fees reliably and be a good neighbor. If the current shareholder wants to trade his shares for a bag of peanuts, that's his choice.
Bob, NY
Because of the socialist co-op board, Manhattan was largely spared the housing implosion that rocked the rest of the country. When the free-market, capitalist bankers wanted to give out loans to anyone who could make an ''X,'' the co-op boards would not allow their homes to be sold. Foreclosure on a co-op is practically unheard of in New York. They have maintained shareholder value throughout this terrible recession. It seems, as a collective, their judgment is far more sound than the banker's.
Cflapjack, Spokane
New York. Strange planet.
Dean, Los Angeles
One day the board members involved in these shenanigans will want to sell their apartments and will be held hostage.
Steven Kopstein, New York, NY
Board members who are nasty, officious and unreasonable in the name of ''fiduciary responsibility'' or ''protecting the value'' of the building often damage the building's reputation with managing agents, brokers and other vendors. The harm they do is great but hidden, since those same vendors and brokers will never say outright what they whisper to their clients: ''Stay away from that building -- the board is ruled by jerks!''
Avenue Be, NYC
During my banking career we watched a co-op board put one of our clients through the ringer as they tried to buy an apartment for their 25-year-old academic daughter who had just graduated university with a PhD. After 5 weeks of humiliating them, they rejected her application in fear ''she might want to have parties.'' The good news: three months later one of the same co-op board members who rejected her came to me for a mortgage loan for their son (not a co-op) so I put them through the ringer, and a week before closing, denied it. They went over my head to the VP, not knowing a co-op board had rejected HIM for some arcane reason. He too declined it and gave me a high-five. What goes around does come around, especially outside their tyrannical redoubts. Co-op boards beware.

HEADLINE: A Hollow Sporting Footnote In Apartheid-Era South Africa

BYLINE: By TREVOR SACKS

 BODY:
For a full minute, neither boxer threw a punch. Instead, Gerrie Coetzee tried to rattle John Tate with a barrage of taunts.
''You better hit him now, Gerrie!'' Tate's trainer, Ace Miller, yelled from the corner.
It was Oct. 20, 1979, and the World Boxing Association's heavyweight title fight was taking place in South Africa. At the height of apartheid, an African-American, Tate, and a white Afrikaner, Coetzee, were competing for the title vacated by Muhammad Ali when he retired. 
This was the first time black South Africans were allowed into Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria's temple of white sport, for anything other than cleaning the stands or tending the grass. They were among 81,000 mostly white spectators, the biggest crowd for a boxing event in more than 50 years.
I was 6 and could not watch the fight live on television in South Africa. Although the country wanted the fight so badly that it agreed to change the apartheid laws to allow blacks and whites to sit together, the national broadcaster decided not to show it.
The match was of such national importance, it attracted Prime Minister P. W. Botha, his entire cabinet, Miss World and 1,000 police officers, but not the money for live broadcast rights.
For the first three rounds, there was little danger for either boxer. Then, at the end of the fourth, a good left from Coetzee connected with Tate and his legs buckled. The cheering intensified, but Coetzee, called the Bionic Hand after a series of operations left his right in a permanent fist, waited calmly for his opponent to come back to him.
Tate had eliminated Kallie Knoetze, a former police officer who once shot a black teenager, so almost all of white South Africa was behind Coetzee. But not me.
It was from a love of American culture rather than a precocious moral awareness -- seeing Tate's head over the Stars and Stripes on the promotional stickers resonated with my admiration for Superman, American movies and the toys I coveted from the pages of Archie comics.
Coetzee felt the isolation, too.
''South Africa is the other end of the world from the United States, the bottom of Africa, right in the corner of the world,'' he once said.
By 1973, Arthur Ashe had made the first high-profile call for a sports boycott against South Africa. When news of the 1976 Soweto uprising reached the world, apartheid could no longer be ignored. Politically and economically isolated, we were excluded from the Olympics, soccer's World Cup and even netball.
That the fight took place at all was a testament to the pliability of the W.B.A. In 1979, South Africa was the world's top gold producer. The rand was worth more than the dollar, and the principal dealmakers saw a gold mine of their own.
In my small town in the far north of the country, the prevailing feeling was that the sports boycott was unfair. It was simply political meddling when all we wanted was a chance to show the world what a champion we had in Coetzee.
As he moved in closer to follow up with his bionic right, his foot slipped on the canvas in front of his corner, still damp in patches from an earlier downpour. In Round 7, Coetzee slipped again, to his knees this time, and Tate punched him as he dropped. But Coetzee rose and delivered a firm uppercut to Tate's jaw.
While white South Africa was behind Coetzee, for black South Africans, the choice was more fraught. At 6 feet 4 inches and as the proud owner of an Olympic bronze medal, Tate was just the guy to symbolically, and not so symbolically, triumph over the white man.
The first problem, though, was that by breaking the sports boycott and entering the country, he had shown a disregard for the plight of black South Africans. Throughout his stay in a mansion in a well-to-do white Johannesburg suburb, Tate refused to express his views on apartheid. The authorities turned a blind eye to his transgression of the Group Areas Act, the law which decreed separate areas for racial groups and restricted entry for nonwhites into white suburbs.
The second problem was that Coetzee was far from an ideal villain. He had spoken out several times against apartheid, perhaps safe in his position as the country's golden boy.
Tate's entourage, the self-proclaimed Knoxville Hillbillies, shouted encouragement.
''Chop wood with him!'' Miller called from Tate's corner.
Tate looked more aggressive with each round, and Coetzee more worn out.
While Coetzee was struggling in Pretoria, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was leading a protest in New York against CBS, the broadcaster of the fight in the United States. The South African authorities had bent over backward to comply with the promoters' insistence on mixed-race seating. But Jackson said, ''The world won't know it's for one night only.''
The crowd was almost silent by Round 11, and Tate looked as if he was only beginning. He landed two blows to Coetzee's jaw, leaving him dazed and weakened.
''Get that cut for apartheid, John!'' Miller shouted in the 15th and final round.
Blood was streaming down Coetzee's cheek from a gash below his left eye. His strength was sapped, and he slipped three more times before the end.
Tate, by contrast, seemed fresh. He harried Coetzee relentlessly, ending with a combination to the head and a cracking right hook. Slowly, Tate had stifled the excitement and expectations of the entire country, earning a unanimous decision.
Everyone went home -- whites to the suburbs, blacks to the townships. Tate left with the W.B.A. crown, which he lost five months later. (Coetzee eventually won the title in 1983 and lost it, like Tate, in his first defense.) The Coetzee-Tate fight was finally televised in South Africa three or four days later. Few watched the midweek broadcast because it was old news, and not good news at that. Perhaps that explains why 33 years later, few recall the bout.
Nevertheless, it deserves to be remembered, if not for the boxing, then for the improbability of its taking place and the hypocrisy of an apartheid government hungry for a homegrown champion.

HEADLINE: Admitted, but Left Out

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
WHEN Ayinde Alleyne arrived at the Trinity School, an elite independent school on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, he was eager to make new friends. A brainy 14-year-old, he was the son of immigrants from Trinidad and Tobago, a teacher and an auto-body repairman, in the South Bronx. He was soon overwhelmed by the privilege he saw. Talk of fancy vacations and weekends in the Hamptons rankled -- ''I couldn't handle that at that stage of my life,'' said Mr. Alleyne, now a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania -- and he eventually found comfort in the school's ''minority corner,'' where other minority students, of lesser means, hung out.
In 2011, when Mr. Alleyne was preparing to graduate, seniors were buzzing about the $1,300-per-student class trip to the Bahamas.
He recalls feeling stunned when some of his classmates, with whom he had spent the last four years at the school, asked him if he planned to go along. 
''How do I get you to understand that going to the Bahamas is unimaginable for my family?'' he said in a recent interview. ''My family has never taken a vacation.''
It was a moment of disconnection, a common theme in conversations with minority students who have attended the city's top-drawer private schools.
There is no doubt that New York City's most prestigious private schools have made great strides in diversifying their student bodies. In classrooms where, years ago, there might have been one or two brown faces, today close to one-third of the students are of a minority. During the 2011-12 school year, 29.8 percent of children at the city's private schools were minority students, including African-American, Hispanic and Asian children, according to the National Association of Independent Schools, up from 21.4 percent a decade ago. (Nationally, the figure was 26.6 percent for the same period, up from 18.5 percent 10 years before.)
But schools' efforts to attract minority students haven't always been matched by efforts to truly make their experience one of inclusion, students and school administrators say. Pervading their experience, the students say, is the gulf between those with seemingly endless wealth and resources and those whose families are struggling, a divide often reflected by race.
Schools have aggressively recruited minority families that pay all costs in full, to break the perception that they are always the ones receiving financial aid. But a connection persists. At the Calhoun School, also on the Upper West Side, 32 percent of the student body is made up of minority children, and 70 percent of them receive some form of financial aid (a figure that has decreased markedly in recent years). Spending on financial aid at the school grew to $3.6 million last year from $1.7 million a decade ago. (It now represents 14.8 percent of total expenses, up from 14.1 percent over that same period.)
At Trinity, where 37 percent of students are from a minority group, financial aid spending ran to $5.7 million last year, up from $2.7 million 10 years ago (13 percent of expenses, up from 11 percent). Minority students represent 38 percent of the student body at the Dalton School, on the Upper East Side, where financial aid totaled $7.8 million last year, up from $3.9 million a decade earlier (13 percent of expenses, up from 12 percent).
David Addams, the executive director of the Oliver Scholars Program, which recruits low- and middle-income African-American and Latino students and helps guide them through private schools, says the report card is mixed. ''These schools have gotten better at providing opportunities for X number of kids, but once there, how well does the school community embrace them and support them in succeeding as well as any other member of the community?'' he asked.
The schools point to efforts to hire diversity directors, create forums for discussion about race and privilege, and design mentoring programs to help students find connections. But several new film projects at some of these schools cast a bright light on the sometimes fraught intersection of race and class, and how the two play out in some New York City independent schools.
The film projects at Dalton, Calhoun and Trinity are independent of one another and are at different stages of completion. The Trinity film, ''Allowed to Attend,'' in which Mr. Alleyne appears, was made by Kevin D. Ramsey, the school's director of communications, and has been shown at the school. At Dalton, the filmmaker parents of an African-American student tracked their son and a friend through their years at the school and are preparing their documentary for broadcast on public television next year. Calhoun is just embarking on its project. But footage from the films and interviews with students and administrators involved with them reveal that initiatives to diversify some of the most elite schools have proved more challenging than glossy brochures and perfectly balanced multiracial imagery on Web sites might indicate.
Students report feeling estranged, studying among peers who often lack any awareness about their socioeconomic status and the differences it entails. They describe a racism that materializes not in insults, but more often in polite indifference, silence and segregation. Albert, an Asian-American boy in ''Allowed to Attend,'' says: ''You can do a lot of psychological damage to people by ignoring them for an extended period of time. For, like, four years.''
DJ BANTON had never fit in at her neighborhood school in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Children there called her an Oreo -- black on the outside, white on the inside -- because of the way she talked, and because she got good grades. So when she was accepted at Trinity for the seventh grade through the Prep for Prep program, she hoped she would find children like herself, students who liked to study and listen to Top 40 songs and watch anime. She craved new friendships and deep connections, perhaps the only surefire inoculation against the perpetual loneliness of adolescence.
Those hopes didn't pan out, at least not for many years. ''I left one school where I felt I didn't belong and went to one where I thought I would belong, and realized I didn't belong in ways I couldn't surmount,'' Ms. Banton, who appears in ''Allowed to Attend,'' said in an interview. In elementary school, she said, she could pretend to be ''blacker'' -- change the way she talked, pretend to like music that she didn't. But at Trinity, ''the differences were in money and in the way I was raised,'' she said. ''I had never been to camp, and I couldn't change or control that.''
Many of the themes explored are common to any adolescence: where to sit in the cafeteria, dating, parties, homework, tutors. But these issues also intersect with race, wealth and privilege. Minority students talk about feeling overwhelmed by the resources they are suddenly confronted with, and many feel forced to pick between their personal roots and the golden promise of a new peer group with greater wealth. They struggle to bridge the two worlds, and some grapple with guilt if they pull away from neighborhood friends. They describe feeling like a guest at someone's house: you can stay and look, but you don't belong.
''The only people who could relate to what I was feeling were minorities, or they were poor,'' Ms. Banton, now studying at the University of Southern California, said. ''It became linked in my mind -- rich, white; minority, poor.''
The emotions are raw, even years later. When Katherine Tineo, who is Afro-Dominican, was accepted at Brown University, she remembers her classmates at Calhoun telling her that it was a result of affirmative action. She stood up in a school town hall meeting and explained, through tears, that she believed that she had been admitted on the merits of her application -- her good grades and her efforts to create awareness about multiculturalism at Calhoun.
Recounting the experience seven years later, Ms. Tineo, now 25, broke down again. ''To say I got into a school because of my color and not because of my efforts?'' she asked, her voice cracking. ''I didn't come from similar places from them, so they thought I didn't amount to the same thing.''
The project at Trinity was inspired by an earlier film, ''The Prep School Negro,'' a documentary completed in 2008 and re-edited in 2012 by Andr Robert Lee, which explores what it means to be poor and black in a wealthy, mostly white school. The film examines his experience at Germantown Friends, an elite day school in Philadelphia, and his attempts as an adult to understand his education and socialization. As a student, he received a ''life-changing'' education, he said, discovered new worlds and even found a white, upper-class ''adoptive'' family.
But as he gravitated to his new world, he slowly divorced himself from his poor, urban past, which included his mother, sister and friends. ''I lost a major connection with my family, and I lost an understanding of what true intimacy and connection with people is,'' he said.
Mr. Lee has spoken at more than 200 schools, and at a screening of the film at Trinity, Ms. Banton asked him to elaborate on how he had bridged the gap between old and new friends. She was struggling with the same issue; her best friend, one she used to play with nearly every day in Flatbush, now seemed distant and angry. ''You wonder, 'Is it my fault for changing or her fault for not?' '' Ms. Banton said.
Conversations with Ms. Banton about ''The Prep School Negro'' prompted Mr. Ramsey to make ''Allowed to Attend,'' which was filmed during the last three weeks of school in 2011 and includes four other minority students, their families and friends. (The entire senior class was given the chance to participate in the film.) The administration gave Mr. Ramsey permission to produce the film, and the students in it approved the final version; Ms. Banton also made a copy available to The New York Times.
Trinity's upper-school head, Jessica Bagby, said she cried when she watched the film. ''They were so brave in telling their story; they were so courageous,'' she said. ''But I was heartbroken that their experience was what it was.''
That experience included the different places where students congregated, with the white, popular students hanging out in the ''swamp,'' or student lounge, and the minority children taking over the red staircase. It involved a divide between those with weekend houses and limitless lunch budgets and students like DJ, who could not afford to spend $8 a day at the diner. And it included a teacher mixing up black girls who look nothing alike. One young woman, Cece, explains in the film that she could not feel pretty when the standard of beauty -- white, skinny, tall -- was something she could never be.
''It's hard for me to get a guy to pay attention to me in a predominantly white school, because I'm black, and that's miserable,'' Cece says. ''From September to June, there's not a day that I feel pretty.''
The Dalton film, ''American Promise,'' is a 12-year project undertaken by Michle Stephenson and Joe Brewster, two Brooklyn filmmakers, whose son, Idris Brewster, started at Dalton in kindergarten along with his best friend, Oluwaseun Summers, who goes by the name Seun. Idris graduated in June and now attends Occidental College in Los Angeles; Seun left after eighth grade, after years of academic and social struggle. He graduated from Benjamin Banneker Academy, a predominantly African-American high school in Brooklyn, and attends the State University of New York at Fredonia.
Idris Brewster has fond memories of Dalton. He hated middle school, but enjoyed high school. He made wonderful friends, and said Dalton's mentoring program helped him connect to other African-American boys at the school. The school provided him the support he needed and the opportunity to branch out. ''I met different kinds of people than I would have met at a public school, or in my neighborhood,'' he said, equating his education to living in a different culture for 12 years.
But his close friends were all African-American, and racial divides were pervasive. ''We're excluded from the whites,'' he said, describing the cafeteria as ''whites on one side and blacks on the other.'' He did not assign blame to Dalton, and said that much of the issue was simply economic. Most of the black students were not wealthy, he said, so ''they have less in common with the whites, who are extremely rich.''
Seun's mother, Stacey Summers, recalls feeling elated when he got into Dalton. She was happy to take part in the film. ''I wanted to chronicle his journey because it would be filled with success, and it would be rosy, rosy, rosy,'' she said. ''I was nave.''
''You are thinking going in that all the children are bright and capable,'' she added. ''The longer you are in the system, you realize what children and parents have to endure to keep up with that level.'' Many families paid for expensive private tutors, and other support for their children that she could not afford.
Seun struggled academically and socially. Play dates were difficult. Parents could not, or would not, come to their Brooklyn neighborhood. Some who declined to visit the borough offered to have Seun to their homes, but his mother felt she was imposing. ''He never had a friend come to Brooklyn,'' she said. She felt like an outsider.
Ms. Stephenson and Mr. Brewster had to get permission every year from Dalton's board to film in the school, according to a former trustee. They hope that ''American Promise,'' scheduled to be broadcast on public television in 2013, and the book that accompanies it will be constructive in addressing the issue they say is paramount: the achievement gap between African-American boys and their white counterparts.
''This is not about what Dalton didn't do for us, or what white people didn't do for us; it's about what are the needs of these boys and how can we provide it,'' Mr. Brewster said. The conversations in the documentaries, and interviews with the participants, suggest that talk of a postracial society is just that. ''As soon as someone says 'postracial,' I say, 'Who was at the last dinner party and who came to the wedding?' That one friend doesn't count,'' Mr. Lee, the ''Prep School Negro'' filmmaker, said.
STEVEN J. NELSON, the head of Calhoun, said that there were certain inevitable realities for minority families at the school: At some point, one parent will be mistaken for a nanny or a service worker. African-American boys will be frisked by the police, or followed inside a store.
''Students, and these are nice kids, too easily assume 'I'm a white kid in this nice Upper West Side school, and that kid is a brown kid in this nice Upper West Side school; my understanding of us can stop there,' '' he said. Conversations have to move beyond the surface, he said.
To help that process along, Calhoun recently won $243,063 from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to produce a film and develop a curriculum and a Web site. The film will be created by Point Made Films, which produced ''The Prep School Negro.''
Clayton Wortmann, a former Trinity student who participated in that school's documentary, agreed it was important to start a conversation. ''The level of silence is astounding,'' he said in an interview. ''Everyone is too nice to talk about it.''
He said the film reminded him of the essay ''Consider the Lobster,'' by David Foster Wallace. ''Do you think about these things? Do you think about how little you think about these things?'' he said, paraphrasing the essay, which is about the cruelty of killing and eating the crustaceans. ''That's what the film will do. It will get people to think about how little they think about it.''

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and others say that income inequality represses economic growth. To expand the economy, should the United States enact policies to address inequality?
ALL BENEFIT IF MORE ARE SECURE 
The biggest effects of rising inequality are probably not on growth, but on the ability of growth to translate into rising living standards, opportunity and security for the broad middle class. And the most likely reason for these negative effects is that rising inequality distorts our politics -- leading to weaker representation for the middle class and increased gridlock -- so that sensible policy choices are more difficult.
If rising inequality doesn't lead to higher growth, then, by definition, it lowers middle-class income gains. In the United States, productivity has grown relatively strongly. The rewards, however, have gone mostly to the top.
Yet even this understates the problem. In addition to income growth, Americans also care about opportunity and security. And both have stalled or declined despite growing productivity. Long-term upward mobility has stagnated as inequality has grown. Intergenerational mobility -- how kids do relative to their parents -- is lower in the United States than in almost any other rich nation.
As growing inequality has translated into rising political inequality, it has been harder and harder to act on sensible prescriptions that would increase middle-class living standards, security and opportunity, as well as overall economic growth. Ensuring that today's economic winners don't dominate our political process may be the most important way to improve the quality of economic life for all Americans.
JACOB S. HACKER AND NATHANIEL LOEWENTHEIL
A GAP LEAVES ROOM TO GROW
Increasing income inequality isn't an obstacle to economic growth; it's a natural result of economic growth. And growth is unlikely to reduce inequality. As economies grow, people get richer, and some people get much richer -- think Steve Jobs of Apple or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. At the same time, low-wage jobs allow unskilled workers, like teenagers, to get their foot on the first rung of the career ladder -- think summer jobs as a lifeguard or scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins.
What's important to economic growth and to social cohesion is job mobility. Can ice cream scoopers become accountants or successful entrepreneurs? For this we need to dramatically improve our education system and raise high school graduation rates above the current level of 75 percent.
In America, growing inequality has been caused partly by rising numbers of two-earner couples. In 2011, 75 percent of households in the top fifth of the income distribution had two income earners, and 22 percent had one. In the lowest fifth, only 5 percent of households have two income earners, and 95 percent have one or no income earners. One of the fastest ways to create more equality would be to rule that only one member of a family is allowed to work full time -- though this would be undesirable socially and economically.

Alex Beam, a columnist for The Boston Globe, is writing a book about the death of Joseph Smith.

 BODY:
BRIGHAM YOUNGPioneer Prophet
By John G. TurnerIllustrated. 500 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $35.
For a young religion, Mormonism seems to have more history than it knows what to do with. The church's founding fathers were outsize, operatic characters: the prophet Joseph Smith, who believers claim received and translated ''The Book of Mormon,'' and his successor, Brigham Young, who ''preserved a church and created a people,'' according to this new biography by John G. Turner, an assistant professor of religious studies at George Mason University. 
But until he met Joseph Smith, Brigham -- the Mormons, or Latter-day Saints, call both Smith and Young by their first names -- was a 29-year-old transient nobody in upstate New York who ''lived on the economic margins of his society,'' and wasn't particularly religious. He relished the sense of community he found among the Mormons and was much moved by his early encounters with Smith (''He took heaven . . . and brought it down to earth,'' Young recalled). Yet half a lifetime later, that unlettered ex-husbandman ruled over a theocratic empire as large as France. Turner calls Young ''the greatest colonizer in American history,'' who established Mormon outposts in present-day California, Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming.
Young was indeed ''maddeningly unpredictable.'' He swore like a sailor and prayed like a saint. He alternately made peace with Indian tribes and massacred them. He couldn't decide whether dancing was sinful; he permitted it one week and forbade it the next. Turner is a good writer in possession of a great story. ''Brigham Young'' is a landmark work, written by a Gentile, as the Saints call non-Mormons, with the active cooperation of the church. If Young could make the Saints dance, I wished at times that Turner would make this double-barreled, all-American story sing. That said, Turner more than compensates for his stylistic formality with exhaustive research, excellent judgment and an abiding sense of fairness.
The perennial question in Mormon history is: Whose side are you on? For over a century, the church cleaved to ''faith-promoting'' histories about heroic Joseph and Brigham, and the evil Gentiles who persecuted them. As recently as 19 years ago, Salt Lake's guardians of the Saintly flame excommunicated several prominent writers and historians for what the old-line Soviets would have called ''deviationist'' points of view. (Some of them have since rejoined the church.)
Turner is on the side of good history, and he generally negotiates the many tripwires in the Saints' story -- the ''hall of mirrors,'' as he calls it -- with aplomb. For example, he unflinchingly recounts the notorious 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which Mormons and their Paiute Indian allies killed a group of emigrants from Arkansas. While he writes that Young encouraged the Indians to attack the wagon trains, Turner allows that no document directly links him to the horrific murders of 120 men, women and children. Turner does note that Young cynically billed the federal government for $3,527 worth of gifts supposedly distributed to ''sundry bands of Indians near Mountain Meadow.'' The gifts -- steers, clothing and butcher knives -- had in fact been plundered from the slaughtered settlers. What Turner calls ''the dark stain the Mountain Meadows Massacre'' left on Young's reputation remains to this day.
Can a biographer be too fair? Perhaps. Turner's judiciousness on the hot-button subject of polygamy is squishy in the extreme. He successfully explains the ''elaborate theological edifice surrounding plural marriage'' but overreaches when he describes Joseph Smith's seduction of the teenage servant girl Fanny Alger as the prophet's ''first well-documented nonmonogamous relationship.'' The business was more sordid than that. Their hasty coupling occurred in a barn on a haymow and was witnessed by Joseph's wife Emma Hale Smith through a crack in the door, according to Linda King Newell and Valeen Tippetts Avery, Emma Smith's biographers. Turner imbues their union with a dignity it doesn't deserve. More likely, it was ''a dirty, nasty, filthy affair,'' as Joseph Smith's confidant Oliver Cowdery called it.
Polygamy loomed large in the life of Young, ''probably the most oft-married man in America,'' according to Turner. Young married an estimated 55 women, and at the age of 70, he endured house arrest for ''lewd and lascivious cohabitation.''
Plural marriage was a serious issue -- it kept Utah out of the United States for decades and was finally renounced by the church in 1890 -- but it did have its light side. In January 1863, the 61-year-old Young fell in love with and married the beautiful Amelia Folsom, 37 years his junior. Predictably, the May-December love match was the subject of much gossip and caviling from Young's many other wives. ''Polygamist as he professes to be,'' fumed Ann Eliza Young, restive wife No. 19, ''he is, under the influence of Amelia, rapidly becoming a monogamist, in all except the name.'' Well, not quite. In 1868 he married two 23-year-old women and he wasn't done yet. His final marriage, to the already-married Hannah Tapfield, occurred four years later.
There is no aspect of Young's fascinating life that eludes Turner's scrutiny. Young's theological impulses may seem off-kilter to mainstream Christians -- for instance, he preached that Adam was God and the father of Jesus Christ -- but Turner elucidates 19th-century Mormon theology with sympathetic intelligence. He makes no secret of Young's espousal of ''blood atonement,'' the ''chilling perversion of the golden rule,'' which allowed Mormons to kill sinners before they were able to forsake salvation. ''Will you love that man or woman well enough to shed their blood?'' Young asked. ''That is what Jesus Christ meant.''
Well, not exactly.
Brigham Young was tough as nails -- and soft as kid leather. ''I am thankful for this hard winter,'' he wrote in January of 1849, and he embraced the arid, rocky Salt Lake Basin as ''a good place to make Saints.'' He hated the gold rush in neighboring California. ''Gold will sink a man to hell,'' he preached, but he was something of a frontier dandy who ordered a bespoke watch from a London craftsman with the letters of his name substituted for the 12 hours. In 1859, he boasted to the newspaperman Horace Greeley that he was worth $250,000, perhaps $7 million today. Brigham cruised the famously broad boulevards of Salt Lake City in a magnificent carriage imported by his Eastern business agents, along with a dozen pairs ''of best French kid gents gloves (goatskin, not sheepskin)'' and opera glasses ''nicely cased in roan calf instead of patent leather.''
When a mob killed Joseph Smith in 1844, The New York Herald confidently predicted: ''The death of the modern Mahomet will seal the fate of Mormonism. They cannot get another Joe Smith. The holy city must tumble into ruins, and the 'Latter-day Saints' have indeed come to the latter day.'' Likewise, when Young died at age 76, The Salt Lake Tribune opined that Mormonism's ''whole decaying structure will rapidly fall to pieces.'' But thanks to Young, the structure has weathered the ensuing 135 years quite handily. He built it better than he knew.

 BODY:
HOW TO GET INTO THE TWIN PALMSBy Karolina Waclawiak
191 pp. Two Dollar Radio. Paper, $16.
Immigration novels often work like playground swings, pitching characters forward into a new culture even as the old maintains its backward pull. The nostalgic tug of the homeland -- Henry Roth's Austria, Jhumpa Lahiri's India -- counters the beckoning excitements of the adopted country, creating a tension that keeps the apparatus moving.
Karolina Waclawiak's ''How to Get Into the Twin Palms'' propels its protagonist in an unexpected direction. Rather than oscillate between her Polish past and American present, Zosia, a 25-year-old immigrant living in Los Angeles, yearns to become something else entirely: Russian. As if giving birth to a new self, she plucks the name Anya out of a baby book. ''I am taking off all my American skin,'' she declares, and means it literally: throughout the book, she shaves, scrapes and even sands her body. Less arduously, she dyes her hair, paints her face and buys new clothes -- all with the goal of winning entry into the Twin Palms, an alluring Russian nightclub in her neighborhood. 
Just as Anya reinvents herself, Waclawiak's novel (her first) reinvents the immigration story, shaving off some bits, accentuating others and dressing the whole thing up in a fresh outfit. Anya seeks not to break into American culture but to become a different kind of outsider. She lands in California not to fulfill a dream of stardom but because she dreams of nothing in particular: having lost her interest in seeing all of America, she ''just stopped here.''
And rather than ''pull herself up by her bootstraps'' -- a feat known to frustrate even the native-born -- Anya is tranquilly unemployed, spending her government checks on carrot cake and discounted bras. Waclawiak captures joblessness well: her narrative unfurls in short, sharp chapters, as though the novel itself refuses to commit to long projects. Without a day job, Anya can devote her energy to wondering which hot dog to buy and how fast her fan would need to spin to detach from the ceiling (concerns familiar to anyone who's endured unemployment). And she can become a peculiarly Californian flneur, coasting up and down the highways.
Anya nonetheless remains, in a sense, the consummate immigrant, a permanently impermanent resident. Someone else's hair balls and bobby pins linger in her rented apartment; she lounges by the pool of a motel where she is not a guest. We often catch her staring at strangers, as if becoming a tourist in their lives -- moments that transform ''Twin Palms'' into its own manner of spy novel.
Yet for all its fascination, this book sometimes lacks finish. While the novel's improvisational quality complements the character, it confounds the reader: If Anya is so intent on passing as Russian, why does she quickly tell her Russian beau -- her key, she hopes, to the Twin Palms -- that she is Polish? Why does she declare her lack of interest in the Twin Palms only to recommit to the idea six pages later? Why, most crucially, does she want to pretend to be Russian at all? Waclawiak offers a quick explanation that fails to justify such a historically loaded gesture, and we close the book thinking -- as Anya notes on the first page -- ''It was a strange choice to decide to pass as a Russian.''
Like the nightclub in its title, ''Twin Palms'' brims with smoke: characters puff cigarettes, eat smoked fish and watch ash fall from nearby forest fires. Anya gets burned both by the man she pursues and by the California sun. At its most illuminating, ''How to Get Into the Twin Palms'' movingly portrays a protagonist intent on both creating and destroying herself, on burning brightly even as she goes up in smoke.

 BODY:
ILLUMINATIONS, by Arthur Rimbaud. Translated by John Ashbery. (Norton, $15.95.) Rimbaud, the bohemian artist who died of cancer in Marseilles in 1891, at the age of 37, produced an influential body of poetry while still in his teens. The intensely visual prose poems in this collection -- a ''crystalline jumble,'' as Ashbery calls them in his adept translation -- develop a wealth of images (industrial, theatrical, royal, natural, nostalgic) by leaps of personal association. 
JERUSALEM: The Biography, by Simon Sebag Montefiore. (Vintage, $20.) From King David's establishment of Jerusalem as his capital to the 1967 war and more recent events, Montefiore packs this 3,000-year history with telling details of the many kings, killers, prophets, pretenders, caliphs and crusaders who have ruled and ravaged the city.
STAY AWAKE: Stories, by Dan Chaon. (Ballantine, $15.) Chaon's 12 tales of fractured families and anxious souls demonstrate the uneasy power of horror fiction. Someone glimpses through a window a figure not of this world. A widower's crippling grief begins to look a lot like schizophrenia. Our reviewer, Patrick McGrath, called these stories ''superbly disquieting. . . . Chaon consistently achieves an electric jolt of originality.''
ELIZABETH AND HAZEL: Two Women of Little Rock, by David Margolick. (Yale University, $15.) It's an iconic photograph of the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School: in it, Elizabeth Eckford, one of the ''Little Rock Nine,'' walks past the school while Hazel Bryan, a student there, screams racial epithets. Margolick, who interviewed both women, provides a patient and evenhanded account of their fraught relationship over the decades.
THE MAID, by Kimberly Cutter. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $14.95.) Cutter vividly evokes medieval France in this novel of Joan of Arc, who led an army at 17, facilitated the coronation of the rightful king and is often credited with turning the tide of the Hundred Years' War. The narrative, framed by scenes of Joan in prison shortly before her death, begins with the moment she first hears God's voice in the fields at age 12.
THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE: Why Violence Has Declined, by Steven Pinker. (Penguin, $20.) Are humans essentially good or bad? Has the past century seen moral progress or moral collapse? In seeking to prove that rates of violence have fallen, and to explain why, Pinker, the Harvard psychologist, draws on recent research in history, psychology, cognitive science, economics and sociology. (By his reckoning, his theory features ''six trends, five inner demons, four better angels and five historical forces.'')
WE THE ANIMALS, by Justin Torres. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $12.95.) Three brothers navigate their parents' tumultuous marriage in Torres's first novel, a series of elliptical vignettes set in upstate New York.
TAMING THE GODS: Religion and Democracy on Three Continents, by Ian Buruma. (Princeton University, $14.95.) Buruma writes intimately about the relationship between politics and faith in Britain, the Netherlands, France, China, Japan and the United States -- uncovering ironies that wreak havoc with popular stereotypes.

HEADLINE: 'If You Fix Cities, You Kind of Fix the World'

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY PRATT

 BODY:
The mountain-lodge gathering felt like an annual shareholders' meeting, with department heads offering optimistic forecasts backed by charts, graphs and photos. Except that the 50 or so attendees wore jeans and sneakers and sat at round tables in a faux log cabin 7,700 feet above sea level and at least 20 degrees cooler than the Nevada desert below. And what they were discussing was not a corporation but a very unusual project.
Tony Hsieh, the 38-year-old chief executive of Zappos, had called the 24-hour retreat as a debriefing of sorts. It was almost a year into the Downtown Project, his $350 million urban experiment to build ''the most community-focused large city in the world'' in downtown Las Vegas -- an area dominated by bare lots and check-cashing stores about an hour's drive away. An icebreaker kicked off the event with whoops and hollers as each attendee stood up to share personal anecdotes or facts, like ''I've tried chicken-fried steak in more than 30 states.'' One woman announced that she had been a salsa dancing champion. Hsieh (pronounced shay) shared how to write his last name in Morse code. 
A jammed schedule was handed out, with most of the dozen or so presentations lasting less than 10 minutes. The schedule featured updates from a number of Hsieh's deputies on how they were spending the project's money, including: Andrew Donner, a veteran of the 1990s Vegas real estate boom, on the $200 million that the project is investing in land and buildings; Don Welch, a former Citigroup banker, on the $50 million the project is spending on small businesses; and Andy White, a former start-up founder, on the $50 million going to tech companies. Hsieh's cousin Connie was scheduled to discuss the remaining $50 million, which is to be used for education. A woman sat off to the side with a digital timer, ready to yank anyone offstage who went over his or her allotted time.
The Downtown Project got its unofficial start several years ago when Hsieh realized that Zappos, the online shoe-and-apparel company that he built to $1 billion in annual sales in less than a decade, would soon outgrow its offices in nearby Henderson, Nev. Though Amazon bought Zappos in 2009 for $1.2 billion, Hsieh still runs the company, and he has endeavored to keep alive its zany corporate culture. This includes a workplace where everyone sits in the same open space and employees switch desks every few months in order to get to know one another better. ''I first thought I would buy a piece of land and build our own Disneyland,'' he told the group. But he worried that the company would be too cut off from the outside world and ultimately decided ''it was better to interact with the community.''
Around the same time, the Las Vegas city government was also about to move, and Hsieh saw his opportunity. He leased the former City Hall -- smack in the middle of downtown Vegas -- for 15 years. Then he got to thinking: If he was going to move at least 1,200 employees, why not make it possible for them to live nearby? And if they could live nearby, why not create an urban community aligned with the culture of Zappos, which encourages the kind of ''serendipitous interactions'' that happen in offices without walls? As Zach Ware, Hsieh's right-hand man in the move, put it, ''We wanted the new campus to benefit from interaction with downtown, and downtown to benefit from interaction with Zappos.'' The only hitch was that it would require transforming the derelict core of a major city.
For Hsieh, though, this was part of the appeal. Transforming downtown Vegas would ''ultimately help us attract and retain more employees for Zappos.'' For the city itself, it would ''help revitalize the economy.'' More important, it would ''inspire,'' a word Hsieh uses often. Hsieh closed his presentation at the faux log cabin high above the desert with the sort of fact he seems to always have on hand: up to 75 percent of the world's population will call cities home in our lifetime. ''So,'' he concluded, ''if you fix cities, you kind of fix the world.''
Most tourists never see downtown Las Vegas. There are a few blocks of mostly run-down casinos, cavernous gift stores and the enormous, glittering LED display overhead called, with hopefulness, the Fremont Street Experience. Less than two miles to the north, there's the so-called homeless corridor, a patchwork of soup kitchens and air-conditioned shelters that protect the area's thousands of homeless from life-threatening 115-degree afternoons during the summer. And this is within a greater metro area that has dominated the nation's unemployment, foreclosure and bankruptcy lists for much of the last four years. Everyone knows at least one person who has left town for Houston, Dallas or Atlanta.
Nevertheless, the Downtown Project is hoping to draw 10,000 ''upwardly mobile, innovative professionals'' to the area in the next five years. And according to Hsieh, he and his team receive requests for seed money from dozens of people every week. In return, the Downtown Project asks not just for a stake in the companies but also for these entrepreneurs to live and work in downtown Las Vegas. (They're also expected to give back to the community and hand over contacts for future recruits.) In expectation of all these newcomers, the project has already set up at least 30 real estate companies, bought more than 15 buildings and broken ground on 16 construction projects.
For those entrepreneurs who live in other parts of the country, and most do, the question often comes down to how eager they are to relocate to a downtown area filled with liquor stores and weekly hotels. Less than a year after the project was officially established, about 15 tech start-ups have signed on. The first tech investment went to Romotive, a company developing smart-phone-controlled personal robots. Money has also gone to Local Motion, a start-up that designs networks for sharing vehicles, and Digital Royalty, a social-media company.
In January, Jody Sherman relocated his e-commerce company, Ecomom, from Los Angeles to a loft in a former bread factory in downtown Vegas. Sherman, who knew Hsieh from his years working around Internet companies, visited the project last fall. At first, Sherman recalled, ''I said to myself, 'I'm a surfer in Santa Monica; there's no way I'm going to Las Vegas.' '' Then he stood in Hsieh's 23rd-floor apartment in the Ogden, a building overlooking downtown, and noticed a large wall in the living room covered with Post-it notes left by dozens of visitors. Each was a suggestion of what they would like to see in the upstart community. The ideas ranged from the simple (a good pizza joint) to the complex (accessible health care). Sherman started to visualize the kind of community that could support his still-young business. ''I have a lot of imagination,'' Sherman said. ''I could see what he was planning. I could see it working.''
The project has since invested $600,000 in Ecomom, which has grown from 13 to 29 employees since Sherman arrived. (Sherman's first ad for three customer-service employees drew more than 100 responses.) To do its part for the community, Ecomom has donated 75,000 organic meals to children, and Sherman has brought in new members to the project. Now he lives four floors below Hsieh, who leases 50 sleek, modern condominiums in the Ogden, 30 of which are maintained as ''crash pads'' for touring entrepreneurs. Hsieh calls the building the project's secret weapon. ''It basically tricks them into coming,'' he told me. ''And downtown basically sells itself.''
But luring entrepreneurs isn't always so easy. One night, Hsieh and a few members of his team met with Jake Bronstein, who had come from New York seeking investment in his start-up apparel company, Flint and Tinder. Bronstein began the dinner meeting by describing several products he would like his line to make, including a ''10-year sweatshirt'' built to last a decade, and the conversation soon veered from granular details (the type of cotton, the size of the factory) to what each side expected from the deal. Bronstein said: ''I don't think I'm coming here saying, 'I'm here, write me a check so I can come and live in your world.' I'm interested in something more than money.'' His salmon remained untouched as he fielded questions and comments from the project reps around the table. ''Every factory in the world is doing everything to maximize R.O.I.'' -- return on investment -- Hsieh said. ''We're doing everything to maximize R.O.C.''
''What's R.O.C.?'' Bronstein asked.
''Return on community,'' Hsieh answered.
Then, after a few moments of banter, Bronstein confessed, quite abruptly: ''Here's the truth. I want to be involved. That's why I came. I'm willing to talk around moving to Las Vegas; I just don't want to do that right now. I have a wife. I have a big dog. I can't walk in and say, 'I'll sell you 30 percent; I'm moving here.' '' The deal appeared less likely by the minute.
Fred Mossler, a former Nordstrom shoe buyer who has been with Hsieh since the early Zappos days, tried to get things back on track. ''I think you're going to want to live here after about two years,'' he said. ''You'll start understanding what we're talking about.'' Hsieh suggested the possibility of Bronstein's coming once every month and staying for a week. The conversation started to turn. Within a few minutes, a dollar amount ($250,000) and terms of investment were traded across the table. After dinner, the group walked a few blocks for drinks at the Downtown Cocktail Room, which also served as the project's de facto office. Bronstein asked, ''So how do we finish the deal?'' Hsieh answered, ''I believe we just did.''
A few days later, I asked Hsieh how he could be sure that Bronstein, or any entrepreneur, could ensure an adequate ''return on community.'' I was expecting something of a philosophical answer -- something in line, perhaps, with his comment about fixing cities -- but instead Hsieh was practical. First, he said, he could afford to take some risks (''it's $250,000 out of $350 million''). Second, the project team trusts its networks, and Bronstein had come recommended. ''Innately, we believe that people are good and trustworthy,'' Mossler said. But in the end, Hsieh added, ''he needed us more than we needed him.''
The transformation of metro areas has been tried many times before. Edward Glaeser, the Harvard economist and author of ''Triumph of the City,'' has said these efforts can be divided into two camps: cities still in the process of being built (think Houston over the past few decades) and cities in decline that try revitalization. The Greater Houston area, for example, has added more than a million residents since 2000, most of whom were drawn by affordable housing and a low cost of living. Cities like Boston, with its Faneuil Hall, and Baltimore, with its three-decade remaking of Inner Harbor, have transformed older areas in decline.
While Glaeser resists making generalizations about what works and what doesn't, he said that smaller projects within economically healthy cities have a greater chance of success than trying a build-it-and-they-will-come approach when surrounded by decay. Almost all of these projects, however, are driven by a partnership between business and government. None have depended so heavily on one man and his money as the Downtown Project.
Hsieh first called Glaeser last fall to discuss his ideas for Las Vegas, and he invited Glaeser to give a talk to Zappos employees in February. Then, ''Tony convinced me to spend more time,'' Glaeser said. He stayed at the Ogden for two days and was surprised by what he saw. Most urban-renewal projects ''would normally lay down structures . . . and hope that human capital will come,'' he said. ''Here, they are leading with human capital.'' In fact, the project's goal of 10,000 new residents is derived from unpacking Glaeser's metric (borrowed from Jane Jacobs) that says 100 homes per acre is the ideal density for creating the sort of unplanned interactions that make successful cities paragons of creativity.
But making room for all of that new human capital can sometimes lead to trouble. At the mountain-lodge retreat, I saw Hsieh pull a couple of his deputies aside after lunch. A few days later, as Hsieh and I shared shots of coconut water in his apartment, I asked him what had been so urgent.
Hsieh said that the abrupt huddle concerned the purchase of a 50-unit apartment building that seemed to have gone awry. The Downtown Project and Zappos donated $1.5 million this year to Teach for America's Las Vegas operation and planned to move the organization's office downtown. This summer, 125 new teachers arrived in town, the largest number since the organization landed here in 2004. The plan was to buy Towne Terrace, a boxy, simple affair about three blocks north of Hsieh's apartment, to house the Teach for America recruits in a hurry. But it turned out that the building ''had residents,'' Hsieh explained, ''some who had lived there a long time and made a really tight-knit community.'' Two days later, he told me, Donner was scheduled to meet Towne Terrace's anxious residents on the building's roof to tell them about the Downtown Project's plans for the property.
At 6 p.m., the temperature still hovered around 100 degrees while about 15 residents milled around under neglected pergolas with peeling paint. Donner bounded onto the roof in jeans and a T-shirt. ''The first thing I need to tell all of you is, you're all going to stay,'' he said. The terms: their leases could be kept as is for at least 12 months; the project would give a six-month notice if anything changed. There was a collective sigh, then applause. ''Papa,'' one of the Terrace's oldest residents, sat in a wheelchair, still as a stone. Someone said loudly in his ear: ''Did you hear that, Papa? They said we can stay. So don't cry no more.''
Although Hsieh and his team repeatedly refer to the area as a series of empty lots, downtown Las Vegas has for decades been a magnet for low-rent apartments and the homeless -- in part because several large social-services agencies have offices nearby. The Towne Terrace misstep was a reminder that the project needed to be mindful of existing communities. Hsieh was remorseful but undeterred: ''We made some bad assumptions. Next time, we'll dig deeper.''
Avoiding such miscalculation may require building a more comprehensive strategy, says Richard Florida, urban theorist and author of ''The Rise of the Creative Class.'' Although he doesn't withhold praise for the Downtown Project, Florida thinks it needs a ''robust community process,'' in which an outside group could help build consensus with the surrounding community and create a plan that takes their wishes into account. ''You can have serendipity,'' he said. ''But when you're building a community, you also need a strategy.''
At times, though, it seems as if Hsieh's strategy is much looser and based, in part, on instincts. It raises a question: How will Hsieh know when the project has succeeded? According to Glaeser, success is a matter of longevity. ''If some of the businesses fail -- and they will, that's not a sign of failure for the project. It's capitalism for you,'' he said. ''Failure would be if people didn't stay around in 15 years.'' And for his part, Hsieh believes there will be people who move here and stick around for that long. ''However,'' he said, ''our timeline is a lot more aggressive. Downtown Vegas will change dramatically for the better within five years.''
In the meantime, Hsieh is still trying to persuade the reluctant. A few days after the Bronstein dinner, he had worked out a contingency plan. With a fresh martini in hand, he laid out a formula by which a certain number of the 10,000 new residents the project intends to attract could be ''commuters'' -- as long as they engaged in ''approximately 1,000 hours per year of serendipitous encounters.''

HEADLINE: High-Rises by the Bay

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
San Francisco
ROUGHLY two decades ago, during an earlier Internet start-up boom, many entrepreneurs and fast-typing coders and engineers set up shop in a still-gritty area of this city: South of Market Street.
The young tech crowd rented -- and sometimes bought -- in commercial buildings in this former warehouse area, converting them into ''work-live'' spaces where they operated their nascent companies and slept (once in awhile).
The boom-and-bust cycles in the tech sector move quickly, and the pace of constant reinvention and innovation is relentless.
The same is true of tastes in real estate. Today a new generation of tech dreamers is back in the South of Market area. But this time they are breathing life into a start-up wave not previously seen in San Francisco: high-rise condo living. 
A clutch of new condo buildings and condo-hotels, some with stunning views of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and Twin Peaks, have sprung up downtown in the past five years. For what would be considered modest prices in Manhattan, they are offering a full-service lifestyle that locals have traditionally steered away from, preferring the single-family homes traditionally available in the City by the Bay.
In the late 1990s, if someone wanted to live in a high-end condo, the options were almost nonexistent. ''There wasn't any signature building that people said, 'I gotta have it,' '' said Max Armour, a real estate agent with TRI Coldwell Banker.
Today there are at least two, both a few blocks south of Market Street. In terms of quality, amenities and V.I.P. neighbors, the 60-story Millennium Tower is San Francisco's version of 15 Central Park West, or perhaps the yet-to-be-completed One57.
At Millennium, tech millionaires from Google, Twitter, Zynga and Salesforce mingle with celebrity residents like the 49ers legend Joe Montana and the chef Michael Mina, who runs RN74, the restaurant in the building. Thomas Perkins, the venture capitalist, lives in a 4,500-square-foot penthouse he bought in 2009 for $9.35 million.
Just up Mission Street from the Millennium, and nearer the financial district, is the St. Regis, a more low-key building, though also lauded for its refinement. Last December a 17,100-square-foot penthouse there sold to a Hong Kong family for $28 million, said Gregg Lynn, the broker at Sotheby's International Realty who represented the sellers.
Other buildings south of Market have been selling swiftly, including Madrone, or have sold out, like Infinity. Developers have taken advantage of zoning regulations in the newer neighborhoods of South Beach, Mission Bay and Rincon Hill to erect taller towers than would be allowed in better-established residential pockets of the city. Millennium Tower, at 645 feet, is San Francisco's tallest residential building.
''There is a whole new generation of wealth that has found its way into San Francisco,'' said Richard G. Baumert, a partner with the New York-based Millennium Partners, which developed Millennium Tower. ''Whether through stock options or whatever, there has been this influx of buying from the tech sector that has had a positive impact on the whole market.''
Some of the wealthiest tech buyers have ranged beyond South of Market and bought trophy properties throughout the city.
In February Jack Dorsey, a founder of Twitter and Square, bought a two-bedroom house perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific for $9.99 million. A few months later Mark Pincus, a founder of Zynga, paid $16 million for a seven-bedroom 11,500-square-foot house in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. Jonathan Ive, the Apple executive responsible for the design of the iPhone and iPad, bought an English-style manor on ''Billionaire's Row'' in Pacific Heights for $17 million.
The recent fall in stock prices for companies like Facebook and Zynga hasn't done a whole lot to slow the buying, brokers say. ''If that hadn't happened our inventory probably would be at zero now,'' Mr. Lynn said.
The inventory in the San Francisco area, which includes the East Bay, dropped by 42.2 percent over the past year, the biggest drop after Sacramento among the country's 30 largest metro areas, according to Zillow, the real estate Web site.
As for the young tech professionals, the catalyst for their condo purchases -- often in developments South of Market -- is San Francisco's exceedingly tight rental market. What the buildings lack in proximity to supermarkets and night life they make up for with an easier commute to tech companies in Silicon Valley, which can take up to 90 minutes during rush hour. A train station for lines running south to the valley is in Mission Bay, as are on-ramps for the expressway.
''It's like living in TriBeCa and working in New Jersey,'' said Alan Mark, president of the Mark Company, a real estate marketing and sales firm.
Both of the newer neighborhoods have benefited from A T & T Park, which opened for Giants baseball in 2000 in South Beach. Mission Bay, a 300-acre area that was previously a rail yard, was largely ignored until the ballpark spurred developers to bet on it. A cluster of biotech companies have since moved in, and a new medical center for the University of California, San Francisco, is currently under construction.
Mayank Mehta and his wife, Ashini Desai, both 30, bought a two-bedroom apartment in Madrone in Mission Bay earlier this year after their landlords at a nearby building told them that their rent of $3,000 a month would jump by 50 percent.
Mr. Mehta works at Capriza, a Palo Alto-based start-up with 28 employees that makes custom mobile applications.
He and his wife, an investment banker, prefer to live in the city rather than in Silicon Valley, he said, because most of their friends in San Francisco -- and most of Capriza's employees -- haven't begun to start families.
Mr. Mehta says they chose Madrone because of its investment potential and easy access to Palo Alto, paying just over $1 million for the apartment, which has about 1,600 square feet. Prices in Madrone range from $500,000 to about $2 million.
''Over the last three years,'' Mr. Mehta said, ''with the Facebook I.P.O., and the Pandora I.P.O. and LinkedIn and a bunch of other companies coming in, rents shot through the roof. We found it was economically better to be owners than renters.''
Madrone's developer, Bosa Development of Vancouver, bet big on Mission Bay when it began acquiring sites in the area some eight years ago. When the company started construction on Madrone in 2010, Nat Bosa, Bosa's president, ''was using his own funds, because he believed that by the time he delivered, the market would be better and there would be no inventory, which is exactly what happened,'' Mr. Mark said.
Since starting advance sales a year ago, the 16-story Madrone has closed on more than half its 329 units, and has been averaging about 30 sales a month at $750 a square foot, said Andrea Jones Bosa's vice president for Northern California.
Millennium Partners, the builder of the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South and the Four Seasons in San Francisco, also had to weather the storm of the financial crisis with Millennium Tower, which began selling in the fall of 2007.
''Our timing couldn't have been worse,'' Mr. Baumert said.
Initial sales were strong, but everything changed in late 2008. The developer dropped prices by 15 percent in January 2009, shortly before the building opened, but sales didn't begin to pick up until in 2010. Since the second half of 2011, tech buyers have been leading the way, with sales averaging about $1,100 a square foot, he said. Now the 60-story tower and its adjacent 11-story companion building, designed by Glenn Rescalvo of Handel Architects (which helped design the World Trade Center memorial), have just 45 of 409 apartments left to sell, Mr. Baumert said. ''There was a lack of high-end product in the city,'' he said. ''We felt this was a perfect opportunity.''
The newer condo buildings offer resortlike amenities. Millennium Tower has a 20,000-square-foot club level with a health club; a 75-foot pool; a private dining room served by RN74; a tasting room and wine cellar; a screening room; and a children's playroom.
Millennium has tried to go one step further in offering residents a lifestyle that never existed South of Market before -- or really anywhere in San Francisco. Its ''La Vie'' calendar of events has included ''share your bottle'' wine nights, summer concerts on the terrace and ''fireside chats'' with prominent locals and building residents like Mr. Perkins and Mr. Montana.
Who knows? With all this mingling, maybe a few new start-ups will be born.

HEADLINE: Struggling to Save the Old in a Town That Values the New

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; David Anderson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- An excavator clawed away at a squat, battered building on the edge of downtown one morning, tearing the structure down in chunks that sounded like firecrackers as they crashed to the ground -- heaps of discarded history in a city that prizes what is new.
From the other side of a chain-link fence, a cadre of preservationists watched with lament. The Madison Hotel -- a boardinghouse for traders, travelers and tramps dating back to Arizona's territorial days -- was coming down unceremoniously to make way for a parking lot. 
Its younger neighbor, the Hotel St. James, is to be next for the wrecking crew.
The hotels' demolition permits were issued midsummer, though no one seemed to have heard about it until Michael Levine stumbled upon a lead-cleanup crew stepping out of the buildings sometime in August and thought to make a call to City Hall. Mr. Levine, 44, is an artist who has made it his business to buy and renovate some of the surviving buildings in Phoenix's vanishing warehouse district, where, he said, ''it's been all about buying low, building cheap and selling out.''
''For the business community here,'' he said, ''it's all about new, new, new.''
By then, all eyes were trained on a more illustrious property facing a similar demise several miles to the north -- a 1952 spiral house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for his son and daughter-in-law, David and Gladys. The Wright family sold it in 2009 to people they thought would live in it and preserve it. The economy crashed and the buyers ended up selling it to a developer in June for $1.8 million.
''The house is so beautiful,'' said Michelle Dodds, the city's acting historic preservation officer, ''who would ever want to tear it down?''
Preserving history is a tricky business in Arizona, where so many old structures have been felled by fire, decay or development that the state's colorful past is often celebrated in recreated settings. Voters in 2006 approved a ballot measure giving property owners the right to file claims against the government if its regulations, like a historic or landmark designation, resulted in a decrease in their property's value.
The Phoenix Historic Preservation Office is a relatively new endeavor, created in the 1980s to rescue what was left of the city's architectural past, though its powers are limited by the wording of the ordinance that established its reach. For example, a landmark designation shields a property from demolition for only three years and even then there is a way out: an owner can seek an exemption by invoking the economic hardship of keeping up a building.
''It doesn't save,'' Ms. Dodds said. ''It just delays.''
The city has since given historic designations to 35 districts and more than 200 properties that were at least 50 years old and still retained much of their original character. (Ms. Dodds said there have been no districts designated since the 2006 property measure was approved, only individual properties.)
The designation process requires four hearings; it helps if the property's owner is on board.
Years ago, the City Council, which has the last say, voted against historic designation for the Madison Hotel, based primarily on opposition by its owners at the time. The Hotel St. James, its neighbor, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a distinction that does not come with any protections.
The Phoenix Suns, the N.B.A. basketball team, bought the properties, just across from its arena, in 2005. The team could use extra parking space, and the two hotels, boarded up and abandoned, made for the perfect location. (Several historic buildings were demolished to make way for the Suns' arena complex; the only exception was the Sun Mercantile warehouse, the last remaining building of Phoenix's old Chinatown.)
The Frank Lloyd Wright house, meanwhile, had not come up before the commissions, committees and councils in charge of historic designation until August. Finding out about its most recent sale, the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, based in Chicago, contacted Ms. Dodds's office, which uncovered a request by the home's new owners, a venture called 8081 Meridian, to have its lot -- roughly 2.5 acres -- split. The job entailed razing the house, in one of the most coveted neighborhoods in Phoenix, and building new homes on the land.
The prospect galvanized architects and architecture enthusiasts, and resulted in an online petition that has already gathered more than 26,000 signatures. A Planning Commission vote on Oct. 9 on the home's proposed landmark designation attracted more than 100 people, three times the usual number.
Only three people testified against landmark designation. One of them was Steve Sells, a partner at 8081 Meridian, who said, ''I've got to think of my family.''
Mr. Sells said that his company had rejected a recent offer of more than $2 million for the house, but that he and his partner, John Hoffman, still wanted to reach a compromise. There are at least two possibilities: dividing the lot but preserving the house, or finding someone willing to pay an acceptable price for the house. The house was listed for sale on Saturday for $2.4 million.
The City Council was scheduled to vote on Nov. 7 on giving the Wright house landmark status.
For the Hotel St. James, the only good news to emerge was on Tuesday, the same day the Madison was knocked down. The city and the Suns reached an agreement to preserve its facade and a small part of its lobby, ''a piece of Arizona's history for future generations,'' the team's president, Jason Rowley, said in a statement.
Mr. Levine, the artist turned entrepreneur, called the offer more affront than consolation, adding, ''They may as well knock it all down.''
Other than his and others' protests online -- on blog posts denouncing the disappearance of the city's past -- there has been little uproar over the hotels' demise.
Jim McPherson, the president of the Arizona Preservation Foundation, a nonprofit group, said that because so many people in Phoenix did not have roots here and knew little, or nothing, about its history, ''the hotels were just meaningless old buildings, nothing else.''
The question that ought to be asked, Mr. McPherson said, is, ''How do you continue to tell a city's story if the remnants of its past have all come down?''

HEADLINE: Returning to the Road, In Style and With Help

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
Hebron, Ohio&#xa;
&#xa;BRUCE CHARGO conceded that he sometimes drove his 1958 Dodge Power Wagon aggressively.
&#x201C;Oh yeah,&#x201D; he said, in a telephone interview. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the whole idea of putting a 375-horse Hemi in there.&#x201D;
Like many of us, Mr. Chargo, 53, of Clio, Mich., enjoys the feel of a high-performance machine and takes pride in his ability to maneuver it.
Unlike most of us, he doesn&#x2019;t drive with his hands and feet. Mr. Chargo was paralyzed from the chest down in a childhood swimming accident and consequently needs special controls to drive by using only his arms. His hands, wrists and legs are immobile. 
Technology has given severely impaired people like Mr. Chargo the ability to drive, but it doesn&#x2019;t come easily. Vehicles outfitted for those with limited muscle control are expensive, and learning to operate one requires determination. It took Mr. Chargo months of practicing in his driveway and on the road to learn. Then, years later, he acted on a long-suppressed love of performance vehicles, bought a collectible truck and turned it into a hot rod.
I met Mr. Chargo at the Mopar Nationals here, an event for fans of Chrysler-built collectibles and high-performance machinery. Amid the winged Dodge Charger Daytonas and the purple &#x2019;Cudas, Mr. Chargo&#x2019;s orange Power Wagon, a 4-wheel-drive utility vehicle that has a cult following, stood out. When Mr. Chargo drove it, he stopped the show.
Asked to move his truck to another location for a photo session, Mr. Chargo drove his wheelchair to the rear doors of the Power Wagon and lowered its lift. He motored onto the platform, which raised him into the truck. He propelled himself to the driver&#x2019;s area and locked his wheelchair into place.
To start the truck, he moved his right arm to toggle switches on the console. His left arm nestled between the four pins of a controller that operates throttle and brake. Flicking a toggle with his right arm turned on the ignition, a second toggle engaged the starter and a third put the automatic transmission into drive. He then moved his right arm into another four-pin controller that steers the vehicle.
And off he went, with all the confidence of a man who has driven half a million miles using controls that require no hand or leg movements.
While the control system may be its most interesting feature, the Power Wagon itself stands out. He started looking for a performance vehicle in 2000, but was limited to vans because of his wheelchair. He found the Power Wagon, which was wide enough, for sale on the Web and bought it from a California man. Mr. Chargo spent 11 years having the van built to his specifications.
From the factory, the Power Wagon had an optional 315-cubic-inch V-8, but Mr. Chargo installed a 1958 Chrysler 392 Hemi, modified to generate 375 horsepower. It&#x2019;s backed by Chrysler&#x2019;s 727 automatic transmission, a favorite of drag racers, and power is delivered to stout Dana front and rear axles, like those in 1980s-vintage Dodge trucks. The project cost about $115,000, he said.
In 1977, the year of his accident, Mr. Chargo had been driving a 1971 Plymouth Duster. He was in high school and lived with his parents on a Michigan farm. Like many teenagers, he had an avid interest in sports and fast cars.
He was injured on a July afternoon after he and his friends decided to go swimming.
&#x201C;It was one of those dumb things kids do,&#x201D; Mr. Chargo said. &#x201C;My buddies and I had added sand to the farm pond&#x2019;s beach. It was a hot day, and we had a trampoline, so we put it in the water. Instead of jumping off feet first, I dove.&#x201D;
His head hit the sandy bottom of the pond, and he felt something like a severe electric shock as his spinal cord was damaged. Unable to move, he was pulled from the pond by his father and a friend. After five months in traction, he was moved to a rehabilitation facility in Colorado.
&#x201C;At first, being a 17-year-old, it kind of kicks you in the stuff to not be independent,&#x201D; he said. When he started rehabilitation, the doctors told him his injury was so high up his spinal cord that he had very little strength in his arms and no function in his hands or wrists.
&#x201C;They wanted to put me in a sip-and-puff wheelchair, a chair controlled by mouth, but I insisted on one I could drive moving a toggle with my arm,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;My arm was so weak I could only go backward at first, but it eventually got strong enough to operate the chair.&#x201D;
Mr. Chargo came home on New Year&#x2019;s Day, 1978. His father bought a van and installed a lift for his son&#x2019;s wheelchair. Mr. Chargo graduated from high school with his class and earned a degree at Western Michigan University.
Today, he&#x2019;s a financial planner managing accounts worth over $10 million, owns a home in Clio and is married to Tammy Dalrymple-Chargo, who was with him at the Mopar Nationals.
&#x201C;I do want to emphasize how important my wife is in my life,&#x201D; Mr. Chargo wrote in an e-mail. &#x201C;Not only is she my best friend and a wonderful wife, she is my primary caregiver. Because of my disability, I require a lot of care.&#x201D;
The Power Wagon is the fourth vehicle Mr. Chargo has equipped with special controls. Because the custom truck is more than mere transportation, it has taken him to a new place. One might say that, as a driver who once relished performance cars, he&#x2019;s come all the way back. People do come back from horrible accidents &#x2014; witness the return of the IndyCar champion Alex Zanardi to motor sports after losing his legs in a racing crash.
Mr. Chargo&#x2019;s return to the driver&#x2019;s seat in 1984 was prompted by a chance encounter with a quadriplegic man who had regained his ability to drive by using a control system similar to the one Mr. Chargo now uses. The man, whose name Mr. Chargo cannot remember, let him try the van in a parking lot, but Mr. Chargo&#x2019;s arms weren&#x2019;t strong enough to operate the controls.
Still, a seed was planted. He had a doctor analyze his physical skills to determine if he was capable of driving, and the doctor recommended a system that could be operated with limited arm movement and minimal effort. The family&#x2019;s van was outfitted, and a driver rehabilitation specialist taught him how to use the equipment.
&#x201C;It was really hard to learn to drive,&#x201D; Mr. Chargo said. &#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t strong enough. I was going to college full time, so I would go to school during the week and come home on the weekends, get in the van and steer it back and forth in the driveway for hours. I was determined to drive.&#x201D;
While learning to operate his family&#x2019;s van, Mr. Chargo, whose back muscles cannot support him, fell over in his chair when turning into his driveway and crashed into his grandfather&#x2019;s new car. That led him and his father to devise a box-shaped head support that allows his neck muscles to provide stability. Switches that can be activated with a head tilt were later added to control the turn signals, headlight dimming, horn and windshield wipers.
&#x201C;My neck and shoulder muscles are strong,&#x201D; Mr. Chargo said. &#x201C;My friends joke that I look like a middle linebacker from the chest up.&#x201D;
Mr. Chargo passed his driving test on the first try. He says that he has never caused an accident.
&#x201C;For the first 10,000 miles I was nervous, and everyone who rode with me was nervous,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But when I started my financial business, I had to drive a lot. I put 250,000 miles on my Econoline before I sold it and have over 200,000 on my &#x2019;93 minivan. Driving is second nature.&#x201D;
Mr. Chargo&#x2019;s control systems mostly use 1980s technology, although he has upgraded them. Today, there are many options for drivers with limited mobility. Input devices, including joysticks, levers and four-pin controllers like Mr. Chargo&#x2019;s, can be combined with the drive-by-wire systems in modern vehicles. He said drivers should investigate the options and match the system to their capabilities.
&#x201C;Then work at increasing your strength,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I still have to work out three times a week to maintain enough strength in my arms to operate a vehicle. It can be done.&#x201D;

HEADLINE: Golden Dawn Rattles Queens

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER and DANIELLA SILVA

 BODY:
IT was news to arouse the indignation of many residents of Queens: Golden Dawn, the neo-Nazi group based in Athens, had established an office in Astoria &#x2014; or so it seemed.&#xa;
&#xa;The evidence was elusive: late last month, a professional Web site suddenly appeared, showing the party&#x2019;s swastikalike logo set against a dark Manhattan skyline and calling on the city&#x2019;s Greek diaspora to donate food and clothing to a charity drive to benefit struggling poor people in Greece. There were pictures on the site: one was of a group of men with their backs turned to the camera, wearing black T-shirts reading, in Greek, &#x201C;Golden Dawn New York.&#x201D;
Although the site went down within days of its emergence &#x2014; targeted, it was reported, by Anonymous, the hackers&#x2019; group &#x2014; it provoked sufficient outrage that local politicians, doing what they do, rallied at a news conference to condemn the right-wing party, and a grass-roots protest movement sprang up in an effort to oppose it. 
The problem was &#x2014; and, indeed, still is &#x2014; that almost nothing is known about the party&#x2019;s actual presence in the neighborhood. Does Golden Dawn really have an office in Astoria, the center of the city&#x2019;s Greek community? That is not clear. What are its goals? Also unclear. Is its membership significant or minimal? No one knows for sure.
As far back as two years ago, one local resident says, he saw a car in the neighborhood with a Golden Dawn bumper sticker. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ve had people in New York for a while now,&#x201D; said the resident, George Davis, 34, a Greek-American financial adviser. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not like these guys woke up yesterday and decided to join.&#x201D;
The Golden Dawn sightings became more frequent, and perceptible, over the summer when a few business owners in Astoria were approached by members of the group, asking for donations for the charity drive, said Nicholas Levis (pronounced Luh-VEES), an activist with Occupy Astoria-L.I.C. The men did not identify themselves at first, although they apparently returned days later with Golden Dawn T-shirts for those who had made contributions. When the business owners realized that the food and hand-me-downs they had given were destined for an ultranationalist party, some of them, Mr. Levis recalled, became upset.
It was around that time that party members also placed charity-drive collection boxes at the Stathakion Cultural Center in Astoria with labels that read, &#x201C;For Greeks Only.&#x201D; Christos Vournos, the first vice president of the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York, which is based at the center, said that he confronted the party members at the time and that they left the building &#x2014; but only after a near-altercation.
&#x201C;I almost had a fistfight with one of their members,&#x201D; Mr. Vournos said. &#x201C;One of their supporters came back and apologized and I said: &#x2018;If you want to perform your activities, it can&#x2019;t be here. Not here. No political parties &#x2014; none.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D;
Riding waves of economic apprehension and fears about illegal immigration, Golden Dawn won 18 of the Greek Parliament&#x2019;s 300 seats in national elections in June &#x2014; even after the party&#x2019;s chief spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, slapped a rival during a televised political debate. The party has increased its presence in middle-class areas of Greece with vows to &#x201C;rid the land of filth&#x201D; and is accused of being behind attacks against immigrants and journalists. According to its home page, the group has opened offices in Greek communities as far away as Montreal and Melbourne, Australia.
In New York, the party seemed to increase its outreach efforts starting late last month, after the appearance of the local chapter&#x2019;s Web site.
Christos Skarlatos, 67, works behind the counter at the Little Coffee Shop in Astoria. He said he was approached one day last month by a Golden Dawn member who asked if he could leave some Golden Dawn cards near the cash register. While Mr. Skarlatos said he had no fondness for the group &#x2014; &#x201C;I try to stay out of politics,&#x201D; he offered with a shrug &#x2014; he let the man leave about 30 cards behind. Within a week, he added, they were gone.
Mr. Davis, the financial adviser, said that he saw members of the party, in groups of three or four, coming and going from the Stathakion Cultural Center only weeks ago. &#x201C;This is still going on,&#x201D; he said, adding that he had asked officials at the center if the party was meeting there. &#x201C;Now that the leadership has seen the reaction from the community,&#x201D; Mr. Davis said, &#x201C;they&#x2019;re denouncing Golden Dawn.&#x201D;
That much seems to be true. Elias Tsekerides, president of the Hellenic federation, said in an interview this month that several Golden Dawn members had, indeed, dropped by the center weeks ago and hastily snapped some photos &#x2014; including, it appears, the one of the men in the party&#x2019;s black T-shirts.
&#x201C;They took some pictures without our knowledge and posted them to the Internet,&#x201D; Mr. Tsekerides (pronounced Seh-ker-RIDE-ees) said. &#x201C;We had calls from here and from Greece asking us, &#x2018;What are you guys doing giving them shelter?&#x2019; But there&#x2019;s no such thing. We do not associate with political parties, and they are extremists. What do they have to offer the community at large? Just divisiveness, nothing constructive, in our view.&#x201D;
Eventually, this street-level conflict, and its attendant whispering campaigns, caught the ears of local politicians who, on Oct. 5, held a rally in Athens Square Park in Astoria to denounce Golden Dawn. There was much condemnation of &#x201C;extremism&#x201D; and &#x201C;intolerance&#x201D; and &#x201C;bigotry&#x201D; and well-meaning words in praise of &#x201C;diversity&#x201D; and &#x201C;openness&#x201D; and &#x201C;broad coalitions.&#x201D; But what there wasn&#x2019;t was any new or actionable information about Golden Dawn New York.
Bill de Blasio, the city&#x2019;s public advocate, who organized the event, acknowledged that no one knew the whereabouts of the party&#x2019;s supposed office or the number of its supporters in New York. Costa Constantinides, the Democratic district leader, said he had never actually seen any local members of Golden Dawn and was more or less going on what he had picked up indirectly.
After the event, a phone call in search of some specifics to Peter F. Vallone Jr., the local city councilman, produced an e-mail from a spokesman saying that Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas, who represents Astoria, knew more about the group. While trying to be helpful, Ms. Simotas said, &#x201C;I only know a little &#x2014; and it&#x2019;s all secondhand.&#x201D;
Nonetheless, the following week, in a forceful show of solidarity, more than 200 people crowded into the basement of the Church of the Redeemer in Astoria to protest the presence of fascists whom no one could definitively locate. The groups represented included the Socialist Alternative, Al-Awda NY, the Union Theological Seminary and the Hell Gate Anarchist Black Cross.
Because it was not possible to speak in detail about Golden Dawn New York, the gathering became a kind of teach-in, with academics lecturing on Greek history in the post-Nazi era, what was called the failure of European immigration policy and the symbiotic relationship between Golden Dawn in Greece and the Greek power structure.
&#x201C;Does Golden Dawn have an office here like they&#x2019;re claiming online?&#x201D; Mr. Levis asked at the start of the event.
&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t actually know,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;But if they do turn up somewhere, at a storefront or a building, you can rest assured we&#x2019;ll be there till they&#x2019;re gone.&#x201D;

HEADLINE: After the Boom In Natural Gas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and ERIC LIPTON; Clifford Krauss reported from Evelyn, La., and Eric Lipton from Houston and Washington.

 BODY:
EVELYN, La.&#xa;
&#xa;THE crew of workers fought off the blistering Louisiana sun, jerking their wrenches to tighten the fat hoses that would connect their cement trucks to the Chesapeake Energy drill rig &#x2014; one of the last two rigs the company is still using to drill for natural gas here in the Haynesville Shale.
At its peak, Chesapeake ran 38 rigs in the region. All told, it has sunk more than 1,200 wells into the Haynesville, a gas-rich vein of dense rock that straddles Louisiana and Texas. Fed by a gold-rush mentality and easy money from Wall Street, Chesapeake and its competitors have done the same in other shale fields from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania.
For most of the country, the result has been cheaper energy. The nation is awash in so much natural gas that electric utilities, which burn the fuel in many generating plants, have curbed rate increases and switched more capacity to gas from coal, a dirtier fossil fuel. 
Companies and municipalities are deploying thousands of new gas-powered trucks and buses, curbing noxious diesel fumes and reducing the nation&#x2019;s reliance on imported oil.
And companies like fertilizer and chemical makers, which use gas as a raw material, are suddenly finding that the United States is an attractive place to put new factories, compared with, say, Asia, where gas is four times the price. Dow Chemical, which uses natural gas as a material for producing plastics, has assembled a list of 91 new manufacturing projects, representing $70 billion in potential investment and up to three million jobs, that various companies have proposed or begun because of cheap gas.
&#x201C;The country has stumbled into a windfall on the backs of these entrepreneurs,&#x201D; said Edward Hirs, a finance professor at the University of Houston who contributed to a report that estimated that the nation&#x2019;s economy benefited by more than $100 billion last year alone from the lower gas prices.
But while the gas rush has benefited most Americans, it&#x2019;s been a money loser so far for many of the gas exploration companies and their tens of thousands of investors.
The drillers punched so many holes and extracted so much gas through hydraulic fracturing that they have driven the price of natural gas to near-record lows. And because of the intricate financial deals and leasing arrangements that many of them struck during the boom, they were unable to pull their foot off the accelerator fast enough to avoid a crash in the price of natural gas, which is down more than 60 percent since the summer of 2008.
Although the bankers made a lot of money from the deal making and a handful of energy companies made fortunes by exiting at the market&#x2019;s peak, most of the industry has been bloodied &#x2014; forced to sell assets, take huge write-offs and shift as many drill rigs as possible from gas exploration to oil, whose price has held up much better.
Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which spent $41 billion to buy XTO Energy, a giant natural gas company, in 2010, when gas prices were almost double what they are today, minced no words about the industry&#x2019;s plight during an appearance in New York this summer.
&#x201C;We are all losing our shirts today,&#x201D; Mr. Tillerson said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re making no money. It&#x2019;s all in the red.&#x201D;
Like the recent credit bubble, the boom and bust in gas were driven in large part by tens of billions of dollars in creative financing engineered by investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Jefferies &#x26; Company.
After the financial crisis, the natural gas rush was one of the few major profit centers for Wall Street deal makers, who found willing takers among energy companies and foreign financial investors.
Big companies like Chesapeake and lesser-known outfits like Quicksilver Resources and Exco Resources were able to supercharge their growth with the global financing, transforming the face of energy in this country. In all, the top 50 oil and gas companies raised and spent an annual average of $126 billion over the last six years on drilling, land acquisition and other capital costs within the United States, double their capital spending as of 2005, according to an analysis by Ernst &#x26; Young.
Now the gas companies are committed to spending far more to produce gas than they can earn selling it. Their stock prices and debt ratings have been hammered.
&#x201C;We just killed more meat than we could drag back to the cave and eat,&#x201D; said Maynard Holt, co-president of Tudor Pickering Holt &#x26; Company, a Houston investment bank that has handled dozens of shale deals in the last four years. &#x201C;Now we have a problem.&#x201D;
A Master Salesman
Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, had a secret, and he was anxious to share it.
He called Ralph Eads III, a fraternity buddy from Duke who had become his go-to banker. Mr. McClendon explained that he had quietly acquired leases on hundreds of thousands of acres somewhere in the southern United States &#x2014; he would not say exactly where &#x2014; that could become one of the world&#x2019;s biggest natural gas fields.
But to develop the wells, he needed billions of dollars.
&#x201C;I can get the assets,&#x201D; Mr. McClendon told Mr. Eads, a vice chairman of Jefferies, according to three people who participated in that call, nearly five years ago. &#x201C;You have to get the money.&#x201D;
Get it he did. Mr. Eads, a pitch artist who projects the unrestrained enthusiasm of a college football coach, traveled the world, ultimately raising an extraordinary $28 billion for Mr. McClendon&#x2019;s &#x201C;secret&#x201D; venture in the Haynesville Shale, as well as other Chesapeake drilling projects.
Other bankers working in the glass office towers of downtown Houston were equally busy. While the skyscrapers are home to global giants like Chevron and lesser-known companies like Plains Exploration and Production, they also house storefronts for Wall Street deal makers who play a vital, though less visible, role in the nation&#x2019;s surging energy production.
Mr. Eads, 53, a Texas native, is a prince of this world. His financial innovations helped feed the gas drilling boom, and he has participated in $159 billion worth of oil and gas deals since 2007.
A Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brother of Mr. McClendon, he headed to Wall Street directly after Duke. He first earned a national profile in 2001, while working for the El Paso Corporation, a natural gas pipeline operator. Regulators accused El Paso of creating an artificial gas shortage in California in the previous year, contributing to a power crisis in the state. Although El Paso eventually settled the complaints for $1.7 billion, Mr. Eads said El Paso was guilty of nothing more than coming up with creative financial transactions.
&#x201C;I wake up every day thinking about how to finance big things,&#x201D; he said.
His tall, lanky frame and bellowing voice make him hard to miss, even in a large crowd. And his deal radar is never off, as he works the room at dinner parties and charity events.
That is how he met Jim Flores, the chief executive of Plains Exploration, who eventually invited him on a duck hunt.
After Mr. McClendon&#x2019;s urgent request for money, Mr. Eads put in a call to Mr. Flores to see if he might be willing to finance part of Chesapeake&#x2019;s Haynesville project.
&#x201C;Aubrey and I have calculated it, and it might be the largest gas field in the world,&#x201D; Mr. Eads said he told Mr. Flores, noting early results from a single well that showed unprecedented gas flows.
The type of deal he pitched, nicknamed &#x201C;cash and carry,&#x201D; was certainly aggressive and innovative. Plains would pay Chesapeake $1.7 billion to gain ownership of about one-third of the drilling rights that Chesapeake had leased in the Haynesville. Plains would also commit to paying out another $1.7 billion to cover half of Chesapeake&#x2019;s drilling costs, in return for part of the future profits.
&#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be a great investment,&#x201D; Mr. Flores said on the day the deal was announced in July 2008.
But the deal, like others later struck by Chesapeake, benefited Mr. Eads and Mr. McClendon and their companies far more than the people writing the big checks.
Chesapeake spent an average of $7,100 an acre on the drilling sites it had leased in the Haynesville. Plains paid Chesapeake the equivalent of $30,000 an acre.
Jefferies and the other firms involved in arranging the deal made an estimated $23 million on this transaction.
Much of the money that Mr. Eads raised for American gas drillers came from overseas oil and gas companies, like Total of France and Cnooc, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation. He told them the American shale revolution was an opportunity they simply could not afford to pass by.
&#x201C;This is like owning the Empire State Building,&#x201D; Mr. Eads said, recalling one of his favorite lines. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not going to be repeated. You miss the boat, you miss the boat.&#x201D;
In China, he was in awe at just how much money was available to invest. One senior executive at a major Chinese oil company that Mr. Eads declined to identify, citing the confidential nature of the negotiations, explained that the country wanted to move as much as $750 billion from United States Treasury bonds into the North American energy business.
Mr. Eads was only happy to oblige, helping to secure $3.4 billion from the Chinese for Chesapeake through two deals.
Not everyone believed the story line of endless profits and opportunity. Mr. Eads said one oil company executive whom he would not identify had rejected his pitch, complaining, &#x201C;The reason for the glut is you guys.&#x201D; The executive said he expected natural gas prices to plummet.
In private, Mr. Eads acknowledged that his pitches involved a bit of bluster.
&#x201C;Typically, we represent sellers, so I want to persuade buyers that gas prices are going to be as high as possible,&#x201D; Mr. Eads said. &#x201C;The buyers are big boys &#x2014; they are giant companies with thousands of gas economists who know way more than I know. Caveat emptor.&#x201D;
Investment banking revenue at Jefferies reached $1.1 billion in 2011, a record for the firm, up from $750 million in 2007. Energy deals were cited among the biggest drivers of that surge, which came despite major problems at the firm because of its exposure to European sovereign debt.
Mr. Eads would not say how much he had been compensated for this bonanza. But Dealogic, a firm that tracks Wall Street transactions, estimated that Jefferies collected at least $124 million in fees from Chesapeake since 2007, a large share of its overall revenue on oil and gas deals, which ranged between $390 million and $700 million during the same period, according to two different industry estimates.
Even before the recent round of deals, Mr. Eads was a wealthy man. He lives in a sprawling, 11,000-square-foot lakefront mansion in Houston and has a wine cellar with 6,500 bottles. In 2010, he bought an $8.2 million home in the exclusive West End of Aspen, Colo., whose other homeowners have included Jack Nicholson and Mariah Carey.
Mr. Eads&#x2019;s success has produced no shortage of jealousy in Houston.
&#x201C;A lot of people don&#x2019;t like him because he got ahead of everyone else,&#x201D; said Chip Johnson, chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas, who made two big deals in which Mr. Eads was involved. &#x201C;He got the reputation for overselling, but I have a hard time believing you can fool the big companies.&#x201D;
&#x201C;Without him,&#x201D; Mr. Johnson added, &#x201C;the country would not have had the huge gas supply as quickly as we did.&#x201D;
Others have been more critical.
&#x201C;He is like the bartender serving drinks for people who can&#x2019;t handle it,&#x201D; said Fadel Gheit, a managing director at Oppenheimer &#x26; Company, about Mr. Eads. &#x201C;And the whole gas industry has gotten a rude awakening, a hangover, with gas prices plummeting. The investment bankers were happy to help with a smile and get their cut.&#x201D;
A Train Without Brakes
&#x201C;Quit drilling,&#x201D; T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, barked to his fellow board members at Exco Resources, a small, independent drilling company based in Dallas that, like Chesapeake, had made a big bet in the Haynesville. &#x201C;Shut her down.&#x201D;
Mr. Pickens, 84, made billions of dollars as a hedge fund manager and wildcatter drilling for oil and gas. He borrowed heavily to build up the oil and gas reserves of Mesa Inc. in the late 1980s before losing the company during its financial difficulties a decade later, when drooping gas prices hurt its ability to repay debts and pay dividends. He wanted Exco to avoid a similar fate.
There was only one problem: under the contracts that Exco signed, it couldn&#x2019;t stop drilling.
The company followed Chesapeake&#x2019;s lead and struck its own $1.3 billion cash-and-carry deal with the BG Group, a British gas company. BG paid Exco $655 million in cash upfront and agreed to foot 75 percent of the bill for future drilling in the Haynesville in return for a share in future profits on the gas produced.
When the arrangement was made, it seemed like a winner all around. Exco had more than 53,000 acres of leases in the Haynesville, but like Chesapeake, it lacked the money it needed to drill on all the land. BG&#x2019;s financing helped Exco to increase the number of rigs it had working in the Haynesville to 22 from four.
Nevertheless, the agreement, negotiated by Goldman Sachs, came with some important strings attached: Exco had to keep all 22 rigs drilling for gas, even as the price was dropping. BG wanted to reach certain targets for drilling wells and producing gas in the United States, and it was intent on sticking with the plan, even if its partner now insisted that it made no economic sense.
&#x201C;They are great partners, but they have their pedal down around the world, and we are part of that,&#x201D; Douglas H. Miller, Exco&#x2019;s chief executive, explained to Wall Street analysts last year.
Mr. Pickens was furious. &#x201C;We are stupid to drill these wells,&#x201D; he said in a recent interview.
But Exco was not alone. Many of its fellow gas companies &#x2014; including Chesapeake and Petrohawk &#x2014; had little choice through last year but to keep drilling, no matter how low the price fell or how big a glut was forming.
It wasn&#x2019;t just the cash-and-carry deals that were forcing them to drill.
The land that the natural gas companies had leased, in most cases, came with &#x201C;use it or lose it&#x201D; clauses that required them to start drilling within three years and begin paying royalties to the landowners or lose the leases.
Exco, Chesapeake and others initially boasted about how many acres they had managed to lock up. But after paying bonuses of up to $20,000 an acre to the landowners, the companies could not afford to lose the leases, even if the low price of natural gas meant that drilling more wells was a losing proposition.
The industry was also driven to keep drilling because of the perverse way that Wall Street values oil and gas companies. Analysts rate drillers on their so-called proven reserves, an estimate of how much oil and gas they have in the ground. Simply by drilling a single well, they could then count as part of their reserves nearby future well sites. In this case, higher reserves generally led to a higher stock price, even though some of the companies were losing money each quarter and piling up billions of dollars in debt.
Just as in the earlier real estate bubble, the main players publicly predicted success even as, privately, their doubts were growing, court documents show.
Mr. McClendon suggested in August 2008 to Wall Street analysts that he had fundamentally transformed the once-risky, century-old oil and gas business into something with the reliability of an assembly line.
&#x201C;We consider ourselves to be in the gas manufacturing business, and that requires four inputs in our opinion &#x2014; those inputs are land, people, science and, of course, capital,&#x201D; Mr. McClendon told the analysts. &#x201C;We think that&#x2019;s pretty impressive and hope you do as well.&#x201D;
But soon after, he told some Chesapeake employees that the company might have made some big mistakes. &#x201C;What was a fair price 90 days ago for a lease is now overpriced by a factor of at least 2x given the dramatic worsening of the natural gas and financial markets,&#x201D; Mr. McClendon wrote in an October 2008 e-mail that has since become public in a lawsuit against Chesapeake.
And as with so many other shale gas players, Chesapeake struck so many complicated financial deals that it couldn&#x2019;t stop ramping up the gas factory.
&#x201C;At least half and probably two-thirds or three-quarters of our gas drilling is what I would call involuntary,&#x201D; Mr. McClendon acknowledged at one point.
For him, the drilling binge had some significant financial consequences. During the good times, Chesapeake paid him handsomely in cash and perks. He achieved a net worth of over $1 billion, and he made it to the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. He bought homes in Bermuda, Colorado and Hawaii, as well as a stake in the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team.
An unusual company program also allowed Mr. McClendon to buy a small personal stake in Chesapeake&#x2019;s wells. That is expected to reap more than $400 million for him over the 15- to 20-year life of the wells, although it has strained his personal finances for now. An investigation by Reuters detailed how Mr. McClendon had borrowed heavily from Chesapeake business partners to help finance his share of the wells&#x2019; costs. That and other issues drew the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shook investor confidence in him and prompted a shake-up of Chesapeake&#x2019;s board that included the removal of Mr. McClendon as chairman.
(Mr. McClendon refused requests to be interviewed for this article, and he did not respond to a list of questions.)
Mr. Eads appears to have fared better. He had seen the coming crash, and, as any master salesman would, found a way to play both sides. He continued to persuade new investors of the great potential in shale while telling his longtime clients to cash out.
&#x201C;It is a great time to sell,&#x201D; Mr. Eads recalled telling Terry Pegula, the founder of East Resources, who had built up his own operation in the Marcellus region of Pennsylvania from one well to 75 over the course of one year. &#x201C;With all these new plays popping up, I had a real concern gas prices would weaken.&#x201D;
Mr. Eads then helped arrange what will go down as one of the great early paydays of the shale revolution: the 2010 sale of East Resources, which Mr. Pegula had started with $7,500 borrowed from family and friends, to Royal Dutch Shell for $4.7 billion.
There were a handful of other such profit takers, including the Houston businessman Floyd Wilson, who created a company in 2003 called Petrohawk Energy with the intention from the start of selling it. Petrohawk drilled its first Haynesville well in 2008. Last year, it sold itself to an Australian energy conglomerate, BHP Billiton, in a $15 billion deal that brought Mr. Wilson and other executives a payout worth at least $304 million.
But for many gas drillers, there has been only pain.
Exco, whose production of natural gas was still rising in the Haynesville as of early this year, saw its credit rating downgraded in May. It reported a loss of nearly $780 million for the first half of the year, before write-offs and other adjustments, even after it reduced its work force and rig count. BG, its joint venture partner, reported in July that it was taking a $1.3 billion write-down on its shale gas investments in the United States, including the Haynesville deal with Exco.
Plains Exploration, which celebrated its first deal with Chesapeake back in 2008, reported a loss for the first quarter this year, but has since shifted heavily away from gas to oil production and is making money again. Warm weather last winter exacerbated the glut to historic levels, reducing prices even further, since so little gas was needed to heat homes in many parts of the nation.
Chesapeake&#x2019;s stock price sank this year after it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. The company is trying to raise $14 billion this year by shedding assets, a goal it has almost reached with huge recent sales of West Texas oil and gas fields and pipelines to Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron.
To help the company through this difficult patch, Mr. McClendon turned to his old friend, Mr. Eads. Jefferies &#x26; Company, joined by Goldman Sachs, offered Chesapeake an emergency $4 billion unsecured bridge loan, at 8.5 percent interest, to give the company a lifeline until it could sell enough assets to keep afloat. (The company says it intends to pay back the entire loan this year from recent sales.)
In hindsight, it should have been clear to everyone that a bust was likely to occur, with so many new wells being drilled and so much money financing them.
But everyone was too busy working out new deals to pay much heed.
The bust has certainly hit the Haynesville hard. Some local landowners, having spent their initial lease bonuses, are now deeply in debt. Local restaurants and other businesses are suffering steep losses now that so many drillers have left town.
&#x201C;At this point we&#x2019;re struggling,&#x201D; said Shelby Spurlock, co-owner of Cafe 171 in the town of Mansfield. The restaurant is decorated with wall collages of drill worker uniforms from companies that are leaving the area. Once open from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. and employing four servers, the restaurant has cut its hours and is down to two servers. &#x201C;Our very existence is in danger,&#x201D; she sighed.
Mr. Eads, ever the deal maker, is unfazed. He tells anyone who will listen that the price of natural gas will eventually recover. He is making money, meanwhile, helping struggling companies and opportunistic investors strike deals at the new, lower prices.
&#x201C;These shale assets are forever,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;They are going to produce for a hundred years.&#x201D;

HEADLINE: Returning to the Road, In Style and With Help

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
Hebron, Ohio
BRUCE CHARGO conceded that he sometimes drove his 1958 Dodge Power Wagon aggressively.
''Oh yeah,'' he said, in a telephone interview. ''That's the whole idea of putting a 375-horse Hemi in there.''
Like many of us, Mr. Chargo, 53, of Clio, Mich., enjoys the feel of a high-performance machine and takes pride in his ability to maneuver it.
Unlike most of us, he doesn't drive with his hands and feet. Mr. Chargo was paralyzed from the chest down in a childhood swimming accident and consequently needs special controls to drive by using only his arms. His hands, wrists and legs are immobile.
Technology has given severely impaired people like Mr. Chargo the ability to drive, but it doesn't come easily. Vehicles outfitted for those with limited muscle control are expensive, and learning to operate one requires determination. It took Mr. Chargo months of practicing in his driveway and on the road to learn. Then, years later, he acted on a long-suppressed love of performance vehicles, bought a collectible truck and turned it into a hot rod. 
I met Mr. Chargo at the Mopar Nationals here, an event for fans of Chrysler-built collectibles and high-performance machinery. Amid the winged Dodge Charger Daytonas and the purple 'Cudas, Mr. Chargo's orange Power Wagon, a 4-wheel-drive utility vehicle that has a cult following, stood out. When Mr. Chargo drove it, he stopped the show.
Asked to move his truck to another location for a photo session, Mr. Chargo drove his wheelchair to the rear doors of the Power Wagon and lowered its lift. He motored onto the platform, which raised him into the truck. He propelled himself to the driver's area and locked his wheelchair into place.
To start the truck, he moved his right arm to toggle switches on the console. His left arm nestled between the four pins of a controller that operates throttle and brake. Flicking a toggle with his right arm turned on the ignition, a second toggle engaged the starter and a third put the automatic transmission into drive. He then moved his right arm into another four-pin controller that steers the vehicle.
And off he went, with all the confidence of a man who has driven half a million miles using controls that require no hand or leg movements.
While the control system may be its most interesting feature, the Power Wagon itself stands out. He started looking for a performance vehicle in 2000, but was limited to vans because of his wheelchair. He found the Power Wagon, which was wide enough, for sale on the Web and bought it from a California man. Mr. Chargo spent 11 years having the van built to his specifications.
From the factory, the Power Wagon had an optional 315-cubic-inch V-8, but Mr. Chargo installed a 1958 Chrysler 392 Hemi, modified to generate 375 horsepower. It's backed by Chrysler's 727 automatic transmission, a favorite of drag racers, and power is delivered to stout Dana front and rear axles, like those in 1980s-vintage Dodge trucks. The project cost about $115,000, he said.
In 1977, the year of his accident, Mr. Chargo had been driving a 1971 Plymouth Duster. He was in high school and lived with his parents on a Michigan farm. Like many teenagers, he had an avid interest in sports and fast cars.
He was injured on a July afternoon after he and his friends decided to go swimming.
''It was one of those dumb things kids do,'' Mr. Chargo said. ''My buddies and I had added sand to the farm pond's beach. It was a hot day, and we had a trampoline, so we put it in the water. Instead of jumping off feet first, I dove.''
His head hit the sandy bottom of the pond, and he felt something like a severe electric shock as his spinal cord was damaged. Unable to move, he was pulled from the pond by his father and a friend. After five months in traction, he was moved to a rehabilitation facility in Colorado.
''At first, being a 17-year-old, it kind of kicks you in the stuff to not be independent,'' he said. When he started rehabilitation, the doctors told him his injury was so high up his spinal cord that he had very little strength in his arms and no function in his hands or wrists.
''They wanted to put me in a sip-and-puff wheelchair, a chair controlled by mouth, but I insisted on one I could drive moving a toggle with my arm,'' he said. ''My arm was so weak I could only go backward at first, but it eventually got strong enough to operate the chair.''
Mr. Chargo came home on New Year's Day, 1978. His father bought a van and installed a lift for his son's wheelchair. Mr. Chargo graduated from high school with his class and earned a degree at Western Michigan University.
Today, he's a financial planner managing accounts worth over $10 million, owns a home in Clio and is married to Tammy Dalrymple-Chargo, who was with him at the Mopar Nationals.
''I do want to emphasize how important my wife is in my life,'' Mr. Chargo wrote in an e-mail. ''Not only is she my best friend and a wonderful wife, she is my primary caregiver. Because of my disability, I require a lot of care.''
The Power Wagon is the fourth vehicle Mr. Chargo has equipped with special controls. Because the custom truck is more than mere transportation, it has taken him to a new place. One might say that, as a driver who once relished performance cars, he's come all the way back. People do come back from horrible accidents -- witness the return of the IndyCar champion Alex Zanardi to motor sports after losing his legs in a racing crash.
Mr. Chargo's return to the driver's seat in 1984 was prompted by a chance encounter with a quadriplegic man who had regained his ability to drive by using a control system similar to the one Mr. Chargo now uses. The man, whose name Mr. Chargo cannot remember, let him try the van in a parking lot, but Mr. Chargo's arms weren't strong enough to operate the controls.
Still, a seed was planted. He had a doctor analyze his physical skills to determine if he was capable of driving, and the doctor recommended a system that could be operated with limited arm movement and minimal effort. The family's van was outfitted, and a driver rehabilitation specialist taught him how to use the equipment.
''It was really hard to learn to drive,'' Mr. Chargo said. ''I wasn't strong enough. I was going to college full time, so I would go to school during the week and come home on the weekends, get in the van and steer it back and forth in the driveway for hours. I was determined to drive.''
While learning to operate his family's van, Mr. Chargo, whose back muscles cannot support him, fell over in his chair when turning into his driveway and crashed into his grandfather's new car. That led him and his father to devise a box-shaped head support that allows his neck muscles to provide stability. Switches that can be activated with a head tilt were later added to control the turn signals, headlight dimming, horn and windshield wipers.
''My neck and shoulder muscles are strong,'' Mr. Chargo said. ''My friends joke that I look like a middle linebacker from the chest up.''
Mr. Chargo passed his driving test on the first try. He says that he has never caused an accident.
''For the first 10,000 miles I was nervous, and everyone who rode with me was nervous,'' he said. ''But when I started my financial business, I had to drive a lot. I put 250,000 miles on my Econoline before I sold it and have over 200,000 on my '93 minivan. Driving is second nature.''
Mr. Chargo's control systems mostly use 1980s technology, although he has upgraded them. Today, there are many options for drivers with limited mobility. Input devices, including joysticks, levers and four-pin controllers like Mr. Chargo's, can be combined with the drive-by-wire systems in modern vehicles. He said drivers should investigate the options and match the system to their capabilities.
''Then work at increasing your strength,'' he said. ''I still have to work out three times a week to maintain enough strength in my arms to operate a vehicle. It can be done.''

HEADLINE: After the Boom In Natural Gas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and ERIC LIPTON; Clifford Krauss reported from Evelyn, La., and Eric Lipton from Houston and Washington.

 BODY:
EVELYN, La.
THE crew of workers fought off the blistering Louisiana sun, jerking their wrenches to tighten the fat hoses that would connect their cement trucks to the Chesapeake Energy drill rig -- one of the last two rigs the company is still using to drill for natural gas here in the Haynesville Shale.
At its peak, Chesapeake ran 38 rigs in the region. All told, it has sunk more than 1,200 wells into the Haynesville, a gas-rich vein of dense rock that straddles Louisiana and Texas. Fed by a gold-rush mentality and easy money from Wall Street, Chesapeake and its competitors have done the same in other shale fields from Oklahoma to Pennsylvania.
For most of the country, the result has been cheaper energy. The nation is awash in so much natural gas that electric utilities, which burn the fuel in many generating plants, have curbed rate increases and switched more capacity to gas from coal, a dirtier fossil fuel. 
Companies and municipalities are deploying thousands of new gas-powered trucks and buses, curbing noxious diesel fumes and reducing the nation's reliance on imported oil.
And companies like fertilizer and chemical makers, which use gas as a raw material, are suddenly finding that the United States is an attractive place to put new factories, compared with, say, Asia, where gas is four times the price. Dow Chemical, which uses natural gas as a material for producing plastics, has assembled a list of 91 new manufacturing projects, representing $70 billion in potential investment and up to three million jobs, that various companies have proposed or begun because of cheap gas.
''The country has stumbled into a windfall on the backs of these entrepreneurs,'' said Edward Hirs, a finance professor at the University of Houston who contributed to a report that estimated that the nation's economy benefited by more than $100 billion last year alone from the lower gas prices.
But while the gas rush has benefited most Americans, it's been a money loser so far for many of the gas exploration companies and their tens of thousands of investors.
The drillers punched so many holes and extracted so much gas through hydraulic fracturing that they have driven the price of natural gas to near-record lows. And because of the intricate financial deals and leasing arrangements that many of them struck during the boom, they were unable to pull their foot off the accelerator fast enough to avoid a crash in the price of natural gas, which is down more than 60 percent since the summer of 2008.
Although the bankers made a lot of money from the deal making and a handful of energy companies made fortunes by exiting at the market's peak, most of the industry has been bloodied -- forced to sell assets, take huge write-offs and shift as many drill rigs as possible from gas exploration to oil, whose price has held up much better.
Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which spent $41 billion to buy XTO Energy, a giant natural gas company, in 2010, when gas prices were almost double what they are today, minced no words about the industry's plight during an appearance in New York this summer.
''We are all losing our shirts today,'' Mr. Tillerson said. ''We're making no money. It's all in the red.''
Like the recent credit bubble, the boom and bust in gas were driven in large part by tens of billions of dollars in creative financing engineered by investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Jefferies & Company.
After the financial crisis, the natural gas rush was one of the few major profit centers for Wall Street deal makers, who found willing takers among energy companies and foreign financial investors.
Big companies like Chesapeake and lesser-known outfits like Quicksilver Resources and Exco Resources were able to supercharge their growth with the global financing, transforming the face of energy in this country. In all, the top 50 oil and gas companies raised and spent an annual average of $126 billion over the last six years on drilling, land acquisition and other capital costs within the United States, double their capital spending as of 2005, according to an analysis by Ernst & Young.
Now the gas companies are committed to spending far more to produce gas than they can earn selling it. Their stock prices and debt ratings have been hammered.
''We just killed more meat than we could drag back to the cave and eat,'' said Maynard Holt, co-president of Tudor Pickering Holt & Company, a Houston investment bank that has handled dozens of shale deals in the last four years. ''Now we have a problem.''
A Master Salesman
Aubrey K. McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, had a secret, and he was anxious to share it.
He called Ralph Eads III, a fraternity buddy from Duke who had become his go-to banker. Mr. McClendon explained that he had quietly acquired leases on hundreds of thousands of acres somewhere in the southern United States -- he would not say exactly where -- that could become one of the world's biggest natural gas fields.
But to develop the wells, he needed billions of dollars.
''I can get the assets,'' Mr. McClendon told Mr. Eads, a vice chairman of Jefferies, according to three people who participated in that call, nearly five years ago. ''You have to get the money.''
Get it he did. Mr. Eads, a pitch artist who projects the unrestrained enthusiasm of a college football coach, traveled the world, ultimately raising an extraordinary $28 billion for Mr. McClendon's ''secret'' venture in the Haynesville Shale, as well as other Chesapeake drilling projects.
Other bankers working in the glass office towers of downtown Houston were equally busy. While the skyscrapers are home to global giants like Chevron and lesser-known companies like Plains Exploration and Production, they also house storefronts for Wall Street deal makers who play a vital, though less visible, role in the nation's surging energy production.
Mr. Eads, 53, a Texas native, is a prince of this world. His financial innovations helped feed the gas drilling boom, and he has participated in $159 billion worth of oil and gas deals since 2007.
A Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brother of Mr. McClendon, he headed to Wall Street directly after Duke. He first earned a national profile in 2001, while working for the El Paso Corporation, a natural gas pipeline operator. Regulators accused El Paso of creating an artificial gas shortage in California in the previous year, contributing to a power crisis in the state. Although El Paso eventually settled the complaints for $1.7 billion, Mr. Eads said El Paso was guilty of nothing more than coming up with creative financial transactions.
''I wake up every day thinking about how to finance big things,'' he said.
His tall, lanky frame and bellowing voice make him hard to miss, even in a large crowd. And his deal radar is never off, as he works the room at dinner parties and charity events.
That is how he met Jim Flores, the chief executive of Plains Exploration, who eventually invited him on a duck hunt.
After Mr. McClendon's urgent request for money, Mr. Eads put in a call to Mr. Flores to see if he might be willing to finance part of Chesapeake's Haynesville project.
''Aubrey and I have calculated it, and it might be the largest gas field in the world,'' Mr. Eads said he told Mr. Flores, noting early results from a single well that showed unprecedented gas flows.
The type of deal he pitched, nicknamed ''cash and carry,'' was certainly aggressive and innovative. Plains would pay Chesapeake $1.7 billion to gain ownership of about one-third of the drilling rights that Chesapeake had leased in the Haynesville. Plains would also commit to paying out another $1.7 billion to cover half of Chesapeake's drilling costs, in return for part of the future profits.
''It's going to be a great investment,'' Mr. Flores said on the day the deal was announced in July 2008.
But the deal, like others later struck by Chesapeake, benefited Mr. Eads and Mr. McClendon and their companies far more than the people writing the big checks.
Chesapeake spent an average of $7,100 an acre on the drilling sites it had leased in the Haynesville. Plains paid Chesapeake the equivalent of $30,000 an acre.
Jefferies and the other firms involved in arranging the deal made an estimated $23 million on this transaction.
Much of the money that Mr. Eads raised for American gas drillers came from overseas oil and gas companies, like Total of France and Cnooc, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation. He told them the American shale revolution was an opportunity they simply could not afford to pass by.
''This is like owning the Empire State Building,'' Mr. Eads said, recalling one of his favorite lines. ''It's not going to be repeated. You miss the boat, you miss the boat.''
In China, he was in awe at just how much money was available to invest. One senior executive at a major Chinese oil company that Mr. Eads declined to identify, citing the confidential nature of the negotiations, explained that the country wanted to move as much as $750 billion from United States Treasury bonds into the North American energy business.
Mr. Eads was only happy to oblige, helping to secure $3.4 billion from the Chinese for Chesapeake through two deals.
Not everyone believed the story line of endless profits and opportunity. Mr. Eads said one oil company executive whom he would not identify had rejected his pitch, complaining, ''The reason for the glut is you guys.'' The executive said he expected natural gas prices to plummet.
In private, Mr. Eads acknowledged that his pitches involved a bit of bluster.
''Typically, we represent sellers, so I want to persuade buyers that gas prices are going to be as high as possible,'' Mr. Eads said. ''The buyers are big boys -- they are giant companies with thousands of gas economists who know way more than I know. Caveat emptor.''
Investment banking revenue at Jefferies reached $1.1 billion in 2011, a record for the firm, up from $750 million in 2007. Energy deals were cited among the biggest drivers of that surge, which came despite major problems at the firm because of its exposure to European sovereign debt.
Mr. Eads would not say how much he had been compensated for this bonanza. But Dealogic, a firm that tracks Wall Street transactions, estimated that Jefferies collected at least $124 million in fees from Chesapeake since 2007, a large share of its overall revenue on oil and gas deals, which ranged between $390 million and $700 million during the same period, according to two different industry estimates.
Even before the recent round of deals, Mr. Eads was a wealthy man. He lives in a sprawling, 11,000-square-foot lakefront mansion in Houston and has a wine cellar with 6,500 bottles. In 2010, he bought an $8.2 million home in the exclusive West End of Aspen, Colo., whose other homeowners have included Jack Nicholson and Mariah Carey.
Mr. Eads's success has produced no shortage of jealousy in Houston.
''A lot of people don't like him because he got ahead of everyone else,'' said Chip Johnson, chief executive of Carrizo Oil and Gas, who made two big deals in which Mr. Eads was involved. ''He got the reputation for overselling, but I have a hard time believing you can fool the big companies.''
''Without him,'' Mr. Johnson added, ''the country would not have had the huge gas supply as quickly as we did.''
Others have been more critical.
''He is like the bartender serving drinks for people who can't handle it,'' said Fadel Gheit, a managing director at Oppenheimer & Company, about Mr. Eads. ''And the whole gas industry has gotten a rude awakening, a hangover, with gas prices plummeting. The investment bankers were happy to help with a smile and get their cut.''
A Train Without Brakes
''Quit drilling,'' T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, barked to his fellow board members at Exco Resources, a small, independent drilling company based in Dallas that, like Chesapeake, had made a big bet in the Haynesville. ''Shut her down.''
Mr. Pickens, 84, made billions of dollars as a hedge fund manager and wildcatter drilling for oil and gas. He borrowed heavily to build up the oil and gas reserves of Mesa Inc. in the late 1980s before losing the company during its financial difficulties a decade later, when drooping gas prices hurt its ability to repay debts and pay dividends. He wanted Exco to avoid a similar fate.
There was only one problem: under the contracts that Exco signed, it couldn't stop drilling.
The company followed Chesapeake's lead and struck its own $1.3 billion cash-and-carry deal with the BG Group, a British gas company. BG paid Exco $655 million in cash upfront and agreed to foot 75 percent of the bill for future drilling in the Haynesville in return for a share in future profits on the gas produced.
When the arrangement was made, it seemed like a winner all around. Exco had more than 53,000 acres of leases in the Haynesville, but like Chesapeake, it lacked the money it needed to drill on all the land. BG's financing helped Exco to increase the number of rigs it had working in the Haynesville to 22 from four.
Nevertheless, the agreement, negotiated by Goldman Sachs, came with some important strings attached: Exco had to keep all 22 rigs drilling for gas, even as the price was dropping. BG wanted to reach certain targets for drilling wells and producing gas in the United States, and it was intent on sticking with the plan, even if its partner now insisted that it made no economic sense.
''They are great partners, but they have their pedal down around the world, and we are part of that,'' Douglas H. Miller, Exco's chief executive, explained to Wall Street analysts last year.
Mr. Pickens was furious. ''We are stupid to drill these wells,'' he said in a recent interview.
But Exco was not alone. Many of its fellow gas companies -- including Chesapeake and Petrohawk -- had little choice through last year but to keep drilling, no matter how low the price fell or how big a glut was forming.
It wasn't just the cash-and-carry deals that were forcing them to drill.
The land that the natural gas companies had leased, in most cases, came with ''use it or lose it'' clauses that required them to start drilling within three years and begin paying royalties to the landowners or lose the leases.
Exco, Chesapeake and others initially boasted about how many acres they had managed to lock up. But after paying bonuses of up to $20,000 an acre to the landowners, the companies could not afford to lose the leases, even if the low price of natural gas meant that drilling more wells was a losing proposition.
The industry was also driven to keep drilling because of the perverse way that Wall Street values oil and gas companies. Analysts rate drillers on their so-called proven reserves, an estimate of how much oil and gas they have in the ground. Simply by drilling a single well, they could then count as part of their reserves nearby future well sites. In this case, higher reserves generally led to a higher stock price, even though some of the companies were losing money each quarter and piling up billions of dollars in debt.
Just as in the earlier real estate bubble, the main players publicly predicted success even as, privately, their doubts were growing, court documents show.
Mr. McClendon suggested in August 2008 to Wall Street analysts that he had fundamentally transformed the once-risky, century-old oil and gas business into something with the reliability of an assembly line.
''We consider ourselves to be in the gas manufacturing business, and that requires four inputs in our opinion -- those inputs are land, people, science and, of course, capital,'' Mr. McClendon told the analysts. ''We think that's pretty impressive and hope you do as well.''
But soon after, he told some Chesapeake employees that the company might have made some big mistakes. ''What was a fair price 90 days ago for a lease is now overpriced by a factor of at least 2x given the dramatic worsening of the natural gas and financial markets,'' Mr. McClendon wrote in an October 2008 e-mail that has since become public in a lawsuit against Chesapeake.
And as with so many other shale gas players, Chesapeake struck so many complicated financial deals that it couldn't stop ramping up the gas factory.
''At least half and probably two-thirds or three-quarters of our gas drilling is what I would call involuntary,'' Mr. McClendon acknowledged at one point.
For him, the drilling binge had some significant financial consequences. During the good times, Chesapeake paid him handsomely in cash and perks. He achieved a net worth of over $1 billion, and he made it to the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans. He bought homes in Bermuda, Colorado and Hawaii, as well as a stake in the Oklahoma City Thunder basketball team.
An unusual company program also allowed Mr. McClendon to buy a small personal stake in Chesapeake's wells. That is expected to reap more than $400 million for him over the 15- to 20-year life of the wells, although it has strained his personal finances for now. An investigation by Reuters detailed how Mr. McClendon had borrowed heavily from Chesapeake business partners to help finance his share of the wells' costs. That and other issues drew the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shook investor confidence in him and prompted a shake-up of Chesapeake's board that included the removal of Mr. McClendon as chairman.
(Mr. McClendon refused requests to be interviewed for this article, and he did not respond to a list of questions.)
Mr. Eads appears to have fared better. He had seen the coming crash, and, as any master salesman would, found a way to play both sides. He continued to persuade new investors of the great potential in shale while telling his longtime clients to cash out.
''It is a great time to sell,'' Mr. Eads recalled telling Terry Pegula, the founder of East Resources, who had built up his own operation in the Marcellus region of Pennsylvania from one well to 75 over the course of one year. ''With all these new plays popping up, I had a real concern gas prices would weaken.''
Mr. Eads then helped arrange what will go down as one of the great early paydays of the shale revolution: the 2010 sale of East Resources, which Mr. Pegula had started with $7,500 borrowed from family and friends, to Royal Dutch Shell for $4.7 billion.
There were a handful of other such profit takers, including the Houston businessman Floyd Wilson, who created a company in 2003 called Petrohawk Energy with the intention from the start of selling it. Petrohawk drilled its first Haynesville well in 2008. Last year, it sold itself to an Australian energy conglomerate, BHP Billiton, in a $15 billion deal that brought Mr. Wilson and other executives a payout worth at least $304 million.
But for many gas drillers, there has been only pain.
Exco, whose production of natural gas was still rising in the Haynesville as of early this year, saw its credit rating downgraded in May. It reported a loss of nearly $780 million for the first half of the year, before write-offs and other adjustments, even after it reduced its work force and rig count. BG, its joint venture partner, reported in July that it was taking a $1.3 billion write-down on its shale gas investments in the United States, including the Haynesville deal with Exco.
Plains Exploration, which celebrated its first deal with Chesapeake back in 2008, reported a loss for the first quarter this year, but has since shifted heavily away from gas to oil production and is making money again. Warm weather last winter exacerbated the glut to historic levels, reducing prices even further, since so little gas was needed to heat homes in many parts of the nation.
Chesapeake's stock price sank this year after it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and then used those investments as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. The company is trying to raise $14 billion this year by shedding assets, a goal it has almost reached with huge recent sales of West Texas oil and gas fields and pipelines to Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron.
To help the company through this difficult patch, Mr. McClendon turned to his old friend, Mr. Eads. Jefferies & Company, joined by Goldman Sachs, offered Chesapeake an emergency $4 billion unsecured bridge loan, at 8.5 percent interest, to give the company a lifeline until it could sell enough assets to keep afloat. (The company says it intends to pay back the entire loan this year from recent sales.)
In hindsight, it should have been clear to everyone that a bust was likely to occur, with so many new wells being drilled and so much money financing them.
But everyone was too busy working out new deals to pay much heed.
The bust has certainly hit the Haynesville hard. Some local landowners, having spent their initial lease bonuses, are now deeply in debt. Local restaurants and other businesses are suffering steep losses now that so many drillers have left town.
''At this point we're struggling,'' said Shelby Spurlock, co-owner of Cafe 171 in the town of Mansfield. The restaurant is decorated with wall collages of drill worker uniforms from companies that are leaving the area. Once open from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. and employing four servers, the restaurant has cut its hours and is down to two servers. ''Our very existence is in danger,'' she sighed.
Mr. Eads, ever the deal maker, is unfazed. He tells anyone who will listen that the price of natural gas will eventually recover. He is making money, meanwhile, helping struggling companies and opportunistic investors strike deals at the new, lower prices.
''These shale assets are forever,'' he said. ''They are going to produce for a hundred years.''

HEADLINE: Golden Dawn Rattles Queens

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER and DANIELLA SILVA

 BODY:
IT was news to arouse the indignation of many residents of Queens: Golden Dawn, the neo-Nazi group based in Athens, had established an office in Astoria -- or so it seemed.
The evidence was elusive: late last month, a professional Web site suddenly appeared, showing the party's swastikalike logo set against a dark Manhattan skyline and calling on the city's Greek diaspora to donate food and clothing to a charity drive to benefit struggling poor people in Greece. There were pictures on the site: one was of a group of men with their backs turned to the camera, wearing black T-shirts reading, in Greek, ''Golden Dawn New York.''
Although the site went down within days of its emergence -- targeted, it was reported, by Anonymous, the hackers' group -- it provoked sufficient outrage that local politicians, doing what they do, rallied at a news conference to condemn the right-wing party, and a grass-roots protest movement sprang up in an effort to oppose it. 
The problem was -- and, indeed, still is -- that almost nothing is known about the party's actual presence in the neighborhood. Does Golden Dawn really have an office in Astoria, the center of the city's Greek community? That is not clear. What are its goals? Also unclear. Is its membership significant or minimal? No one knows for sure.
As far back as two years ago, one local resident says, he saw a car in the neighborhood with a Golden Dawn bumper sticker. ''They've had people in New York for a while now,'' said the resident, George Davis, 34, a Greek-American financial adviser. ''It's not like these guys woke up yesterday and decided to join.''
The Golden Dawn sightings became more frequent, and perceptible, over the summer when a few business owners in Astoria were approached by members of the group, asking for donations for the charity drive, said Nicholas Levis (pronounced Luh-VEES), an activist with Occupy Astoria-L.I.C. The men did not identify themselves at first, although they apparently returned days later with Golden Dawn T-shirts for those who had made contributions. When the business owners realized that the food and hand-me-downs they had given were destined for an ultranationalist party, some of them, Mr. Levis recalled, became upset.
It was around that time that party members also placed charity-drive collection boxes at the Stathakion Cultural Center in Astoria with labels that read, ''For Greeks Only.'' Christos Vournos, the first vice president of the Federation of Hellenic Societies of Greater New York, which is based at the center, said that he confronted the party members at the time and that they left the building -- but only after a near-altercation.
''I almost had a fistfight with one of their members,'' Mr. Vournos said. ''One of their supporters came back and apologized and I said: 'If you want to perform your activities, it can't be here. Not here. No political parties -- none.' ''
Riding waves of economic apprehension and fears about illegal immigration, Golden Dawn won 18 of the Greek Parliament's 300 seats in national elections in June -- even after the party's chief spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, slapped a rival during a televised political debate. The party has increased its presence in middle-class areas of Greece with vows to ''rid the land of filth'' and is accused of being behind attacks against immigrants and journalists. According to its home page, the group has opened offices in Greek communities as far away as Montreal and Melbourne, Australia.
In New York, the party seemed to increase its outreach efforts starting late last month, after the appearance of the local chapter's Web site.
Christos Skarlatos, 67, works behind the counter at the Little Coffee Shop in Astoria. He said he was approached one day last month by a Golden Dawn member who asked if he could leave some Golden Dawn cards near the cash register. While Mr. Skarlatos said he had no fondness for the group -- ''I try to stay out of politics,'' he offered with a shrug -- he let the man leave about 30 cards behind. Within a week, he added, they were gone.
Mr. Davis, the financial adviser, said that he saw members of the party, in groups of three or four, coming and going from the Stathakion Cultural Center only weeks ago. ''This is still going on,'' he said, adding that he had asked officials at the center if the party was meeting there. ''Now that the leadership has seen the reaction from the community,'' Mr. Davis said, ''they're denouncing Golden Dawn.''
That much seems to be true. Elias Tsekerides, president of the Hellenic federation, said in an interview this month that several Golden Dawn members had, indeed, dropped by the center weeks ago and hastily snapped some photos -- including, it appears, the one of the men in the party's black T-shirts.
''They took some pictures without our knowledge and posted them to the Internet,'' Mr. Tsekerides (pronounced Seh-ker-RIDE-ees) said. ''We had calls from here and from Greece asking us, 'What are you guys doing giving them shelter?' But there's no such thing. We do not associate with political parties, and they are extremists. What do they have to offer the community at large? Just divisiveness, nothing constructive, in our view.''
Eventually, this street-level conflict, and its attendant whispering campaigns, caught the ears of local politicians who, on Oct. 5, held a rally in Athens Square Park in Astoria to denounce Golden Dawn. There was much condemnation of ''extremism'' and ''intolerance'' and ''bigotry'' and well-meaning words in praise of ''diversity'' and ''openness'' and ''broad coalitions.'' But what there wasn't was any new or actionable information about Golden Dawn New York.
Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, who organized the event, acknowledged that no one knew the whereabouts of the party's supposed office or the number of its supporters in New York. Costa Constantinides, the Democratic district leader, said he had never actually seen any local members of Golden Dawn and was more or less going on what he had picked up indirectly.
After the event, a phone call in search of some specifics to Peter F. Vallone Jr., the local city councilman, produced an e-mail from a spokesman saying that Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas, who represents Astoria, knew more about the group. While trying to be helpful, Ms. Simotas said, ''I only know a little -- and it's all secondhand.''
Nonetheless, the following week, in a forceful show of solidarity, more than 200 people crowded into the basement of the Church of the Redeemer in Astoria to protest the presence of fascists whom no one could definitively locate. The groups represented included the Socialist Alternative, Al-Awda NY, the Union Theological Seminary and the Hell Gate Anarchist Black Cross.
Because it was not possible to speak in detail about Golden Dawn New York, the gathering became a kind of teach-in, with academics lecturing on Greek history in the post-Nazi era, what was called the failure of European immigration policy and the symbiotic relationship between Golden Dawn in Greece and the Greek power structure.
''Does Golden Dawn have an office here like they're claiming online?'' Mr. Levis asked at the start of the event.
''We don't actually know,'' he said. ''But if they do turn up somewhere, at a storefront or a building, you can rest assured we'll be there till they're gone.''

HEADLINE: What's the Plan, Mitt?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
With only a few weeks remaining until the election, it's still not clear how Mitt Romney would manage our jobs crisis. There aren't many lessons from his term as the governor of Massachusetts -- the economy was comparatively healthy back then, and the unemployment rate was fairly low. His current economic platform lays out broad principles (Principle No. 1: Don't be Barack Obama) but is light on specifics. All that's certain is that Romney has promised to use decades of business savvy to create jobs, which raises the question: how do you apply business strategy to a jobs crisis? No business views hiring as an objective. When a crisis hits, the response of many executives is to let workers go. 
When I put this question to business analysts, several pointed me in the direction of Louisiana, which has applied a number of Romney's principles. Its governor, Bobby Jindal, is a former McKinsey & Company consultant who has focused on making his state more attractive to businesses. Since taking office in 2008, Jindal helped cut antiquated taxes (like those on certain factory machines) and streamlined regulatory burdens (like lengthy permit processes). He and Stephen Moret, his secretary of economic development (and another former McKinsey guy), have also used state tax incentives in creative ways. A few years ago there were virtually no video-game designers in Louisiana; today, digital media is on pace to make up 5 percent of the state's economy. In 2011, according to Southern Business Development magazine, Louisiana attracted more new business-development projects per capita than any other state in the South. Its unemployment tracks below the national average, too. Romney would presumably be encouraged by the comparison.
I was surprised, though, when Moret volunteered that some of what his state has done during the crisis cannot be applied on the national level. State government can persuade companies to move to Louisiana and prevent the ones already there from moving out. But that doesn't have an impact on the overall national employment picture. After all, Louisiana can enlarge its slice of the pie, but it can't make the pie bigger. ''At the state level,'' Moret said, these policies are ''perfectly appropriate.''
Jindal has received praise from free-market advocates. Some economists, however, argue that Louisiana's robust economic growth suggests the opposite point. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Louisiana received a ministimulus in the form of billions in federal dollars and insurance payouts that went into recovery projects. It's a quirk of economic measurement that rebuilding a destroyed city can look the same as healthy economic growth. And while Moret argues that Katrina spending mostly dried up before Jindal took office, many economists contend that the benefits of any stimulus last longer than the initial spending.
Regardless of whether this growth was achieved by a federal infusion or conservative policies (or a combination of both), it is not necessarily clear that it has even worked on a statewide level. Many of Jindal and Moret's highest profile projects focus on specialized industries, like pharmaceuticals, renewable energy and digital media, which offer a disproportionate number of jobs to already in-demand workers in gentrified urban areas. The median wage for a software developer is more than $90,000 a year, and new jobs are expected to grow at more than double the national average and nearly four times the state's average income. Moret was eager to point out one recent success story -- a new G.E. software office in New Orleans. The facility, however, will largely employ computer engineers, software developers and other information-technology professionals. It's unlikely to have much of an impact on the city's poorer residents.
Moret contends that growth, no matter where it starts in the economy, will eventually effect everyone. ''If we're able to grow faster,'' he said, ''you can have a surplus of tax revenue, without raising tax rates, that you can invest in education.'' But when I pressed him on how job growth among programmers in Baton Rouge or engineers in the Garden District would enhance the lives of the chronically unemployed in the Lower Ninth Ward, Moret said, ''We're not there yet.'' The state has successfully recruited some manufacturing and call-center businesses that employ high-school graduates, he said. These jobs, however, are unlikely to reach Louisiana's truly poor. ''We haven't done well enough to see the reduction in poverty we're looking for,'' he said.
Moret remains confident that, after a few more successful years, Louisiana will get there. But many critics, like Jan Moller, director of the Louisiana Budget Project, an advocacy group for the state's poor, worries that cutting taxes and decreasing government spending will ensure that the affluent remain comfortable and the poor remain stuck. ''The cuts-only approach has hurt Louisiana more than it's helped,'' he told me.
As I listened to Moret talk about how growth spreads throughout a state, I was reminded of another governor who tried the same approach. For decades, Massachusetts sought to attract businesses to cities like Lowell that were suffering from entrenched poverty brought on by the collapse of the textile industry. It is difficult and expensive to recruit businesses to places that have had the least success in the economy, so when Mitt Romney became governor, in 2003, he redirected his economic-development team to focus on whatever business seemed most promising, wherever it happened to be. Peter Enrich, a professor at Northeastern University School of Law, said that Romney's decision ended up benefiting already thriving industries, like the biotechnology sector along the I-495 corridor. In one of the administration's signature achievements, Romney leveraged tax incentives to persuade Bristol-Myers Squibb to locate a massive facility near Boston rather than in North Carolina. While this brought about 400 high-paying jobs to the state, Enrich argues that it wasn't worthwhile over the long term. Massachusetts, he said, desperately needs ''growth in New Bedford or Lowell. That could make a real difference.''
The United States has always had pockets of sustained poverty, but throughout its history, almost everyone, almost everywhere, even the poorly educated, have shared in the country's broad economic growth. Unfortunately, this no longer seems to be the case. According to many economists, technological advances and competition with low-wage countries, among other factors, portend an America in which the undereducated everywhere, including the 85 million people over 25 without postsecondary training, will fall further and further behind the educated and in-demand software designers and biotech engineers. If that's true, roughly one out of three American workers can expect to see their living standards erode throughout their lifetimes.
These predictions suggest that it is in everyone's interest to channel at least some of the benefits of high-growth businesses toward preparing the undereducated for a very different 21st century. These are not problems that any business executive has to deal with. When people or divisions at a company consistently underperform, they're usually let go. For the president, of course, this isn't an option.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. How do you use a business strategy to create jobs?
2. Focus on the most competitive sectors.
3. But what happens to the less competitive ones?

HEADLINE: A Columbia Dean As Romney Adviser

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Romney's Go-To Economist'' (Oct. 14), a look at the career and policy stances of R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School: 
I suspect that most Americans would agree that the ''plug and play'' technological age provides us with many electronic gadgets for quick communication. Usually, these gadgets work well, but occasionally something can go awry -- like the maps on the iPhone 5.
It now appears that the plug-and-play notion has been adopted by Mr. Hubbard in Mitt Romney's campaign for president. Plugging in a 20 percent across-the-board tax cut might be easy for a President Romney and a Republican-dominated House and Senate. But playing around with exemptions, deductions, loopholes and the growth rate of the economy to make that policy revenue-neutral could be a formidable task.
One should be very wary of political plug-and-play devices offered up as policy without written directions on how to make the ''play'' part work.

To the Editor:
Your article about R. Glenn Hubbard discussed how his academic colleagues, supporters and detractors perceive his work and politics. But how about his students at Columbia Business School?
I took Professor Hubbard's Entrepreneurial Finance course in the fall of 2011. He was not just a dynamic lecturer whose clear thinking and explanations illuminated complex concepts, but his ability to interact with students, engage in lively discussions and respect alternative views made him a very popular professor.
Except in moments of levity, never did he allow his personal politics to skew the presentation of business, finance and policy concepts. In lunches with students, he welcomed policy and political questions, giving frank responses and entertaining opposing views from me and others.
As a Democrat, I can only regret that such calm, rational and reasoned discussions of policies and concepts have been replaced by shrill slogans and ad hominem attacks in our national discourse.
We, the public, learn less and lose more by this change.

HEADLINE: Ever Bipartisan, Bloomberg Jabs Both Candidates

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
President Obama and Mitt Romney have courted his endorsement covetously, with a White House lunch invitation here (Mr. Obama) and a pilgrimage to the Upper East Side there (Mr. Romney), through intensive back-channel outreach and effusive public praise.
But sitting in the elegant town house in Manhattan that is home to his private foundation two and a half weeks before Election Day, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has endorsed neither candidate, had sobering words for both.
For Mr. Romney: ''I do think that Romney's business experience would be valuable, but I don't know that running Bain Capital gives you the experience to run the country.''
For Mr. Obama: ''This business of 'Well, they can afford it; they should pay their fair share?' Who are you to say 'Somebody else's fair share?' '' 
For both: ''Their economic plans are not real. I think that's clear.''
In one sense, Mr. Bloomberg was speaking for voters everywhere who feel exasperated by a presidential campaign that has been fought in sound bites and bromides as problems at home and abroad multiply. In another, perhaps, they are the words of a man who thinks he can do better, his own chronic yearnings for the office frustrated by his cleareyed assessment that he could not win.
But mostly, Mr. Bloomberg was stepping forward as the nation's newest billionaire ''super PAC'' donor, with a vow to spend millions beyond this election year supporting candidates willing to do what he implied Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney were not: taking ''leadership and standing up to do things that aren't going to be popular.''
And it was in that context that he offered his most expansive, and critical, take yet of the two men vying for the presidency, each of whom had at times held promise to practice Mr. Bloomberg's brand of nonideological pragmatism only to become snared in partisanship.
His new group, Independence USA PAC, which was officially unveiled last week, has pledged to spend up to $15 million in the next two weeks on state, federal and local candidates whose views align with Mr. Bloomberg's in support of gun control, same-sex marriage and overhauling public schools.
Calling that ''getting your feet wet,'' he said he wanted to provide a financial bulwark for those who occupy his definition of the political center, as George Soros does for those on the left, and as Charles and David Koch do for those on the right.
In essence, though, Mr. Bloomberg is seeking to give the candidates a taste of the political freedom that he has enjoyed as a self-financed billionaire politician whose money helped him withstand the powerful opposition he faced because of his unpopular initiatives, including a smoking ban and an 18.5 percent raise in property taxes, to name just two.
While he had some praise for Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, his central argument was that they were too hemmed in by partisan obligations and special-interest intimidation to tackle problems head on.
''If you listen to what they say, they never get explicit,'' he said, leaning forward in a plush beige lounge chair alongside the deputy mayor who is on leave to run the mayor's new super PAC, Howard Wolfson.
Mr. Bloomberg endorsed George W. Bush in 2004, when the mayor was a Republican. In 2008, after changing his party registration to independent, he declined to make an endorsement.
His support is eagerly sought because of his unusual crossover appeal, especially to three key constituencies: moderate independents, Jewish voters and the Wall Street crowd that has shifted to Mr. Romney this year from Mr. Obama four years ago.
Though he is more likely to agree with Mr. Obama than with Mr. Romney -- on same-sex marriage, climate change and abortion rights -- he expressed disappointment with the president's leadership.
''I am more in sync with President Obama's views on social issues,'' he said. ''I will say that I don't see as much action as I would like, and it's nice to be on the side that I think you should be on, but unless you do something, so what?''
Mr. Bloomberg was asked how he could make that criticism given the president's announcement last spring that he supported same-sex marriage.
''Let's get serious here: it was Joe Biden that forced that issue,'' he said, referring to the vice president's surprise remarks backing same-sex nuptials that were credited with forcing Mr. Obama to follow. ''Some people say he just goes off; I would say he's a principled guy.''
The White House has said that the president had always intended to announce his support for same-sex marriage and that Mr. Biden's words only forced him to do so slightly earlier than planned.
Mr. Bloomberg, who founded the global media giant Bloomberg L.P., is worth an estimated $25 billion, according to Forbes, and he is occasionally mentioned as a future Treasury secretary. He said Mr. Romney was wrongheaded for his opposition to raising taxes as part of a budget deal.
''You cannot balance the budget without raising revenue and cutting expenses,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''There is no reputable economist that remotely thinks you could do this without doing those two things -- one of which is anathema to the Republicans, and one of which is anathema to the Democrats.''
A solution, he said, would be to allow the Bush-era tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of this year. Mr. Obama supports allowing them to expire for those with household incomes of more than $250,000, a delineation that Mr. Bloomberg said was unfair, arbitrary and fiscally irresponsible.
Similarly, Mr. Bloomberg suggested that both men were engaging in election-year pandering in their tough talk on China. ''I'm skeptical enough to think that a lot of this is just done by advisers,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. '' 'I'm going to be dishonest to get elected because unless I get elected, I can't be honest.' It's a little bit of that.''
Most galling to him, however, is their lack of action on his marquee issue: gun control. ''Romney passed a law, signed a law, in Massachusetts banning assault weapons, and today says, 'No,' '' he said. ''And Obama campaigned on introducing legislation to ban assault weapons, and then did absolutely nothing.''
Mr. Bloomberg suggested they were cowed by the National Rifle Association, which has endorsed Mr. Romney.
The point of his super PAC, he said, was to provide ''spine'' for politicians under that sort of pressure, which is why, for instance, it is supporting the re-election of Representative Robert J. Dold, a Republican from Illinois. Mr. Dold got a ''D'' from the National Rifle Association for backing some gun restrictions.
''You're not going to beat the N.R.A. overnight,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''As you get going, people start realizing that there's a sane group of people out there that want them to do intelligent things, and that that's where their support is going to come from.''
As for Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama, he said, he had not entirely ruled out endorsing one of them, unlikely as that may seem.
Thursday night, he saw both candidates at the annual Al Smith charity dinner, where they were feted, and where Mr. Obama poked fun at Mr. Bloomberg's ban on large sugary sodas. (''They all do that,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''That's easy.'')
For a night, at least, they did not lobby for his endorsement. And he offered them advice for the roast. ''I said to both of them, 'Don't be sensitive,' '' Mr. Bloomberg said. '' 'They'll kid me and they'll kid you, and if they don't mention your name, that's worse.' ''

HEADLINE: Taxing My Patience

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
ON the morning of the second presidential debate, Marco Rubio gave a performance every bit as riveting as the ones the candidates turned in less than 12 hours later.
He was visiting Bloomberg View in Manhattan, where he sat down with political journalists for a freewheeling hourlong conversation. I'd never met him and was eager to, given the belief of many Republicans that he has a big future in the party, and in politics.
I was impressed first and foremost by the assurance with which he spoke, projecting a wisdom and an authority beyond his 41 years.
But I was even more struck by something else: the dispiriting, infuriating way in which he deployed that assurance and what that said about our sorry politics today. Instead of conducting a blunt, honest examination of the hard choices and necessary compromises that confront our country, he presented the sorts of rosy assumptions and slippery generalizations that have characterized too much of this election. 
With our debt soaring, our population aging and our infrastructure crumbling, we stand at a troubling crossroads. And yet politicians sell us low-tax, no-pain fantasies. They traffic in vagueness and treat us like toddlers.
On Tuesday morning Rubio certainly did. When the conversation turned from immigration, on which he was eloquent, to taxes, he followed Mitt Romney's lead and became maddeningly evasive, indicating support for Romney's half-formed proposal of across-the-board cuts in marginal rates that somehow won't diminish federal revenue.
Before we go deeper into that proposal, a question: when did we become so spectacularly tax-phobic? Who appointed Grover Norquist our national revenue muse?
At a time when our taxes are, in a historical sense, relatively low, our leaders vie for favor not by conjuring more sweeping and profound visions of the future but by leaning on the prosaic, default promise that they'll leave more money in our pockets than the other guys will.
President Obama admits that he'd like taxes raised on households making more than $250,000. But he casts those increases as an insurance policy against any significant hikes on everyone else, and puts an emphasis on them far out of bounds with their potential impact. The implication is that extra taxation on the rich alone can solve many of our budget problems. That's savvy marketing, smart politics and utter bunk.
But Romney's bunk, like his pension, is bigger. Or at least seems to be. We can't know for sure, because he won't give us details. He says that his proposed 20 percent cut in marginal rates won't sap the Treasury because of all the tax loopholes he'll close, but then he won't name which loopholes.
His vagueness serves a dual purpose. It prevents voters from panicking about a lost deduction and analysts from checking his math. There's no math to check.
Under pressure for at least a few specifics, he at one point furnished an actual number, $17,000, which he mentioned as a hypothetical cap on aggregate deductions. But it was apparently hypothetical in the extreme, because at the first debate, talking about such a cap, he said, ''Make up a number.'' He floated $25,000, then $50,000. There's more than a little bit of daylight between those two figures.
In the second debate, he said, ''I'll pick a number: $25,000.'' And I'll pick a color: yellow. I mean, as long as we're just picking things at random. Besides which, yellow is the hue of cowardice.
Rubio, in his meeting with journalists last week, didn't get into deduction caps. But he did get into specific deductions, only to name ones he would not want eliminated.
''The home interest deduction is troubling, because it really helps the middle class,'' he said. As for any rollback of deductions for philanthropy, he said: ''Do you really want to hurt charitable giving in a country when you're saying you want to rely less on government and more on private institutions?''
HE even expressed reservations about fiddling with the oft-disparaged deduction for private jets. It may sound reasonable, he conceded, to ask, ''Why does a billionaire need a tax deduction on a plane he just bought?''
''But if you talk to the folks that build that plane,'' he continued, ''they'll tell you, 'Well, it helps us hire 5,000 people.' '' Trickle-down economics includes trickle-down aviation.
''I'm not prepared to go through the tax code and say, 'This is what I'd go after,' because it's a false choice,'' he declared, explaining his belief that the federal government would reap more revenue by keeping taxes as low as possible, because that would spur growth. ''Only through growth,'' he summed up, ''can you generate the revenue to bring the debt under control.''
There are several problems with this happy talk. One is that many economists dispute any such tidy correlation between tax cuts and quick, consequential growth.
Another problem is that growth on the scale he's suggesting isn't really a plan or policy. If it were that controllable, we'd be growing like a punch-drunk weed, quarter after merry quarter. It's a goal. A hope.
But the biggest problem is that growth is the one putative solution that asks nothing of us: no trade-offs, no sacrifices. It perpetuates the seductive and irresponsible illusion that we can get our house in fiscal order without any terrible inconvenience after all.
Rubio's attachment to something-for-nothing salesmanship was confirmed when he was asked about Medicare. He started out with two refreshingly frank admissions, saying that ''there's a growing realization that Medicare as it's currently structured is unsustainable in the long term'' and that ''my generation is going to have to accept that our Medicare is going to look different.''
But then he insisted that his generation would still have the option of a Medicare program just like the current one, in addition to private-insurance alternatives. Apart from acknowledging that wealthy older Americans in the future would have to contribute more to their health care than they do now, he painted a win-win picture of undiminished aid and undiluted services.
It was a master class in wishful thinking, and I pick on it not because it was unusual, but because it distilled so many politicians' refusal to have adult conversations with us, to assume that we're grown-ups who can do some math and face some disappointment.
And I think Rubio in particular got under my skin because he has real charisma and obvious talent. If he hitched them to a mature grappling with our challenges, we might actually get somewhere.

HEADLINE: Google's Crystal Ball

BYLINE: By SETH STEPHENS-DAVIDOWITZ. 
A doctoral candidate in economics at Harvard.

 BODY:
Every election season, pollsters try to figure out the demographic makeup of the electorate in an election that hasn't happened yet. And every election season, pollsters are greeted with charges that their estimates are wrong. Republicans criticize 2012 polls that assume that African-American turnout will remain at its 2008 level. Democrats criticize 2012 polls that assume African-American turnout will be lower than it was. And that's just one demographic group.
It's hard to predict voter turnout because people are reluctant to admit that they will not vote. How reluctant? One recent estimate suggests that as many as two-thirds of people who will end up not voting tell pollsters that they will.
In my work in economics, I use anonymous, aggregate data from millions of Google searches in hundreds of media markets in the United States to measure variables on sensitive topics - racism, drug dealing and child abuse, for example - where people tend to be less forthcoming in surveys (to put it mildly). 
My research suggests that by comparing Google search rates for voting information so far this year with search rates on comparable dates from previous elections, we might already be able to get a pretty good idea of the composition of the 2012 electorate.
Despite the ubiquity of Google searching, and searchers' demonstrated willingness to share their true feelings and unbridled thoughts on Google, what Americans are typing when they search remains surprisingly underutilized in political analysis. But Google can often offer insights unavailable elsewhere.
Some of what we learn is pretty silly. Every month, about 5,000 people ask Google about Mitt Romney's underwear choice (devout Mormons wear temple garments). But some of what we learn is disturbing. On Election Day in 2008, roughly 1 in 100 searches that included "Obama" also included "KKK" or "nigger."
Our thoughts are often superficial. "Paul Ryan shirtless" is currently Googled 9 times more often than "Paul Ryan budget." Don't ask me why, but "Paul Ryan shirtless" is Googled more frequently in blue states than in red. When we search for "Michelle Obama," we include the word "ugly" three times as often as the word "beautiful."
Politicians can map the geography of their popularity by looking at what they're called on Google. "Obama" is Googled more frequently in blue states, but "Barack Hussein Obama" is Googled more often in red states - just as "Willard Mitt Romney" is in the blue states.
How frequently people in a state searched for "Obama jokes" almost perfectly predicted the vote share of Mr. Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain. "Romney jokes," which typically focus on his wealth, are popular in Iowa and Ohio, two swing states in which Mr. Romney has struggled to connect with working-class voters. Never mind favorability; maybe what we need is a jokeability index.
Google search data also give some evidence suggesting that last-minute rumors had negative effects in the 2008 election. There were a number of states, like Oklahoma, Tennessee and Kentucky, in which Mr. Obama slightly underperformed in the final polls. Google search data offer one rather interesting correlation: these states had some of the largest search volumes for "Obama Muslim." And those searches, while not uncommon throughout the summer and early fall, rose substantially in the final days of the campaign, after many of the final polls were conducted.
Comparing the timing of our Google searches to outside events is often intriguing. Searches for "McCain life expectancy" rose to unprecedented levels the day of his controversial choice of the Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. They rose again after Ms. Palin's poorly received interview with Katie Couric.
Google data may also help us predict the composition of the 2012 electorate. Individuals may systematically deceive pollsters regarding their intentions, but actual voters are far more likely to Google phrases like "how to vote" or "where to vote" before an election.
By the middle of October, taking the frequency with which Google searches include "vote" or "voting" and comparing the number to those from the same days four years earlier strongly predicts where turnout will rise, stay the same or fall. If search rates for voting information were higher in the first half of October 2008 than in the first half of October 2004, voting rates tended to be higher in 2008 than in 2004. It's true for midterm elections, too. If search rates for voting information were higher in the first half of October 2010 than in the first half of October 2006, voting rates tended to be higher in 2010 than in 2006.
This predictive power was significantly stronger than that of other variables we might use to predict area-level turnout, like changes in registration rates or movement in early voting.
By comparing changes in search volume to area-level demographics, we can use this information to make predictions about turnout rates among different demographic groups.
To see how this works, consider what Google search data would have shown us by this time in 2008. Search rates for voting information that month were slightly lower than they were in October 2004. However, states in which Google searches were higher than they were four years earlier were overwhelmingly the states with some of the highest African-American populations -North Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. Within states, media markets with higher African-American populations - places like the Raleigh-Durham area in North Carolina, Augusta, Ga., and Jackson, Miss. - saw the biggest increases in voting-related searches from October 2004 to October 2008. The Jackson media market, with a 47 percent African-American population, saw a 56 percent increase.
An analysis of Google search data, in other words, would have made the unsurprising, and ultimately correct, prediction that black turnout was going to be substantially higher in 2008 than it was in 2004.
This methodology would have also correctly predicted a slight increase in Hispanic turnout. While the relationship was not nearly as strong as it was among African-Americans, parts of the country with greater Hispanic populations were Googling for voting information at elevated rates in 2008 compared with 2004.
Google search data, in October 2008, would not have predicted major changes in the age composition of the electorate. Before the election, some were claiming that Mr. Obama's presence on the ticket would lead to a substantial increase in youth turnout. However, in October, the media markets with the greatest proportion of individuals between the ages of 18 and 34 - Gainesville, Fla., and Salt Lake City, for example - were not Googling for voting information at significantly elevated rates. Youth turnout did not rise as much as it was expected to in 2008.
So what does Google suggest about 2012 this far into October? There is little evidence for a 2012 electorate significantly more favorable to Democrats or Republicans than the one that obtained in 2008. The data suggest that turnout, as always, will be elevated in some parts of the United States and depressed in others. Interestingly, turnout might be expected to be higher in Ohio in 2012 than it was in 2004 or 2008.
Of course, there are still two weeks of searches to come. And the methodology I am using is new and subject to many caveats. But the differences we see so far do not appear to predict large changes in demographics that might substantially affect the outcome of the election.
Areas with the largest black populations are, on average, Googling for voting information at rates similar to those of 2008, rather than 2004, levels. By this metric, it does seem that pollsters should assume a black share of the electorate similar to that of 2008, when African-Americans made up an estimated 12 percent of the electorate, rather than 2004, when it was 11 percent - a good sign for Mr. Obama.
There is nice news for Mitt Romney in the Google data, too: voting searches are higher in Idaho Falls and Salt Lake City, the two media markets with the largest Mormon populations. While neither Idaho nor Utah is a swing state, increased Mormon turnout might help Mr. Romney somewhat in two important swing states: Nevada (7 percent Mormon) and Colorado (3 percent Mormon).
Mr. Romney's supporters might also be pleased with the search rates for voting information in some areas with high evangelical populations. Google data predict that Lubbock, Tex., and Paducah, Ky., for example, may see increased turnout. This might alleviate the concern among Republicans that evangelical voters will turn out in lower numbers because of suspicions about Mr. Romney's Mormon faith or his lack of commitment to conservative social causes.
The Google data offer little evidence for any big changes in the age composition of the electorate: there is also not a meaningful change in voting-information search rates in areas with a high proportion of individuals 18 to 34, who tend to support Mr. Obama, or individuals 65 and older, who generally lean toward Mr. Romney.
Search rates thus far in October 2012, compared to the same days in October 2008, are a bit lower in areas with larger Hispanic populations. While Mr. Obama is more popular among Hispanics than Mr. Romney, the size of the correlation does not, as of yet, present a huge concern for Mr. Obama. Monitoring the data over the next two weeks, not to mention looking at Spanish-language voting searches, might tell us if this should become a significantly larger concern for his campaign.
Mr. Obama's opponents hope that the 2012 electorate will be less favorable to Democrats, more like the 2004 electorate. My early analysis of Google search data says: don't count on it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Disability Trap

BYLINE: By JULIE TURKEWITZ and JULIET LINDERMAN. 
Freelance journalists who have contributed to The New York Times.

 BODY:
BRAD CRELIA was rushing around the vast media room at an international AIDS conference last summer in Washington, interviewing people for a series of articles on Hivster.com, a Web magazine he founded for people who are H.I.V. positive. The ease with which he moved through the crowd made it clear he'd done this kind of political networking before: he'd worked first as a field organizer for Hillary Rodham Clinton and later as a regional field organizer for President Obama.
But Mr. Crelia, 27, nearly didn't make it home from the AIDS conference; without the $17 necessary to buy a bus ticket, he'd had to beg a stranger for a ride back to New York. It was the end of the month, he said. He'd simply run out of money.
He is one of more than 8.7 million disabled Americans who rely on cash assistance from the government through a program called Supplemental Security Income. The program was created in 1974 to help blind, aged and disabled people meet basic needs for food, clothing and shelter. By 2035, the federal government expects to spend $60.9 billion in payments to 9.9 million people. 
Discussion of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs has been at the forefront of election-year debate. But there has been no discussion of S.S.I. The fact is that expenditures for the S.S.I. program are rising while the economic status of disabled people is on the decline.
The very program that is supposed to be their safety net is actually the source of the problem, experts say. S.S.I. traps many disabled people by limiting their income to levels just above the poverty line, and taking away their cash benefits if they achieve any level of security.
At 16, Mr. Crelia was given a diagnosis of porphyria, an incurable hereditary blood disorder. His symptoms -- seizures, paralysis, blackouts, nausea and extreme pain -- became more and more severe, preventing him from finishing college and landing him in the hospital for days or weeks at a time. In addition, in 2009, he learned he had H.I.V. That has not affected his ability to work. But his porphyria has made maintaining a traditional full-time job nearly impossible.
So he and others like him need a flexible financial safety net for the periods during which they cannot work. But no such program exists. The only way for Mr. Crelia to qualify for cash assistance was to sign up for S.S.I. -- and demonstrate that he was unable to ''engage in substantial gainful activity'' because of his physical impairment.
He now receives a monthly check for $506 through the S.S.I. program, and he is allowed to earn $85 more. (He also receives some assistance toward his rent and food expenses.) Once he surpasses the $85, his benefit check will be reduced by $1 for every $2 he earns. And if his income reaches $1,097 a month, he will no longer be eligible for any cash S.S.I. benefits at all. So he must be poor or he must give up all government support. Mr. Crelia is never permitted to have more than $2,000 in the bank, a restriction that places the trappings of a middle-class life -- a car, a modest home, a family -- far out of reach.
''I've been kept financially sort of in this cage,'' Mr. Crelia said. ''Just basic things that people rely upon, having a normal life, aren't things that are really accessible. And won't be.''
People like Mr. Crelia -- ill, but ambitious, motivated and able to work the majority of the time -- don't fit into a rigid system set up primarily to provide support for those who will never be able to enter the workplace in any capacity. Instead of accounting for a spectrum of ability and administering a benefits package accordingly, the system offers a one-size-fits-all plan: you can either work and not qualify for financial assistance, or you're sick, and barred from earning any substantial income.
''Instead of helping people achieve their full potential,'' David Stapleton, who directs the Mathematica Center for Studying Disability Policy, testified before Congress last month, ''the current disability support system has created a poverty trap.'' The employment rate for people with disabilities, he said, is just 21 percent of the rate for people without disabilities, down from 32 percent in 1981. The problems stem from the Social Security Administration's failure in 1974 to structure a program that motivates work. It is relatively easy to accept cash benefits but very hard to get into the workplace. Mr. Stapleton said that Congress had the power to push to change the structure of the program, but that it had not done so.
Today, 70 percent of people with disabilities live in poverty. The Affordable Care Act may eventually ease the burden for some individuals with disabilities, namely those who rely on Medicaid through the S.S.I. program, by eliminating exclusions based on pre-existing conditions and annual or lifetime benefits caps. But the impact on the disabled is not yet clear, and experts are calling for additional targeted reforms.
Richard Burkhauser, a professor at Cornell, and Mary Daly, a government economist, have studied the welfare of people with disabilities for more than three decades, and offer some solutions. They suggest a work-first approach that would help people get job training or employment before they go through the red-tape-ridden path of getting on S.S.I. Now people must go through the lengthy process of proving that they cannot work before they are given access to job training and other programs.
Instead of enrolling Mr. Crelia in S.S.I., the Social Security Administration could have helped him apply for a loan to finish his bachelor's degree, increasing his chances of finding a flexible, high-paying job with health insurance.
Mr. Burkhauser and Ms. Daly borrow another idea from the lessons learned from the 1996 welfare overhaul. Welfare moved from a federal program that did not encourage single mothers to work to a state-run program that offered the incentive of an earned-income tax credit for working mothers. They say S.S.I. should copy this model by allowing people like Mr. Crelia to hold a paying job as often as possible -- whether for 20, 25 or 30 hours a week -- and having the federal or state government chip in with tax credits to round out his income.
For now, Mr. Crelia is doing his best to stay busy. He clocks far more than 40 hours most weeks, mostly in unpaid writing. ''When I work, I thrive both physically and emotionally,'' Mr. Crelia said. ''When I am not sick and can control my disease with medication -- like now -- I want to be able to contribute to society, have a family, grow my business. But not as a volunteer; I want to be paid like everyone else.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Best-Kept Secrets

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
ONE thing that has struck me about the debates so far is how little President Obama has conveyed about what I think are his two most innovative domestic programs. While I don't know how Obamacare will turn out, I'm certain that my two favorite Obama initiatives will be transformative.
His Race to the Top program in education has already set off a nationwide wave of school reform, and his Race to the Top in vehicles -- raising the mileage standards for American-made car and truck fleets from 27.5 miles per gallon to 54.5 m.p.g. between now and 2025 -- is already spurring a wave of innovation in auto materials, engines and software. Obama mentioned both briefly in the last debate, but I want to talk about them more, because I think they are the future of progressive politics in this age of austerity: government using its limited funds and steadily rising performance standards to stimulate states and businesses to innovate better economic, educational and environmental practices. 
While it is too scary for Obama to tell people in so many words, his races to the top in schools and cars are both based on one brutal fact: ''The high-wage, medium-skilled job is over,'' as Stefanie Sanford, a senior education expert at the Gates Foundation, puts it. The only high-wage jobs, whether in manufacturing or services, will be high-skilled ones, requiring more and better education, and Obama's two races to the top aim to produce both more high-skill jobs and more high-skilled workers.
In the Race to the Top in schools, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has built on the good works of his predecessor, Margaret Spellings, and President George W. Bush, who put in place No Child Left Behind. Though never perfect, No Child Left Behind was still a game-changer for education reform because it gave us the data to see not only how individual schools were doing but how the most at-risk students were doing within those schools. Without that, educational reform based on accountability of teachers and principals could never start.
The purpose of Race to the Top, Secretary Duncan explained to me, was basically to say that if we now live in a world where every good high-wage job requires more skill, we need to get as many of our schools as possible educating their students ''to college- and career-ready standards,'' measured against the best in the world, because that is whom our kids will be competing against. ''We have to educate our way to a better economy,'' Duncan argues. ''The path to the middle class today runs straight through the classroom.''
So, Race to the Top said to all 50 states, we have a $4.35 billion fund that Washington will invest in the states that come up with the best four-year education reform plans that have these components: 1) systems for data-gathering on student performance, dropout rates, graduation rates and post-graduation college and vocational school success, so schools are held accountable for what happens to their students; 2) systems for teacher and principal evaluation and support, as well as systems to reward great teachers, learn from their best practices and move out those at the bottom -- essentially systems that help elevate teaching into an attractive profession; 3) systems that propose turning around failing schools by changing the management and culture; 4) systems that set college- and career-ready, internationally benchmarked standards for reading and math.
IT is too early to draw any firm conclusions, but Duncan points to some early positives. Some 4,500 state and local teachers' union affiliates have signed onto their state's reform proposals, showing they want to be partners. Roughly 25 percent of the turnaround schools, Duncan said, ''have already showed double-digit increases in reading or math in their first year and about two-thirds showed gains.'' There have also been ''huge reductions of discipline incidents.''
Although, over the two years of the program, 46 states submitted reform blueprints -- and only the 12 best won grants from $70 million to $700 million, depending on the size of their student populations -- even states that did not win have been implementing their proposals anyway. And because 45 states and the District of Columbia adopted similar higher academic standards (known as the ''common core'') for reading and math, ''for the first time in our history a kid in Massachusetts and a kid in Mississippi are now being measured by the same yardstick,'' said Duncan.
In many cases, we have seen as much reform from those ''who did not get a nickel as those who got $100 million,'' Duncan added. As Jay Altman, the chief executive of FirstLine Schools, which manages the turnarounds of failing schools in New Orleans, put it, ''Louisiana ended up not winning Race to the Top, but we got close, and the process stimulated Louisiana and other states to think more broadly about educational reform rather than just approach it piecemeal.''
As for Obama's doubling of vehicle mileage by 2025, led by his Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation, it's already driving more innovation in Detroit, as each car company figures out how it will improve mileage by 5 percent every year. The auto industry's main newspaper, ''Automotive News, used to be a sad collection of stories of failing dealerships and excess inventory,'' notes Hal Harvey, the chief executive of Energy Innovation. ''Now it is one technology story after another, all aimed at increasing fuel efficiency. Engines, transmissions, electrical systems, advanced materials are all in the midst of new revolutions. Finally the engineers are back at work!''
Carl Pope, the former executive director of the Sierra Club, notes that Mitt Romney rejects Obama's auto Race to the Top and is vowing to import more oil from the Canadian tar sands through the Keystone XL pipeline. ''So Romney wants to throw away our cheapest, cleanest oil -- the stuff we make in Detroit through greater mileage efficiency -- and replace it with the world's most expensive and dirty oil from the Canadian tar sands,'' says Pope. ''That's a swap only the Koch brothers could dream up.''
Yes, the costs for cars with higher miles per gallon will rise a touch, but the savings will be manyfold that amount. The Environmental Protection Agency projects families will save $1.8 trillion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by 2.1 million barrels per day by 2025, which is equivalent to one-half of the oil that we currently import from OPEC countries every day. It will cut six billion metric tons of greenhouse gases over the lifetimes of the vehicles sold through 2025 -- more than the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. in 2010.
But remember: It's all a secret. Don't tell anyone.

HEADLINE: I'm Right! (For Some Reason)

BYLINE: By STEVEN SLOMAN and PHILIP M. FERNBACH. 
Steven Sloman is a professor of cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences at Brown University. Philip M. Fernbach is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Colorado's Leeds School of Business.

 BODY:
IF we are reminded of anything this election season, it is that America is a house divided against itself. The anger and mistrust between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, often seems as bitter as it is reflexive. Most worrisome of all, we have grown so accustomed to this divide that we no longer flinch at the brazen political attacks on either side -- even when the logic underlying these attacks is hard to fathom.
Take the case of two political ads recently shown on television. One, from Mitt Romney, asserts that the employment situation in the United States ''doesn't have to be this way if Obama would stand up to China.'' The other, from President Obama's camp, implies that a Romney presidency would be bad for the coal industry, in part because Mr. Romney has a Swiss bank account. 
The truth is, even experts have difficulty spelling out how changing our trade policy with China will make more than a modest dent in unemployment numbers -- or how, with or without a foreign bank account, Mr. Romney's proposed policies are likely to hurt the domestic coal industry. But that doesn't matter.
Such attack ads work, in large part, because we don't understand them. Statements take advantage of a fact about human psychology called the ''illusion of explanatory depth,'' an idea developed by the Yale psychologist Frank Keil and his students. We typically feel that we understand how complex systems work even when our true understanding is superficial. And it is not until we are asked to explain how such a system works -- whether it's what's involved in a trade deal with China or how a toilet flushes -- that we realize how little we actually know.
In our own research we have found this pattern when people are asked to explain how political policies work. In a forthcoming article in Psychological Science, written with Todd Rogers of the Harvard Kennedy School's Center for Public Leadership and Craig Fox of U.C.L.A.'s Anderson School of Management, we report on experiments showing that people often believe they understand what is meant by well-worn political terms like the ''flat tax,'' ''sanctions on Iran'' or ''cap and trade'' -- even when they don't.
That's not much of a shocker, of course. The real surprise is what happens after these same individuals are asked to explain how these policy ideas work: they become more moderate in their political views -- either in support of such policies or against them. In fact, not only do their attitudes change, but so does their behavior. In one of our experiments, for example, after attempting to explain how various policy ideas would actually work, people became less likely to donate to organizations that supported the positions they had initially favored.
Interestingly, asking people to justify their position -- rather than asking them to explain the mechanisms by which a policy would work -- doesn't tend to soften their political views. When we asked participants to state the reasons they were for or against a policy position, their initial attitudes held firm. (Other researchers have found much the same thing: merely discussing an issue often makes people more extreme, not less.)
Why, then, does having to explain an opinion often end up changing it? The answer may have to do with a kind of revelatory trigger mechanism: asking people to ''unpack'' complex systems -- getting them to articulate how something might work in real life -- forces them to confront their lack of understanding.
The challenge in an election season that largely takes place in the form of 30-second advertisements and fire-up-the-base rallies is that rarely is anybody -- candidate or voter -- asked to explain his or her positions. American political discourse, in short, is not discourse at all.
So what can be done to turn it into one? The answer implied by our research is not that we should all become policy wonks. Instead, we voters need to be more mindful that issues are complicated and challenge ourselves to break down the policy proposals on both sides into their component parts. We have to then imagine how these ideas would work in the real world -- and then make a choice: to either moderate our positions on policies we don't really understand, as research suggests we will, or try to improve our understanding. Either way, discourse would then be based on information, not illusion.
But whether or not we citizens make this effort, our leaders should. We should demand that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney explain how in addition to why. And the last and best shot we'll have at hearing these ''hows'' will come tomorrow evening, in the final presidential debate. We will all be served if Bob Schieffer, the chief Washington correspondent for CBS News and moderator for Monday's debate, pushes both men to explain, not just assert.
Strong opinion and vigorous debate are key parts of democracy and the foundation to American culture. Yet most people would agree that it is not productive to have a strong opinion about an issue that one doesn't really understand. We have a problem in American politics: an illusion of knowledge that leads to extremism. We can start to fix it by acknowledging that we know a lot less than we think.

HEADLINE: Gosh, Who Talks Like That Now? Romney Does

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
GOFFSTOWN, N.H. -- At a campaign stop in Rockford, Ill., not long ago, Mitt Romney sought to convey his feelings for his wife, Ann. ''Smitten,'' he said.
Not merely in love.
''Yeah, smitten,'' he said. ''Mitt was smitten.''
It was a classic Mittism, as friends and advisers call the verbal quirks of the Republican presidential candidate. In Romneyspeak, passengers do not get off airplanes, they ''disembark.'' People do not laugh, they ''guffaw.'' Criminals do not go to jail, they land in the ''big house.'' Insults are not hurled, ''brickbats'' are.
As he seeks the office of commander in chief, Mr. Romney can sometimes seem like an editor in chief, employing a language all his own. It is polite, formal and at times anachronistic, linguistically setting apart a man who frequently struggles to sell himself to the American electorate. 
It is most pronounced when he is on the stump and off the cuff, not on the stuffy and rehearsed debate stage. But Mr. Romney offered voters a dose of it during his face-off with President Obama last week, when he coined the infelicitous phrase ''binders full of women.''
Mr. Romney's unique style of speaking has distinguished him throughout his career, influencing the word choices of those who work with and especially for him. Should he reach the White House, friends and advisers concede, the trait could be a defining feature of his public image, as memorable as Lyndon B. Johnson's foul-mouthed utterances or the first President Bush's tortured syntax.
Mr. Romney, 65, has spent four decades inside the corridors of high finance and state politics, where indecorous diction and vulgarisms abound. But he has emerged as if in a rhetorical time capsule from a well-mannered era of soda fountains and AMC Ramblers, someone whose idea of swearing is to let loose with the phrase ''H-E-double hockey sticks.''
''He actually said that,'' recalled Thomas Finneran, the speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives when Mr. Romney was governor. ''As in, go to 'H-E-double hockey sticks.' I would think to myself, 'Who talks like that?' ''
Mr. Romney, quite proudly. In fact, he seems puzzled by the fascination with something as instinctive (and immutable) as how he talks, as if somebody were asking how he breathes. ''It's like someone who speaks with an accent,'' he said in an interview. ''You don't hear the accent.''
His Mormon faith frowns on salty language, and so does he. A man of relentless self-discipline, he made clear to lawmakers in Boston and colleagues in business that even in matters of vocabulary, he ''held himself to a high standard of behavior,'' said Geoffrey Rehnert, a former executive at Bain Capital, the firm Mr. Romney started in the 1980s. Mr. Romney's father, George, whom he idolized, shared the same style of refined and restrained speech.
Those around him are so accustomed to his verbal tics that they describe them in shorthand. ''Old-timey,'' said one aide. ''His 1950s language,'' explained another. ''The Gomer Pyle routine,'' said a third.
Asked about his boss's word preferences, Eric Fehrnstrom, a veteran Romney adviser, responded knowingly: ''You mean like 'gosh, golly, darn'?''
For Democratic strategists, Mr. Romney's throwback vocabulary feeds into their portrayal of a man ill-equipped for the mores and challenges of the modern age. David Axelrod, a top adviser for an Obama campaign that has adopted ''Forward'' as its slogan, once quipped that Mr. Romney ''must watch 'Mad Men,' '' the hit television show set in Manhattan in the 1960s, ''and think it's the evening news.''
His exclamations can sound jarring to the contemporary ear -- or charming, depending on whom you ask. Midway into a critique of Mr. Obama's economic policies a few months ago, Mr. Romney declared: ''They've scared the dickens out of banks,'' he said. ''They've scared the dickens out of insurance companies.''
He declared, ''To heck with it!'' while urging reporters to use their fingers to dig into a box of pastries he was passing around on a plane. ''Darn good question,'' he replied to a voter in Kalamazoo, Mich., who asked how he would work with Congress if elected. (His wife also got the ''darn'' treatment in Michigan, when he enthused, ''Gosh, darn, she is amazing!'') ''Thank heavens'' is another favorite.
For people used to peppering their speech with four-letter words, time with Mr. Romney can prove an exercise in self-control. A half-dozen people recalled the precise moment when they swore -- almost always accidentally -- in his presence.
When Robert Travaglini, then the Democratic president of the Massachusetts State Senate, would curse in front of Mr. Romney, the governor would frown and interject, ''Well, I wouldn't choose that diction,'' Mr. Travaglini recalled.
Mr. Rehnert, the former Bain executive, was mortified when a potential client he took into Mr. Romney's office promptly dropped a string of profanities. ''Mitt wanted to know what cats and dogs I was dragging in here,'' Mr. Rehnert said.
His cussing colleagues said Mr. Romney took pains not to judge them publicly. ''He did not impose his language preferences on us,'' Mr. Finneran said. ''But I wonder if we became a little bit more restrained because we knew this about him.''
Mr. Travaglini recalled lawmakers' discussing how Mr. Romney ''should be more in tune with the vernacular of the day and express himself more passionately.''
''But,'' he added, ''that's not who he is.''
Mr. Romney does have his own distinctly G-rated arsenal of angry expressions -- ''Good grief,'' ''flippin','' ''good heavens'' and even the occasional ''crap.''
Perhaps the most intriguing of these is ''grunt.'' Most people just grunt. Mr. Romney, however, talks about grunting. ''Grunt'' he says, onomatopoetically, when annoyed with a last-minute change in his campaign schedule.
Many of Mr. Romney's verbal habits can sound like those of a hyper-literate graduate student who never left school. (In college, he majored in English.) He favors the gentlemanly qualifier ''if you will,'' which he invoked three times during a recent speech.
On how to reduce the debt: ''You have to start accumulating, if you will, reserves.''
On speaking to a group of soldiers: ''The cadets were all lined up and sitting at attention, if you will.''
On his business background: ''I've had the experience of working in the real world, if you will.''
In interviews, voters expressed an equal measure of admiration for and curiosity about his quaint dialect, which many described as a conspicuous break from the normally harsh tone of politicians.
''It's a wonderful change,'' said Irene Sperling, a retiree from Allentown, Pa. ''He's a gentleman.''
Wendy Tonn, 63, a Romney supporter who splits her time between Michigan and Florida, said she found comfort in his vocabulary, comparing it to the simple innocence of ''Leave It to Beaver.'' ''We are of that era, and we'd like to be returned to that kind of era,'' she said.
Even Dennis Miller, the comedian, has weighed in, suggesting that after four years of having a ''hipster president'' in the White House, Americans craved a ''gosh president.''
A few acquaintances have tried to drag him linguistically into the 21st century. Mr. Finneran, an admitted serial curser, said that after years of working closely with Mr. Romney, he began to fantasize about provoking him to utter a particularly crude word.
''It got to the point where I started to think that my greatest achievement of all time would be if I somehow or other got him to say the word,'' he said.
Once, Mr. Romney seemed on the cusp of fulfilling that wish during a heated discussion. But he caught himself. ''And I thought, 'Oh, God, my closest moment ever,' '' Mr. Finneran said. ''But it's not going to happen.''

HEADLINE: Submarine Plans Draw Skepticism, Even in Town That Would Benefit

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
GROTON, Conn. -- Here in the Submarine Capital of the World, where the business of undersea warfare employs nearly 20,000 people, no one dismisses Mitt Romney's plan to build three Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines a year instead of the two built each year under President Obama.
But with each submarine costing more than $2 billion, there is skepticism about how to pay for them, even from Representative Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who in 2007 successfully pushed to have the Navy build two submarines a year instead of one and has been known ever since as ''Two Subs Joe.''
''You can definitely make a case'' to build three submarines a year, said Mr. Courtney, whose district is home to the Naval Submarine Base New London and to General Dynamics Electric Boat, both in Groton. Nonetheless, the Romney campaign's math for how to do it, he argued, ''is not realistic at all.'' 
Whoever is right, building more military ships is at the heart of Mr. Romney's plan to gradually increase military spending to 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, a major increase from the Obama administration's budget.
Mr. Romney has made what he calls the nation's underfinanced military a centerpiece of his argument that Mr. Obama has failed to safeguard American strength abroad. Mr. Romney's advisers say the nation remains woefully vulnerable to the maritime threats of China in the Pacific and Iran in the Persian Gulf.
The Obama administration, which has already moved more ships to the Pacific, counters that Mr. Romney is proposing needless Pentagon budget increases when there is universal agreement that government spending has to be cut.
How many trillions of dollars are at stake remains in dispute. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in his debate with Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, that the Romney plan would add $2 trillion to military spending, a figure that Mr. Romney's advisers have rejected as exaggerated.
But Todd Harrison, a senior fellow for defense budget studies at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, has calculated that even if a Romney administration slowly increases the military budget to 4 percent of the G.D.P. over two presidential terms, that would still amount to spending $7.5 trillion over the next decade -- or $1.8 trillion more than the Obama administration plans for the Pentagon's base budget in the same period.
As part of his proposals, Mr. Romney would restore Mr. Obama's cuts of about 100,000 troops in the Army and the Marines, which he says are vital to the battle-readiness of the nation's ground forces, and would invest more in missile defense. But his most specific proposals are to increase the reach and power of the Navy, which plays well in the critical battleground states of Florida and Virginia, both home to large naval installations.
Mr. Romney would build 15 ships a year, including 3 submarines, compared with Mr. Obama's 9 or 10. John F. Lehman, one of Mr. Romney's top advisers on the military, said the Navy was long overdue for an expansion. ''It's too small, and the world is too large,'' Mr. Lehman said in a recent interview, echoing an argument he made when he was President Ronald Reagan's Navy secretary.
Michle A. Flournoy, a national security adviser to the president's campaign and a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, countered that it was the capability rather than the number of ships that mattered, and that shipbuilding in the Obama administration had actually increased from the administration of President George W. Bush.
''Sure it's gone up; I gave them the money,'' Dov S. Zakheim, a Romney defense adviser and the Pentagon comptroller under Mr. Bush, told reporters this month. Mr. Zakheim's argument was that ships take so long to build -- a Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine takes five years to complete -- that the money appropriated in the Bush administration is only now being realized in ships that are in service today.
Ms. Flournoy's central argument is that Mr. Romney's plan to peg military spending to 4 percent of the G.D.P. is not based, she said, on a strategy, a threat assessment or what the Pentagon says it needs. ''It's simply 'Let's throw a figure against the wall and look tough on defense,' '' she said in an interview.
Since Mr. Romney is reluctant to put tax increases on the table to pay for the spending increase, she said, there would have to be ''draconian'' cuts to the rest of the federal budget, including entitlement programs.
For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the Pentagon's base budget is $525 billion. Under Mr. Obama, it is to grow only with inflation over the next decade, keeping military spending essentially flat. By 2022, Mr. Obama's projected annual base Pentagon budget would be $629 billion. Mr. Romney's military budget, using Mr. Harrison's calculations, would be $986 billion.
The figures do not include the supplemental cost of the war in Afghanistan, which is budgeted separately, at $88 billion for this fiscal year. That cost is projected to decrease and eventually disappear after the withdrawal of the bulk of American forces by the end of 2014. Mr. Romney would like to put the savings back into the Pentagon's base budget; Mr. Obama would not.
The current Pentagon budget, including money for the war in Afghanistan, amounts to 4.2 percent of the G.D.P. Without the war costs, military spending is 3.4 percent of the G.D.P. By 2022, Mr. Harrison estimated, Mr. Obama's base Pentagon budget would be 2.6 percent of the G.D.P.
In Groton, the numbers that matter are people. About 10,000 sailors, other military personnel and civilians work on the Navy's submarine base each day. Electric Boat, which shares the building of the two submarines a year with the Newport News Shipbuilding division of Huntington Ingalls, employs more than 8,000 people at its facilities in Groton and across the Thames River in New London.
As a result of the two submarines a year, Electric Boat hired more than 300 engineers this year and has plans to hire more than 300 welders, carpenters and other workers by the end of December.
Advocates say that nuclear-powered submarines, which can get close to shorelines without detection and have highly sophisticated technology to intercept communications, remain crucial to gathering intelligence and waging war.
''The drones are getting a lot of credit right now because they're blowing up guys who live in mud huts,'' said John B. Padgett, a retired rear admiral who is the president of the Naval Submarine League. ''But a submarine will drive in 10 miles off the beach, take a picture of a missile and blow up the missile before it launches.''
Still, there are reservations in Groton about ever more submarines.
''Look, of course we'd love three subs a year,'' said Tony Sheridan, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut, who identified himself as a Democrat. ''But we're also responsible Americans, and we know that we have to deal with the deficit.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Say Iran Has Agreed To Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and MARK LANDLER; David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States and Iran have agreed in principle for the first time to one-on-one negotiations over Iran's nuclear program, according to Obama administration officials, setting the stage for what could be a last-ditch diplomatic effort to avert a military strike on Iran.
Iranian officials have insisted that the talks wait until after the presidential election, a senior administration official said, telling their American counterparts that they want to know with whom they would be negotiating.
News of the agreement -- a result of intense, secret exchanges between American and Iranian officials that date almost to the beginning of President Obama's term -- comes at a critical moment in the presidential contest, just two weeks before Election Day and the weekend before the final debate, which is to focus on national security and foreign policy. 
It has the potential to help Mr. Obama make the case that he is nearing a diplomatic breakthrough in the decade-long effort by the world's major powers to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, but it could pose a risk if Iran is seen as using the prospect of the direct talks to buy time.
It is also far from clear that Mr. Obama's opponent, Mitt Romney, would go through with the negotiation should he win election. Mr. Romney has repeatedly criticized the president as showing weakness on Iran and failing to stand firmly with Israel against the Iranian nuclear threat.
The White House denied that a final agreement had been reached. ''It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections,'' Tommy Vietor, a White House spokesman, said Saturday evening. He added, however, that the administration was open to such talks, and has ''said from the outset that we would be prepared to meet bilaterally.''
Reports of the agreement have circulated among a small group of diplomats involved with Iran.
There is still a chance the initiative could fall through, even if Mr. Obama is re-elected. Iran has a history of using the promise of diplomacy to ease international pressure on it. In this case, American officials said they were uncertain whether Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had signed off on the effort. The American understandings have been reached with senior Iranian officials who report to him, an administration official said.
Even if the two sides sit down, American officials worry that Iran could prolong the negotiations to try to forestall military action and enable it to complete critical elements of its nuclear program, particularly at underground sites. Some American officials would like to limit the talks to Iran's nuclear program, one official said, while Iran has indicated that it wants to broaden the agenda to include Syria, Bahrain and other issues that have bedeviled relations between Iran and the United States since the American hostage crisis in 1979.
''We've always seen the nuclear issue as independent,'' the administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. ''We're not going to allow them to draw a linkage.''
The question of how best to deal with Iran has political ramifications for Mr. Romney as well. While he has accused Mr. Obama of weakness, he has given few specifics about what he would do differently.
Moreover, the prospect of one-on-one negotiations could put Mr. Romney in an awkward spot, since he has opposed allowing Iran to enrich uranium to any level -- a concession that experts say will probably figure in any deal on the nuclear program.
Beyond that, how Mr. Romney responds could signal how he would act if he becomes commander in chief. The danger of opposing such a diplomatic initiative is that it could make him look as if he is willing to risk another American war in the Middle East without exhausting alternatives.
''It would be unconscionable to go to war if we haven't had such discussions,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, who led negotiations with Iran as under secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration.
Iran's nuclear program ''is the most difficult national security issue facing the United States,'' Mr. Burns said, adding: ''While we should preserve the use of force as a last resort, negotiating first with Iran makes sense. What are we going to do instead? Drive straight into a brick wall called war in 2013, and not try to talk to them?''
The administration, officials said, has begun an internal review at the State Department, the White House and the Pentagon to determine what the United States' negotiating stance should be, and what it would put in any offer. One option under consideration is ''more for more'' -- more restrictions on Iran's enrichment activities in return for more easing of sanctions.
Israeli officials initially expressed an awareness of, and openness to, a diplomatic initiative. But when asked for a response on Saturday, Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael B. Oren, said the administration had not informed Israel, and that the Israeli government feared Iran would use new talks to ''advance their nuclear weapons program.''
''We do not think Iran should be rewarded with direct talks,'' Mr. Oren said, ''rather that sanctions and all other possible pressures on Iran must be increased.''
Direct talks would also have implications for an existing series of negotiations involving a coalition of major powers, including the United States. These countries have imposed sanctions to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes but which Israel and many in the West believe is aimed at producing a weapon.
Dennis B. Ross, who oversaw Iran policy for the White House until early 2012, says one reason direct talks would make sense after the election is that the current major-power negotiations are bogged down in incremental efforts, which may not achieve a solution in time to prevent a military strike.
Mr. Ross said the United States could make Iran an ''endgame proposal,'' under which Tehran would be allowed to maintain a civil nuclear power industry. Such a deal would resolve, in one stroke, issues like Iran's enrichment of uranium and the monitoring of its nuclear facilities.
Within the administration, there is debate over just how much uranium the United States would allow Iran to enrich inside the country. Among those involved in the deliberations, an official said, are Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, two of her deputies -- William J. Burns and Wendy Sherman -- and key White House officials, including the national security adviser, Tom Donilon, and two of his lieutenants, Denis R. McDonough and Gary Samore.
Iran's capacity to enrich uranium bears on another key difference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney: whether to tolerate Iran's enrichment program short of producing a nuclear weapon, as long as inspectors can keep a close eye on it, versus prohibiting Iran from enriching uranium at all. Obama administration officials say they could imagine some circumstances under which low-level enrichment might be permitted; Mr. Romney has said that would be too risky.
But Mr. Romney's position has shifted back and forth. In September, he told ABC News that his ''red line'' on Iran was the same as Mr. Obama's -- that Iran may not have a nuclear weapon. But his campaign later edited its Web site to include the line, ''Mitt Romney believes that it is unacceptable for Iran to possess nuclear weapons capability.''
For years, Iran has rejected one-on-one talks with the United States, reflecting what experts say are internal power struggles. A key tug of war is between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ali Larijani, Iran's former nuclear negotiator and now the chairman of the Parliament.
Iran, which views its nuclear program as a vital national interest, has also shied away from direct negotiations because the ruling mullahs did not want to appear as if they were sitting down with a country they have long demonized as the Great Satan.
But economic pressure may be forcing their hand. In June, when the major powers met in Moscow, American officials say that Iran was desperate to stave off a crippling European oil embargo. After that failed, these officials now say, Iranian officials delivered a message that Tehran would be willing to hold direct talks.
In New York in September, Mr. Ahmadinejad hinted at the reasoning. ''Experience has shown that important and key decisions are not made in the U.S. leading up to the national elections,'' he said.
A senior American official said that the prospect of direct talks is why there has not been another meeting of the major-powers group on Iran.
In the meantime, pain from the sanctions has deepened. Iran's currency, the rial, plummeted 40 percent in early October.

HEADLINE: For President, a Complex Calculus of Race and Politics

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
When President Obama greets African-Americans who broke barriers, he almost invariably uses the same line.
''I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you,'' he said to Ruby Bridges Hall, who was the first black child to integrate an elementary school in the South. The president repeated the message to a group of Tuskegee airmen, the first black aviators in the United States military; the Memphis sanitation workers the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. addressed in his final speech; and others who came to pay tribute to Mr. Obama and found him saluting them instead.
The line is gracious, but brief and guarded. Mr. Obama rarely dwells on race with his visitors or nearly anyone else. In interviews with dozens of black advisers, friends, donors and allies, few said they had ever heard Mr. Obama muse on the experience of being the first black president of the United States, a role in which every day he renders what was once extraordinary almost ordinary.
But his seeming ease belies the anxiety and emotion that advisers say he brings to his historic position: pride in what he has accomplished, determination to acquit himself well and intense frustration. Mr. Obama is balancing two deeply held impulses: a belief in universal politics not based on race and an embrace of black life and its challenges. 
Vigilant about not creating racial flash points, the president is private and wary on the subject, and his aides carefully orchestrate White House appearances by black luminaries and displays of black culture. Those close to Mr. Obama say he grows irritated at being misunderstood -- not just by opponents who insinuate that he caters to African-Americans, but also by black lawmakers and intellectuals who fault him for not making his presidency an all-out assault on racial disparity.
''Tragically, it seems the president feels boxed in by his blackness,'' the radio and television host Tavis Smiley wrote in an e-mail. ''It has, at times, been painful to watch this particular president's calibrated, cautious and sometimes callous treatment of his most loyal constituency,'' he continued, adding that ''African-Americans will have lost ground in the Obama era.''
Such criticism leaves the president feeling resentful and betrayed, aides said, by those he believes should be his allies. The accusations are ''an assault on his being,'' said David Axelrod, his chief strategist -- not to mention a discomfiting twist in a re-election fight in which the turnout of black voters, who express overwhelming loyalty to the president but also some disappointment, could sway the result.
But like an actor originating a role on Broadway, Mr. Obama has been performing a part that no one else has ever played, and close observers say they can see him becoming as assured on race in public as he is in private conversation. In 2009, the new president's statement on the arrest of a black Harvard professor by a white police officer set off days of negative headlines; in 2012, he gave a commanding but tender lament over the killing of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, by a white man.
''As he's gotten more comfortable being president, he's gotten more comfortable being him,'' said Brian Mathis, an Obama fund-raiser.
Asked when they could sense that shift, several advisers and friends mentioned the waning hours of Mr. Obama's birthday party in the summer of 2011. As the hour grew late, many of the white guests left, and the music grew ''blacker and blacker,'' as the comedian Chris Rock later told an audience. Watching African-American entertainers and sports stars do the Dougie to celebrate a black president in a house built by slaves, Mr. Rock said, ''I felt like I died and went to black heaven.''
The president, guests recalled, seemed free of calibration or inhibition. He danced with relative abandon, other guests ribbing him about his moves, everyone swaying to Stevie Wonder under a portrait of George Washington.
Trying to Avoid a Wedge
In the White House, Mr. Obama has relied on a long-term strategy on race and politics that he has been refining throughout his career.
As far back as 1995, former colleagues at the University of Chicago remember him talking about moving away from the old politics of grievance and using common economic interests to bind diverse coalitions. ''He argued that if political action and political speeches are tailored solely to white audiences, minorities will withdraw, just as whites often recoil when political action and speeches are targeted to racial minority audiences,'' recalled William Julius Wilson, now a sociologist at Harvard.
Mr. Wilson had turned the world of social policy on its head by arguing that class was becoming more determinative than race in America and pointing out that race-specific remedies were less politically feasible than economic policies that benefited a broad range of people. The young politician absorbed Mr. Wilson's ideas, which matched his own experience as a community organizer and a person whose own life did not fit neat racial categories.
Mr. Obama now presides over a White House that constantly projects cross-racial unity. When discussing in interviews what image the Obamas want to project, aides use one word more than any other: ''inclusive.'' Concerts of Motown and civil-rights-era songs have been stocked with musicians of many races, and in introducing them, the president emphasizes how the melodies brought disparate Americans together. Though the Memphis sanitation workers were involved in a shattering moment of the civil rights struggle -- Dr. King was assassinated after going to support their strike -- they were invited to the White House for a labor event, not a race-oriented one.
Many of the president's most critical domestic policy decisions have disproportionately benefited African-Americans: stimulus money that kept public sector workers employed, education grants to help underperforming schools and a health care overhaul that will cover tens of millions of uninsured Americans. But he invariably frames those as policies intended to help Americans of all backgrounds.
''If you really want to get something done, you can't put it in a way that will kill it before it gets going,'' Mr. Obama said in one meeting, according to the Rev. Al Sharpton. ''We have to deal with the specific problems of different groups -- blacks, women, gays and lesbians, immigrants -- in a way that doesn't allow people to put these wedges in,'' Mr. Sharpton recalled the president saying in another.
That approach, along with the memories of the toxic campaign battles over Mr. Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., has resulted in a White House that often appears to tiptoe around race.
Debra Lee, the chairman and chief executive of Black Entertainment Television, requested interviews with the Obamas in 2009, but press aides told her that they did not want the first couple on BET in the first six months of the administration, she said in an interview. (They appeared later.)
''There was all this caution and concern because we were in the midst of a great American experiment,'' one former aide said. Another aide remembered palpable nervousness about the artwork the Obamas chose for their private quarters in the White House, including some with race-specific messages.
In private, White House aides frequently dissect the racial dynamics of the presidency, asking whether Representative Joe Wilson, Republican of South Carolina, would have yelled ''You lie!'' at a white president during an address to Congress or what Tea Party posters saying ''Take Back Our Country'' really mean. Michelle Obama, often called the glue in her husband's relationship with black voters, sometimes remarks publicly or privately about the pressures of being the first black first lady.
Her husband is more circumspect, particularly on the question of whether some of his opposition is fueled by race. Aides say the president is well aware that some voters say they will never be comfortable with him, as well as the occasional flashes of racism on the campaign trail, such as the ''Put the White Back in the White House'' T-shirt spotted at a recent Mitt Romney rally. But they also say he is disciplined about not reacting because doing so could easily backfire.
''The president knows that some people may choose to be divided by differences -- race, gender, religion -- but his focus is on bringing people together,'' Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser, wrote in an e-mail.
Even when Newt Gingrich called him a ''food stamp president'' during the Republican primaries, the most the president did was shoot confidants a meaningful look -- ''the way he will cock his head, an exaggerated smile, like 'I'm not saying but I'm saying,' '' one campaign adviser said.
To blacks who accuse him of not being aggressive on race, Mr. Obama has a reply: ''I'm not the president of black America,'' he has said. ''I'm the president of the United States of America.''
That statement ''makes me want to vomit,'' Cornel West, an activist and Union Theological Seminary professor, said in an interview. ''Did you say that to the business round table?'' he asked rhetorically. ''Do you say that to Aipac?'' he said, referring to a pro-Israel lobbying group.
Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, with whom the president has a contentious relationship, have echoed the charges that Mr. Obama is insufficiently attentive to African-Americans, even threatening at times to sandbag his agenda.
Even some of Mr. Obama's black supporters privately express the same anxiety, in more muted form. At the first meeting of his top campaign donors last year, some black donors were dismayed when officials handed out cards with talking points on the administration's achievements for various groups -- women, Jews, gays and lesbians -- and there was no card for African-Americans.
The accusation that Mr. Obama does not care about black suffering appears to carry little weight with the African-American public, and yet it tears at the president, say aides, friends and supporters.
After a 2010 speech at the National Urban League, he approached Mr. West. ''He just came at me tooth and nail,'' Mr. West said. ''Are you saying I'm not a progressive?'' Mr. West recalled the president asking.
Mellody Hobson, an Obama fund-raiser, explained why the accusation was painful.
''You expect your family to give you the benefit of the doubt,'' she said.
Out to Change Stereotypes
Shortly before his 2009 inauguration, Barack Obama took his family to see the Lincoln Memorial. ''First African-American president, better be good,'' a 10-year-old Malia Obama told her father, who repeated the story later, a rare acknowledgment of the symbolic shadow he casts.
For all of Mr. Obama's caution, he is on a mission: to change stereotypes of African-Americans, aides and friends say. Six years ago, he told his wife and a roomful of aides that he wanted to run for the White House to change children's perceptions of what was possible. He had other ambitions for the presidency, of course, but he was also embarking on an experiment in which the Obamas would put themselves and their children on the line to help erase centuries of negative views.
While Mr. Obama resists being the president of black America, he does want to change black America, aides say -- to break apart long-held beliefs about what African-Americans can and cannot do. The president, who appointed Lisa P. Jackson and Charles F. Bolden Jr. as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, wants to encourage black achievement in science and engineering, even urging black ministers to preach about the need to study those subjects.
Mr. Obama knows that the next presidential candidate of color may be judged by his own performance, added Charles J. Ogletree, a Harvard law professor. And Mr. Obama's desire to win re-election in part because he is the first black president is ''so implicit it's just like breathing,'' one White House adviser said.
On rare occasions, Mr. Obama allows others a glimpse of the history, expectations and hope he carries with him. At the funeral of the civil rights leader Dorothy Height in 2010, he wept openly. Again and again, those close to him say, Mr. Obama is moved by the grace with which other blacks who broke the color barrier behaved under pressure.
When Ruby Bridges Hall went to see the famous Norman Rockwell portrait of her marching into school, which Mr. Obama had hung just outside the Oval Office, the president opened up a bit. The painting shows a 6-year-old Ms. Hall in an immaculate white dress walking calmly into school, a hurled tomato and a racial slur on the wall behind her.
The president asked Ms. Bridges, now 58, how she summoned up such courage at that age and said he sometimes found his daughters staring at the portrait. ''I really think they see themselves in this little girl,'' he said, according to an interview with Ms. Hall.
''Doing the work we do, it gets really lonely,'' Ms. Hall said. ''I felt like we understood each other because we belong to the same club.''

HEADLINE: The Debatable World

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER. 
The chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
OVER a long campaign, it's become maddeningly difficult to tease out concrete differences in how Barack Obama and Mitt Romney would deal with an angry, unmanageable world that at once craves and resents American intervention.
Iran? Mr. Romney promises toughness, decries the administration's navet that it could talk with the mullahs and declares, when pressed, that he would bring about ''crippling sanctions.'' An amused Mr. Obama says he's already checked that one off, leaving unsaid the cybersabotage that was directed toward Iran's nuclear program out of the Situation Room. Afghanistan? It's a race for the exits, with Mr. Obama at a fast trot and Mr. Romney at a brisk walk, now that he has discarded his primary-season vow that we stay around to kill the Taliban. Mr. Obama is helping funnel light arms to the Syrian rebels; Mr. Romney would send heavy arms, and neither can explain how they would separate secular rebels from jihadists.
These fine gradations -- exaggerated for effect two weeks before Election Day -- will presumably be on display Monday night at the final presidential debate. But with luck, viewers will get a glimpse of the real, gut-level difference in how these two men perceive the future of American power. 
In Mr. Romney's telling, America can -- and must -- restore itself to the glory days when it had unquestioned pre-eminence in the world. It was a brief, shining moment -- that decade bracketed by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the destruction of the World Trade Center, when the United States was what the French called, with some derision, a ''hyperpower.'' A longing for that era lurks in Mr. Romney's critique of what has gone wrong in the Obama years, which he describes as a messy age of jihadist revivals, new nuclear worries and a looming threat from Beijing, and an era in which, he wrote recently, ''our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them.''
For his part, Mr. Obama is a man who tends to live in the moment, reacting to the world's problems while trying to define an emerging Obama doctrine, though it is a phrase the president never utters. To Mr. Obama, that unipolar moment is a gauzy memory. Those longing for it are pining for a global order that cannot exist again. The essence of Mr. Obama's approach has been that the United States will act unilaterally whenever its direct interests are threatened -- think of the Osama bin Laden raid or of the drone strikes and cyberattacks. But he has hesitated to act in cases where he believes others have greater interests at stake than we do: thus America's halfhearted commitment to the military effort to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, and its refusal to take a major role in ousting President Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
If there is a lesson of the past decade, in Mr. Obama's mind, it is that we can no longer afford to fight every war, insert ourselves in the middle of every dispute and get stuck in the muck of occupying nations whose fates are not central to our national interest. Nor can we stop rising powers from ... well, rising.
''The United States does not seek to contain China,'' Mr. Obama was quick to tell the Chinese on his first visit to Beijing, in November 2009, when he was less than a year into his term. ''On the contrary, the rise of a strong and prosperous China can be a source of strength for the community of nations.'' Old cold warriors cringed, but so did many in the president's own party, whose biggest concerns about China focus on jobs and economic influence. It is a view Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton gave voice to when she whispered to the prime minister of Australia on her way to Beijing in 2009: ''How do you deal toughly with your banker?''
Mr. Obama has a tough task. It is a lot easier to go on the trail arguing for America as No. 1 than it is making a case that America's leverage comes in its ability to work with allies. ''It's an incredibly difficult balance, especially for anyone running for president,'' said R. Nicholas Burns, who spent nearly three decades as one of America's top diplomats before he left his post as George W. Bush's under secretary of state for political affairs to teach at Harvard. ''Governor Romney is right to say America must lead, and we are still the indispensable power and must remain a strong and active world leader. But President Obama has developed a modern and effective view of leadership that I think resonates with anyone who has done this kind of work for a living: that in places like Libya, you have to challenge the NATO allies and the Arab states to be in the front lines, and that Americans know we can no longer be everywhere and do everything.''
Mr. Romney's aides say he, too, will use American power sparingly. But the core of Mr. Romney's argument is that the Obama approach is a sure recipe for slow decline.
Maybe these are the differences to be expected between a president who spent his elementary-school years in a yearning middle power in the Pacific -- Indonesia -- and a candidate who was raised in the glory days of industrial America, before the humbling of America's auto industry became a symbol of things to come. Mr. Obama's writings about his youth openly questioned whether American power was used wisely in the cold war years. Mr. Romney's candidacy has been tinged with Eisenhower envy and almost pretends the Bush years never happened. Mr. Obama's starts with the gritty reality that the response to the Sept. 11 attacks cost America $3.3 trillion and counting. One line kept coming back in his speeches on Afghanistan: ''So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars,'' he said at West Point, in late 2009, when he announced the ''surge'' that just ended, with a whimper, last month. ''The nation that I'm most interested in building is our own.''
If that difference flares up anywhere on Monday night, it may be over the defense budget. This is the only part of the federal budget that Mr. Romney views as sacrosanct: he wants a bigger Army, and a Navy that builds 15 new ships a year, a 50 percent increase. It is part of his call for a more muscular America, one that can take on Russia if it ever lives up to Mr. Romney's description of it as America's ''greatest geopolitical threat'' (which Mr. Obama mocked in the first debate) and can keep China from pushing us back toward the middle of the Pacific.
But he has not, at least in his public comments, aligned that with a strategy of when and how he would have the United States intervene around the world. Would we re-enter Afghanistan if the Taliban tried to retake Kabul? Finish the job with American troops in Syria if it looked as if Mr. Assad would hang on, killing thousands more? Join in a military strike against Iran on the theory that America's national interest must be identical to Israel's?
So far, we don't know.
MR. Obama, in contrast, has made clear that the era of sending 100,000 troops to occupy countries for years on end, only to leave amid fuming resentments, is over. His budgets reflect his doctrine: more for cybertechnology like the kind used against Iran, more for drones and Special Forces, and less for keeping a large armed force on hand. That became clear last December, when he gathered the nation's combat commanders into the State Dining Room at the White House and, under the gaze of Abraham Lincoln's portrait, told his audience the party was over. The defense budget had grown 67 percent, in real terms, in the decade since the Sept. 11 attacks, and was wildly higher than it was during the cold war.
So after the Pentagon asked for funding last year to keep 100,000 troops ready for ''stability operations'' around the world -- the kind of operation the United States ran in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the White House suggested they hadn't read the memo: Mr. Obama is out of the occupation business. He seemed to take to heart the parting warning of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, the Republican who served under the last two presidents. On his way out the door, Mr. Gates said that anyone in his job ''who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should 'have his head examined,' as General MacArthur so delicately put it.''
Mr. Gates's view certainly seems to be in tune with the electorate these days. That explains why Mr. Romney has been so tentative about translating his call for a more muscular American approach to the world into specifics. He is trapped, to some degree, by the legacy of George W. Bush -- while he wants to reject the Obama doctrine as too weak and unprincipled, he cannot bring himself to embrace Mr. Bush's first-term enthusiasm for pre-emptive action, or his second-term argument that the United States has a moral obligation to rewire societies that can give rise to despotism or terrorism.
The question of when America should intervene around the world -- and when to leave it to others -- has been the subtext of most major national security debates here for the last decade. Syria is the crisis du jour, but it will not be the last weak state that threatens to devolve into chaotic, violent collapse -- and become new territory for extremists. What we have not decided, as a country, is how much risk we are willing to live with as those states crack, collapse and are reborn. Mr. Obama has put together a nuanced approach that worked in Libya and has frozen in place in Syria. It will be up to Mr. Romney to explain if he has found a third way.

HEADLINE: The Opiate of Exceptionalism

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE. 
A reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
IMAGINE a presidential candidate who spoke with blunt honesty about American problems, dwelling on measures by which the United States lags its economic peers.
What might this mythical candidate talk about on the stump? He might vow to turn around the dismal statistics on child poverty, declaring it an outrage that of the 35 most economically advanced countries, the United States ranks 34th, edging out only Romania. He might take on educational achievement, noting that this country comes in only 28th in the percentage of 4-year-olds enrolled in preschool, and at the other end of the scale, 14th in the percentage of 25-to-34-year-olds with a higher education. He might hammer on infant mortality, where the United States ranks worse than 48 other countries and territories, or point out that, contrary to fervent popular belief, the United States trails most of Europe, Australia and Canada in social mobility. 
The candidate might try to stir up his audience by flipping a familiar campaign trope: America is indeed No. 1, he might declare -- in locking its citizens up, with an incarceration rate far higher than that of the likes of Russia, Cuba, Iran or China; in obesity, easily outweighing second-place Mexico and with nearly 10 times the rate of Japan; in energy use per person, with double the consumption of prosperous Germany.
How far would this truth-telling candidate get? Nowhere fast. Such a candidate is, in fact, all but unimaginable in our political culture. Of their serious presidential candidates, and even of their presidents, Americans demand constant reassurance that their country, their achievements and their values are extraordinary.
Candidates and presidents generally oblige them, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney included. It is permissible, in the political major leagues, for candidates to talk about big national problems -- but only if they promise solutions in the next sentence: Unemployment is too high, so I will create millions of jobs. It is impermissible to dwell on chronic, painful problems, or on statistics that challenge the notion that the United States leads the world -- a point made memorably in a tirade by the dyspeptic anchorman played by Jeff Daniels in the HBO drama ''The Newsroom.''
''People in this country want the president to be a cheerleader, an optimist, the herald of better times ahead,'' says Robert Dallek, the presidential historian. ''It's almost built into our DNA.''
This national characteristic, often labeled American exceptionalism, may inspire some people and politicians to perform heroically, rising to the level of our self-image. But during a presidential campaign, it can be deeply dysfunctional, ensuring that many major issues are barely discussed. Problems that cannot be candidly described and vigorously debated are unlikely to be addressed seriously. In a country where citizens think of themselves as practical problem-solvers and realists, this aversion to bad news is a surprising feature of the democratic process.
''I think there's more of a tendency now than in the past to avoid discussion of serious problems,'' says Allan J. Lichtman, a political historian at American University. ''It has a pernicious effect on our politics and on governing, because to govern, you need a mandate. And you don't get a mandate if you don't say what you're going to do.''
American exceptionalism has recently been championed by conservatives, who accuse President Obama of paying the notion insufficient respect. But the self-censorship it produces in politicians is bipartisan, even if it is more pronounced on the left for some issues and the right for others.
FOR instance, Democrats are more loath than Republicans to look squarely at the government debt crisis indisputably looming with the aging of baby boomers and the ballooning cost of Medicare. Republicans are more reluctant than Democrats to acknowledge the rise of global temperatures and its causes and consequences. But both parties, it is fair to say, prefer not to consider either trend too deeply.
Both parties would rather avert their eyes from such difficult challenges -- because we, the people, would rather avert our eyes. Talk to any political pro about this phenomenon and one name inevitably comes up: Jimmy Carter, who has become a sort of memento mori for American politicians, like the skulls in Renaissance paintings that reminded viewers of their mortality.
Mr. Carter, they will say, disastrously spoke of a national ''crisis of confidence'' and failed to project the optimism that Americans demand of their presidents. He lost his re-election bid to sunny Ronald Reagan, who promised ''morning in America'' and left an indelible lesson for candidates of both parties: that voters can be vindictive toward anyone who dares criticize the country and, implicitly, the people.
This is a peculiarly American brand of nationalism. ''European politicians exercise much greater freedom to address bluntly the uglier social problems,'' says Deborah Lea Madsen, professor of American studies at the University of Geneva. An American politician who speaks too candidly about the country's faults, she went on to say, risks being labeled with that most devastating of epithets: un-American.
The roots of this American trait are often traced to the famous shipboard sermon the Puritan lawyer John Winthrop preached on his way to help found the Massachusetts Bay Colony nearly five centuries ago.
''We must consider,'' he said, ''that we shall be as a city upon a hill -- the eyes of all people are upon us.'' Winthrop's metaphor has had a long life in American speechifying, prominently quoted by both President John F. Kennedy and Reagan. But if, for Winthrop, the image was something the colony should aspire to, for modern politicians it is often a boast of supposed accomplishment, a way of combating pessimists and asserting American greatness, whatever the facts.
Could a presidential candidate today survive if he promised to wage a war on poverty, as President Lyndon B. Johnson did in 1964? It seems unlikely, and one reason may be that Johnson's effort fell short, revealing the agonizing difficulty and huge cost of trying to change the lives of the poor.
Indeed, in the current fiscal environment, promising an ambitious effort to reduce poverty or counter global warming might imply big new spending, which is practically and politically anathema. And given the increasing professionalization of politics, any candidate troubled by how the United States lags its peers in health or education has plenty of advisers and consultants to warn him never to mention it on the stump.
''Nobody wants to be the one who proposed taking the position that got the candidate in trouble,'' says Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University who studies presidential communications.
Of course, the reason talking directly about serious American problems is risky is that most voters don't like it. Mark Rice, who teaches American studies at St. John Fisher College in Rochester, N.Y., said students often arrived at his classes steeped in the notion that the United States excelled at everything. He started a blog, Ranking America, to challenge their assumptions with a wild assortment of country comparisons, some sober (the United States is No. 1 in small arms ownership) and others less so (the United States is tied for 24th with Nigeria in frequency of sex).
''Sure, we're No. 1 in gross domestic product and military expenditures,'' Mr. Rice says. ''But on a lot of measures of quality of life, the U.S. ranking is far lower. I try to be as accurate as I can and I avoid editorializing. I try to complicate their thinking.''

HEADLINE: Wall St. May Not Cheer, But Obama's Been Good for Stocks

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
''ARE you better off than you were four years ago?''
Ronald Reagan asked that memorable question at the end of the presidential debate of October 1980, one week before Election Day.
Millions of voters answered no -- sweeping President Jimmy Carter from office and installing the Republican Party in the White House for the next 12 years.
In the presidential debate last Tuesday on Long Island, and through much of this campaign season, Mitt Romney has been raising a similar question. He said last week that middle-class incomes have declined since President Obama took office, while gasoline prices have risen. And much as Mr. Reagan did several decades ago, Mr. Romney suggested that Americans are worse off today than they were four years earlier.
By some objective measures, we are worse off -- although that is at least partly because a severe recession was well under way and the economy was shrinking when Mr. Obama first walked into the White House as president. Based primarily on the grim fundamental economic data, several forecasting models have been showing for months that Mr. Obama faced a very difficult road to re-election. 
Yet for the most part, he has been holding his own in the polls and the prediction markets. At the moment, he is widely considered to have an advantage in the all-important Electoral College.
But why? Elections, of course, are not decided on economics alone. ''Campaigns matter, at least a little,'' said Thomas M. Holbrook, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. ''The issues and the candidates matter, at least a little.'' Yet to the extent that the economy determines the election's outcome, it's possible that the stock market holds part of the explanation for Mr. Obama's outsize electoral strength.
Through Friday, since Mr. Obama's inauguration -- his first 1,368 days in office -- the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 67.9 percent. That's an extremely strong performance -- the fifth best for an equivalent period among all American presidents since 1900. The Bespoke Investment Group calculated those returns for The New York Times.
The best showing occurred in Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, when the market rose by a whopping 238.1 percent. Of course, that followed a calamitous decline. When his term started, the Dow had fallen to one-fourth of its former peak. In 2008, the year before Mr. Obama took office, the Dow declined by roughly one-third.
After Franklin Roosevelt, the next-best market performances occurred under Calvin Coolidge, Bill Clinton and Dwight Eisenhower. These exceptionally strong markets helped all of them win the next election -- and the stock market is undoubtedly helping Mr. Obama, too, even if he isn't saying much about it.
''What I find most ironic about these numbers is that one of Obama's weaknesses is said to be his economic record,'' said Paul T. Hickey, Bespoke's co-founder. ''While the stock market isn't a complete reflection of the economy, it is an important indicator, and the stock market is one of the great things the president has working in his favor. But it's a sensitive subject. With Wall Street so despised by the average American right now, it's probably something he doesn't want to be too quick to trumpet. But facts are facts.''
The market's relationship to the economy and to the political system is complex and varying from era to era. But a simple truth is that the market's rise and fall has an enormous effect on the wealth of ordinary Americans -- and on whether they feel themselves to be wealthy.
Some market effects on wealth are straightforward enough. With the relative decline of traditional pensions, and the rise of defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s, the well-being of middle-class households is intimately connected to the stock market's fortunes. That was shockingly evident in 2008, when the Dow declined by more than 33 percent. That market fall, on top of a sharp drop in housing prices, contributed to a 19 percent decline in the total net worth of American households that year, according to figures compiled by the Federal Reserve.
Relatively low housing prices continue to depress aggregate wealth levels, the Fed's Flow of Funds report shows. But when stock market values are factored in, the rising value of financial assets -- including stocks -- has restored the total wealth of American households. Using this measure, it is now higher than when Mr. Obama's presidency began, Fed figures indicate.
Unfortunately for millions of Americans, that can't be said for median household income, which was only $51,023 last year, down from $53,206 in 2009, according to Census Bureau figures adjusted for inflation. While it appears to have risen in 2012, median household income almost certainly has not returned to its former level. And rising income inequality means that the hardship has been felt disproportionately by poor people, who face a double-whammy: they don't have financial assets that have grown in value.
Presidential election forecasting models using ''objective data'' like personal income, gross domestic product and unemployment have captured the gloomy realities of the economy, painting a relatively bleak picture of Mr. Obama's electoral chances. But Robert S. Erikson, a professor of political science at Columbia University, said, ''If you include subjective data -- emphasizing expectations about the economy -- you get a very different forecast.'' In a paper, Professor Erikson and Christopher Wlezien of Temple University described a forecasting model using consumer sentiment measures and leading economic indicators. That model predicts an Obama victory ''quite strongly,'' Professor Erikson said in an interview.
The performance of the stock market, at least to some extent, is a subjective rendering of market participants' expectations for the corporate economy. It's a complicated subject, partly because market prices tend to rise when interest rates are low, as they are now, thanks largely to efforts of the Fed and other central banks.
Do these relatively high prices really reflect the future outlook for the economy? It's not certain. But the stock market is an important component of many measures of leading economic indicators, and it is clearly painting a rosier picture than the retrospective headline numbers about the economy -- like the 1.3 percent annual growth rate of G.D.P. in the second quarter or the 7.8 percent unemployment rate in September.
IT'S often said that Wall Street prefers Mitt Romney to Mr. Obama, Mr. Hickey observed, yet the stock market has flourished under the president -- and under Democratic presidents generally. Since 1900, it has returned 7.1 percent annually when Democrats have occupied the White House, and only 3 percent under Republicans.
Mr. Carter was an exception. The market declined 0.3 percent in his first 1,368 days in office -- a performance more than 68 percentage points worse than that for Mr. Obama.
Are you better off than you were four years ago? For stock portfolios, at least, the last four years have been bumpy but they haven't been bad at all.

HEADLINE: Christopher Murphy for Connecticut

 BODY:
The battle to replace the retiring Senator Joseph Lieberman has become one of the toughest and most crucial in the country. Republicans have again chosen the former wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who lost the Senate race in 2010 to Richard Blumenthal despite spending $50 million of her own money. This time, she is spending at least $27 million. Representative Christopher Murphy, the Democratic candidate, has been trying to break through her attack ads, which blanket Connecticut airwaves. 
Mr. Murphy, a thoughtful and productive public servant, spent nearly six solid years in Congress, with an almost perfect voting record. He was a strong voice for ending the war in Iraq and worked diligently on the committee that helped draft the health care reforms. He also helps run a bipartisan group in the House, the Center Aisle Caucus, that tries to find common ground between the two parties.
Ms. McMahon has tried to soften her earlier image as the tough, no-holds-barred chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment. She has promised to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and has supported the infamous Blunt amendment that would have allowed employers to refuse to cover contraception. She says she will focus on policies that improve the economy and create jobs.
Her campaign has spent a lot of its energies on demonizing Mr. Murphy for failing to pay personal bills and for getting a break on a home-equity loan despite those lapses. Mr. Murphy denies there was any favoritism in the loan and has said that these ''screw-ups'' were remedied quickly. Ms. McMahon and her husband are no strangers to financial issues: they declared bankruptcy in 1976 while owing $1 million to 26 creditors. And she has been late paying property taxes, most recently this year on a luxury condominium in Stamford.
We endorse Christopher Murphy for the Senate.

HEADLINE: The Fiscal Stimulus, Flawed but Valuable

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA D. ROMER. 
Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of , President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.

 BODY:
AS a former member of President Obama's economic team, I have a soft spot for the fiscal stimulus legislation he signed just a month after his inauguration.
But I'm also an empirical economist who's spent a career trying to estimate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy. So let me put on my empiricist's hat and evaluate what we know about the legislation's effects.
After listening to Representative Paul Ryan in the vice-presidential debate, you might think that careful evaluation isn't needed. In his view, we spent $800 billion on the stimulus, yet unemployment still rose to 10 percent -- so obviously it wasn't helpful.
To understand what's wrong with that reasoning, think of someone who's been in a terrible accident and has massive internal bleeding. After lifesaving surgery, the patient still feels rotten. But we shouldn't conclude from this lingering pain that the surgery was useless -- because without it, the patient would have died. 
Without knowing where the economy was headed in the absence of the stimulus, it's impossible to judge what it contributed just from what happened afterward. That's why empirical economists rely on other approaches.
One is to look at history. The stimulus legislation, technically known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, was a mixture of tax cuts for families and businesses; increased transfer payments, like unemployment insurance; and increased direct government spending, like infrastructure investment. A growing literature examines the effects of such tax cuts and increases in government spending over history and across countries, and the overwhelming conclusion is that fiscal stimulus raises employment and output in the near term.
When the Congressional Budget Office or leading private forecasters assess what the Recovery Act contributed, they use these estimates from history. They multiply the amounts of different types of stimulus in the act by their usual historical effects. This method suggests that at its peak, the act raised employment by about 1 million to 3 1/2 million jobs, compared with what would have happened without it.
But history isn't destiny. It's possible that the various elements of the Recovery Act worked better or worse than similar measures in the past. That's why a cottage industry has emerged of researchers looking explicitly at the recent experience.
The most successful of these studies focus on the variation in Recovery Act spending across states. Some of this variation resulted from differences in the recession's severity. For example, there was much more spending on unemployment insurance in Michigan than in Wyoming, because unemployment rose much more in Michigan. We wouldn't want to look at that variation and say Recovery Act spending caused unemployment to be higher, because causation clearly ran in the other direction.
But some Recovery Act spending was allocated via formulas unrelated to economic conditions in particular states. For example, some road-repair expenditures were based on the miles of highways in each state, and some aid to state governments was based on past Medicaid funding. This kind of spending provides a sort of natural experiment: some states received more treatment from the Recovery Act than others for relatively random reasons.
TWO careful studies have looked at the relationship between this formulaic spending and employment. Both find that states that received more money fared substantially better. This is the strongest direct evidence that the Recovery Act contributed to employment growth. Based on the estimated size of the effect, the studies suggest that the act created more than three million jobs.
Another study using a related method finds noticeably smaller effects. Even it, however, suggests that about a million jobs were created, and that estimate doesn't include the effects of the act's tax cuts.
In addition to its near-term jobs effects, the Recovery Act may also be having more lasting benefits. It's too early to measure the value of the roads, bridges and airports improved through stimulus funds. But a survey of influential studies looking at highway construction in the 1950s and '60s suggests that such investments contribute substantially to long-term growth.
Likewise, the Recovery Act's funding of basic research and clean-energy technology is only just beginning to pay dividends. And, contrary to some claims, the Government Accountability Office has found that those investments were accompanied by almost no fraud and abuse.
The act may have also helped prevent a permanent rise in unemployment. The longer workers are unemployed, the more likely they will never find steady employment again. By creating millions of jobs for unemployed workers in 2009 and 2010, the Recovery Act may have prevented some of these scarring effects.
THOUGH the Recovery Act appears to have had many benefits, it could have been more effective.
Most obviously, it was too small. When we were designing it, most forecasters estimated that the United States would lose around six million jobs during the recession without fiscal stimulus. Compared with this baseline, creating three million jobs would have filled roughly half of the employment hole.
As it turned out, even with the stimulus, we lost almost nine million jobs. Indeed, because of horrific job losses in late 2008 and early 2009, we'd nearly passed the six-million mark before the Recovery Act was even signed. Adding in the estimated effect of the act, the correct no-stimulus baseline was a total employment fall of nearly 12 million. With a loss that big, creating three million jobs was helpful, but not nearly enough.
A different mix of spending increases and tax cuts might also have been desirable. The money given to state and local governments to ease their budget problems appears to have been particularly effective for job creation in the near term. On the other hand, many families didn't even realize they had received a tax cut, so that part of the act may have had a smaller impact than was initially projected. And I desperately wish we'd been able to design a public employment program that could have directly hired many unemployed workers, especially young people.
Finally, there's little question that policy makers -- myself included -- should have worked harder to earn the public's support for the act. One frustrating anomaly is that many of its individual components routinely received favorable reactions in polls, while the overall act was viewed negatively.
That is more than a simple public relations problem. Recovery measures work better when they raise confidence -- as Franklin D. Roosevelt understood. His fireside chats, and his inaugural address proclaiming he would fight the Great Depression with the same resolve he would muster against a foreign foe, were aimed at reassuring Americans. Recent research suggests that New Deal programs may actually have had their primary impact on the economy by influencing consumer and business expectations of future growth and inflation.
Partly because of fierce political opposition, and partly because of ineffective communication and imperfect design, the Recovery Act generated little such rebound in confidence. As a result, it didn't have that extra, Rooseveltian kick.
The ultimate verdict on the Recovery Act will depend in part on further studies. I believe that as more research occurs and the political rancor fades, the fiscal stimulus will be viewed as an important step at a bleak moment in our history. Not the knockout punch the administration had hoped for, but a valuable effort that improved the lives of many.

 BODY:
Among the suddenly numerous Indian film festivals in New York, the SOUTH ASIAN INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, now in its ninth year, stands out for showing movies that push boundaries and sometimes buttons. Bypassing the starry entertainments of Bollywood -- and Tollywood, Kollywood and Mollywood -- the festival offers documentaries and features with a decidedly independent spirit.
Filmmakers may rebel against the commercial movie business, but they remain fascinated with it and its hold on culture. Ashim Ahluwalia's ''Miss Lovely,'' which opens the festival on Wednesday, explores the seamy side of the industry, with the story of two brothers who make porn and horror films in 1980s Bombay. We get occasional, dead-on glimpses of the brothers' shlocky product, pulsating with bad vibes and vulgar allure. Mostly, though, Mr. Ahluwalia, a documentarian making his fiction film debut, keeps his camera trained on the behind-the-scenes ugliness and exploitation, even at the risk of being tedious. But sordid dream factories still produce dreams, and ''Miss Lovely''has sympathy for the strivers it shows, men and women trapped in the gutter but compulsively and vainly reaching for the stars. Wednesday at 8, N.Y.I.T. Auditorium, 1871 Broadway at 61st Street; festival continues through Oct. 30 at various locations; saiff.org. 
BEYOND CAGE is more than just another entry in this year's John Cage centenary sweepstakes. Organized by Petr Kotik, a seasoned new-music flutist, conductor and composer, this eight-concert celebration showcases some of Cage's most ambitious creations among works by his peers and his successors. The series starts on Monday at Carnegie Hall, as Mr. Kotik and his Orchestra of the S.E.M. Ensemble recreate their 1992 presentation of Cage's ''Atlas Eclipticalis'' and ''Winter Music.'' On Thursday at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the Flux Quartet plays Cage's ''Four'' and pieces by Feldman, Nono, Mr. Kotik and others. At 8 p.m.; Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, brownpapertickets.com.
The composer Phil Kline's ''OUT COLD,'' created for BAM's Next Wave Festival, draws inspiration from Schubert's soul-wracked song cycles and Frank Sinatra's saloon confessionals. At 7:30 p.m., Fishman Space, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 321 Ashland Place, near Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org.
Whitney Houston was no stranger to reality shows, having exposed the unraveling of her marriage and the disintegration of her once-shimmering life through drug abuse in ''Being Bobby Brown,'' on Bravo in 2005. No one has probably suffered more in the wake of Houston's death in February than her daughter with Mr. Brown, Bobbi Kristina Brown, now 19 and the sole heir to her mother's estate. But there's grief to go around in ''THE HOUSTONS: ON OUR OWN,'' to have its premiere on Wednesday at 9 p.m. on Lifetime. Mining the void left by its absentee star, the series follows Ms. Brown as she navigates a perilous young adulthood with the help of her Uncle Gary; his wife, Pat, the estate's executor; their teenage daughter, Rayah; and Nick Gordon, the boy Houston raised as a son.
The series begins as the family flies from Atlanta to Newark to spend Mother's Day with its matriarch, the gospel singer Cissy Houston, and to make its first visit to Houston's grave. That scene, accompanied by Whitney Houston's rendition of ''I Love the Lord,'' is filled with a dignity long missing from her life, which viewers may only hope lingers beyond this episode.
Anthony LaPaglia and Kathryn Erbe know from criminals. They have both logged many hours on prime time bringing shady characters to justice -- he on ''Without a Trace'' and she on ''Law and Order: Criminal Intent.'' But are they ready to take on the monumentally shady ethics of national politics? Are they ready to take on -- drum roll, please (or sinister cackle) -- the Nixons?
In Douglas McGrath's ''CHECKERS,'' now in previews at the Vineyard Theater, Mr. LaPaglia (a Tony winner for the 1998 revival of ''A View From the Bridge'') will be portraying Richard Nixon and Ms. Erbe, his cloth-coat-wearing wife, Pat. Set in 1952, when Nixon was Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice-presidential running mate, this play considers the events surrounding what is still perhaps Nixon's most famous speech (at least pre-Watergate). That came when he addressed allegations of financial improprieties on national television, setting a precedent for strategic humble-pie-eating on the small screen. No word on who, if anyone, will be playing the title character, the Nixons' cocker spaniel, in a production that promises to vibrate with echoes of today. Terry Kinney (''reasons to be pretty'') directs. Opens Oct. 31, the Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org, $75.
Almost all accounts of the career of the German artist Rosemarie Trockel mention Joseph Beuys as a major influence, though she has made his view of art, as an intersection of the mythic and mundane, her own, as will surely be evident in ''ROSEMARIE TROCKEL: A COSMOS,'' opening at the New Museum on Wednesday.
Born in 1952, Ms. Trockel is a logical candidate for a New York career retrospective, though the New Museum show is not exactly that. It will include some of her signature work, notably the ''knit paintings'' that she had been making for years, machine-generated weavings with loaded images -- Playboy logos, Soviet hammers and sickles, commercial brand emblems.
But she has chosen to share the space with artists with whom she feels an affinity, in effect defining her sensibility through theirs. One is the American fiber artist Judith Scott (1943-2005), who was born deaf, mute and with Down syndrome. Another is the 18th-century Spanish botanist Jos Celestino Mutis, who defended the Copernican view of the universe before the Spanish Inquisition. A third is the German scientific illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian (1647-1717), who united science and beauty, perfectly, in her depictions of butterflies.
How Ms. Trockel's art will complement, extend, explain or otherwise connect with these artists remains to be seen, but there's no question that she has surrounded herself with heroically cosmic company. Through Jan. 20, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side; (212) 343-0460, newmuseum.org.
Ever since Marius Petipa choreographed it in St. Petersburg in 1877, ''LA BAYADRE'' has been a treasured ballet. Now the Royal Danish Ballet is staging it in a new production by Nikolaj Hbbe that opens Nov. 10 in Copenhagen. But thanks to the Works and Process series at the Guggenheim Museum, dancers from the company will present a sneak preview of its highlights.
Petipa set his ballet in a storybook India. A rajah gives his daughter to a warrior as a reward for bravery. But the warrior secretly loves a temple dancer, and what follows is a tale of intrigue and murder with passages of glorious choreography, including the Kingdom of the Shades scene for an ensemble of ethereal women.
Mr. Hbbe may love the choreography but not the plot, for he puts his version in 19th-century India and makes the warrior a British lieutenant, while the rajah becomes a vice consul with a daughter. But the temple dancer remains a temple dancer and the Shades also become temple dancers, rather than spirits. Mr. Hbbe and Richard Hudson, his designer, will be on hand to discuss their dramaturgical changes. Sunday at 7:30 p.m. ($50); Monday at 3 p.m. ($40) and 7:30 p.m, ($50), 1071 Fifth Avenue at 89th Street; (212) 423-3587, www.worksandprocess.org.
The tenor saxophonist BILL McHENRY has a robust, unsentimental tone that scans as old-fashioned: he can make you think of someone like Dexter Gordon, though the comparison has less to do with his phraseology than with the weight and grain of his timbre. His playing reflects a hunger for originality and economy: like an Old West pioneer, he balances an expeditionary urge against a code of survivalist thrift. Mr. McHenry has often partnered with musicians of like temperament, but not in his current quartet. Its supporting cast -- the pianist Orrin Evans, the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Andrew Cyrille -- skews more voluble and emphatic than he does. There are a few kinds of rigor at work here, with Mr. McHenry's as the loose governing authority.
During the band's opening set at the Village Vanguard this spring, it took a while to find its footing. But a new album recorded later that week -- ''La Peur du Vide'' (Sunnyside), which means ''fear of the void'' -- is unremittingly strong, which raises the bar for a repeat engagement. Tuesday through next Sunday. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village; (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25, with a one-drink minimum.

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan Can't Lose

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
On a Monday night in late September, Paul Ryan sat on the edge of a couch in his suite at the Cincinnatian Hotel, his left fist clenched so tightly around the neck of his bottle of Miller Lite that I could see the veins bulging in his hands. It was the end of a long day that began at Ryan's home in Janesville, Wis., where he'd spent the weekend preparing for the vice-presidential debate. Early Monday morning, he flew to the first of two fund-raisers, on top of which he did three local TV interviews and a brief chat on Fox Business Network and also a town-hall meeting, plus a half-hour phone call with Mitt Romney, after which he finally settled in on the couch to watch his Green Bay Packers play the Seattle Seahawks on ''Monday Night Football.'' A few minutes after kickoff, Ryan's traveling press secretary, Michael Steel, led me into the suite where Ryan was watching the game with his older brother Tobin, his campaign adviser Dan Senor, the Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. 
''Is this the guy who's writing that hit piece on me?'' Ryan said, rising to shake my hand. He's adept at wielding sarcasm in a way that can both disarm and manipulate -- signaling a likable, faux-fatalistic awareness of How the Game Is Played. At 42, Ryan looks even younger and more angular in person than he does on television. He says he was teased as a child for looking like Eddie Munster, because of his black widow's peak, and in the course of reporting this article, I also heard people liken him to Greg Brady; Will Schuester, the music-club director in ''Glee''; Kyle MacLachlan, who played Special Agent Dale Cooper on ''Twin Peaks''; a bat; an owl; an eagle; and Boner, from ''Growing Pains.''
''Get yourself some ribs,'' Ryan said after shaking my hand. Everyone had plates balanced on their laps filled with ribs and chicken and coleslaw from a Cincinnati barbecue joint that Ryan frequented in his college days at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The game on TV was the infamous contest -- the crime, Ryan called it -- that effectively forced a settlement of the referees' lockout, after Seattle won on a last-second touchdown pass that the replacement officials should have ruled an interception or offensive pass interference. At a rally the next morning, Ryan would parallel the incompetence of the replacement refs to President Obama's handling of the economy. But the calamity unfolding now involved the Packers offensive line being devoured by the Seattle pass rush, which was on its way to sacking quarterback Aaron Rodgers eight times in the first half. ''And we drafted all these linemen too,'' Ryan said.
Ryan tries to plan his schedule around Packers games and also owns shares in the team, the only nonprofit, community-held professional sports franchise in the United States. ''I am an owner,'' he said proudly. When I made a crack about how that would make him another of Mitt Romney's rich N.F.L.-owner pals -- a reference to Romney's ill-fated attempt in March to score Everyman points by asserting his friendship with a couple of the league's chieftains -- Ryan did not seem to know what I was talking about, or pretended not to.
Across from the couch where Ryan was sitting, Portman kept urging me to ''get some sauce'' for my ribs, motioning to a glass bowl next to the television. Portman, a former congressman and White House budget director, was a top runner-up to Ryan in the vice-presidential sweepstakes. One mark against the wealthy senator was that he might be perceived as too much of a Grey Poupon Republican in the stiff mold of Romney, an image Ryan helps to counter with his deer-hunting, football-loving, Rage Against the Machine-listening ways. As Seattle's quarterback unleashed a long pass from midfield -- and as Portman looked up suggestively at me and said, again, ''It's all about the sauce'' -- the Ryan brothers let out a simultaneous moan as the Seahawks went up 7-0. Ryan swigged from his beer and sniffled and made the first of several mentions of the bad head cold he was fighting. ''I should not be drinking,'' he said. ''But, c'mon, it's ribs, it's football, so I gotta have a beer.'' He then coughed a couple of times and announced that he would be watching the second half in bed.
Earlier this month, I traveled to Danville, Ky., for the debate in which Ryan would turn in a competent if somewhat innocuous performance that was largely overshadowed by Joe Biden's amped-up mannerisms. In the arc of the campaign, the evening would probably be recalled as a spirited and entertaining spectacle with minimal impact on the ultimate result. What was striking to me was the almost giddy mood that suddenly came over the Romney camp and Republicans in general -- high-fives for Sean Hannity in the spin room, surrogates hailing the efforts of ''the next vice president.'' It was as if they were just now getting their heads around the idea that they might actually win this thing, after a period in which they seemed so resigned to defeat that all that was left to do was engage in a kind of pre-emptive soul-searching over what -- and who -- came next.
When I first started trailing Ryan in late September, things were not looking good for Mitt Romney, and some of this soul-searching was focused on Ryan. Specifically on the question of why he was he not playing a bigger and more visible role in the campaign. The leading actor, Romney, did not seem to be cutting it, after all, and many conservatives were preparing to write him off as another object lesson in Why We Must Stop Nominating Moderates and move on. The campaign endured a snake-bitten stretch that ran from Romney's European tour in July to his bounce-free convention in August and on through a blunder-filled September, ending finally with Romney's strong performance (or Obama's horrific performance, depending on your perspective) in the first presidential debate on Oct. 3. For Ryan, the trick during that bedeviled stretch was to do no harm -- to the campaign, yes, but also to himself. ''There is absolutely no downside to being a good soldier in a presidential race, and Ryan is smart enough to realize this,'' Craig Robinson, the former political director of the Iowa Republican Party, told me on his way to a Ryan rally in Dubuque two days before the vice-presidential debate. ''If Romney loses, I have no doubt the G.O.P. would move on quickly,'' Robinson added. ''And Ryan would, too.''
He was speaking to something that various Republicans were beginning to consider and express -- that if Obama was re-elected, it would be bad, but there could also be an ushering in of the new face of the party. After the drubbing of four years ago and the freak-show primary season and the ill-fated summer, it was time to contemplate a younger, more dynamic and more purely conservative future. To many, Paul Ryan was a key figure -- if not the key figure -- in that future. In fact, his selection as running mate instantly mollified two basic insecurities that had been nagging at the conservative establishment for some time: one was that their standard-bearer, Romney, was a closet moderate who could not win over the hard-core ''movement conservatives''; the other was that the fervor that animated the Tea Party movement had acquired a dangerously anti-intellectual strain, embodied by the likes of Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. When I asked Ryan if today's Republican Party was more ''idea based'' than it was two years ago, he squinted his intense eyes, nodded hard and said yes. I then asked his opinion of the more, let's say, knowledge-averse bent of some conservative populism, mentioning Palin and Bachmann while understanding that he obviously couldn't outwardly offend them or their supporters. ''I have my poker face on,'' Ryan said before letting slip with a tight grin.
In the midst of Romney's deliberations, Ryan was the clear running mate of choice among the right-wing commentariat. (''The Republican Party's intellectual leader,'' wrote The Weekly Standard's Stephen F. Hayes and William Kristol, who is partly credited with ''discovering'' Palin during a cruise to Alaska hosted by the magazine in 2007.) Ryan was considered a long shot among several contenders -- he was too young, too conservative and too potentially offensive to older voters because of his plan to overhaul Medicare. Another knock was that he was too cerebral, or ''wonkish,'' to win broad appeal in a general election. This is one of those backhanded criticisms that in fact flatter. He was ''too smart,'' ''too substantive,'' in other words, for the sound-bite shorthand of the campaign trail.
Ryan had worn the mantle of the ''serious man'' for some time in Washington. It was a reputation burnished by both sides (In 2010, President Obama called his budget plan ''a serious proposal''), and when Ryan was selected, it led many D.C. Thought Leaders to praise Romney for his bold and substantive stroke. In the time I spent with him, everyone around Ryan was very invested in conveying that he is indeed a detail-obsessed man of great substance. Satisfied that I fully appreciated the barbecue sauce, Rob Portman asked me as he was leaving Ryan's suite if I attended the town-hall event that day in Lima. Yes, I had.
''Tell me how many politicians can do that?'' Portman asked.
''Do what?''
''Go out in front of a crowd, with that level of detail and intellectual honesty. I'm impressed!''
''And with a bad head cold!'' Ryan chimed in.
Ryan is gifted at shrouding a cutthroat ambition in sheepish nonchalance. It is a key political skill -- trying constantly to impress without looking as if you're trying -- and one that has eluded many politicians past and present. He is also deft at conveying precision and specificity without being the least bit precise or specific. He has honed his image carefully and promotes it relentlessly on the stump. In late September, Ryan introduced a slide-show demonstration to his appearances. ''I'm sort of a PowerPoint guy, so bear with me,'' he said the first time he did this, in Orlando, Fla., by way of apologizing for his apparent inability to communicate without his security blanket. Though his PowerPoint presentation is an extremely basic four-slide tutorial that shows how much the national debt has risen since World War II -- something that many fifth graders could grasp -- his home crowds invariably nod and praise him for his faith in their ability to grasp hard truths. The PowerPoint shtick, combined with the headbanger energy of AC/DC (''It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n' roll'' blares when Ryan arrives onstage), conveys a not-so-subtle message that Ryan is a distinctly un-Romney-like next-generation hybrid and that he's just ready to get out there and do some truth-telling.
But as with any national campaign, there have been strains: to his health (the head cold has lasted weeks), to his patience (a testy end to a local-news interview in Michigan in early October) and most important to his reputation as a purveyor of the power of reality-based conservatism (his convention speech was like Christmas morning for fact-checkers). Ryan was embarrassed in August after telling the radio host Hugh Hewitt that he once ran a marathon in ''under three, high twos'' (after a writer for Runner's World dug into the records for the Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minn., Ryan acknowledged that his actual time was 4:01.25). And more substantive, in an interview with Chris Wallace on ''Fox News Sunday,'' he was asked repeatedly how he would offset the 20 percent rate cuts that the Romney tax plan called for -- a move that the Obama campaign, citing independent groups, said would cost the government $5 trillion over 10 years. Ryan disputed that figure, but Wallace did not relent, asking how they would pay for the tax cuts, however much they amounted to. ''It's revenue neutral,'' Ryan kept saying. They would eliminate some loopholes and deductions to make up for the rate cut. Which ones? He would not say, and when Wallace pressed, Ryan filibustered with talk about why it was best to give money to individuals rather than to governments. He recited his credentials (''I've been on the Ways and Means Committee for 12 years''), complained about the meaningless subjectivity of statistics and offered his standard ''we can do this'' reassurance. Finally, after Wallace asked Ryan yet again how the numbers would work, Ryan maintained, ''It would take me too long to go through all of the math.''
The Wallace interview fed a problematic narrative for the Romney campaign: that its numbers did not add up. It also slightly tipped the halo of the wonk for Ryan; or at the very least provided an object lesson in the limitations that a supposed seller of ''bold ideas'' and ''hard truths'' confronts when straitjacketed by the on-message demands of a presidential campaign.
Ryan figured on a friendlier audience two days later at a town-hall meeting in Clinton, Iowa. ''I gotta call on her,'' Ryan said, pointing to a woman in a Packers jacket who was raising her hand. The woman, Linda Morrison, asked: ''Where are the answers? I mean, why aren't you more specific? I heard you, was it Sunday, when you were on Fox, and you didn't answer his question about how we're going to -- you know, what are your plans?''
Nodding slowly, Ryan then recited again their list of five priorities -- energy, trade, deficit reduction, etc. -- even though Wallace's question was about his tax plan, which he mentioned last. He noted closing loopholes, ending deductions, again not indicating which ones. He assured Morrison that he did have specifics on how the plan would add up, but it's complicated. ''The problem is it just took me about five minutes to go into all of this with you,'' Ryan said. ''When you are on a 30-second TV show,'' he added, ''you can't do as much.''
After the rally, I asked Ryan if he had any regrets about the Wallace interview. ''I'm not the kind of guy who has a lot of regrets,'' he said, and again he explained his unwillingness to be specific with Wallace as a product of the medium -- television -- rather than any obfuscation on his part. If anything, Ryan said, his challenge is that he becomes too steeped in details, not that he is unwilling to reveal them. ''I get too deep in the weeds too fast, and I start losing people,'' he told me. ''I had about seven statistics running through my mind when Chris asked me that. And I'm like, If I go through a recitation of all this, it's going to burn three minutes, and they're going to change the channel.'' Ryan concluded his answer with his standard, ''Trust me.'' He reassured me: ''We can do what we say we're going to do, we're very clear about that. I've been running numbers on tax-reform proposals for years.''
Skeptics say Ryan owes his superwonk standing as much to comparisons with his colleagues than to any great knowledge or depth. In a recent profile of Ryan by Alec McGillis in The New Republic, Barney Frank dismissed his colleague's brainy reputation as being relative to that of other House Republicans, some of whom had just been implicated in a late-night escapade during a Congressional trip to Israel last summer. ''He is being graded on a curve,'' Frank said of Ryan, ''with a bunch of guys who jump into the Sea of Galilee because they want to be closer to God.''
Jared Bernstein, who read Ryan's fiscal proposals when he worked as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Biden, was more pointed regarding Ryan's credibility. ''He definitely talks the talk,'' Bernstein told me. ''He has a great facility with a particular set of words, like 'baseline,' 'nondefense discretionary' and things like that.'' Bernstein said he eventually came to the view that while Ryan might understand basic concepts, ''he does not actually understand what it takes to craft a budget.'' This became clear when Ryan was chairman of the House Budget Committee after 2010. ''I would say at this point that his budgetary knowledge is a stalking horse for his ideology,'' Bernstein told me, meaning that what was important wasn't the actual balancing of the budget but the slashing of government spending and programs like Medicare and Social Security and the revenue-generating taxes that pay for them. By picking Ryan, Romney signaled that he too was all-in on Big Idea conservatism. And here was the guy, popular with the base and well liked in Congress, who was going to help him sell it to America.
While the notion that Washington operates like a high school has become a clich, it is an apt one: ''No one who ever passed through an American public high school could have watched William Jefferson Clinton running for office in 1992 and failed to recognize the familiar predatory sexuality of the provincial adolescent,'' Joan Didion wrote of the former president in ''Political Fictions.'' In a Rolling Stone profile of John McCain during the 2000 presidential campaign, David Foster Wallace described the then-maverick Republican as a ''varsity jock and a hell-raiser whose talents for partying and getting laid are still spoken of with awe by former classmates.'' When Ryan actually was in high school -- Joseph A. Craig High School, in Janesville -- he was the kind who joined a million clubs, befriended teachers and was recognized in his yearbook as his class's Biggest Brown-Noser. People in both parties described him to me as pleasant and thoughtful and one of the easier members of Congress to get along with. Others have found him arrogant, self-righteous and emblematic of the earnest striver types who populate so many Congressional and White House staffs (and think tanks, policy institutes and lobbying shops), no matter what party is in charge.
Like more or less every politician seeking to stay in the capital, Ryan is quick to express his anti-Washington sentiments. ''Not a D.C. guy,'' is how he described himself to me in Cincinnati after a soliloquy on Hu-Dey, a Bengals-inspired beer he consumed back in his college days. He sleeps on a cot in his office (its own clichd symbol of proof of a congressman's unrootedness), the better to work late, save rent and then return home on weekends to see his family in Janesville.
In fact, Ryan has spent half his life in Washington, arriving right out of college to work in a series of staff jobs before being elected to Congress in 1998, at 28. He met his wife, Janna -- who is the first cousin of Representative Dan Boren, a moderate Democrat from Oklahoma -- at a party near Washington, in the late '90s, when she was working as a lawyer and a lobbyist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. He worked closely with Rob Portman in Congress and again years later when Portman served as budget director in the George W. Bush administration; he met Dan Senor in the mid-'90s, when the two were Congressional staff members. A brief foray into the ''do you know'' game with Ryan quickly yields endless Capitol Hill associations. When the name of my New York Times colleague Carl Hulse, who was a longtime Congressional correspondent, came up, Ryan mentioned that he and Carl get their hair cut by the same stylist (Hanna) at a Capitol Hill salon called Bubbles.
Talking to Ryan, I was struck by the number of mentors he has collected at every rung of his career (and several more have taken to describing themselves as such). He attributes this tendency to having lost his father, a prominent lawyer, when he was 16. Ryan came to Washington at 21 and affixed himself to a procession of conservative luminaries, many of them his bosses. He worked for the Reagan-era education secretary William Bennett, with whom he has since taken several mountain-climbing trips to Colorado over the years, as well as the former congressman and supply-sider sage Jack Kemp, who died in 2009 and has been described as a father figure to Ryan. ''He instinctively knew how to get you into the action,'' says Sam Brownback, the governor of Kansas and former member of Congress for whom Ryan worked as legislative director in the mid-'90s. By that, Brownback said, he meant that Ryan combined policy acumen with political instincts that allowed him to see which issues would become hot and which bills had a chance of passing.
One of Ryan's most formative influences has been Tom Coburn, the Republican senator from Oklahoma with whom he overlapped for one term in the House in the late 1990s. Coburn was a viscerally anti-Washington conservative long before that sentiment coalesced into the Tea Party. Known as Dr. No, Coburn, a recently retired physician, has built his political career on displeasing the constituencies that politicians spend most of their time trying to please -- the activists, the donors, the party leadership and many of his colleagues. His contempt for them is genuine, bipartisan and in many cases mutual. He once prescribed a ''spinal transplant'' for 70 percent of the Senate and another time said his colleagues had ''reproductive organs the size of BBs.''
The central tenet of today's Congress is ''careerism,'' Coburn says, mocking the politician's most basic self-preservation impulse. ''Both parties today are ultimately controlled not by ideas but by the desire to be in control, a posture that creates little motivation for bold change,'' he wrote in his 2003 book ''Breach of Trust.'' Ryan told me that he read Coburn's book closely and more than once. It resonated for him throughout the Bush years -- a period in which, despite Republican majorities, he was often profoundly frustrated and unhappy over the continued growth of the government and his own complicity in it.
''I did a lot of defensive voting during that time,'' Ryan said, referring specifically to a 2003 bill that overhauled Medicare and gave seniors prescription-drug benefits at a cost first estimated at $400 billion over 10 years. (''Catholic guilt,'' Ryan joked, explaining his vote.) Gaining a permanent majority supplanted budget discipline as his party's governing imperative. ''Earmark your way, ribbon-cut your way, and you'll keep your job,'' Ryan said. In 2006, House Democrats reclaimed the majority in the midterm elections, putting what Bush called a ''thumpin' '' on the Republican Party. It was well deserved, Ryan said. He thought seriously about quitting Congress, maybe joining a policy group. He did a lot of bowhunting, spending long contemplative days in his tree stand. He talked a lot to Coburn. ''He taught me to do exactly what you believe and let the chips fall where they may,'' Ryan told me.
He introduced the first version of his signature budget plan, ''Roadmap for America's Future,'' in May 2008. Only eight Republicans in the House signed it, wary of the retribution that might come from voters if they were seen supporting an overhaul of Medicare and Social Security. ''People said, 'This is political suicide,' '' Ryan told me. ''I'm like: I don't care. First of all, I don't think that's right, but we'll find out.'' He considered running for Senate in 2010 but says the best possible outcome held no appeal: ''It's 6 years, then 12 years,'' Ryan said. ''And then, next thing you know it's 18 years, and you've spent your entire life in Congress.'' He says this with a tone of contempt and a full-faced smirk that is a bit striking given that it would describe the life choice of many of his colleagues.
''It set him free,'' Coburn told me, speaking of Ryan's vow to himself after 2006. ''If you decide that you're just going to . . . not play the political game, all of a sudden you can have fun.'' I asked Coburn where Ryan fell on the spectrum of Washington careerism. He has been here half his life, after all, and is way too much of a pleaser to ever be a Coburn-style irritant. He would fit many people's definition of a Washington careerist.
''Paul Ryan is a rare exception in my mind, because he still takes bold positions,'' Coburn said. ''My criticism of career politicians is that they always do what's expedient for their career. I don't think what he recommended on Medicare or Social Security was good for his career.''
Early this month, after visiting the Clinton, Iowa, home where his mother-in-law grew up and posing for photos with the current owners, Ryan headed out on an hourlong drive along the Mississippi River to the town of Muscatine. Michael Steel led me onto the cushy campaign bus, appointed with deep vinyl seats emblazoned with the Romney-Ryan insignia, a wood-paneled kitchen, a living room in back and all manner of laptops, television and other communications gadgets. Sitting across from me, Ryan said he thought his party would continue its rightward bend rather than moving back to the moderate middle. ''The Tea Party was a godsend,'' he said, because the movement forced new focus on fiscal issues. The election of 2010 brought a fresh wave of resolute conservatives to Congress, ''but you need another cycle to finish the job, to bring in more cause-oriented people instead of career-oriented people,'' Ryan said. ''That's what I've been trying to encourage.''
Ryan's stump appearances include a standard line in which he says that ''both parties got us into this mess.'' The line always receives big applause, and it seems designed to lend a veneer of bipartisanship to his deeply partisan policy arguments and a personal record that reflects no participation in major bipartisan legislation over 13 years in Congress. Ryan also says in his speeches that winning this election would endow him and Romney with the ''moral authority'' and the ''mandate'' to enact their agenda and move the country, implicitly, to the right. Yet since Romney's successful performance in his first debate, the campaign's message has tacked notably to the center, with more emphasis on Romney's bridge-building efforts with Democrats in Massachusetts (a state the former governor seemed terrified to even utter during the primaries). Romney even struck a softer tone on abortion, at least temporarily, when he told an Iowa newspaper that he saw ''no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda.'' The next day, Romney was compelled to reassert his anti-abortion legitimacy -- assuring reporters that he would ''remove funding for Planned Parenthood.''
In the vice-presidential debate, Ryan emphasized that he would support the position of the Romney administration on abortion, even though it differed from his own. ''I would call him a pragmatic conservative,'' Brownback says of Ryan. He recalls Ryan as a true conservative believer when he was on his staff -- particularly disdainful of government subsidies for ethanol, which are popular in farm states like Kansas. But later, when Ryan was elected to Congress, Brownback teased him about his own support for dairy subsidies in Wisconsin. ''I used to give him raspberries over that,'' Brownback says. ''I would say, 'O.K., Mr. Purity, it's not so easy now, is it?' ''
Ryan told me that he envisions a vice presidency in which he oversees a vast portfolio on fiscal and economic issues. He agreed fully with the suggestion -- first mentioned to me by one of his advisers -- that his assignment could be the fiscal version of the role Dick Cheney played on national security after Sept. 11. ''It's a role where you take your expertise and your value-add and you apply it,'' Ryan said during a conversation in which he used the phrase ''value-add'' three times in a 60-second stretch. ''My knowledge is how Congress works, how the budget works. Economic policy. That's my value-add.''
It's hard not to consider what would happen if Romney continues to campaign as a moderate, wins and then tries to govern as one. In the spin room following the Ryan-Biden debate, I asked Jeb Hensarling, a Republican congressman from Texas and former chairman of the House Conservative Caucus, if he had any concerns about Romney's recent tack to the center. Hensarling immediately pushed back. ''Any question any conservative ever had about Mitt Romney,'' he added, ''was erased when he asked Paul Ryan to be his vice-presidential candidate.'' Hensarling's enthusiasm for Romney was not surprising here -- this was a spin room, after all, not exactly a hothouse for the exchange of private doubts. But I was struck by the degree to which conservatives have taken to using the fact of Ryan's selection as an all-purpose, get-out-of-jail-free card for Romney, even as his campaign coordinators have begun speaking a somewhat different language.
Late on our drive to Muscatine, Michael Steel, the press secretary, asked me if I was sufficiently assured that Ryan was satisfied with his role on the campaign -- that his rapport with Romney was good and he was happy with how he was being used. (I did ask him, and big surprise, the answer was yes.)
''Just noise,'' Ryan told me of the second-guessing about his deployment. The critics ''don't see me on Dayton TV, Richmond TV, Dubuque TV,'' he said. ''It's literally, if I'm not on Fox News every 36 hours, people think I'm fading into the woodwork.''
As the Ryan bus approached Muscatine, the candidate described for me a personal e-mail that Romney sent him three weeks earlier. ''He said, 'I basically picked you because I thought you could help me govern,' '' Ryan said. '' 'I never knew you'd be decent at campaigning, and you turned out to be pretty good at that, too. So, thanks.' ''
I asked if he considered Romney a mentor, and he paused for a second. ''I see him as an older partner,'' he said. ''You have to understand, I was elected to Congress when I was 28, so I'm used to working with a lot of people who are much older. It's a relationship I'm very accustomed to.''
Few if any alliances are as fraught as those between presidents and vice presidents -- strategically, politically, psychologically. It's hard not to wonder how this one would evolve in the White House, what would happen if Ryan found himself wedged between the pragmatic governing demands of his ''older partner'' and the true-belief system of the movement -- and the chamber -- he came from.
If Romney loses, the recriminations play out in two predictable ways among Republicans. Some will say that the party must attract a broader base of support among independent and moderate and nonwhite voters, which would argue for the less severely conservative tone that Romney adopted right after his first debate. They might even point to the presence of Ryan on the ticket as, ultimately, a negative, that his selection did nothing to move national polls in favor of Romney and possibly even scared off potential voters.
But a far more vocal -- and probably bigger -- group on the right will maintain that the ticket was not conservative enough. They will insist that Republicans need to stop nominating the next establishment guy in line. They will say Mitt Romney ran a lousy general election campaign, except for his finest act, the elevation of Paul Ryan, who was a very good Boy Scout and who waited his turn.

HEADLINE: Twisting the Facts About Health Care

 BODY:
The outcome of the presidential election will determine which of two opposing paths the nation will follow on health care for all Americans. If voters re-elect President Obama, he will protect the health care reforms that are his signature domestic achievement. If they elect Mitt Romney, they will be choosing a man who has pledged to repeal the reform law and replace it with -- who knows what?
The competing visions are often difficult to evaluate because the Republican candidates -- Mr. Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan -- have become so artful about obfuscating their plans for Medicare, Medicaid and what they will do to reform the whole system. Almost nothing the Republican candidates say on these or other health care issues can be taken at face value.
Here are some of their bigger evasions: 
REPLACING OBAMACARE Although Mr. Romney has said he wants to ''repeal and replace'' the Affordable Care Act, he has provided few details on what he would replace it with. When challenged to do so at the first presidential debate, Mr. Romney never quite answered and made some egregious misstatements along the way, some of which were repeated by Mr. Ryan in the vice-presidential debate.
Mr. Romney asserted that his plans had already been laid out in ''a lengthy description,'' implying that anyone could read the whole story by turning to his campaign Web site. As it turns out, the site has a page-and-a-half statement that says he would rely on private markets and state leadership but gives no hint of what it would cost or who would pay. A one-page list of frequently asked questions about his Medicare plan assures us that ''Mitt continues to work on refining the details.''
He continues to assert that his plan would cover people with pre-existing conditions when it clearly would not. People who have pre-existing conditions -- and are not already covered by insurance -- are often refused coverage or charged exorbitant rates by private insurers. Starting in 2014, the reform law will require insurers to accept all applicants and charge them without regard to health status. By contrast, Mr. Romney has simply pledged to protect people who had insurance but then lost it, provided they take out a new policy within a short time. But this protection is already required by law and offers absolutely nothing for millions of people who can't get or can't afford private insurance.
He has also implied that the reform law created an unelected board that's ''ultimately'' going to tell people what treatments they can have. The advisory board is specifically precluded by the law from recommending cuts in benefits or eligibility; its job is to propose cuts in payments to providers and insurers if necessary to meet budget targets.
A major goal of the law was to cover some 30 million more people by expanding Medicaid and subsidizing coverage for middle-income people. That goal would be lost if the law was repealed. The Republicans, of course, have no plans for covering the uninsured beyond assuming they can use emergency rooms, leaving the problem to the states.
MEDICARE Mr. Romney has misrepresented what would happen to both current beneficiaries and future generations under his proposals. He says his plans would have no effect on people now on Medicare or nearing eligibility. But if he succeeded in repealing the reform law, which has many provisions that hold down costs for Medicare enrollees, most beneficiaries would see their annual premiums and cost-sharing go up. The average beneficiary in traditional Medicare would pay about $5,000 more through 2022, and heavy users of prescription drugs about $18,000 more over the same period, if the act is repealed, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Mr. Romney also argues that the reform law will weaken Medicare because it cuts some $716 billion from future Medicare spending by slowing the rate of increase over the next decade. Of course, that is essentially the same amount of Medicare cuts in Mr. Ryan's budget resolutions, approved this year and last year by House Republicans.
The reform law justifiably reduces the excessive subsidies to private plans (known as Medicare Advantage) that enroll many beneficiaries. It also lowers the annual rate of increase in payments to providers, like hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies, to force them to become more efficient. Mr. Romney wants to keep overpaying the plans and providers simply to pander to elderly voters.
For future generations, the Romney-Ryan ticket would turn Medicare into a premium-support -- or voucher -- program in which the federal government provides a fixed amount of money to beneficiaries each year and allows it to grow by a small amount annually, which may not keep pace with medical costs. The whole point of turning to vouchers is to reduce federal spending on Medicare, so it seems likely that many beneficiaries would end up worse off than now. (At the vice-presidential debate, Mr. Ryan tried to pretend his premium-support proposal was bipartisan, but the sole Democrat who backed an early version -- Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon -- has disavowed his plan.)
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan insist that the magic of competition among health insurers -- both private plans and a public option like Medicare -- will bring down premiums. But if competition fails to do that, beneficiaries would almost certainly get socked with added payments or fewer benefits.
They say that lower-income beneficiaries would get more-generous premium support and wealthier individuals would receive less support. But, of course, they provide no numbers on what those support levels might be.
MEDICAID The Republicans want to repeal the reform law's expansion of Medicaid to cover millions of low- and middle-income people and instead shrink federal funding by turning Medicaid into a block grant. States would be given a fixed amount of money equal to what they had been getting in federal payments for Medicaid, and that grant would then grow at a rate tied to inflation. If those increases failed to keep up with medical costs, states -- faced with the necessity of balancing their budgets every year -- would probably have to cut enrollments or benefits or payments to providers. That could include cuts to coverage for long-term and nursing home care that millions depend on.
The block grant proposal in Mr. Ryan's budget resolution would reduce federal Medicaid payments to the states by more than $800 billion over 10 years and would cut federal funding by a third in 2022, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mr. Romney blithely said that if a state got into trouble ''Why, we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them.'' Or maybe not. It's another of those vague promises.

HEADLINE: China Is Wary of U.S. Candidates' Tough Talk

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Helen Gao and Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Richer and more assertive since the last American presidential campaign, China is looking at the harsh anti-Chinese sentiment being expressed by both candidates with a mixture of aloofness and unease.
The Chinese say they are accustomed to China-bashing during the American election season, but there is growing concern among government officials, business executives and academics here that this time the attitude toward China among the American public and politicians is so hot it may not cool after Election Day.
From accusations of unfair trade practices to a discussion of whether it is proper for the candidates to have investments in Chinese companies, the word ''China'' came up 22 times, and always negatively, in the debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney last week. In the final presidential debate Monday night, when foreign policy will be the main subject, China is likely to be a center of attention again.
The relationship between China and the United States has become more brittle in the past two years, with differences over trade and strategic interests stoking American fears that China is infringing on the United States' longstanding influence in Asia. For their part, the Chinese watch with growing alarm as their country has become a frequent target of blame for the weakness in the American job market. 
''The U.S. general election, originally thought only a battle over domestic issues -- the economy, fiscal deficit and health care -- has now embroiled China as a punching bag,'' said Fred Hu, chairman of Primavera Capital, a private equity group in Beijing, and former Greater China chairman of Goldman Sachs. ''The noises from the campaign trail are quite disconcerting. It remains to be seen whether the shrill campaign rhetoric about China will just remain as bombast.''
The fears over China in the United States, experts here note, are not limited to the campaign trail. Last month Mr. Obama cited national security concerns as the reason for ordering a Chinese company to divest its shares in wind farm projects near a Navy testing facility in Oregon. A scathing Congressional report called the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei a national security threat to the United States.
China is itself now in the final countdown of the transfer of power from President Hu Jintao to Vice President Xi Jinping, whose ascension to the top Communist Party post is expected to be announced at the 18th Party Congress opening on Nov. 8, two days after the American election. With the political jockeying inside the Chinese leadership more turbulent than expected because of such things as the Bo Xilai scandal and the conflicts with China's neighbors over offshore territory, Beijing has had less time than it might have to focus on the American contest.
''I don't see a clear intention from the Chinese government yet,'' said Hu Shuli, editor in chief of Caixin Media.
Historically, Chinese governments have favored Republican administrations, preferring their perceived stability in foreign policy, Chinese academics say. In particular, they were closely acquainted with and liked George Bush, who was an envoy to China and head of the Central Intelligence Agency before becoming president in 1989.
But those were different times, when the relationship was less interdependent, less vital to the global economy. Chinese government leaders know little about Mr. Romney, analysts here said, and view him as a new kind of Republican who is more conservative than those they have known.
In some respects, the Chinese government would probably prefer a continuation of the Obama administration, they added, on the basis that the incumbent is a known quantity.
''If Obama wins, we will have a smooth relationship without much change,'' said Chu Shulong, a professor of political science and international relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. ''If Romney wins, there will be some uncertainty. If Romney wins, he has to keep some of his words.''
Of particular concern, Mr. Chu said, is Mr. Romney's threat to name China a currency manipulator for keeping the renminbi at an artificially low level. But he and other analysts said they believed that Mr. Romney would be hard put to follow through. That is because the value of China's currency against the dollar has risen substantially in recent years, making it less of a factor in providing Chinese exporters a competitive advantage, and because Mr. Romney would run into a wall of opposition from American businesses that fear they would be deeply scarred by any Chinese retaliation.
''Obviously people are not happy with the Romney rhetoric, but they assume he will adjust if he got into office,'' said Dali L. Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and Tsinghua University in Beijing.
The American election and the impending leadership changes in China coincide with a growing confidence among the Chinese in their own strengths and more wariness toward the United States.
Just 39 percent of those polled in China during the Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project earlier this year described the relationship with the United States as cooperative. In 2010, two-thirds of those polled called the relationship cooperative. Only 8 percent saw the relationship as hostile in the 2010; this year 26 percent viewed it that way.
The survey was conducted between March 18 and April 15 this year among 3,177 respondents, a sample designed to reflect the views of about 64 percent of the adult Chinese population, the Pew Research Center said.
Despite the clamor in the American campaign about China, the coverage here of politics in the United States has been relatively modest. Whether the coverage is limited by the Communist Party's distaste for democratic elections is not clear. By contrast, the coverage here of presidential elections in Taiwan, the island nation considered by the government to be part of China, has been more comprehensive.
In China the American presidential debates are available live only to the very small number of households that subscribe to cable television and whose channels include CNN, or some of the households with satellite dishes.
''Americans shouldn't assume the presidential campaign is watched by people in every second-tier city in China,'' said Rui Chenggang, a prominent interviewer on CCTV, the state broadcaster, and author of ''Something for Nothing.'' ''People don't care about the campaign; they want to know the result.''
But to show how intertwined China has become in the campaign, Mr. Rui posted on his microblog a translation in Chinese of the candidates' back and forth in the last debate on their investments in China. ''I wanted to show that neither candidate is separated from China, that China is an inherent part of the campaign,'' Mr. Rui said.
At a cafe near Tsinghua University on Wednesday night, a small crowd consisting mostly of American students was joined by some Chinese students as they watched a replay of the most recent debate.
A common attitude among the Chinese students was pride that China had become an important issue in the campaign, whether positive or negative. ''We have a power transition in China this year as well, and China's influence is only going to grow,'' said Chen Meini, a senior at Beijing Sport University. ''I think it's good that China is one focus of their campaign. At least we get to influence their policy making.''
Another student, Yang Xiao, a junior at the Beijing Film Academy, said he did not believe that the candidates' negativity about China would hurt China in the long run. If elected, Mr. Romney would ''need to be nicer to China later,'' Mr. Yang said. ''China's rise is inevitable and irresistible.''

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan Can't Lose

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
On a Monday night in late September, Paul Ryan sat on the edge of a couch in his suite at the Cincinnatian Hotel, his left fist clenched so tightly around the neck of his bottle of Miller Lite that I could see the veins bulging in his hands. It was the end of a long day that began at Ryan's home in Janesville, Wis., where he'd spent the weekend preparing for the vice-presidential debate. Early Monday morning, he flew to the first of two fund-raisers, on top of which he did three local TV interviews and a brief chat on Fox Business Network and also a town-hall meeting, plus a half-hour phone call with Mitt Romney, after which he finally settled in on the couch to watch his Green Bay Packers play the Seattle Seahawks on ''Monday Night Football.'' A few minutes after kickoff, Ryan's traveling press secretary, Michael Steel, led me into the suite where Ryan was watching the game with his older brother Tobin, his campaign adviser Dan Senor, the Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. 
''Is this the guy who's writing that hit piece on me?'' Ryan said, rising to shake my hand. He's adept at wielding sarcasm in a way that can both disarm and manipulate -- signaling a likable, faux-fatalistic awareness of How the Game Is Played. At 42, Ryan looks even younger and more angular in person than he does on television. He says he was teased as a child for looking like Eddie Munster, because of his black widow's peak, and in the course of reporting this article, I also heard people liken him to Greg Brady; Will Schuester, the music-club director in ''Glee''; Kyle MacLachlan, who played Special Agent Dale Cooper on ''Twin Peaks''; a bat; an owl; an eagle; and Boner, from ''Growing Pains.''
''Get yourself some ribs,'' Ryan said after shaking my hand. Everyone had plates balanced on their laps filled with ribs and chicken and coleslaw from a Cincinnati barbecue joint that Ryan frequented in his college days at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The game on TV was the infamous contest -- the crime, Ryan called it -- that effectively forced a settlement of the referees' lockout, after Seattle won on a last-second touchdown pass that the replacement officials should have ruled an interception or offensive pass interference. At a rally the next morning, Ryan would parallel the incompetence of the replacement refs to President Obama's handling of the economy. But the calamity unfolding now involved the Packers offensive line being devoured by the Seattle pass rush, which was on its way to sacking quarterback Aaron Rodgers eight times in the first half. ''And we drafted all these linemen too,'' Ryan said.
Ryan tries to plan his schedule around Packers games and also owns shares in the team, the only nonprofit, community-held professional sports franchise in the United States. ''I am an owner,'' he said proudly. When I made a crack about how that would make him another of Mitt Romney's rich N.F.L.-owner pals -- a reference to Romney's ill-fated attempt in March to score Everyman points by asserting his friendship with a couple of the league's chieftains -- Ryan did not seem to know what I was talking about, or pretended not to.
Across from the couch where Ryan was sitting, Portman kept urging me to ''get some sauce'' for my ribs, motioning to a glass bowl next to the television. Portman, a former congressman and White House budget director, was a top runner-up to Ryan in the vice-presidential sweepstakes. One mark against the wealthy senator was that he might be perceived as too much of a Grey Poupon Republican in the stiff mold of Romney, an image Ryan helps to counter with his deer-hunting, football-loving, Rage Against the Machine-listening ways. As Seattle's quarterback unleashed a long pass from midfield -- and as Portman looked up suggestively at me and said, again, ''It's all about the sauce'' -- the Ryan brothers let out a simultaneous moan as the Seahawks went up 7-0. Ryan swigged from his beer and sniffled and made the first of several mentions of the bad head cold he was fighting. ''I should not be drinking,'' he said. ''But, c'mon, it's ribs, it's football, so I gotta have a beer.'' He then coughed a couple of times and announced that he would be watching the second half in bed.
Earlier this month, I traveled to Danville, Ky., for the debate in which Ryan would turn in a competent if somewhat innocuous performance that was largely overshadowed by Joe Biden's amped-up mannerisms. In the arc of the campaign, the evening would probably be recalled as a spirited and entertaining spectacle with minimal impact on the ultimate result. What was striking to me was the almost giddy mood that suddenly came over the Romney camp and Republicans in general -- high-fives for Sean Hannity in the spin room, surrogates hailing the efforts of ''the next vice president.'' It was as if they were just now getting their heads around the idea that they might actually win this thing, after a period in which they seemed so resigned to defeat that all that was left to do was engage in a kind of pre-emptive soul-searching over what -- and who -- came next.
When I first started trailing Ryan in late September, things were not looking good for Mitt Romney, and some of this soul-searching was focused on Ryan. Specifically on the question of why he was he not playing a bigger and more visible role in the campaign. The leading actor, Romney, did not seem to be cutting it, after all, and many conservatives were preparing to write him off as another object lesson in Why We Must Stop Nominating Moderates and move on. The campaign endured a snake-bitten stretch that ran from Romney's European tour in July to his bounce-free convention in August and on through a blunder-filled September, ending finally with Romney's strong performance (or Obama's horrific performance, depending on your perspective) in the first presidential debate on Oct. 3. For Ryan, the trick during that bedeviled stretch was to do no harm -- to the campaign, yes, but also to himself. ''There is absolutely no downside to being a good soldier in a presidential race, and Ryan is smart enough to realize this,'' Craig Robinson, the former political director of the Iowa Republican Party, told me on his way to a Ryan rally in Dubuque two days before the vice-presidential debate. ''If Romney loses, I have no doubt the G.O.P. would move on quickly,'' Robinson added. ''And Ryan would, too.''
He was speaking to something that various Republicans were beginning to consider and express -- that if Obama was re-elected, it would be bad, but there could also be an ushering in of the new face of the party. After the drubbing of four years ago and the freak-show primary season and the ill-fated summer, it was time to contemplate a younger, more dynamic and more purely conservative future. To many, Paul Ryan was a key figure -- if not the key figure -- in that future. In fact, his selection as running mate instantly mollified two basic insecurities that had been nagging at the conservative establishment for some time: one was that their standard-bearer, Romney, was a closet moderate who could not win over the hard-core ''movement conservatives''; the other was that the fervor that animated the Tea Party movement had acquired a dangerously anti-intellectual strain, embodied by the likes of Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. When I asked Ryan if today's Republican Party was more ''idea based'' than it was two years ago, he squinted his intense eyes, nodded hard and said yes. I then asked his opinion of the more, let's say, knowledge-averse bent of some conservative populism, mentioning Palin and Bachmann while understanding that he obviously couldn't outwardly offend them or their supporters. ''I have my poker face on,'' Ryan said before letting slip with a tight grin.
In the midst of Romney's deliberations, Ryan was the clear running mate of choice among the right-wing commentariat. (''The Republican Party's intellectual leader,'' wrote The Weekly Standard's Stephen F. Hayes and William Kristol, who is partly credited with ''discovering'' Palin during a cruise to Alaska hosted by the magazine in 2007.) Ryan was considered a long shot among several contenders -- he was too young, too conservative and too potentially offensive to older voters because of his plan to overhaul Medicare. Another knock was that he was too cerebral, or ''wonkish,'' to win broad appeal in a general election. This is one of those backhanded criticisms that in fact flatter. He was ''too smart,'' ''too substantive,'' in other words, for the sound-bite shorthand of the campaign trail.
Ryan had worn the mantle of the ''serious man'' for some time in Washington. It was a reputation burnished by both sides (In 2010, President Obama called his budget plan ''a serious proposal''), and when Ryan was selected, it led many D.C. Thought Leaders to praise Romney for his bold and substantive stroke. In the time I spent with him, everyone around Ryan was very invested in conveying that he is indeed a detail-obsessed man of great substance. Satisfied that I fully appreciated the barbecue sauce, Rob Portman asked me as he was leaving Ryan's suite if I attended the town-hall event that day in Lima. Yes, I had.
''Tell me how many politicians can do that?'' Portman asked.
''Do what?''
''Go out in front of a crowd, with that level of detail and intellectual honesty. I'm impressed!''
''And with a bad head cold!'' Ryan chimed in.
Ryan is gifted at shrouding a cutthroat ambition in sheepish nonchalance. It is a key political skill -- trying constantly to impress without looking as if you're trying -- and one that has eluded many politicians past and present. He is also deft at conveying precision and specificity without being the least bit precise or specific. He has honed his image carefully and promotes it relentlessly on the stump. In late September, Ryan introduced a slide-show demonstration to his appearances. ''I'm sort of a PowerPoint guy, so bear with me,'' he said the first time he did this, in Orlando, Fla., by way of apologizing for his apparent inability to communicate without his security blanket. Though his PowerPoint presentation is an extremely basic four-slide tutorial that shows how much the national debt has risen since World War II -- something that many fifth graders could grasp -- his home crowds invariably nod and praise him for his faith in their ability to grasp hard truths. The PowerPoint shtick, combined with the headbanger energy of AC/DC (''It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock'n' roll'' blares when Ryan arrives onstage), conveys a not-so-subtle message that Ryan is a distinctly un-Romney-like next-generation hybrid and that he's just ready to get out there and do some truth-telling.
But as with any national campaign, there have been strains: to his health (the head cold has lasted weeks), to his patience (a testy end to a local-news interview in Michigan in early October) and most important to his reputation as a purveyor of the power of reality-based conservatism (his convention speech was like Christmas morning for fact-checkers). Ryan was embarrassed in August after telling the radio host Hugh Hewitt that he once ran a marathon in ''under three, high twos'' (after a writer for Runner's World dug into the records for the Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minn., Ryan acknowledged that his actual time was 4:01.25). And more substantive, in an interview with Chris Wallace on ''Fox News Sunday,'' he was asked repeatedly how he would offset the 20 percent rate cuts that the Romney tax plan called for -- a move that the Obama campaign, citing independent groups, said would cost the government $5 trillion over 10 years. Ryan disputed that figure, but Wallace did not relent, asking how they would pay for the tax cuts, however much they amounted to. ''It's revenue neutral,'' Ryan kept saying. They would eliminate some loopholes and deductions to make up for the rate cut. Which ones? He would not say, and when Wallace pressed, Ryan filibustered with talk about why it was best to give money to individuals rather than to governments. He recited his credentials (''I've been on the Ways and Means Committee for 12 years''), complained about the meaningless subjectivity of statistics and offered his standard ''we can do this'' reassurance. Finally, after Wallace asked Ryan yet again how the numbers would work, Ryan maintained, ''It would take me too long to go through all of the math.''
The Wallace interview fed a problematic narrative for the Romney campaign: that its numbers did not add up. It also slightly tipped the halo of the wonk for Ryan; or at the very least provided an object lesson in the limitations that a supposed seller of ''bold ideas'' and ''hard truths'' confronts when straitjacketed by the on-message demands of a presidential campaign.
Ryan figured on a friendlier audience two days later at a town-hall meeting in Clinton, Iowa. ''I gotta call on her,'' Ryan said, pointing to a woman in a Packers jacket who was raising her hand. The woman, Linda Morrison, asked: ''Where are the answers? I mean, why aren't you more specific? I heard you, was it Sunday, when you were on Fox, and you didn't answer his question about how we're going to -- you know, what are your plans?''
Nodding slowly, Ryan then recited again their list of five priorities -- energy, trade, deficit reduction, etc. -- even though Wallace's question was about his tax plan, which he mentioned last. He noted closing loopholes, ending deductions, again not indicating which ones. He assured Morrison that he did have specifics on how the plan would add up, but it's complicated. ''The problem is it just took me about five minutes to go into all of this with you,'' Ryan said. ''When you are on a 30-second TV show,'' he added, ''you can't do as much.''
After the rally, I asked Ryan if he had any regrets about the Wallace interview. ''I'm not the kind of guy who has a lot of regrets,'' he said, and again he explained his unwillingness to be specific with Wallace as a product of the medium -- television -- rather than any obfuscation on his part. If anything, Ryan said, his challenge is that he becomes too steeped in details, not that he is unwilling to reveal them. ''I get too deep in the weeds too fast, and I start losing people,'' he told me. ''I had about seven statistics running through my mind when Chris asked me that. And I'm like, If I go through a recitation of all this, it's going to burn three minutes, and they're going to change the channel.'' Ryan concluded his answer with his standard, ''Trust me.'' He reassured me: ''We can do what we say we're going to do, we're very clear about that. I've been running numbers on tax-reform proposals for years.''
Skeptics say Ryan owes his superwonk standing as much to comparisons with his colleagues than to any great knowledge or depth. In a recent profile of Ryan by Alec MacGillis in The New Republic, Barney Frank dismissed his colleague's brainy reputation as being relative to that of other House Republicans, some of whom had just been implicated in a late-night escapade during a Congressional trip to Israel last summer. ''He is being graded on a curve,'' Frank said of Ryan, ''with a bunch of guys who jump into the Sea of Galilee because they want to be closer to God.''
Jared Bernstein, who read Ryan's fiscal proposals when he worked as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Biden, was more pointed regarding Ryan's credibility. ''He definitely talks the talk,'' Bernstein told me. ''He has a great facility with a particular set of words, like 'baseline,' 'nondefense discretionary' and things like that.'' Bernstein said he eventually came to the view that while Ryan might understand basic concepts, ''he does not actually understand what it takes to craft a budget.'' This became clear when Ryan was chairman of the House Budget Committee after 2010. ''I would say at this point that his budgetary knowledge is a stalking horse for his ideology,'' Bernstein told me, meaning that what was important wasn't the actual balancing of the budget but the slashing of government spending and programs like Medicare and Social Security and the revenue-generating taxes that pay for them. By picking Ryan, Romney signaled that he too was all-in on Big Idea conservatism. And here was the guy, popular with the base and well liked in Congress, who was going to help him sell it to America.
While the notion that Washington operates like a high school has become a clich, it is an apt one: ''No one who ever passed through an American public high school could have watched William Jefferson Clinton running for office in 1992 and failed to recognize the familiar predatory sexuality of the provincial adolescent,'' Joan Didion wrote of the former president in ''Political Fictions.'' In a Rolling Stone profile of John McCain during the 2000 presidential campaign, David Foster Wallace described the then-maverick Republican as a ''varsity jock and a hell-raiser whose talents for partying and getting laid are still spoken of with awe by former classmates.'' When Ryan actually was in high school -- Joseph A. Craig High School, in Janesville -- he was the kind who joined a million clubs, befriended teachers and was recognized in his yearbook as his class's Biggest Brown-Noser. People in both parties described him to me as pleasant and thoughtful and one of the easier members of Congress to get along with. Others have found him arrogant, self-righteous and emblematic of the earnest striver types who populate so many Congressional and White House staffs (and think tanks, policy institutes and lobbying shops), no matter what party is in charge.
Like more or less every politician seeking to stay in the capital, Ryan is quick to express his anti-Washington sentiments. ''Not a D.C. guy,'' is how he described himself to me in Cincinnati after a soliloquy on Hu-Dey, a Bengals-inspired beer he consumed back in his college days. He sleeps on a cot in his office (its own clichd symbol of proof of a congressman's unrootedness), the better to work late, save rent and then return home on weekends to see his family in Janesville.
In fact, Ryan has spent half his life in Washington, arriving right out of college to work in a series of staff jobs before being elected to Congress in 1998, at 28. He met his wife, Janna -- who is the first cousin of Representative Dan Boren, a moderate Democrat from Oklahoma -- at a party near Washington, in the late '90s, when she was working as a lawyer and a lobbyist at PricewaterhouseCoopers. He worked closely with Rob Portman in Congress and again years later when Portman served as budget director in the George W. Bush administration; he met Dan Senor in the mid-'90s, when the two were Congressional staff members. A brief foray into the ''do you know'' game with Ryan quickly yields endless Capitol Hill associations. When the name of my New York Times colleague Carl Hulse, who was a longtime Congressional correspondent, came up, Ryan mentioned that he and Carl get their hair cut by the same stylist (Hanna) at a Capitol Hill salon called Bubbles.
Talking to Ryan, I was struck by the number of mentors he has collected at every rung of his career (and several more have taken to describing themselves as such). He attributes this tendency to having lost his father, a prominent lawyer, when he was 16. Ryan came to Washington at 21 and affixed himself to a procession of conservative luminaries, many of them his bosses. He worked for the Reagan-era education secretary William Bennett, with whom he has since taken several mountain-climbing trips to Colorado over the years, as well as the former congressman and supply-sider sage Jack Kemp, who died in 2009 and has been described as a father figure to Ryan. ''He instinctively knew how to get you into the action,'' says Sam Brownback, the governor of Kansas and former member of Congress for whom Ryan worked as legislative director in the mid-'90s. By that, Brownback said, he meant that Ryan combined policy acumen with political instincts that allowed him to see which issues would become hot and which bills had a chance of passing.
One of Ryan's most formative influences has been Tom Coburn, the Republican senator from Oklahoma with whom he overlapped for one term in the House in the late 1990s. Coburn was a viscerally anti-Washington conservative long before that sentiment coalesced into the Tea Party. Known as Dr. No, Coburn, a recently retired physician, has built his political career on displeasing the constituencies that politicians spend most of their time trying to please -- the activists, the donors, the party leadership and many of his colleagues. His contempt for them is genuine, bipartisan and in many cases mutual. He once prescribed a ''spinal transplant'' for 70 percent of the Senate and another time said his colleagues had ''reproductive organs the size of BBs.''
The central tenet of today's Congress is ''careerism,'' Coburn says, mocking the politician's most basic self-preservation impulse. ''Both parties today are ultimately controlled not by ideas but by the desire to be in control, a posture that creates little motivation for bold change,'' he wrote in his 2003 book ''Breach of Trust.'' Ryan told me that he read Coburn's book closely and more than once. It resonated for him throughout the Bush years -- a period in which, despite Republican majorities, he was often profoundly frustrated and unhappy over the continued growth of the government and his own complicity in it.
''I did a lot of defensive voting during that time,'' Ryan said, referring specifically to a 2003 bill that overhauled Medicare and gave seniors prescription-drug benefits at a cost first estimated at $400 billion over 10 years. (''Catholic guilt,'' Ryan joked, explaining his vote.) Gaining a permanent majority supplanted budget discipline as his party's governing imperative. ''Earmark your way, ribbon-cut your way, and you'll keep your job,'' Ryan said. In 2006, House Democrats reclaimed the majority in the midterm elections, putting what Bush called a ''thumpin' '' on the Republican Party. It was well deserved, Ryan said. He thought seriously about quitting Congress, maybe joining a policy group. He did a lot of bowhunting, spending long contemplative days in his tree stand. He talked a lot to Coburn. ''He taught me to do exactly what you believe and let the chips fall where they may,'' Ryan told me.
He introduced the first version of his signature budget plan, ''Roadmap for America's Future,'' in May 2008. Only eight Republicans in the House signed it, wary of the retribution that might come from voters if they were seen supporting an overhaul of Medicare and Social Security. ''People said, 'This is political suicide,' '' Ryan told me. ''I'm like: I don't care. First of all, I don't think that's right, but we'll find out.'' He considered running for Senate in 2010 but says the best possible outcome held no appeal: ''It's 6 years, then 12 years,'' Ryan said. ''And then, next thing you know it's 18 years, and you've spent your entire life in Congress.'' He says this with a tone of contempt and a full-faced smirk that is a bit striking given that it would describe the life choice of many of his colleagues.
''It set him free,'' Coburn told me, speaking of Ryan's vow to himself after 2006. ''If you decide that you're just going to . . . not play the political game, all of a sudden you can have fun.'' I asked Coburn where Ryan fell on the spectrum of Washington careerism. He has been here half his life, after all, and is way too much of a pleaser to ever be a Coburn-style irritant. He would fit many people's definition of a Washington careerist.
''Paul Ryan is a rare exception in my mind, because he still takes bold positions,'' Coburn said. ''My criticism of career politicians is that they always do what's expedient for their career. I don't think what he recommended on Medicare or Social Security was good for his career.''
Early this month, after visiting the Clinton, Iowa, home where his mother-in-law grew up and posing for photos with the current owners, Ryan headed out on an hourlong drive along the Mississippi River to the town of Muscatine. Michael Steel led me onto the cushy campaign bus, appointed with deep vinyl seats emblazoned with the Romney-Ryan insignia, a wood-paneled kitchen, a living room in back and all manner of laptops, television and other communications gadgets. Sitting across from me, Ryan said he thought his party would continue its rightward bend rather than moving back to the moderate middle. ''The Tea Party was a godsend,'' he said, because the movement forced new focus on fiscal issues. The election of 2010 brought a fresh wave of resolute conservatives to Congress, ''but you need another cycle to finish the job, to bring in more cause-oriented people instead of career-oriented people,'' Ryan said. ''That's what I've been trying to encourage.''
Ryan's stump appearances include a standard line in which he says that ''both parties got us into this mess.'' The line always receives big applause, and it seems designed to lend a veneer of bipartisanship to his deeply partisan policy arguments and a personal record that reflects no participation in major bipartisan legislation over 13 years in Congress. Ryan also says in his speeches that winning this election would endow him and Romney with the ''moral authority'' and the ''mandate'' to enact their agenda and move the country, implicitly, to the right. Yet since Romney's successful performance in his first debate, the campaign's message has tacked notably to the center, with more emphasis on Romney's bridge-building efforts with Democrats in Massachusetts (a state the former governor seemed terrified to even utter during the primaries). Romney even struck a softer tone on abortion, at least temporarily, when he told an Iowa newspaper that he saw ''no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda.'' The next day, Romney was compelled to reassert his anti-abortion legitimacy -- assuring reporters that he would ''remove funding for Planned Parenthood.''
In the vice-presidential debate, Ryan emphasized that he would support the position of the Romney administration on abortion, even though it differed from his own. ''I would call him a pragmatic conservative,'' Brownback says of Ryan. He recalls Ryan as a true conservative believer when he was on his staff -- particularly disdainful of government subsidies for ethanol, which are popular in farm states like Kansas. But later, when Ryan was elected to Congress, Brownback teased him about his own support for dairy subsidies in Wisconsin. ''I used to give him raspberries over that,'' Brownback says. ''I would say, 'O.K., Mr. Purity, it's not so easy now, is it?' ''
Ryan told me that he envisions a vice presidency in which he oversees a vast portfolio on fiscal and economic issues. He agreed fully with the suggestion -- first mentioned to me by one of his advisers -- that his assignment could be the fiscal version of the role Dick Cheney played on national security after Sept. 11. ''It's a role where you take your expertise and your value-add and you apply it,'' Ryan said during a conversation in which he used the phrase ''value-add'' three times in a 60-second stretch. ''My knowledge is how Congress works, how the budget works. Economic policy. That's my value-add.''
It's hard not to consider what would happen if Romney continues to campaign as a moderate, wins and then tries to govern as one. In the spin room following the Ryan-Biden debate, I asked Jeb Hensarling, a Republican congressman from Texas and former chairman of the House Conservative Caucus, if he had any concerns about Romney's recent tack to the center. Hensarling immediately pushed back. ''Any question any conservative ever had about Mitt Romney,'' he added, ''was erased when he asked Paul Ryan to be his vice-presidential candidate.'' Hensarling's enthusiasm for Romney was not surprising here -- this was a spin room, after all, not exactly a hothouse for the exchange of private doubts. But I was struck by the degree to which conservatives have taken to using the fact of Ryan's selection as an all-purpose, get-out-of-jail-free card for Romney, even as his campaign coordinators have begun speaking a somewhat different language.
Late on our drive to Muscatine, Michael Steel, the press secretary, asked me if I was sufficiently assured that Ryan was satisfied with his role on the campaign -- that his rapport with Romney was good and he was happy with how he was being used. (I did ask him, and big surprise, the answer was yes.)
''Just noise,'' Ryan told me of the second-guessing about his deployment. The critics ''don't see me on Dayton TV, Richmond TV, Dubuque TV,'' he said. ''It's literally, if I'm not on Fox News every 36 hours, people think I'm fading into the woodwork.''
As the Ryan bus approached Muscatine, the candidate described for me a personal e-mail that Romney sent him three weeks earlier. ''He said, 'I basically picked you because I thought you could help me govern,' '' Ryan said. '' 'I never knew you'd be decent at campaigning, and you turned out to be pretty good at that, too. So, thanks.' ''
I asked if he considered Romney a mentor, and he paused for a second. ''I see him as an older partner,'' he said. ''You have to understand, I was elected to Congress when I was 28, so I'm used to working with a lot of people who are much older. It's a relationship I'm very accustomed to.''
Few if any alliances are as fraught as those between presidents and vice presidents -- strategically, politically, psychologically. It's hard not to wonder how this one would evolve in the White House, what would happen if Ryan found himself wedged between the pragmatic governing demands of his ''older partner'' and the true-belief system of the movement -- and the chamber -- he came from.
If Romney loses, the recriminations play out in two predictable ways among Republicans. Some will say that the party must attract a broader base of support among independent and moderate and nonwhite voters, which would argue for the less severely conservative tone that Romney adopted right after his first debate. They might even point to the presence of Ryan on the ticket as, ultimately, a negative, that his selection did nothing to move national polls in favor of Romney and possibly even scared off potential voters.
But a far more vocal -- and probably bigger -- group on the right will maintain that the ticket was not conservative enough. They will insist that Republicans need to stop nominating the next establishment guy in line. They will say Mitt Romney ran a lousy general election campaign, except for his finest act, the elevation of Paul Ryan, who was a very good Boy Scout and who waited his turn.

HEADLINE: Reinhart, Rogoff, and Latvia

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A strange notion of triumph. 

 BODY:
OK, the recent Reinhart-Rogoff protest against "gross misinterpretations of the facts" on financial crises doesn't actually say anything about Latvia. But the points R-R make in taking on the US crisis denialists apply with equal force to the weird phenomenon of Baltic triumphalism.
As R-R say, rapid growth over a short period following a deep slump does not constitute a success story; by that measure, America was a tower of prosperity in the depths of the Great Depression. It's much more informative to focus on levels, both of output and of unemployment, and compare them with the pre-crisis peak.
So, people keep telling me that Latvia is an economic miracle that refutes Keynesianism and Krugmanism. How's it doing on the level thing? (All data from Eurostat).
Here's real GDP:
And here's the unemployment rate:
So in what reality is an economy whose real GDP is still 15 percent below the pre-crisis peak, and whose unemployment rate is still 9 points above the pre-crisis trough, a stunning success story that refutes the pessimists? I mean, better to be growing fairly fast than not, but surely this isn't cause to break out the champagne.

HEADLINE: Stumbling Upon a Little Diner in Elyria

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: The New York Times staff photographer Nicole Bengiveno, who produced video and photography for The Times's multimedia presentation of "This Land, Elyria, Ohio," discusses the project and her approach. 

 BODY:
 Last week, The Times published a special presentation of Dan Barry's "This Land" column, centered around the town of Elyria, Ohio. The five-part multimedia series, with stories, photos, audio and video, ended Thursday. The Times staff photographer Nicole Bengiveno, who works with Mr. Barry on "This Land" columns, shot stills and video for this project, which was six months in the making. She spoke with James Estrin this week about her approach. Their conversation has been edited and condensed. 
 Q. 
How did this project start?
 A. 
This project started in a very funny way. I was on my way to an assignment in Elyria, Ohio, late one afternoon, and I passed this diner and I went, "Oh my gosh, I'm hungry, I'm going to remember where that is." I went to do the assignment, came back, found a parking spot. The diner was open. I walked in. Donna was just leaving to go to the bank, but Kristy was there, her daughter, mopping the floor. They were just about to close. And they said, "Go ahead, sit down." So I grabbed a booth, ordered a green pepper omelet, and they looked at me kind of funny, but they made it for me.
While I was sitting there, a couple named the Bullocks came in, and they sat at the next booth. So, I'm sitting there, unwinding from a long day of shooting, and I was watching Kristy leaning on her mop, talking to the Bullocks and just chatting about their kids.
I leave, and I go to the front desk and I say, "I love diners," and I grabbed a business card.
 Q. 
Once you went for it, how did you conceive of its structure?
 A. 
Honestly, it started with this idea of telling a series of short stories. Dan's inspiration was Sherwood Anderson, the writer, who actually lived in Elyria for a while. He wrote a book called "Winesburg, Ohio." That was Dan's inspiration, but my inspiration was this whole idea that we are all connected, including how we pass each other on the sidewalk. Or a scent that rises from the diner, that goes upstairs to the building. There's a connection there. Around the diner you have this park, you have these people, you have these concerts, you have the trains that pass through, so my idea was to capture these journeys that would touch on how we're all connected.
The idea was that it would be a wonderful story to sort of tell short stories and have an opportunity for a lot of photography, and I was hoping some videography as well, and audio. They assigned Kassie Bracken, who shot some of the video and who edited the multimedia with Meaghan Looram.
Our base was Donna's Diner, this diner, and the businesswoman who's trying to keep this diner open. What was interesting is that they were very open to let us come and spend time and hang out.
 Q. 
How much time did you spend there?
 A. 
Dan and I would go together quite often, so I would go twice a month for probably four or five days a week. I spent a good ten days a month there producing.
 Q. 
Tell me about Elyria.
 A. 
Donna and some of the people would say, "Why Elyria? Why are you here? We can't figure it out. What are you looking at?" And I would say, "We really were hoping to try and tell some stories about America. And we were really hoping to be able to focus in on one place where many people would be able to identify."
The thing about Elyria that I loved is that it has a town square, and no matter what direction you look there's somebody looking back into the square that you could see. In that town square, every possible patriotic holiday - Elyria pride day, Memorial Day, Flag Day - they had a celebration. The flags would come out, the veterans would come out, they'd have their parade. I just loved seeing all this because I don't get to see it that often, living in a big city.
 Q. 
It's a different way of life.
 A. 
It's a different way of life, but one of the ideas we had was, to hear what politicians were talking about in the background, and then watching real everyday life. So I mean, all the issues that we're hearing now, what do they look like? Elyria, in a way, provided that.
 Q. 
What type of issues?
 A. 
Unemployment, or people who are in the community who get out and try to make a difference. It was a city that was, at one point, thriving. A lot of big, big companies went away. They're trying to reinvent themselves - there's this sort of place where people can't quite figure out what to do, but they're trying.
 Q. 
You've done stories before that have included multimedia, but this one, early on, was conceived with the multimedia as being integral. How did that affect the way you thought of the structure and your approach?
 A. 
I have to say, I felt like a one-man band. I'm so used to being like a cat, you know, where you can just wander around. I like people to just go about their business, and I love being quiet and getting in and sort of capturing moments in between moments. But I found that many times I'd have one camera still, one camera video with a microphone, and I figured out a way to carry a tripod on my shoulder by coming up with this little strap situation. Nonetheless, it was cumbersome.
I'd get in a situation to shoot and would have to figure out what to do. I did get pulled into video. This is really my first video assignment. I had one small thing before this. So this was an opportunity to play, and I dove in headfirst.
I really did think in terms of how something would come to life and the sound along with the images. And I made a point to stop and shoot stills in moments that I felt were really beautiful for a still situation. But it's tricky. It's very tricky.
 Q. 
Have you heard from any of the subjects yet? Have you talked to Donna?
 A. 
I talked to Donna, and Donna has said that her whole diner was packed Monday morning and that she has so many people calling. The mayor called to say that someone had called and wanted to make a big donation. She was shocked.
It really touches people. They can't believe it. I think they're in shock. You see your diner on the front page of this paper that's going around the country. Donna said she went online with the help of her husband of see what people were saying, and she couldn't get over it - people were writing in from India.
 Q. 
No matter how you try, you can't really prepare someone.
 A. 
It makes me feel happy because she opened herself, opened her life up to us. And that always scary, and it's scary for me too.
 Q. 
Why is it scary to you?
 A. 
When it comes down to having somebody trusting me, I really respect that. And at the same time I'm needing to do a very honest job and capture moments. And many times those moments are moments of vulnerability, and I can't take it back once it's published.
 "This Land: Donna's Diner," was reported and written by Dan Barry, with reporting from Nicole Bengiveno. Ms. Bengiveno and Kassie Bracken shot the video, and the music was by Thomas Gamble. The feature was produced by Dan Barry, Nicole Bengiveno, Kassie Bracken, Leslye Davis, Meaghan Looram, Jacky Myint, John Niedermeyer, Graham Roberts and David Scull.

HEADLINE: An Elite Obsession

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Only the VSPs care about the deficit. 

 BODY:
David Dayen makes a very good point, which I missed: during the Hofstra debate, in which questions were posed by members of the public rather than the Beltway elite, there wasn't a single question about the deficit. Not one. The public really doesn't care.
And you know what? Neither do financial markets, which continue to lend to the U.S. government at incredibly low rates.
Meanwhile, the results from austerity are in -- and it's now clear that the adverse economic impacts of austerity in a depressed economy are much worse than the elite imagined (although Keynesian economists knew better), and are in fact so severe that austerity is largely self-defeating, having little impact on the budget deficit even in the short run because reduced revenue takes away much of the initial savings. Once you take long-run effects into account, austerity is almost surely self-defeating.
Yet deficit fever, with demands for spending cuts right away, has dominated policy discussion for almost three years, with all the Very Serious People believing that by pounding on this issue they were demonstrating their Very Seriousness.

HEADLINE: Report on Iran Talks Reverberates on Sunday Shows

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: Spokesmen for the candidates jousted over whether the United States should seek to engage Iran in one-on-one talks over its nuclear program, or whether Tehran was playing for time. 

 BODY:
Foreshadowing what could be fierce lines of argument in Monday's final presidential debate, spokesmen for the two candidates jousted on Sunday over whether the United States should seek to engage Iran in one-on-one talks over its nuclear program, or whether Tehran was simply playing for time.
The prospect of such talks was raised in a New York Times article posted on Saturday, and those who commented on Sunday morning television programs said that they had no specific details, or any confirmation, that such talks might be in the offing.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry on Sunday dismissed the Times report. On Saturday, the White House also denied that a final agreement on direct talks had been reached, while saying that it remained open to such contacts.
But surrogates of Mitt Romney said Iranian motives should be seriously questioned. Supporters of President Obama, in the meantime, said that the tough international sanctions that the president helped marshal against Iran may be bearing fruit exactly as hoped -- that Tehran was finally blinking. 
"I hope we don't take the bait," said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a Romney backer. "I think this is a ploy by the Iranians" to buy time for their nuclear program and divide the international coalition, he said on "Fox News Sunday."
But an Obama supporter, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, insisted that the international sanctions were clearly succeeding.
"This month of October, the currency in Iran has declined 40 percent in value," said Mr. Durbin, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, on Fox. "There is unrest in the streets of Tehran, and the leaders in Iran are feeling it. That's exactly what we wanted the sanctions program to do."
Precisely how the issue might play out in the final debate is unclear. While Mr. Romney has sharply criticized Mr. Obama's handling of Iran - starting with his failure to side more vocally with the antigovernment protests there a few years ago - his specific plans to halt Iranian nuclear efforts do not appear to go much beyond what Mr. Obama has done.
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a Republican, who has helped Mr. Romney prepare for his debates, suggested that the report on Iran might be "another example of a national security leak from the White House," though he offered no evidence. He did say on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the governor would use the debate to "lay out a clear vision for how to get Iran to do the right thing."
More specifically, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, representing the Romney campaign on three television shows, seemed to suggest that Mr. Romney might at least be open to talks of some sort.
 "I think Governor Romney has said repeatedly that armed conflict should be the absolute last measure that one takes," he said on ABC's "This Week." 
David Axelrod, senior adviser to the president, said he had no knowledge about possible United States-Iranian talks.
"But here is what I do know," he said on "Meet the Press." "For two years, the president traveled the world putting together a withering international coalition, and now, the sanctions that they agreed on are bringing the Iranian economy to its knees."
The Times, quoting unnamed senior Obama administration officials, reported that after intense, secret exchanges, an agreement has been reached for one-on-one talks between the United States and Iran, which have not had direct diplomatic relations since 1980.
In Iran, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on Sunday denied that any direct talks were in the making. "We do not have anything such as talks with the United States," he told the semiofficial Fars News Agency.
Mr. Salehi predicted that there would be a new round of talks with world powers over Iran's nuclear program in November. "There is no fixed date yet," he said.
On Saturday, the White House also denied that such an agreement had been reached. "It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections," said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman. But he noted that the administration has "said from the outset that we would be prepared to meet bilaterally."
 Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.

HEADLINE: Sleight of the 'Invisible Hand'

BYLINE: JOHN PAUL ROLLERT


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans have been making political use of the phrase made famous in "The Wealth of Nations." But what would Adam Smith think? 

 BODY:
Much has been made of Paul Ryan's devotion to, and timely disavowal of, Ayn Rand and her work, but little has been said about the Scottish philosopher he and Mitt Romney have cited as the ideological embodiment of what's at stake in this election. "I think Adam Smith was right," Romney affirmed in a January debate. "And I'm going to stand and defend capitalism across this country, throughout the campaign."
Capitalism is a word that Smith never used - the author of "The Wealth of Nations" had been dead for almost 50 years before it entered the language, via Karl Marx - but his most famous expression, "the invisible hand," is often taken as its proxy. Romney juxtaposes it with what he calls the "supposed informed hand of government." As he said in a speech on economics at the University of Chicago in March, "When the heavy hand of government replaces the invisible hand of the market, economic freedom is the inevitable victim."
Heady words, but hardly unusual. Few phrases in Western philosophy have embedded themselves as deeply in the vernacular as Smith's invisible hand, and no single image has ever so captivated (and occasionally inflamed) the popular mind. This has been the case for a while now - the intellectual historian Emma Rothschild called the 20th century "the epoch of the invisible hand"- but the financial crisis and the federal government's response have recently made it a cause for celebration and debate. 
This development would most likely have surprised Adam Smith. The invisible hand makes only three appearances in his work, all fleeting. Blink, and you will miss them.
The most cited usage is in "The Wealth of Nations," the foundational text of modern economics, first published in 1776. The invisible hand appears once, several hundred pages into the work during a discussion of trade policy. Mercantilism, then the prevailing school of economic thought, held that the way to secure a nation's wealth was by implementing rigid protectionist polices. Smith agreed that such polices could strengthen certain sectors of an economy, but he contended that this came at the expense of "the general industry." If restrictions were lifted, every merchant would pursue the most profitable trade available to him, making the most efficient use of his own time and money. Granted, he would act with an eye only toward his personal "security" and "gain," but in so doing, he would "render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can." He would be "led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was not part of his intention," namely, to benefit society and the broader welfare of its citizens.
"[T]he system works behind the backs of the participants" is how the Nobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow described this phenomenon. Smith wouldn't have objected, though what clearly intrigued him was less the enlightened mechanism than the moral paradox. The invisible hand not only works behind the backs of participants, it succeeds despite them.
Consider Smith's use of the phrase in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," the first of his two great works. He describes the landlord who, admiring his fields, consumes in his imagination "the whole harvest that grows upon them." Fortunately for the poor, the size of a wealthy man's stomach, if not necessarily his storehouse, is roughly equal to theirs. The rich "only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable." The rest they "divide with the poor" such that they "are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions."
Again, the system yields an outcome that is salutary and humane, but one that stands at odds with the selfish interests of participants. The wealthy, says Smith, spend their days establishing an "economy of greatness," one founded on "luxury and caprice" and fueled by "the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires." Any broader benefit that accrues from their striving is not the consequence of foresight or benevolence, but "in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity." They don't do good, they are led to it.
The moral paradox of the invisible hand often seems lost on those who speak loudest in its favor. Take the stubborn rhetoric of the "jobs creators." Insofar as it portrays a conspicuous group of people who act with conscious moral purpose, it bears no resemblance to the phenomenon Smith describes. We might as well call this vision of development the "visible hand" of capitalism, for it has the original theory backward. The merchants of Smith's world busy themselves seeking profit, while the idle rich build monuments to their own self-importance. We can debate the worthiness of either pursuit, but neither activity has the common good as its aim nor, for Smith, does it merit moral acclamation. Wisdom and virtue, he says, are the qualities of the person who is "at all times willing that his own private interest should be sacrificed to the public interest." Putting our own interests before and above others is nothing special. It is merely being human.
If enthusiasts of the invisible hand often overlook the moral paradox, they don't fail to appreciate the enlightened mechanism. Individuals, left to their own devices, will engage in commercial activities that ultimately establish a more affluent society than one organized by well-intentioned statesmen. "That's the American Dream," Ryan said, embracing this vision in his convention address, "That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners."
For his part, Smith described this state of affairs as "the obvious and simple system of natural liberty," and he knew that it made for the revolutionary implication of his work. It shifted the way we thought about the relationship between government action and economic growth, making less means more the rebuttable presumption of policy proposals.
What it did not do, however, was void any proposal outright, much less prove that all government activity was counterproductive. Smith held that the sovereign had a role supporting education, building infrastructure and public institutions, and providing security from foreign and domestic threats - initiatives that should be paid for, in part, by a progressive tax code and duties on luxury goods. He even believed the government had a "duty" to protect citizens from "oppression," the inevitable tendency of the strong to take advantage of the ignorance and necessity of the weak.
In other words, the invisible hand did not solve the problem of politics by making politics altogether unnecessary. "We don't think government can solve all our problems," President Obama said in his convention address, "But we don't think that government is the source of all our problems." Smith would have appreciated this formulation. For him, whether government should get out of the way in any given matter, economic or otherwise, was a question for considered judgment abetted by scientific inquiry. He offered "The Wealth of Nations" in service of such an inquiry, a two-volume tome he painstakingly revised for years after it was published. Had he known that a single phrase plucked from the dense thicket of ideas would become the first and last word of his philosophy, I suspect he would have made one more revision.
And yet, Smith should have known better than to use an image, even once, that would elevate an operating assumption of his science to an article of blind faith. Before either "The Wealth of Nations" or "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," Smith used his most famous phrase in "The History of Astronomy," an essay (published posthumously) in which he observed that, in ancient times, the invisible hand of Jupiter was held responsible for "irregular events" of the heavens - comets, eclipses, meteor showers and the like. As civilization took hold, however, humans expected from the divine a cosmic reflection of their accomplishments: order, coherency, routine. They sought out theories that explained "the whole course of the universe consistent and of a piece," and to the degree that they fought to preserve the grandest of them all, the system of Ptolemy, Smith said it demonstrated "how easily the learned give up the evidence of their senses to preserve the coherence of ideas in their imagination."
The invisible hand is similarly beguiling. It claims a propitious pattern for which no one is responsible, even while everyone participates. As such, it absolves us from the conscious burden of building a common world, that work which is otherwise, at least in part, committed to politics.
That sounds nice in theory, but politics is a practical venture, and Smith distrusted those statesmen who confused their work with an exercise in speculative philosophy. Their proposals should be judged not by the delusive lights of the imagination, but by the metrics of science and experience, what President Obama described in the first presidential debate as "math, common sense and our history."
The president, himself an enthusiast of Smith, was speaking of Governor Romney's signature policy proposal, a huge tax cut that promises to spur job growth and balance the budget, while protecting the interests of the weakest and most vulnerable. The proposal, he said, fails these metrics. We cannot know what Adam Smith would make of this conclusion, but we can be sure that he would tell his admirers, all of them, that this test, and not the conformity to an abstract idea, is one on which the election should turn.
 John Paul Rollert teaches business ethics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and leadership at the Harvard Extension School. He is the author of a recent paper on President Obama's "Empathy Standard" for the Yale Law Journal Online.

HEADLINE: 'Gender Gap' Near Historic Highs

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The biggest gender gap to date in the exit polls came in 2000, when Al Gore won by 11 points among women, but George W. Bush won by 9 points among men - a 20-point difference. The numbers this year look very close to that. 

 BODY:
If only women voted, President Obama would be on track for a landslide re-election, equaling or exceeding his margin of victory over John McCain in 2008. Mr. Obama would be an overwhelming favorite in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and most every other place that is conventionally considered a swing state. The only question would be whether he could forge ahead into traditionally red states, like Georgia, Montana and Arizona.
If only men voted, Mr. Obama would be biding his time until a crushing defeat at the hands of Mitt Romney, who might win by a similar margin to the one Ronald Reagan realized over Jimmy Carter in 1980. Only California, Illinois, Hawaii and a few states in the Northeast could be considered safely Democratic. Every other state would lean red, or would at least be a toss-up.
Although polls disagree on the exact magnitude of the gender gap (and a couple of recent ones seemed to show Mitt Romney eliminating the president's advantage with women voters), the consensus of surveys points to a large one this year - rivaling the biggest from past elections.
The gender gap is nothing new in American politics. Since 1972, when exit polling became widespread, men and women split their votes in three elections: 1996, 2000, and 2004. They came close to doing so on several other occasions. In 2008, for example, Mr. Obama won resoundingly among women, beating Mr. McCain by 13 points, but only won by a single point among men.
The biggest gender gap to date in the exit polls came in 2000, when Al Gore won by 11 points among women, but George W. Bush won by 9 points among men - a 20-point difference. The numbers this year look very close to that. 
Since the first presidential debate in Denver, there have been 10 high-quality national polls that reported a breakout of results between men and women. (I define a "high-quality" poll as one that used live telephone interviews, and which called both landlines and cellphones. These polls will collect the most representative samples and should provide for the most reliable benchmarks of demographic trends.)
The results in the polls were varied, with the gender gap ranging from 33 points (in a Zogby telephone poll for the Washington Times) to just 8 (in polls by Pew Research and by The Washington Post). On average, however, there was an 18-point gender gap, with Mr. Obama leading by an average of 9 points among women but trailing by 9 points among men.
If that difference carries forward to the exit polls, it would reflect among the largest gender splits ever, rivaling the 20-point difference from 2000, and a 17-point difference in both 1980 and 1996.
The gender gap has been growing over time. It was nearly absent, for instance, in 1972 and 1976, the first two years that the exit polls tested it. 
But after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, reproductive rights became a greater focus in presidential elections -- particularly under Ronald Reagan in 1980, who was more willing to campaign on the issue of abortion than most of his predecessors. The gender gap jumped to 17 points that year, with men much more likely to vote for Mr. Reagan.
The gender gap has sometimes been widest when there is a Democratic president running for re-election, as in 1980 or 1996 (or a Democratic vice president looking to ascend to the presidency, as in 2000). Women, apart from their tendency to vote Democratic, also seem slightly more inclined than men to give the incumbent party another chance. When the incumbent is a Republican, as in 1976 or 1992, this can mitigate the gender gap. When the incumbent is a Democrat instead, as for Mr. Obama this year, both trends operate in the same direction, making it wider.
One area where gender politics is less important is in planning Electoral College strategy, since roughly equal numbers of men and women vote in each state. Nevertheless, the Electoral College can serve as a way to demonstrate to scope of the difference in how men and women vote.
If the current FiveThirtyEight forecast were re-calibrated to show an overall 10-point lead for Mr. Obama -- his lead among women in polls since the Denver debate -- he would be a clear favorite in states totaling 347 electoral votes. Mr. Romney would be favored in states containing just 140 electoral votes. Another 51 electoral votes would be too close to call.
About the opposite would happen if Mr. Romney led nationally by 9 points -- his current advantage among men. He would be all but certain to win states with a total of 321 electoral votes, and would be highly competitive in traditionally blue-leaning states like New Jersey, Oregon, and Washington.
The large gender gap comes despite the fact that men and women's economic roles are becoming more equal -- according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women represented 47 percent of the labor force as of September -- and that women suffered at least as much as men in the recent economic downturn. 
The unemployment rate among women was 7.5 percent as of September -- up from 7.0 percent when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009.
The unemployment rate among men is higher -- 8.0 percent as of September -- but it has declined rather than increased since Mr. Obama took office. It had been 8.6 percent in January 2009, and peaked at as high as 11.2 percent later that year.
This suggests the gender gap instead has more to do with partisan ideology than with pocketbook voting; apart from their views on abortion, women also take more liberal stances than men on social issues ranging from same-sex marriage to gun control. 
Presidential candidates have faced increasing pressure to align with the bases of their parties on social issues. Mr. Obama reversed his previous position to support same-sex marriage this year. Mr. Romney has long since abandoned a number of moderate stances he took on social issues as governor of Massachusetts, when he said he supported abortion rights. So long as the ideological gap between the parties grows, the gender gap may grow as well.

HEADLINE: Sharpening the Message for the Final Push

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In the closing days of the 2012 presidential campaign, President Obama and Mitt Romney are finding sharper, punchier ways to communicate their basic arguments. 

 BODY:
 In the closing days of the 2012 presidential campaign, President Obama and Mitt Romney are finding sharper, punchier ways to communicate their basic arguments.
Bumper-sticker politics has been around forever. But it often takes presidential candidates a while to hone their closing arguments.
Listening to both men recently in the debates and on the stump has made it clear that their advisers have worked hard to distill the campaign themes and attacks into a single word or phrase. The idea? Make sure everyone can understand what the simple message is.
Here is a sample from each side:
The Democrats
 "Romnesia" - At a rally on Friday morning in Fairfax, Va., Mr. Obama found a way to encapsulate his campaign's attack on Mr. Romney's attempts to moderate some of his more conservative positions. He accused Mr. Romney of forgetting his previous positions because he has a case of "Romnesia."
The president was not the first to come up with the word - it has been bouncing around on Twitter for weeks. But it was a big hit with the crowd at George Mason University, and it will most likely find its way into many of the president's rallies.
 "Malarkey" - Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used the word several times during his debate with Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate. He has continued to use it to attack the Republican ticket's veracity.
Campaigns can sometimes simply accuse their rivals of lying. But that can appear harsh to voters, especially in the waning days of a race, when people can tire of the negativity. A word like "malarkey" can seem like a more lighthearted way to say the same thing.
 "Sketchy Deal" - In his first debate with Mr. Romney, the president stumbled about for a concise way to question the Republicans' economic and tax plans. What came out was a long and rambling critique that for some was hard to follow and seemed defensive.
In the second debate, Mr. Obama found his phrase. By calling Mr. Romney's tax and budget plans a "sketchy deal," Mr. Obama condensed his argument into two words. Expect the president to continue repeating the term as he crosses the country.
 "Binders Full of Women" - During the second presidential debate, Mr. Romney's description of being handed "binders full of women" who were potential appointees when he was the governor of Massachusetts became an Internet sensation. But the president's team has used it in a serious way, as an easy catchphrase to signify his belief that Mr. Romney's policies would be bad for women.
The phrase gets huge applause at rallies and will no doubt remain in the Democrats' stump speeches in places where they think they can make gains among women.
The Republicans
 "Running on Fumes" - For the last week, Mr. Romney's campaign has been accusing the president of not having much of a second-term agenda. The idea is to highlight what Mr. Romney's organization believes is a backward-looking, defensive campaign by the president.
"Running on fumes" captures that sentiment and will most likely be repeated on the trail during the rallies ahead. The Republican campaign hopes people will be able to identify easily with the imagery of a White House that is out of ideas.
 "Last Four Years" - Several weeks ago, when Mr. Romney's campaign was down in the polls and struggling, his top advisers came up with a new formulation of Ronald Reagan's "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The adaptation: "We can't afford another four years like the last four years."
Mr. Romney seems to like it. He used it during the first two debates, and he and Mr. Ryan regularly repeat it on the stump. It appears often in Republican advertisements and literature. That is not likely to change, as Mr. Romney's camp tries to persuade voters to make a change.
 "Hope Is Not a Strategy" - When it comes to foreign policy, Mr. Romney has accused the president of failing to achieve the grand vision he laid out in 2008. Speaking several weeks ago in Lexington, Va., Mr. Romney praised Mr. Obama's "hopes" for the Middle East, but said that "hope is not a strategy."
The Republican campaign believes that wording nicely captures what it says is a feckless, ineffective foreign policy that has not achieved its goals. For a public that is more focused on domestic issues and less knowledgeable about national security, the phrase could help make Mr. Romney seem an acceptable commander in chief.
 "The Shrinking Campaign" - Mr. Romney and his allies have recently begun talking abut the "smallness" of the president's campaign. They say Mr. Obama's ads about Big Bird and catchy terms like "Romnesia" testify to a lack of big ideas.
On the stump, Mr. Romney has said his rival is reduced to "petty attacks and silly word games." But the "shrinking campaign" is likely to be the way he talks about it in the last two weeks of the race.

HEADLINE: Publisher Sees a Poetry In Print

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; Twitter: @carr2n

 BODY:
Gambling is not about luck, it's about timing; knowing when the moment comes to grab your winnings and push away from the table.
Felix Dennis, the British magazine publisher, took America by storm in the 1990s with Maxim, a bawdy men's magazine with models whose garments always seemed on the precipice of falling off. The formula was so successful, he also started Stuff, a little brother brand, and Blender, a music magazine.
In 2007, Mr. Dennis sold the magazines to Alpha Media, backed by Quadrangle Capital Partners II, a private equity firm, for $250 million. The bottom dropped out of the category, Stuff was folded into Maxim, Blender ceased publication, Maxim hemorrhaged ads and employees and its owners defaulted on their loans.
Mr. Dennis, who built and sold computer magazines in America when the category was hot, had done it again. After selling Maxim, he repaired to England with a big bag of loot, though he did hang on to The Week, a low-cost print aggregation of news done by others, which has outlasted the print version of Newsweek. In 2011, he also bought Mental Floss, a smarty pants magazine and Web site aimed at a young, connected demographic. 
Mr. Dennis, who has invested aggressively in digital operations in Britain and elsewhere, is intent on proving there is still life left in print. With a keen understanding of readers and a deft touch for timing, he's proud that he's still able ''to be a nuisance to the rest of the business.''
''I have sold at the top of market several times,'' he cackled. ''Nobody remembers how long I've been at this. I love the media game. Love. It.''
He also happens to be a best-selling poet in his native England. In a documentary, ''Felix Dennis: Millionaire Poet,'' that is out right now, Tom Wolfe is seen reading three of his poems. A ruffler of feathers and professed ''bearded dwarf,'' Mr. Dennis knows his way around a quip and tends to dole them out at a very high frequency.
He was once invited to give the annual Delacorte Lecture to the students at Columbia Journalism School and advised them to ignore advertisers -- they are merely ''guests'' -- and focus on readers. ''They are my bread, my butter, my caviar and my Gulfstream jet. Actually, I always rent the private jets. My rule is, if it flies, floats or fornicates, rent it. It's cheaper in the long run.''
But he is oddly chaste about the death of the print version of Newsweek, a magazine which he had constantly slagged as a bloated, beside-the-point publication.
''I have always been a fan of Tina,'' he said, referring to Tina Brown, the editor, ''and thought she brought a sense of fun to magazines, but there was no way that was ever going to work out. It had huge costs at a time the economics would not support it.''
He added: ''You'll get no triumphalism from me. I was a subscriber, believe it or not, and it's never good when a magazine goes away.''
Even though he believes that American magazines are overedited and overstaffed -- ''No one else in the world takes so many people to make magazines'' -- Mr. Dennis says that there is nonetheless a lot of life left in printed products here. ''No woman or girl is going to want to spend time looking at pretty dresses on the Internet,'' he said. ''Vogue is going to be around for a long time to come.''
Mr. Dennis, 65, got his start selling magazines on Kings Road in London and worked his way over to the editorial side at Oz magazine, where he quickly ran afoul of British obscenity laws and was charged with ''conspiracy to corrupt public morals.'' The verdict against him and his co-defendants -- they were convicted of two lesser charges -- was eventually overturned.
He then got in early on the computer craze with a raft of hobby magazines, although to this day he does not use e-mail and carries no cellphone.
He owned up to frittering away $100 million on drugs and ill-chosen companions in his 2006 best seller ''How to Get Rich,'' but these days the enfant terrible seems, well, a little less terrible. His biggest current addiction is writing poetry and his latest project is a room-size rock weighing 30 tons inscribed with one of his poems, the ostentatiously titled ''Mirabile Dictu.'' (Latin for ''wonderful to relate.'')
When finished, the rock will be dropped by heavy-lift helicopter into the forest he planted near Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire. I said it sounded extravagant.
''It should cost a lot of money! I am not a poor man!'' he said in his office in Midtown Manhattan, and then erupted with a huge Falstaffian laugh that is one of his many trademarks.
The trademark seemed to be at risk in January -- ''on Friday the 13th,'' he drolly points out -- when he was found to have throat cancer while visiting his estate on the Caribbean island of Mustique. He rushed back to London and had surgery and radiation, which shaved 40 pounds off him.
The treatment went well, so that means his ashes won't be going under that rock anytime soon (only Mr. Dennis would have a headstone the size of a room). The Week, a big hit in both print and on the Web in Britain, has been a growing performer here, increasing its circulation to 525,000 from 100,000 when Mr. Dennis first brought it to the United States in 2001.
Mental Floss is still tiny -- it will have a circulation of 150,000 when it is audited at the end of the year, according to Dennis Publishing executives -- but is playing larger on the Web and mobile, with almost four million unique users a month. It also sells about $1.5 million in merchandise a year to its cultlike audience.
Never shy, Mr. Dennis chided me for having written bearishly about the magazine business. ''You are far too parochial,'' he said. ''America is not the center of the universe. Hearst just bought all of the international editions of Elle. The owners of Maxim just got a $6 million check from Russia. Those are still very good businesses and they are making me very, very rich.
''It's true that a stake has been driven through the heart of a lot of publishing and we will have to be digital wizards to survive, but if we are doing it right, we know our customers. If I have any trick, it's knowing what the customer wants five minutes before he does. No amount of market research can do that.''
I noticed his trademark beard was gone.
''Radiation,'' he said, his hand circling where the beard once was. ''Alas, the 'bearded dwarf' is no more.'' A huge honking laugh filled the room and I suggested it was unbecoming to laugh at one's own jokes.
''I never said I was becoming,'' he said. And then again came the laugh.

HEADLINE: Buoyed by Experience, Fehr Holds Tight to His Composure and His Principles

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
Last week was a dismal one for Donald Fehr and the N.H.L. Players' Association, and not just because the owners flatly rejected the union's offer to settle the N.H.L. lockout. For the first time since negotiations began last summer, public opinion seemed to have shifted: many fans, who had been blaming Commissioner Gary Bettman and the owners for the impasse, started to blame Fehr and the players.
Yet none of that is likely to sway Fehr, perhaps North America's most effective union leader over the past three decades. He has drawn fans' wrath before, but his accomplishments are enormous. As head of the Major League Baseball Players Association from 1983 to 2009, Fehr thwarted efforts to impose a salary cap and kept players' salaries high. In three years with the N.H.L. Players' Association, he repaired a hopelessly fractured union and readied it for confrontation with the owners.
''Players understand that this is something in which they all have to hang together,'' Fehr said. ''You can paraphrase Benjamin Franklin: if we don't hang together, we're going to hang separately.'' 
Fehr is something of an anachronism: an ardent trade unionist in an era when the power of unions outside of sports is shrinking.
''Don Fehr is an enormously bright and committed lawyer, and a liberal person of the left,'' said Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner from 1989 to 1992. ''He is very committed to using collective bargaining to improve the conditions and economic well-being of his constituents.''
Fehr's politics stand in sharp contrast to those of the N.H.L.'s United States-based owners, who as a group have donated more heavily to Republican candidates and causes than their N.F.L. and N.B.A. counterparts.
Despite a public reputation for combativeness, Fehr also draws praise from former adversaries for honesty, integrity and a calm, businesslike demeanor.
''Donald Fehr was a perfectly honorable person -- I don't think he ever lied to me,'' said Richard Ravitch, who negotiated for the baseball owners in the two years that preceded the 1994-95 strike. ''He never lost his temper; in fact, I thought he was a cold fish. But he was very honorable and very straightforward. A man of few words, even if his favorite word was no.''
Vincent called Fehr ''absolutely straight and totally honest.'' He added, ''I don't think his worst enemies have ever found him lying to them or misleading them.''
In Canada, fans angry with the union for not accepting the owners' demand for a 12 percent pay cut last week called radio stations to speculate that Fehr was dictating a militant stance to the players. But no players have suggested that is happening.
''One of Don's core principles is the need to appropriately and accurately reflect the consensus of the players, and that leadership comes from the ranks, not from the top down,'' said Gene Orza, Fehr's longtime general counsel with the baseball players union, who still confers regularly with Fehr. ''Your position-taking has to be supported by a large, large portion of the players.''
Orza said he was not surprised by fans' accusations. ''There are two things they've been saying for years in baseball,'' he said. ''There's never enough left-handed pitching, and the union is always leading the players around by the nose.''
N.H.L. fans seemed to dread Fehr's arrival on the hockey scene in 2009, when he was asked to repair a players union torn by internal squabbling after accepting a 24 percent pay cut and a salary cap in the 2004-5 lockout. The union had gone through four leaders in four years. Like many baseball fans, hockey fans saw Fehr as responsible for the strike that canceled the 1994 World Series.
But what is often forgotten is that the strike ended by court order, when Judge Sonia Sotomayor ruled that the owners had engaged in unfair labor practices. The old contract was reinstated and, legally at least, Fehr and the union were vindicated.
That followed other legal victories by Fehr over the owners, who were found to have illegally colluded by refraining from bidding against one another for free agents.
Fehr took over as the director of the baseball union in 1983, soon after Marvin Miller stepped down. ''You've got to remember, the first thing that I was met with within a year or so was collusion,'' Fehr said. ''It was followed by a lockout, followed by an attempt to impose a salary cap, followed by court decisions that the owners were breaking the law right and left and Sunday. And they were portraying me as somebody who didn't want to let them do that.
''And I didn't,'' Fehr continued. ''I thought collusion was bad. I thought the '90 lockout was bad. I thought the attempt to impose the salary cap in '94 was bad. I thought the way they bargained was bad.''
While baseball has had labor peace since 1996, Fehr has often spoken of a new ''playbook'' for other sports leagues, in which they impose salary caps and lock out players to force them to accept pay cuts. The N.F.L. and N.B.A. lockouts of 2011 reduced players' shares of revenue in those sports to about 50 percent, and Bettman has frequently cited that as a main rationale for the current N.H.L. lockout.
Fehr said ''the same people'' are behind these tactics ''regardless of the sport'' -- a reference to the Proskauer Rose law firm, which represents the N.H.L., the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and Major League Baseball in labor negotiations. Bettman worked there as a lawyer in the 1970s.
Bob Batterman, a top Proskauer Rose lawyer who works closely with the N.H.L. and the N.F.L., said in January that ''the pendulum has swung too far toward the employees,'' and that ''employers are using lockouts because unions are reluctant to do what the employers consider reasonable.''
Fehr said: ''He's obviously right that employers are using the lockout more often. Bob has been the architect of a whole host of those.''
In Fehr's baseball days, he sometimes had a reputation for arrogance and curtness in dealings with reporters and in negotiations.
But in the hockey job, Fehr has been remarkably accessible to reporters, and he has kept his cool after difficult negotiating sessions with Bettman -- a contrast with the often fuming demeanor of Bob Goodenow, the union boss during the last N.H.L. lockout.
''I'd like to think I am wiser, more measured,'' Fehr, 64, said when asked whether he has mellowed over the last quarter-century. ''But I don't really know -- that's for other people to judge.''
Talks are expected to resume this week in New York, with bargaining still stalemated but a solution in sight. Bettman is calling for an immediate reduction of players' salaries to 50 percent of league revenue from 57 percent, a 12 percent pay cut. Fehr is calling for a gradual reduction to 50 percent that avoids pay cuts.
Whatever happens, Bettman and the owners should not expect Fehr to roll over.
''After all the concessions the players made last time, in the billions of dollars, and with the owners having had record revenues seven years in a row, and the two highest growth years being last season and the season before, we see no basis upon which to tell players to go backward,'' Fehr said.

HEADLINE: Law Banning Masks at Protests Is to Be Challenged

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
The crowd had gathered outside the Russian Consulate in New York, awaiting the sentencing in Moscow of members of the punk protest band Pussy Riot.
Some held aloft placards proclaiming their solidarity with the band members; others strummed guitars. Many in the crowd that day in August wore the same sort of brightly colored balaclavas worn by the women in the band.
The choice of apparel led to the arrest of some demonstrators, who were charged with disorderly conduct and with violating an arcane provision in the loitering law that makes it unlawful for three or more people to wear masks in public. 
Now, a lawyer for three women arrested that day says he is preparing to challenge the constitutionality of the law, which he argues should not apply to peaceful protesters.
''We believe this law is overly broad,'' the lawyer, Norman Siegel, said recently. ''Political protest is a quintessential freedom of expression.''
Mr. Siegel said his arguments would differ from those used in previous challenges. Instead of stating that his clients needed to hide their identities with masks because the ideas they were spreading are controversial, he said, he will assert that the masks themselves were integral to the message the three women were communicating.
The ban on masks in New York State dates to 1845, when it was adopted in response to events in the Hudson Valley, where local tenant farmers disguised as American Indians had attacked and killed landlords. The law includes exceptions for masquerade parties and similar events.
The police have periodically used the law during political demonstrations. In 2002, for instance, commanders said they would enforce the law during protests that accompanied meetings of the World Economic Forum in Manhattan. Over the past year, the police have regularly cited the mask law while arresting participants in gatherings and marches connected to the Occupy Wall Street movement.
The law has been litigated several times over the past decade or so, with state courts, federal courts and appeals panels seesawing back and forth over whether it can be fairly applied.
Perhaps the most vigorous challenge came in 1999, after police officials said Ku Klux Klan members could not wear masks during a rally in Lower Manhattan. Assisted by Mr. Siegel, then the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, the group sued, saying the Giuliani administration had violated their members' rights by denying them permission for the rally, and adding that the masks were needed to protect the Klan members from retaliation.
Federal judges twice ruled in favor of the Klan, but the matter was ultimately decided in 2004 by an appeals panel that ruled that the masks were not necessary to convey the Klan's message, which could also be communicated through their tall hoods and flowing robes.
Another challenge came in 2000 after 14 anarchists wearing black bandannas across their faces were arrested in Union Square on May Day. A State Supreme Court justice declined to dismiss charges against the defendants, saying they had not shown that the masks were necessary to protect them from harassment by the authorities.
But the justice, Gregory Carro, also concluded that the United States Constitution protects the right to wear a mask during a peaceful political demonstration.
Mr. Siegel said he thought his argument that the balaclavas themselves were a form of protected speech would be bolstered by the previous court decisions. If successful, he said, the argument could provide a way for other groups to wear masks without being subject to arrest.
Last week, his clients, Rebekah Schiller, Esther Robinson and Rachel Weldon, appeared in court and told prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorney's office that they planned to go to trial.
Afterward, they discussed their reasons for opposing the mask law. Ms. Weldon said that while certain forms of protest, like marches and picket lines, were recognized as valid, less familiar tactics might be more effective at conveying a message.
''The mask law, historically and currently, has caused people to conform to a certain way of delivering their speech,'' she said. ''It's not just what you're saying but how you're saying it that should be protected from interference by the government.''

HEADLINE: George McGovern on Op-Ed

BYLINE: By GEORGE McGOVERN

 BODY:
George S. McGovern, a former senator from South Dakota and the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee, wrote several Op-Eds over the years. Here is a sample of some of those articles. 
Feb. 5, 1971: An Opening to the Far East (pdf)
''Our actions and preparations for dealing with the China of our imaginations has damaged us far more than the China that is real either can or could.''
PUB-DATE: April 25, 1972:
''Most Americans see the establishment center as an empty, decaying void that commands niether their confidence nor their love.''
Oct. 11, 1973: From a Man Who (pdf)
''Much of the stale repetition about the 'disaster' of 1972 is the product of cynicism and a superficial toughness believed to be a safer posture than old-fashioned idealism.''
PUB-DATE: June 26, 1978:
''In recent days there have been implications suggesting that the United States is standing by helplessly while the Soviet Union, with the help of Cuba, is taking over first Africa and then the world. We cannot conduct foreign policy as though every stirring in Africa, Asia or the Indian Ocean is another Cuban missile crisis.''
PUB-DATE: April 3, 1982:
''I'm not yet ready to surrender the New Deal, the Square Deal, the New Frontier, the Great Society -- or the hope that America will again become the great land it can be when it is faithful to its founding ideals.''
PUB-DATE: May 11, 1983:
''An interesting paradox of American politics is that every Presidential contender longs to become the front-runner, but this position once achieved becomes so hazardous as to be perceived as a possible liability on the road to nomination and election.''
PUB-DATE: June 27, 1987:
''To be tough today is to recognize that while America will always need an adequate military defense, most of the dangers and opportunities that confront us are economic, political, diplomatic and moral.''
Dec. 5, 1999: Discovering Greatness in Lyndon Johnson
''Like many Americans, I was deeply opposed to Lyndon Johnson's pursuit of the Vietnam War. My views on the war have not changed, but my opinion of Johnson has.''
PUB-DATE: May 13, 2008:
''To reduce the risk of creating the kind of divisions that afflicted Democrats during my campaigns, here is a proposal that I hope Senators Clinton and Obama and our party will consider.''
Aug. 28, 2008: Help Wanted
''When I arrived in Miami on the Sunday before the Democratic convention in 1972, I had yet to select a running mate.''

HEADLINE: Unfilled Lots Put Parking Company in Peril

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The highest payroll in baseball did not help the Yankees in their failed bid to make the World Series. Charging as much as $58 to park has not helped the company that runs the parking lots around Yankee Stadium, either.
Bronx Parking Development Company, the operator of the lots, has defaulted on nearly $240 million of its bonds because of overambitious forecasts and less expensive transportation alternatives for fans, like the subway and Metro-North Railroad. 
If new revenue is not found and costs are not cut in the coming months, the company could go bankrupt even though the city provided more than $200 million in subsidies, some of which were used to replace parkland where parking lots now stand. The company's next debt payment is due in April.
The Yankees do not own the lots, which have nearly 9,300 spots, and Bronx Parking has ignored their suggestions for improving conditions, a team spokesman said. But fans who drive to Yankee Stadium said fixing the parking problem was simple: lower the prices.
''The whole thing is supply and demand,'' said Ray Hanson, who attended a Yankees game last week with his friend. They parked for free on the Grand Concourse and walked a few blocks to the stadium. ''If they charged $20, the lots would fill up.''
This year, the parking lots have been 43 percent full on average during games and other events at Yankee Stadium, down from 46 percent last year, according to regulatory filings. The lots have generated $767,000 less than expected this year on game days, and continued shortfalls forced Bronx Parking to dip deep into its reserve fund to meet its semiannual bond payments.
On Oct. 1, Bronx Parking took $4.6 million from its fund to cover its bond payment of $6.9 million. That left just $422,000 in the reserve fund, leading to the default.
Edward Moran, the chief restructuring officer at Bronx Parking, said that to bolster the company's finances, other measures are needed, including persuading bondholders to accept less than they are owed.
''Unless debt service costs are lowered through a voluntary restructuring, bankruptcy will eventually be B.P.D.C.'s only available option,'' he wrote in an analysis in June.
Moran declined to say whether parking prices would be cut, though he said all aspects of the company's operations were being reviewed. Moran said the Metro-North station at West 153rd Street, which opened in 2009, has severely affected the parking lots.
The new train stop was not included in the company's original forecasts, he said. Even so, the station, much to the pleasure of transportation advocates and local residents, has been a success because it has kept cars off congested streets. Nearly 4,100 fans on average took Metro-North trains to the stadium for weekend games, including many who live in Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester County who previously drove to games.
''We used to drive in,'' said Dave Weaver, who paid about $23 for a round-trip ticket on Metro-North from his home in Fairfield, Conn., to the stadium. ''But tickets are astronomical, gas is high and the parking is expensive.''
If the 4,100 rail passengers on a single weekend game had driven, with four passengers in a vehicle, that would have been roughly equivalent to more than 1,000 vehicles driving to the stadium. Another 15,000 fans take the subway on game days; many of them live in New York City and are unlikely to drive to the game.
Though the city's Industrial Development Agency issued the bonds on behalf of Bronx Parking, the city is not on the hook for them.
However, the company owes the city $25.5 million in rent and payments in lieu of taxes accumulated since 2007.
The back rent, combined with the subsidies and high parking prices, have watchdog groups, like Good Jobs New York, wondering about the wisdom of turning parkland into parking lots and calling it economic development.
''I would love to say the garages are doing well and we're using the money for other things,'' said Bettina Damiani, the project director at Good Jobs New York. ''But it's not adding up and never will.''

HEADLINE: Diversity at CUNY

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You made a strong argument for the Supreme Court to uphold the University of Texas's consideration of race in its admissions decisions (''Race-Conscious Admissions in Texas,'' editorial, Oct. 11). It's astounding that Texas, a state not known for its progressive politics, recognizes the need to diversify its top educational institutions, but the City University of New York does not. 
As our recent report shows, black and Latino enrollment at top CUNY colleges has plummeted since the onset of the recession. CUNY does not consider race, income or neighborhood factors in its admissions decisions. As a result, in 2011, the percentage of black freshmen at Baruch College (6 percent) was lower than that of Harvard University (7 percent), despite the fact that an overwhelming share of CUNY students come from predominantly black and Latino public high schools.
CUNY can reverse this trend by considering race and/or developing race-neutral policies to increase the diversity at its top schools, much as Texas, California and other strong public university systems have done. In doing so, CUNY can reclaim its tradition as an equalizer in our city, rather than becoming a perpetuator of inequality.

HEADLINE: At Technology High School, Goal Isn't to Finish in 4 Years

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
Flakes of green paint are peeling from the third-floor windowsills. Some desks are patched with tape, others etched with graffiti. The view across the street is of a row of boarded-up brownstones.
The building and its surroundings in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, may look run-down, but inside 150 Albany Avenue may sit the future of the country's vocational education: The first 230 pupils of a new style of school that weaves high school and college curriculums into a six-year program tailored for a job in the technology industry.
By 2017, the first wave of students of P-Tech -- Pathways in Technology Early College High School -- is expected to emerge with associate's degrees in applied science in computer information systems or electromechanical engineering technology, following a course of studies developed in consultation with I.B.M.
''I mean, in 10th grade, doing college work?'' said Monesia McKnight, 15, as she sat in an introduction to computer systems course taught by a college professor. ''How great is that?'' 
Many with four-year degrees are facing a transforming economy where jobs require less generalized types of education and more of the skills that many college graduates lack, in science, technology, engineering or math.
Into this breach, school systems around the country have been aiming to start new high schools like P-Tech. Officials in Chicago were so taken by New York's school that they opened five similar schools this year with corporate partners in telecommunications and technology. Besides New York and Illinois, education officials in Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina and Tennessee have committed to creating such schools, and the Obama administration has recommended that Congress provide more money for vocational education -- the preferred name is career and technical education, or C.T.E. -- to promote this approach.
A year from now, New York City plans to open two more schools just like P-Tech, focusing on other growing industries in the city, possibly including health care. A fourth one is planned to open in September 2014. The State Board of Regents is also trying to develop assessment exams for this type of school, perhaps one that could be substituted for one of the usual Regents tests.
''When we view high-quality C.T.E. programs, we see how engaged those students are and what clear aspirations they have for their future,'' said John B. King Jr., the state education commissioner. ''Unfortunately, that's not always present in some of our struggling schools.''
P-Tech, which began last year with a ninth grade and now has a 10th grade, is inside Paul Robeson High School, which is being phased out because of poor performance. Students attend from 8:35 a.m. to 4:06 p.m., in 10-period days that intersperse traditional classes like math and English with technology and business-centric courses like ''workplace learning,'' which teaches networking, critical thinking and presentation skills. Second-year students are offered physics and global studies as well as the business courses and college-level courses in speech or logic and problem solving -- or both. There is also a six-week summer academy for geometry.
The objective is to prepare students for entry-level technology jobs paying around $40,000 a year, like software specialists who answer questions from I.B.M.'s business customers or ''deskside support'' workers who answer calls from PC users, with opportunities for advancement.
Stanley S. Litow, the president of I.B.M.'s International Foundation, the company's philanthropic arm, and a former deputy schools chancellor in New York, said that the P-Tech curriculum was mapped backward: I.B.M.'s own employees were analyzed to learn what skills a student would need.
Each student also is paired with a mentor from the company, as is the principal, Rashid F. Davis; students take trips to I.B.M. facilities to learn such things as how computer chips are made; the company helped train the school's 18 teachers, and it provides a full-time liaison based at the school to work with faculty from the New York City College of Technology and the City University of New York, which also helped develop the course work. Mr. Litow said that while no positions at I.B.M. could be guaranteed six years in the future, the company would give P-Tech students preference for openings. They would also be well-trained for other information technology jobs, Mr. Litow said.
''Because that is the problem,'' he said. ''Too few kids have these skills.''
P-Tech students are chosen by lottery, with academics not factored in, said Josh Thomases, the Education Department's deputy chief academic officer. Mr. Davis said that 52 percent of last year's ninth graders scored below proficiency on their math and English eighth-grade exams. But he noted that 76 of those 102 pupils had already passed the English and Integrated Algebra Regents exams. He said 16 took a college class over the summer at the New York City College of Technology, and since school began this year, they and 34 others are enrolled in at least one college class that is taught at P-Tech by one of three professors from the college.
''At the center of all this is the notion that there are young people who have as much potential to learn what we think of as basic academics as anyone, but whose learning style, whose interests and preferences are for doing things where they can see: 'What does this mean? Why am I doing this?' '' said Stephen F. Hamilton, a professor of human development at Cornell University who has studied the success of Germany's apprenticeship programs.
''Right now,'' he added, ''I think what P-Tech is trying to do is laudable.''
There were 600 applicants for the second freshman class, or about six times as many as for the first.
This is despite the school's threadbare appearance. Mr. Davis said he pours most of his resources into academics -- even using Robeson's beat-up desks to save on costs.
''You have to know where to place your priorities, and our priorities are in the intellectual capital of the people that we hire,'' said Mr. Davis, who added that 88 percent of his students were poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunch (the citywide average is about 75 percent).
Whether the school is worth the investment depends on how it is compared. Since most vocational schools finish in four years -- Mr. Litow said some P-Tech students could ''be on a fast track'' to finish in four -- the six-year program costs the city more. But most of the jobs the students are aiming for require at least a two-year associate's degree as well. Absent financial aid, New York City's community colleges charge $3,900 a year in tuition.
''And what is the return on the individual student?'' Mr. Litow said. ''It is the difference between a low-wage job with no career and the solid wages and skills to have a productive middle-class job.''
Several students at P-Tech said they felt the school was giving them a new start in academia, by appealing to their passions for learning something that moved them. Some were already looking beyond the prospect of an I.B.M. job, like Eketa Roberts, 15, who said she wanted to be a lawyer, possibly in technology; Cierra Copeland, 15, who wants to be a cardiac surgeon; and Clifton McDonald, 15, who wants to create technology that improves on prosthetics, and also write fiction. Clifton has already written five chapters of a novel about a boy with amnesia, ''who woke up in a world that he doesn't completely recognize.''
Another, Lamar Agard, 14, noted the practical realities, too.
''I'm getting an associate degree,'' he said as he sat in his ninth-grade math class. ''It's giving me the opportunity of getting my college degree without having to pay for it.''
Recently in Dan Berkley's 10th-grade physics class -- which was being taught in part by Brian Lewis, a math teacher -- the students were well dressed and some even had briefcases. Amare Lewis, 15, said he never wore a tie to school until now.
''If I'm going to take these classes, and be part of I.B.M., I feel like I want to dress well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Benghazi and Arab Spring Rear Up in U.S. Campaign: Obama and Romney Differ Sharply on Mideast Course

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Suliman Ali Zway contributed reporting from Benghazi, Libya, and Mayy El Sheikh from Cairo.

 BODY:
BENGHAZI, Libya -- When people here talk about American politics, many look to the sky, where the buzz of surveillance drones has grown heavy since last month's deadly assault on the United States mission in this city in eastern Libya.
''Give it a rest, Obama,'' one resident posted in a Twitter message on Saturday morning, after a low-flying drone woke much of the city. ''We want to get some sleep.''
The drones are a vivid reminder that Benghazi has become the focal point of a fierce debate over what role the United States should seek to play in shaping the new order emerging from the revolts of the Arab Spring, an issue that is expected to be a flash point in Monday night's foreign policy debate between Mitt Romney and President Obama.
Yet Benghazi has entered the American political lexicon with contradictory meanings. 
To Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, the city has become shorthand for the growing threat to the United States from Islamist militants -- and what Romney advisers call the Obama administration's ''passivity'' in the face of the menace. To President Obama, Benghazi is also the place where moderate Islamists took up arms to defend American diplomats from extremists, a democratically elected president rushed to express his solidarity with Washington and thousands turned out to demand the rule of law and mourn an American envoy.
The candidates' differing views encapsulate their approaches to both the Arab Spring and the nature of American power. Mr. Obama has emphasized cautious restraint, out of philosophical support for Arab demands for self-governance and out of a conviction that events in the region are largely beyond American control. Mr. Romney has stressed his wariness of the popular uprisings and vowed a more assertive approach to influencing their outcome.
That disagreement in many ways mirrors the paradoxical views of America held by many of the region's people and policy makers, who see Washington as all-powerful but also doomed to self-sabotage whenever it intervenes there.
Many here ask, nodding toward the sky, has America not learned the lessons of Iraq?
''People, psychologically, are quite anxious,'' said Jalal el-Gallal, a Benghazi political activist, who worries that the pressures of an election year could prompt an American strike on militants suspected in the consulate attack. ''It would destroy all the good will that was won over the last two years of engagement, and it could undermine the elected government and make the place ungovernable.''
More than a decade of public opinion polls have shown that, except for the hope that America might goad Israel toward recognizing a Palestinian state, overwhelming majorities of the populations in every Arab country would prefer a more restrained American foreign policy like Mr. Obama's. For many, Mr. Romney's assertion in an address that ''there is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East'' is not just false but a laugh line.
If Mr. Obama's soft touch is popular in the region, however, it may not be in America's best interest, argued Shadi Hamid, research director of the Brookings Doha Center in Qatar.
''There is a widespread sense in the region that Obama is a weak, somewhat feckless leader,'' Mr. Hamid said, citing Mr. Obama's acquiescence in confrontations with Israeli leaders over settlements and with Egypt's generals over the prosecution of American-backed nonprofit groups.
''People think that if you are in a standoff with Obama and you hold your ground, he will eventually back down,'' Mr. Hamid said.
The contrast between the candidates is so stark they sometimes appear to be on opposite sides of the Arab Spring itself. President Obama, his advisers say, began with the premise that the old American-backed order of secular autocracies was already crumbling from within and could no longer promise stability, while the Arab demands for self-governance accorded more with American values.
''The president made a decision to side with democratic change,'' said Benjamin Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, ''and we made it clear that it is not our place to dictate the outcomes in any given country.''
Mr. Romney has emphasized the risks of uprisings. Eliot A. Cohen, a foreign policy adviser to his campaign, said he questioned the concept of an Arab Spring altogether. ''It is not clear to me what is germinating,'' he said.
Where the president says he is supporting new democracies, Mr. Romney argues that the Obama administration has, in effect, abandoned the region to forces hostile to American interests. ''If you don't even try to shape events,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''then for sure you are going to get a bad outcome.''
Neither candidate has fully squared the potential conflicts of American values and interests, a problem most acute in the case of Bahrain. Its Sunni Muslim monarch used brutal force to crush a democracy movement among the Shiite majority, but the island kingdom is also home to the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet and a crucial bulwark against Iranian influence.
Obama administration officials say they concluded that even the presence of the Fifth Fleet gave Washington little influence over Bahrain's rulers. Saudi Arabia and the other Sunni monarchies in the Persian Gulf were determined to prop up the kingdom even if the United States withdrew.
In the most urgent question now posed by the Arab Spring, rebels in Syria are battling a longtime American foe, marching under the banner of Arab democracy and pleading for Washington to supply them with weapons.
But the Obama administration has nonetheless declined to provide the arms, saying it has too little sway over the direction of the insurgency, the influence of Islamist extremists, the potential that the weapons might be turned on neighbors like Israel or the likelihood of a sectarian blood bath. Iraq, White House advisers say, proved that the United States is ill equipped to manage a sectarian civil war.
Mr. Romney has vowed to arm the opposition despite the acknowledged risks, as a way of buying an American say in whatever comes next.
''Sooner or later Assad is going to go down, so you are better off getting in there early to try to shape what you are going to get as a result,'' Mr. Cohen said, referring to Bashar al-Assad, Syria's ruler. ''Or the choice is to be passive, as we have been, and watch the void filled by others who don't like us,'' like hard-line Islamists.
On Friday, the Syrian opposition declared a national demonstration to express its frustration at the American refusal to supply it with weapons. But the Syrian rebels also say they doubt that as president Mr. Romney would live up to his promise or that Congress would let him. ''It is just propaganda for the elections,'' said Abu Jaafar El Megharbel, an activist from Homs.
Some regional governments supportive of the rebels dismissed Mr. Romney's proposal in even stronger terms. ''That would explode the whole area, if Romney is serious about it,'' warned Amr Darrag, the top foreign policy official of the political party of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the party of the country's newly elected president. ''The difference reflects the good experience of President Obama and a lack of experience of Governor Romney.''
On the subject of political Islam, the Obama administration concluded that democracy would inevitably empower Islamist parties, leaving the United States no choice but to build partnerships with them. Breaking decades of mutual hostility, the administration has opened cordial relations with the Islamists who dominated elections in both Tunisia and Egypt -- in each case, with promises of tolerance, pluralism and constitutional democracy.
White House officials said they have no bias against Islamist parties. ''We will judge these parties not by who they are but what they do,'' Mr. Rhodes said. Officials said that responsibility for governing and participation in the political process can have a moderating influence on the movement. ''We believe there is a chance for democratic change to undercut the Al Qaeda narrative,'' Mr. Rhodes said.
The Romney camp, on the other hand, views Islamists -- even the most moderate -- as a potentially threatening force. Despite their public statements and recent track record, Mr. Cohen argued, it was premature to conclude that any of the Islamists were committed to democracy.
''I think we have to be very cautious that it is only a 'one man, one vote, one time' kind of process,'' he said. ''We are going to have a very complicated relationship with these people.''
To Mr. Romney, foreign aid should be used for political leverage, particularly in Egypt. Mr. Obama has resisted attaching any conditions to the $1.5 billion in annual American aid to Egypt in order to preserve friendly relations and long-term influence. Mr. Romney has vowed to use the money as punishment or reward.
For example, Mr. Cohen said, Mr. Romney might penalize Egypt's Islamist government for its slow response when protesters breached the walls of the American Embassy in Cairo last month. ''We are not going to give those kinds of sums to people who fail to deliver on their most basic obligations to us,'' he said.
But Mr. Darrag of the Muslim Brotherhood said the aid was not much of a cudgel against a country with an economy of $200 billion a year. ''It is just not acceptable for one party to say, 'We give you this amount of money so you have to listen to what we are saying,' '' he said. ''That is when we get very offended.''
Such talk was the difference between a candidate and a president, Mr. Darrag said, arguing that governing responsibility would moderate Mr. Romney as well, just as it has previous presidents. ''I would say Romney would sound the same as Obama four years after the start of his term,'' Mr. Darrag said, ''That has always been the case.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s Beleaguered Akin Draws Ire Over 'Fetch' Talk

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Representative Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate, drew ire and fire again during the weekend for comments likening his Democrat opponent's legislative actions to those of a dog responding to the command of fetch.
The race between Mr. Akin and Senator Claire McCaskill has been one of the most contentious and closely watched ones in the nation, punctuated by comments from Mr. Akin about women that his detractors, including Ms. McCaskill, have used to try to paint him as extreme. Speaking about Ms. McCaskill at an event in Springfield on Saturday, Mr. Akin said, ''She goes to Washington, D.C., and it's a little bit like, uh, you know, one of those dog, you know, 'fetch.' '' 
''And she goes to Washington, D.C.,'' Mr. Akin continued, ''and gets all of these taxes and red tape and bureaucracy and executive orders and agencies and she brings all of this stuff and dumps it on us in Missouri. And it seems to me that she's got it just backwards. What we should be doing is taking the common sense that we see in Missouri and taking that to Washington, D.C., and blessing them with some solutions instead of more problems.''
The comments were first reported by the Web site PoliticMo.com, which posted an audio recording of the comments online on Saturday. They came about two months after Mr. Akin set off a storm of criticism across the political spectrum by suggesting that in cases of a ''legitimate rape,'' women's bodies could ward off becoming pregnant. That comment drastically changed Mr. Akin's fortunes. Once favored to win a seat that Republicans thought would be a sure pickup in their effort to win control of the Senate, Mr. Akin fell behind in the polls and big-time donors withdrew pledges of millions of dollars.
Ms. McCaskill's campaign quickly pounced on Mr. Akin's comment, using it in a daily e-mail series it had been sending to reporters that highlighted a separate comment or action by Mr. Akin that the campaign viewed as extreme.
''Akin continues to offend women, anyone else with a sense of decency,'' the e-mail's headline read. ''We were planning to send out one of our usual '35 Days, 35 Ways' press releases, but Todd Akin did the work for us when he compared Claire to a dog in Springfield last night,'' the e-mail continued.
It went on to post links to several articles about the comment and said the remark ''was another in a series of quotes that could place more distance between Akin and female voters.''
Mr. Akin also drew criticism last month when he suggested that Ms. McCaskill was much more ''ladylike'' during debates in her first run for Senate six years ago.
The tight race has gotten personal on both sides. Mr. Akin's campaign has attacked Ms. McCaskill's wealth and said she has benefited off of taxpayers. Mr. Akin has highlighted in recent weeks that housing development companies tied to Ms. McCaskill's husband had received $40 million in federal subsidies.
Rick Tyler, an adviser to Mr. Akin, played down Mr. Akin's comments. His opponents, he said, simply were trying to distract from the important issues. ''I think this cycle is becoming interesting because it's becoming puerile and infantile with this parsing of little statements, while we ignore $16 trillion of debt and unemployment,'' Mr. Tyler said.
He added that Mr. Akin, ''made an analogy -- probably could have made a better one. Everybody's going to find a reason to get their feelings hurt and get bent out of shape.''
Mr. Tyler also joked that Mr. Akin ''could have said liberals -- people actually like dogs.''

HEADLINE: Sharpening the Message For the Final Push

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
In the closing days of the 2012 presidential campaign, President Obama and Mitt Romney are finding sharper, punchier ways to communicate their basic arguments.
Bumper-sticker politics has been around forever. But it often takes presidential candidates a while to hone their closing arguments.
Listening to both men recently in the debates and on the stump has made it clear that their advisers have worked hard to distill the campaign themes and attacks into a single word or phrase. The idea? Make sure everyone can understand what the simple message is. 
Here is a sample from each side:
The Democrats
 "Romnesia" - At a rally on Friday morning in Fairfax, Va., Mr. Obama found a way to encapsulate his campaign's attack on Mr. Romney's attempts to moderate some of his more conservative positions. He accused Mr. Romney of forgetting his previous positions because he has a case of "Romnesia."
The president was not the first to come up with the word - it has been bouncing around on Twitter for weeks. But it was a big hit with the crowd at George Mason University, and it will most likely find its way into many of the president's rallies.
 "Malarkey" - Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used the word several times during his debate with Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's running mate. He has continued to use it to attack the Republican ticket's veracity.
Campaigns can sometimes simply accuse their rivals of lying. But that can appear harsh to voters, especially in the waning days of a race, when people can tire of the negativity. A word like "malarkey" can seem like a more lighthearted way to say the same thing.
 "Sketchy Deal" - In his first debate with Mr. Romney, the president stumbled about for a concise way to question the Republicans' economic and tax plans. What came out was a long and rambling critique that for some was hard to follow and seemed defensive.
In the second debate, Mr. Obama found his phrase. By calling Mr. Romney's tax and budget plans a "sketchy deal," Mr. Obama condensed his argument into two words. Expect the president to continue repeating the term as he crosses the country.
 "Binders Full of Women" - During the second presidential debate, Mr. Romney's description of being handed "binders full of women" who were potential appointees when he was the governor of Massachusetts became an Internet sensation. But the president's team has used it in a serious way, as an easy catchphrase to signify his belief that Mr. Romney's policies would be bad for women.
The phrase gets huge applause at rallies and will no doubt remain in the Democrats' stump speeches in places where they think they can make gains among women.
The Republicans
 "Running on Fumes" - For the last week, Mr. Romney's campaign has been accusing the president of not having much of a second-term agenda. The idea is to highlight what Mr. Romney's organization believes is a backward-looking, defensive campaign by the president.
"Running on fumes" captures that sentiment and will most likely be repeated on the trail during the rallies ahead. The Republican campaign hopes people will be able to identify easily with the imagery of a White House that is out of ideas.
 "Last Four Years" - Several weeks ago, when Mr. Romney's campaign was down in the polls and struggling, his top advisers came up with a new formulation of Ronald Reagan's "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" The adaptation: "We can't afford another four years like the last four years."
Mr. Romney seems to like it. He used it during the first two debates, and he and Mr. Ryan regularly repeat it on the stump. It appears often in Republican advertisements and literature. That is not likely to change, as Mr. Romney's camp tries to persuade voters to make a change.
 "Hope Is Not a Strategy" - When it comes to foreign policy, Mr. Romney has accused the president of failing to achieve the grand vision he laid out in 2008. Speaking several weeks ago in Lexington, Va., Mr. Romney praised Mr. Obama's "hopes" for the Middle East, but said that "hope is not a strategy."
The Republican campaign believes that wording nicely captures what it says is a feckless, ineffective foreign policy that has not achieved its goals. For a public that is more focused on domestic issues and less knowledgeable about national security, the phrase could help make Mr. Romney seem an acceptable commander in chief.
 "The Shrinking Campaign" - Mr. Romney and his allies have recently begun talking abut the "smallness" of the president's campaign. They say Mr. Obama's ads about Big Bird and catchy terms like "Romnesia" testify to a lack of big ideas.
On the stump, Mr. Romney has said his rival is reduced to "petty attacks and silly word games." But the "shrinking campaign" is likely to be the way he talks about it in the last two weeks of the race.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: High Stakes for Airbus in Getting New Jet to Market

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- Less than two weeks after its parent abandoned a megamerger with BAE Systems, Airbus is set to enter a critical new phase in the development of its newest airplane, the A350, which will come under greater scrutiny as the industry faces a cyclical downturn in new orders and a still-tentative recovery in air travel.
On Tuesday in Toulouse, France, Airbus plans to hold a formal inauguration of the final assembly line for the A350, a twin-engine wide-body jet that is scheduled to enter commercial service in late 2014. The aircraft will be the first by Airbus to have more than half of its structural components made from lightweight, plastic-based composite materials, rather than aluminum.
The A350 will also be the company's first all-new product since the A380 superjumbo, which has been wildly popular with fliers since entering service in 2007 but became a symbol of cross-cultural and industrial dysfunction that Airbus is eager to put behind it. 
''Airbus learned a great deal from the A380 as far as the need for standardizing, better coordinating and integrating their internal design processes,'' said Hans Weber, chief executive of Tecop International, an aviation consulting business based in San Diego. ''It wasn't easy.''
Six years ago, miscommunications in the design, manufacturing and installation of several hundred kilometers of electrical cables resulted in a devastating three-year delay to the A380 program that ultimately led to a reshuffling in management, the elimination of 10,000 jobs and more than $6 billion in losses.
Fabrice Brgier, who took over in June as the Airbus chief executive, has been deeply involved in the plane maker's restructuring since he joined as chief operating officer in 2006 and is determined not to repeat the exercise.
In addition to centralizing its internal design systems and decision-making processes, Airbus has involved the key suppliers to the A350 in the design process from the start, sharing digital blueprints with them and even dispatching its own engineers to help train and guide contractors. The result, Airbus hopes, will be to minimize delays through quicker and more transparent communication of incremental changes across the production and supply chains.
''I think we have improved a lot in having a better management of our operations, bringing much more transparency and professionalism,'' Mr. Brgier said in an interview this summer. ''Big groups are always overwhelmed by bureaucracy, by complex processes. We are evolving our organization to make it simpler.''
That is not to say that such organizational improvements have managed to keep the A350 project -- now estimated at &#x20ac;12 billion to &#x20ac;13 billion, or $15.6 billion to $17 billion -- on schedule.
In the summer of 2011, Airbus delayed its anticipated delivery dates for two of the plane's three versions by two years, to 2016 and 2017, to meet customers' demands for a more powerful engine for the largest version, the A350-1000, and to focus its engineering resources better on building its top-selling version, the 314-seat A350-900, which it had promised to customers beginning in late 2013. Airbus has more than 350 orders for the A350-900, while its 270-seat model, the A350-800, has garnered 118 orders and the 350-seat A350-1000 has just 88.
Then, almost a year ago, the delivery goal for the A350-900 crept back another six months, the result of a maddening shortage of parts from third-party suppliers who were scrambling to meet demand from Airbus as Boeing gradually speeded up production of its competing 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in late 2011 and is also largely built from the same lightweight composite materials. European Aeronautic Defense & Space, Airbus's parent, booked a &#x20ac;200 million charge on its 2011 third-quarter earnings due to the delay
A bug was subsequently discovered early this year in the software that drives robots responsible for drilling holes in the plane's carbon fiber wings -- which are 32 meters, or 105 feet, long -- at a site in Broughton, Wales. The problem, which Airbus says it has since fixed, required that workers drill holes in the first five wings -- including those for the first flight-test aircraft -- by hand, adding &#x20ac;124 million to the A350's development bill and pushing back the first deliveries to the second half of 2014.
Airbus said it was sticking to that timetable, with plans to begin a 12-month flight test program next summer. But analysts said they anticipated that the calendar would slip further. It is normal, they said, for snags to arise in the production and testing of new planes, especially when they use new technologies.
''Experience of recent programs shows you can get a long way into the development process before trouble shows up,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, an analysis firm in Fairfax, Virginia. In the case of the A350's entry into service, he said, ''we have always assumed mid-2015, and we are still sticking with that.''
In addition to lessons from the painful birth of the A380, Airbus has learned much from studying Boeing's missteps with the 787, which was three years late amid numerous problems linked to inexperience with the new composite materials, outsourcing of key elements of the plane, parts shortages and other issues.
''The 787 was rolled out as an intact aircraft before anyone figured out that things were terribly wrong,'' Mr. Aboulafia said.
The 72,000-square meter, or 775,000-square-foot, A350 facility in Toulouse, in the southwest of France, currently houses a fully assembled version of the plane that will be used for ground tests, as well as the fuselage and vertical tail plane of the first flyable A350 -- one of a fleet of five to be used in flight tests. Airbus aims eventually to produce 10 finished aircraft a month at the site by 2018.
Even if Airbus manages to limit further production delays, analysts said EADS still faced challenges in keeping the program financed. Some estimate that the setbacks thus far have already added &#x20ac;2 billion to the A350's final bill.
''Everything that goes wrong increases the financing requirements,'' said Nick Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, a research firm in London. ''Even when these programs are successful, they lose a lot of money and use up a lot of cash in their early years.''
In addition to about &#x20ac;13 billion in nonrecurring development costs, he estimated the A350 would tie up a further &#x20ac;9 billion in EADS's available working capital for several years before it started to recoup those costs as new planes were delivered and paid for.
The project has already helped to drain EADS's net cash position to about &#x20ac;9.7 billion at the end of June, from nearly &#x20ac;12 billion at the end of last year. Airbus has said it expects several major A350 suppliers to foot about &#x20ac;2 billion of the costs in exchange for a share of the program's eventual profits. European governments could also provide as much as &#x20ac;4 billion in preferential loans, although at least one -- Germany's -- recently threatened to withhold some of those funds unless it receives guarantees of jobs linked to the project.
State funding for civil aircraft is a politically charged subject. In a seven-year-old dispute with the European Union before the World Trade Organization in Geneva, the United States challenged such government loans, sometimes referred to as ''launch aid,'' for past Airbus jets as illegal subsidies that unfairly hurt Boeing. While the W.T.O. has so far rejected the U.S. claim, Washington has not ruled out the possibility of bringing a new suit against the Union that would specifically focus on launch aid for the A350.
Most analysts said Airbus and European governments would probably be extremely careful to structure any A350 loans so they complied with W.T.O. rules.

HEADLINE: Win Ohio, and Win the White House

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Only a risk-taker with the guts of a cat burglar, or someone with lots of money to burn, would bet the ranch on the close U.S. presidential race this year.
A better bet: Whoever wins Ohio -- President Barack Obama or his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney -- will win the presidency.
Ohio is the only state that has voted for the victor of the past 12 presidential elections. It is the embodiment of Middle America and swings back and forth from Republican red to Democratic blue. Right now it looks blueish purple. 
If either candidate gains some momentum in the home stretch and wins by two, three points or more, the Electoral College will not matter. If this year resembles one of the razor tight contests -- 1960, 1968, 1976 and 2000 -- it's the Electoral College, awarding votes by states, that will settle the outcome.
Under that scenario, it's almost impossible to see a pathway to a Romney victory without Ohio's 18 electoral votes. It's more feasible, though still unlikely, that the president could win 270 electoral votes without the state.
The centrality of the state is reflected in the campaigns' heavy presence. In the past seven weeks, Mr. Obama has had nine events in Ohio and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has had five. Mr. Romney, in that stretch, has made 20 Ohio appearances and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has had 14.
Almost every day, the crme de la crme of surrogates descends on the state. Last week, it was former President Bill Clinton and Bruce Springsteen for the Democrats. Mr. Ryan arrived the day after the Oct. 16 presidential debate, accompanied by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Both sides are flooding the airwaves. Over just the past 30 days, Mr. Obama and his ''super PAC'' have spent $26 million on television advertising in Ohio. Mr. Romney, his super PAC and Karl Rove's outside group have spent $20 million over that period. Separately, huge amounts are being disbursed by the campaigns and others on efforts to turn out the vote.
The intensity was evident in campaign appearances last week. In Berea, Mr. Ryan told the crowd that Ohio is ''the battleground of the battlegrounds.'' A few hours later, at a rally at Ohio University in Athens, the president mentioned his opponent and the crowd booed. ''Don't boo, vote,'' he replied.
The two parties' state chairmen, among the best in the country, realize the stakes, though their perspective is different.
''We're now up by a couple,'' says Bob Bennett, the Republicans' Ohio chief.
''We've got a lead in the middle single digits,'' says Chris Redfern, his Democratic counterpart.
Both boast about unprecedented organization and infrastructure resources. Republicans believe they have their best-ever turnout operation. The Obama organization, far superior in 2008, never left the state and has a markedly more sophisticated operation this time.
For Mr. Bennett, ''it's all going to come down to the economy.'' Mr. Redfern said the election could be summed up in four words: ''Let Detroit go bankrupt,'' a paraphrase of Mr. Romney's position on what proved to be the successful bailout of the auto industry, which is a big employer in Ohio.
The state's economy is like the proverbial glass half full, or half empty, depending on your perspective. The jobless rate is 7 percent, below the national average and down sharply from the 10.6 percent level it reached shortly after Mr. Obama took office. At least 11,100 jobs, according to Bloomberg Government, have been saved by the auto rescue and, indirectly, probably considerably more. There are elements of real economic vibrancy.
At the same time, Ohio has lost 239,800 jobs over the past four years, and there are pockets that reflect a durable and deep recession. Almost one-quarter of home mortgages are underwater, meaning the debt is larger than the value of the home.
Thus, Mr. Obama has to be careful in heralding a resurgent economy. Nevertheless, he was buoyant in Athens a few days ago: ''We've added more than five million new jobs, more manufacturing jobs than any time since the 1990s,'' he said. ''The unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 7.8 percent. Foreclosures are at their lowest in five years. Home values are on the rise. Stock market has doubled, manufacturing is coming back. Assembly lines are putting folks back to work.''
Mr. Romney dwells on the glass that's half empty, yet he also faces a conundrum on the economy. Even as the candidate runs around Ohio talking about difficult times, the state's Republican governor, John Kasich, who craves higher office someday, is bragging about Ohio's recovery.
Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster with more than 40 years of experience surveying Ohioans, recently conducted a focus group of a dozen undecided voters in suburban Columbus. The session crystallized the ambivalence toward the two candidates among voters who may hold the balance in the most important state. Mr. Hart said they would decide in the final weeks and would be looking ahead, not back, ''based on who will best get the economy moving and who will fight for them.''
If they split, Ohio tilts toward Mr. Obama, given his superior political infrastructure.

HEADLINE: The Myth of Job Creation

 BODY:
The headlines from the last presidential debate focused on President Obama challenging Mitt Romney on issue after issue. There was a less noticed, but no less remarkable, moment when Mr. Obama agreed with Mr. Romney on something -- and both were entirely wrong. 
The exchange began with a question about the offshoring of American jobs. Part of Mr. Obama's answer was that federal investments in education, science and research would help to ensure that companies invest and hire in the United States. Mr. Romney interrupted. ''Government does not create jobs,'' he said. ''Government does not create jobs.''
It was a decidedly crabbed response to a seemingly uncontroversial observation, and yet Mr. Obama took the bait. He said his political opponents had long harped on ''this notion that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer. That's not what I believe.'' He went on to praise free enterprise and to say that government's role is to create the conditions for everyone to have a fair shot at success.
So, they agree. Government does not create jobs.
Except that it does, millions of them -- including teachers, police officers, firefighters, soldiers, sailors, astronauts, epidemiologists, antiterrorism agents, park rangers, diplomats, governors (Mr. Romney's old job) and congressmen (like Paul Ryan).
First, the basics. At last count, government at all levels -- federal, state and local -- employed 22 million Americans, with the largest segment working in public education. Is that too many? No. Since the late 1980s, the number of public-sector workers has averaged about 7.3 for every 100 people. With the loss of 569,000 government jobs since June 2009, that ratio now stands at about 7 per 100.
Public-sector job loss means trouble for everyone. Government jobs are crucial to education, public health and safety, environmental protection, defense, homeland security and myriad other functions that the private sector cannot fulfill. They are also critical for private-sector job growth in two fundamental ways. First, the government gets its supplies from private-sector companies, which is why Republican senators like John McCain have been frantically warning about the dire effects on job creation if Congress moves ahead with planned military spending cuts. (Republicans insisted upon the cuts as part of their ill-advised showdown over the debt ceiling.) Second, government spending on supplies and salaries reverberates strongly through the economy, increasing demand and with it, employment.
That means the economy suffers when government cuts back. A report by the Economic Policy Institute examined the effect of recent cutbacks at the state and local level -- including direct loss of government jobs and indirect loss of suppliers' jobs; the jobs that should have been added to keep up with population growth; and the reduction in purchasing power from other cutbacks. If not for state and local budget austerity, the report found, the economy would have 2.3 million more jobs today, half of which would be in the private sector.
The government does not create jobs? It most certainly does. And at this time of state budgetary hardship, a dose of federal fiscal aid to states and localities could create more jobs, in both the public and private sectors.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Election-Year Gender Gaps, 2012 Ranks High

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
If only women voted, President Obama would be on track for a landslide re-election, equaling or exceeding his margin of victory over Senator John McCain in 2008.
Mr. Obama would be an overwhelming favorite in Florida, Ohio, Virginia and most every other place that is conventionally considered a swing state. The only question would be whether he could forge ahead into traditionally red states like Arizona, Georgia and Montana.
If only men voted, Mr. Obama would be biding his time until a crushing defeat at the hands of Mitt Romney, who might win by a margin similar to the one Ronald Reagan realized over Jimmy Carter in 1980. Only California, Hawaii, Illinois and a few states in the Northeast could be considered safely Democratic. Every other state would lean red or would at least be a tossup. 
Although polls disagree on the exact magnitude of the gender gap (and a couple of recent ones seemed to show Mr. Romney eliminating the president's advantage among women), the consensus of surveys points to a large one this year -- rivaling the biggest from past elections.
The gender gap is nothing new in American politics. Since 1972, when exit polling became widespread, men and women split their votes in three elections -- 1996, 2000 and 2004 -- and came close on several other occasions. In 2008, for example, Mr. Obama won resoundingly among women, beating Mr. McCain by 13 points, but won by only a single point among men.
The biggest gender gap to date in the exit polls came in 2000, when Al Gore won by 11 points among women, but George W. Bush won by 9 points among men -- a 20-point difference. The numbers this year look very close to that.
Since the first presidential debate in Denver, there have been 10 high-quality national polls that reported a breakout of results between men and women. (I define a ''high-quality'' poll as one that used live telephone interviews and called both land lines and cellphones.)
The gender gap in these polls ranged from 33 points (in a Zogby telephone poll for The Washington Times) to just 8 points (in polls by Pew Research and The Washington Post). On average, however, it was 18 points, with Mr. Obama leading by an average of 9 points among women but trailing by 9 points among men.
If those numbers carry forward to the exit polls on Election Day, the gender gap will rank among the largest ever -- the 20-point split in 2000 and the 17-point splits in 1980 and 1996.
The gender gap was nearly absent in 1972 and 1976, the first two years the exit polls tested it. But after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, reproductive rights became a greater focus in presidential elections -- particularly in 1980, when the Reagan campaign highlighted his opposition to abortion. The gender gap jumped to 17 points that year, with men much more likely to vote for Mr. Reagan.
The gender gap has often been widest when there is a Democratic president running for re-election, as in 1980 and 1996 (or a Democratic vice president looking to ascend to the presidency, as in 2000). Women, apart from their tendency to vote Democratic, also seem slightly more inclined than men to give the incumbent party another chance. When the incumbent is a Republican, as in 1976 and 1992, this can mitigate the gender gap.
If the current FiveThirtyEight forecast were recalibrated to show an overall nine-point lead for Mr. Obama -- his lead among women in polls since the Denver debate -- he would be a clear favorite in states totaling 347 electoral votes. Mr. Romney would be favored in states containing just 140 electoral votes. An additional 51 electoral votes would be too close to call.
About the opposite would happen if Mr. Romney led nationally by nine points -- his current advantage among men. He would be all but certain to win states containing 321 electoral votes and would be highly competitive in traditionally blue-leaning states like New Jersey, Oregon and Washington.
The large gender gap exists despite the fact that men's and women's economic roles are becoming more equal -- according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women represented 47 percent of the labor force as of September -- and that women suffered at least as much as men in the recent economic downturn. The unemployment rate among women was 7.5 percent as of September; it was 7.0 percent when Mr. Obama took office in January 2009.
The unemployment rate among men is higher -- 8.0 percent as of September -- but it has declined rather than increased since Mr. Obama took office. It was 8.6 percent in January 2009 and peaked at 11.2 percent that year.
This suggests the gender gap instead has more to do with partisan ideology than pocketbook voting; apart from their views on abortion, women also take more liberal stances than men on social issues like same-sex marriage and gun control.
Presidential candidates have faced increasing pressure to align with the bases of their parties on social issues. Mr. Obama reversed his position this year and publicly supported same-sex marriage. Mr. Romney has abandoned a number of moderate stances he took on social issues as the governor of Massachusetts.
So long as the ideological gap between the parties grows, the gender gap may grow as well.

HEADLINE: A Prairie Liberal, Trounced but Never Silenced

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM; David E. Rosenbaum, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, died in 2006. William McDonald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
George McGovern, the United States senator who won the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1972 as an opponent of the war in Vietnam and a champion of liberal causes, and who was then trounced by President Richard M. Nixon in the general election, died early Sunday in Sioux Falls, S.D. He was 90.
His death was announced in a statement by his family. He had been moved to hospice care in recent days after being treated for several health problems in the last year. He had a home in Mitchell, S.D., where he had spent his formative years.
In a statement, President Obama called Mr. McGovern ''a champion for peace'' who was a ''statesman of great conscience and conviction.'' 
To the liberal Democratic faithful, Mr. McGovern remained a standard-bearer well into his old age, writing and lecturing even as his name was routinely invoked by conservatives as synonymous with what they considered the failures of liberal politics.
He never retreated from those ideals, however, insisting on a strong, ''progressive'' federal government to protect the vulnerable and expand economic opportunity, while asserting that history would prove him correct in his opposing not only what he called ''the tragically mistaken American war in Vietnam'' but also the American invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.
A slender, soft-spoken minister's son newly elected to Congress -- his father was a Republican -- Mr. McGovern went to Washington as a 34-year-old former college history teacher and decorated bomber pilot in World War II. He thought of himself as a son of the prairie as well, with a fittingly flat, somewhat nasal voice and a brand of politics traceable to the Midwestern progressivism of the late 19th century.
Elected to the Senate in 1962, Mr. McGovern left no special mark in his three terms, but he voted consistently in favor of civil rights and antipoverty bills, was instrumental in developing and expanding food stamp and nutrition programs, and helped lead opposition to the Vietnam War in the Senate.
The war was the cause he took into the 1972 election, one of the most lopsided in American history. Mr. McGovern carried only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia and won just 17 electoral votes to Nixon's 520.
The campaign was the backdrop to the burglary at the Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate Hotel in Washington and to the Nixon organization's shady fund-raising practices and sabotage operations, later known as ''dirty tricks,'' which were not disclosed until after the election.
The Republicans portrayed Mr. McGovern as a cowardly left-winger, a threat to the military and the free-market economy and someone outside the mainstream of American thought. Whether those charges were fair or not, Mr. McGovern never lived down the image of a liberal loser, and many Democrats long accused him of leading the party astray.
Mr. McGovern resented that characterization mightily. ''I always thought of myself as a good old South Dakota boy who grew up here on the prairie,'' he said in an interview for this obituary in 2005 in his home in Mitchell. ''My dad was a Methodist minister. I went off to war. I have been married to the same woman forever. I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like.
''But we probably didn't work enough on cultivating that image,'' he added, referring to his presidential campaign organization. ''We were more interested in ending the war in Vietnam and getting people out of poverty and being fair to women and minorities and saving the environment.
''It was an issue-oriented campaign, and we should have paid more attention to image.''
The 1972 Nomination
Mr. McGovern was 49 years old and in his second Senate term when he won the 1972 Democratic nomination, outdistancing a dozen or so other aspirants, including Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, the early front-runner; former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, the nominee in 1968; and Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, a populist with a segregationist past who was gravely wounded in an assassination attempt in Maryland during the primaries.
Mr. McGovern benefited from new party rules that he had been largely responsible for writing, and from a corps of devoted young volunteers, including Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham, who took time off from Yale Law School to work on the campaign in Texas.
The nominating convention in Miami was a disastrous start to the general election campaign. There were divisive platform battles over Vietnam, abortion, welfare and court-ordered busing to end racial discrimination. The eventual platform was probably the most liberal one ever adopted by a major party in the United States. It advocated an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam, amnesty for war resisters, the abolition of the draft, a guaranteed job for all Americans and a guaranteed family income well above the poverty line.
Several prominent Democrats declined Mr. McGovern's offer to be his running mate before he chose Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri.
Mr. McGovern's organization was so disorganized that by the time he went to the convention rostrum for his acceptance speech, it was nearly 3 a.m. He delivered perhaps the best speech of his life. ''We reject the view of those who say, 'America, love it or leave it,' '' he declared. ''We reply, 'Let us change it so we can love it more.' ''
The delegates loved it, but most television viewers had long since gone to bed.
The convention was barely over when word got out that Mr. Eagleton had been hospitalized three times in the 1960s for what was called nervous exhaustion, and that he had undergone electroshock therapy.
Mr. McGovern said he was behind his running mate ''a thousand percent.'' But less than two weeks after the nomination, Mr. Eagleton was dropped from the ticket and replaced by R. Sargent Shriver, a Kennedy in-law and former director of the Peace Corps.
The campaign never recovered from the Eagleton debacle. Republicans taunted Mr. McGovern for backing everything a thousand percent. Commentators said his treatment of Mr. Eagleton had shown a lack of spine.
In the 2005 Times interview, Mr. McGovern said he had handled the matter badly. ''I didn't know a damn thing about mental illness,'' he said, ''and neither did anyone around me.''
With a well-oiled campaign operation and a big financial advantage, Nixon began far ahead and kept increasing his lead. When Mr. McGovern proposed deep cuts in military programs and a $1,000 grant to every American, Nixon jeered, calling the ideas liberalism run amok. Nixon, meanwhile, cited accomplishments like the Paris peace talks on Vietnam, an arms limitation treaty with the Soviet Union, a prosperous economy and a diplomatic opening to China.
On election night, Mr. McGovern did not bother to call Nixon. He simply sent a telegram offering congratulations. Then, he said, he sat on his bed at the Holiday Inn in Sioux Falls and wrote his concession speech on hotel stationery.
In his book on the campaign, ''The Making of the President 1972,'' Theodore H. White wrote that the changes Mr. McGovern had sought abroad and at home had ''frightened too many Americans.''
''Richard M. Nixon,'' Mr. White wrote, ''convinced the Americans, by more than 3 to 2, that he could use power better than George McGovern.''
Mr. McGovern offered his own assessment of the campaign. ''I don't think the American people had a clear picture of either Nixon or me,'' he said in the 2005 interview. ''I think they thought that Nixon was a strong, decisive, tough-minded guy, and that I was an idealist and antiwar guy who might not attach enough significance to the security of the country.
''The truth is, I was the guy with the war record, and my opposition to Vietnam was because I was interested in the nation's well-being.''
His staff, he said, urged him to talk more about his war experience, but like many World War II veterans at the time, he was reluctant to do so.
How long, he was asked, did it take to get over the disappointment of losing? ''You never fully get over it,'' he replied. ''But I've had a good life. I've enjoyed myself 90 percent of the time.''
Humble Beginnings
George Stanley McGovern was born on July 19, 1922, in a parsonage in Avon, S.D., a town of about 600 people where his father, Joseph, was the pastor of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. A disciplinarian, his father, who was born in 1868, tried to keep his four children from going to the movies and playing sports. His mother, the former Frances McLean, was a homemaker about 20 years her husband's junior.
The family moved to Mitchell, in southeastern South Dakota, when George was 6. He went to high school and college there, enrolling at Dakota Wesleyan University in 1940. After Pearl Harbor, Mr. McGovern joined the Army Air Corps. In 1943 he married Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up with an identical twin on a South Dakota farm. They had met at Dakota Wesleyan.
Mr. McGovern was trained to fly the B-24 Liberator, a four-engine heavy bomber, and he flew dozens of missions over Austria, Germany and Italy.
On his 30th mission, his plane was struck by enemy fire. Lieutenant McGovern crash-landed the plane on an island in the Adriatic. He earned a Distinguished Flying Cross for the exploit.
After his discharge, Mr. McGovern returned to Mitchell -- his father had recently died -- and resumed his studies at Dakota Wesleyan. He graduated in 1946 and went to Northwestern University for graduate studies in history.
With a master's degree, he returned to Dakota Wesleyan, a small university, to teach history and political science. ''I was the best historian in a one-historian department,'' he said in an interview in 2003. During summers and in his free time, he continued his graduate work and received a Ph.D. in history from Northwestern in 1953.
Mr. McGovern left teaching to become executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party, and almost single-handedly revived a moribund operation in a heavily Republican state.
Month after month, he drove across South Dakota in a beat-up sedan, making friends and setting up county organizations. In 1956, gaining the support of farmers who had become New Deal Democrats during the Depression, he was elected to Congress himself, defeating an overconfident incumbent Republican. He became the first Democratic congressman from his state in more than 20 years.
Mr. McGovern left the House after two terms to run for the Senate and was soundly beaten by the sitting Republican, Karl E. Mundt. He then became a special assistant to the newly elected president, John F. Kennedy, and the director of Kennedy's Food for Peace program, an effort to provide food for the hungry in poor countries.
In 1962, Mr. McGovern ran for the Senate again, and this time he won, by 597 votes. He defeated Joseph H. Bottum, a Republican serving out the term of Senator Francis H. Case, who had died in office.
In the Senate, Mr. McGovern became a reliable vote for Democratic initiatives and a leader on food and hunger issues as a member of the Agriculture Committee. But he was more interested in national politics than in legislation.
After Robert F. Kennedy, fresh from his victory in the California presidential primary, was assassinated in Los Angeles in June 1968, the Kennedy camp encouraged Mr. McGovern to enter the race as an alternative to Humphrey and Senator Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota. Mr. McGovern did so but was unable to catch up to Humphrey.
Almost from the moment the 1968 campaign ended, Mr. McGovern began running for the 1972 nomination. He traveled the country, recording on index cards the names of potential supporters he met. He also became the chairman of a Democratic Party commission on delegate selection, created after the fractious 1968 national convention to give the rank and file more say in picking a presidential nominee.
What became known as the McGovern commission rewrote party rules to ensure that more women, young people and members of minorities were included in delegations. The influence of party leaders was curtailed. More states began choosing delegates on the basis of primary elections. And the party's center of gravity shifted decidedly leftward.
Though the rules were not written specifically to help Mr. McGovern win the nomination, they had that effect.
After he was crushed by Nixon in the 1972 election, Mr. McGovern returned to the Senate and began campaigning for re-election in 1974. At the Gridiron Club's annual dinner in 1973, he told the assembled Washington elite, ''Ever since I was a young man, I wanted to run for the presidency in the worst possible way -- and I did.''
Mr. McGovern was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, a landslide year for Democrats after Watergate. He defeated Leo K. Thorsness, a novice politician.
It proved to be Mr. McGovern's last success in elective politics. As the conservative movement gained force, Mr. McGovern's popularity dropped.
In 1980, he was defeated by James Abdnor, a plain-spoken Republican congressman who had clung to Ronald Reagan's coattails and was helped by anti-McGovern advertisements broadcast by the National Conservative Political Action Committee.
Mr. McGovern ran for the Democratic presidential nomination again in 1984, but withdrew after winning only 23 convention delegates, most of them in Massachusetts.
Unlike some of his peers, Mr. McGovern did not become wealthy in office, and he said he had no interest in lobbying afterward. Instead, he earned a living teaching, lecturing and writing. He briefly owned a motor inn in Stratford, Conn., and a bookstore in Montana, where he owned a summer home. But neither investment proved profitable.
What he called ''the big tragedy of my life'' occurred in 1994. His daughter Teresa J. McGovern, who had suffered from alcoholism and mental illness, froze to death, acutely intoxicated, in a parking lot snowbank in Madison, Wis., at the age of 45.
His eyes welled up as he talked about it 11 years later. ''That just about killed me,'' he said. ''I had always had a very demanding schedule. I didn't do everything I could as a father.''
As therapy, Mr. McGovern researched and wrote a book, ''Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle With Alcoholism,'' published in 1997. (An addiction-treatment center named after her was established in Madison.)
That year, President Bill Clinton appointed Mr. McGovern ambassador to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. He moved to Rome, and he worked on plans for delivering food to malnourished people around the world. In 2000, Mr. Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
Returning Home
After four years in Rome, Mr. McGovern and his wife moved back to Mitchell, where they lived in a ranch-style house owned by Dakota Wesleyan and helped raise money for a university library that was named after them. The university is also home to the McGovern Center for Leadership and Public Service, a research and educational institution founded in 2006. The McGoverns also had a home in St. Augustine, Fla.
Eleanor McGovern died in 2007 at 85. A son, Steven, who had also struggled with alcoholism, died in July at 60.
Mr. McGovern's survivors include three daughters, Ann, Susan and Mary; 10 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.
Mr. McGovern remained robust in old age. To celebrate his 88th birthday, he sky-dived in Florida. Last fall, he was hospitalized twice, once after falling and hitting his head outside the Dakota Wesleyan library before a scheduled C-Span interview, and another time for fatigue after completing a lecture tour. But he rebounded and resumed making public appearances this year.
Mr. McGovern remained a voice in public affairs, notably in 2008, when, in an op-ed article in The Washington Post, he called for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for their prosecution of the war in Iraq.
He published books regularly, on history, the environment and other subjects. In ''Out of Iraq'' (2006), written with William R. Polk, he argued for a phased withdrawal from Iraq, to end in 2007. In his final book, ''What It Means to Be a Democrat,'' released last November, he despairs of an ''insidious'' political atmosphere in Washington while trying to rally Democrats against ''extremism'' in the Republican ranks.
''We are the party that believes we can't let the strong kick aside the weak,'' Mr. McGovern wrote. ''Our party believes that poor children should be as well educated as those from wealthy families. We believe that everyone should pay their fair share of taxes and that everyone should have access to health care.''
With the country burdened economically, he added, there has ''never been a more critical time in our nation's history'' to rely on those principles.
''We are at a crossroads,'' he wrote, ''over how the federal government in Washington and state legislatures and city councils across the land allocate their financial resources. Which fork we take will say a lot about Americans and our values.''

HEADLINE: Better Schooling for More, Sure, but at Whose Expense?

BYLINE: JOYCE LAU


HIGHLIGHT: New recruiting strategies and a scholarship program are helping elite schools in Britain reach out to bright students of modest means. But are scholarships from private schools and donors enough to make a difference? 

 BODY:
The historic buildings and immaculate green lawns of Britain's elite private high schools may feel a world away from London's gritty Underground. But 23 top institutions have been using advertisements on the city's subway system to alert commuters that financial aid is available to gifted students from less privileged families, D.D. Guttenplan writes from London.
Meanwhile, at Oxford, the first 100 Moritz-Heyman Scholars recently started school at one of the world's top universities. D.D. spoke to several students from state-funded high schools who otherwise might not have even applied.
Currently, most the world's top schools and universities are in the west, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. But there is a debate over how to a provide high-quality education to more students in an era of economic problems and government budget cuts.
 Judy Dempsey recently wrote about the effects of cutbacks to education funding in Europe. 
A few days later, Tamar Lewin, The New York Times's higher education reporter, cited a new report saying that the average U.S. college or university student is walking off the graduation stage $26,500 in debt. 
 How can governments balance the need for education funding with the need to balance the books? Are scholarships from private schools and donors enough?

HEADLINE: At a Church Downtown, Two Revolutions Intersect

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Horatio Gates, a general in the Revolutionary War, was honored on Sunday, just steps from an encampment of Occupy Wall Street protesters leading their own type of revolution. 

 BODY:
 Descendants of an old American revolution crossed paths on Sunday with some people who fancy themselves as progenitors of a new one. The first revolution was fought long ago by men who took up arms. This latest one, if it can even be called a revolution without distorting the meaning of that word beyond recognition, is conducted by men and women who take up sidewalk space. 
 We have a pretty good idea which insurgency will prove the more enduring.
 First, let's go back in time, to the Battle of Saratoga in upstate New York. There, in 1777, revolutionary forces defeated the British and made it possible for the Americans to believe they just might emerge from the war with a country to call their own.
 The commanding general in northern New York was Horatio Gates, whose name would grace Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and Horatio Street in Greenwich Village. Gates died in 1806, and was buried in the Trinity Church graveyard, off Wall Street. For reasons obscured by the gauze of time, his grave is unmarked. But people versed in these matters are certain that he is there, somewhere.
 Gates is a controversial figure on several counts, including whether he deserved the credit at Saratoga. Some historians are more inclined to shower huzzahs on Benedict Arnold, who unlike Gates was a field commander. Obviously, this was before Arnold's name became synonymous with treason.
 One person who feels strongly that Gates never got his due is James Kaplan, who conducts tours of historic New York sites when he is not at his day job as a tax lawyer with the Herzfeld & Rubin firm in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Kaplan became convinced years ago that Gates had been given short shrift, a slight that he said "has never ceased to amaze me."
 That failing was corrected at the Trinity churchyard on Sunday with the dedication of a granite plaque honoring Gates and proclaiming him unflinchingly as "victor at Saratoga." A half-hour ceremony was held under the aegis of the New York State Organization of the Daughters of the American Revolution. 
 Mr. Kaplan had piqued the interest of Denise Doring VanBuren, who is regent, or chief officer, of the New York organization. Ms. VanBuren wrote to Trinity and to national officers of her own group. One thing led to another, with the result that about 150 people, dozens of them descendants of Revolutionary era figures, gathered in the churchyard for Sunday's ceremony. 
 They passed protesters who have camped outside Trinity Church for the past four months. These people consider themselves an extension of Occupy Wall Street, which likes to think it has led a revolution of its own in regard to American concepts of economic and social justice. 
 Trinity became a target because it didn't accept the occupiers' insistence on their right to plop down wherever they felt like. After protesters were evicted from Zuccotti Park last year, church leaders declined to forgive them their trespasses by yielding to their insistence on taking over an empty lot belonging to the church.
 That led to an encampment of sleeping bags outside Trinity's front gate. It has become a constant in that part of town. About 20 protesters were there on Sunday, some referring to themselves as Occupy Trinity. Frankly, it was hard to distinguish them from any collection of vagrants you might stumble upon. Their principal activity seems to be to lie on the sidewalk, often asleep.
 We seem to be breeding unusual strains of self-styled freedom fighters.
 On Saturday, hundreds of skateboarders sped down Broadway to the financial district, thumbing their collective nose at a state judge who had declared their race to be unlawful - and, city officials added, dangerous. "This is no longer a race," one defiant skateboarder told a reporter for The New York Times. "This is a demonstration for our freedom."
 Right, freedom. One had to wonder what Gandhi or Dr. King would have thought about civil disobedience in the name of skateboarder self-absorption.
 As for the sleeping bag contingent, nobody is suggesting that they imitate General Gates and his brethren by taking up arms. But one might well ask if their doing little more than taking up space on the sidewalk all day truly qualifies as having accomplished something.

HEADLINE: An Issue Whose Time Has Passed

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: China's currency manipulation: not what it was. 

 BODY:
Chinese currency manipulation may come up in tonight's debate -- and as someone who wanted the US to take a tougher line back in 2010, I guess I should weigh in.
Basically, as Ezra Klein says, this is an issue whose time has passed.
In 2010 an undervalued renminbi was a significant drag on advanced economies, including the United States. Since then, however, two big things have happened: relatively high inflation in China, and some appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar. As a result, the real exchange rate of China against the United States (based on consumer prices), has appreciated significantly:
At the same time. China's surplus has come way down:
So this is an odd time to be making confrontation over China's currency a centerpiece of your economic policy -- unless, of course, it's just bluster aimed at making voters think you're tough.

HEADLINE: Home Affordability Still Elusive in Some Major Markets

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Housing affordability is still elusive in some major markets, despite the housing crash. 

 BODY:
Despite a drop in prices since the housing market crash and historically low mortgage rates, many families still can't afford to buy a home in many major cities, a new analysis finds.
Despite lower prices, a median-income household can afford a median-priced home in just 14 of the country's 25 largest metropolitan areas due to rising expenses and stagnant wages, research from Interest.com finds.
The home affordability study finds that Detroit, Atlanta and Minneapolis are the most affordable markets, and San Diego, New York and San Francisco are the least affordable.
"Even after years of declining home prices and record-low mortgage rates, median-income households are unable to afford a median-priced home in nearly half of the metropolitan areas that we looked at," explained Mike Sante, the site's managing editor, in a statement.
To determine their rankings, Interest.com gathered the median home prices in the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States and calculated how much financing would be required for a buyer with a 20 percent down payment. The site crunched data from the National Association of Realtors, the Census Bureau and other sources, including data on insurance costs and taxes, to arrive at its findings.
Interest.com gave each market a letter-grade for overall affordability, as well as a "paycheck power" rating, which indicates the percentage by which the median income exceeds, or falls short of, the income necessary to buy a median-priced home.
Atlanta scored an "A" on affordability and a paycheck power rating of 40 percent, which means that the median income in the city exceeds that needed to buy a median-priced home there by 40 percent. The city has relatively low home prices -- the median sale price of $103,200 is well below the average of nearly $230,000 for the 25 largest cities - and slightly higher income. (Detroit's rating was even higher, but the city represents a special situation, Interest.com notes, because the low home prices reflect a large number of abandoned properties).
The least affordable city was San Francisco, where the median income falls 33 percent short of the income needed to buy a median-priced home.
The most-affordable and least-affordable markets and their paycheck power ratings are:
1. Detroit (+45.32 percent)
2. Atlanta (+40 percent)
3. Minneapolis (+32.2 percent)
4. Phoenix (+23.67 percent)
5. St. Louis (+23.49 percent)
Least Affordable Metropolitan Areas
21. Los Angeles (-12.52 percent)
22. Miami (-12.59 percent)
23. San Diego (-25.9 percent)
24. New York (-29.71 percent)
25. San Francisco (-32.76 percent)

HEADLINE: The Uncomfortable Truth About American Wages

BYLINE: MICHAEL GREENSTONE and ADAM LOONEY


HIGHLIGHT: The stagnation of wages in recent years has many causes, but reflects a failure to invest enough in the skills and productivity of the American work force, two economists write. 

 BODY:
 Michael Greenstone is director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He is also the 3M Professor of Environmental Economics at M.I.T. Adam Looney is policy director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow at Brookings. 
Job creation has rightly been the central economic issue of the last three years as the United States continues its recovery. But the problems with the job market are not entirely recent. The downturn also exacerbated longer-term challenges in the labor market that are driven by a variety of factors, including technological change, international trade and the decline of unions. Many of these forces have been around since the 19th century, but today, for what may be the first time in American history, we are failing to invest enough in our skills and productivity to stay ahead of these trends, and the impacts of this failure are reflected in the declining wages of many American workers.
Because the role of women in the labor force has changed strikingly over the last 40 years, the problem is most evident in trends in male earnings. And, in fact, there has been a lot of talk about the stagnating wages of American male workers. Using conventional methods of analysis, the data show that the median earnings for prime-age (25-64) working men have declined slightly from 1970 to 2010, falling by 4 percent after adjusting for inflation. 
This finding of stagnant wages is unsettling, but also quite misleading. For one thing, this statistic includes only men who have jobs. In 1970, 94 percent of prime-age men worked, but by 2010, that number was only 81 percent. The decline in employment has been accompanied by increases in incarceration rates, higher rates of enrollment in the Social Security Disability Insurance program and more Americans struggling to find work. Because those without jobs are excluded from conventional analyses of Americans' earnings, the statistics we most commonly see - those that illustrate a trend of wage stagnation - present an overly optimistic picture of the middle class.
When we consider all working-age men, including those who are not working, the real earnings of the median male have actually declined by 19 percent since 1970. This means that the median man in 2010 earned as much as the median man did in 1964 - nearly a half century ago. Men with less education face an even bleaker picture; earnings for the median man with a high school diploma and no further schooling fell by 41 percent from 1970 to 2010.
Women have fared much better over these 40 years, but they started from a lower level, and the same problems faced by their male counterparts are beginning to have an effect. Since 1970, the earnings of the median female worker have increased by 71 percent, and the share of women 25 to 64 who are employed has risen to 71 percent, from 54 percent. But after making significant wage gains over several decades, that progress has slowed and even reversed recently. Since 2000, the earnings of the median woman have fallen by 6 percent.
Though these trends in earnings for American workers - men and women alike - are troubling and have many causes, the data do present some clear guidance for policy makers. Among the most robust findings in economics is that education reduces unemployment and increases earnings. But even with the remarkable capacity for education to produce growth, the rate of educational attainment in the United States has slowed, especially for men. The share of men 25 to 34 with a college degree, for example, has barely increased over the last 30 years. (The trends are much better for women.) The United States, once the world leader in educational attainment, has been surpassed by many countries.
Strengthening our K-12 education system and increasing college-completion rates are, therefore, imperative to improving living standards for future generations. It is also clear that changes in the global economy that generate vast opportunities for the American economy have created difficulties for many Americans; the continued pursuit of pro-growth policies will require the identification of policies that help these workers to remain active participants in the economy. These are difficult tasks, but the last four decades demonstrate that the stakes are high. Our children's living standards are at risk, and with them the American Dream that each generation can do better than the previous one.

HEADLINE: Young People Frequent Libraries, Study Finds

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: Sixty percent of 16- through 29-year-olds surveyed by the Pew Research Center said they still visited the library. 

 BODY:
In a digital world where many younger readers feel increasingly comfortable downloading novels and textbooks onto their computers or e-readers, a majority of Americans from the ages of 16 through 29 still frequent libraries.
According to a study released Monday by the Pew Research Center, 60 percent of Americans surveyed in this age group said they still visited the library. They use libraries to conduct research, borrow print, audio and electronic books and, in some cases, read magazines and newspapers.
That finding would seem to clash with the popular notion that young readers have turned away from libraries and print books as the source of their reading material, said Kathryn Zickuhr, research analyst with the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. "A lot of people think that young people aren't reading, they aren't using libraries," Ms. Zickuhr said. "That they're just turning to Google for everything."
The Pew Center has been researching the use of the nation's libraries for more than two years, with financing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The latest study involved a telephone survey, conducted last November and December, of nearly 3,000 people 16 and older talking about their reading habits, and data from two telephone polls conducted in January. While young people clearly do not read newspapers as regularly as their parents and grandparents did, their consumption of magazines is more closely aligned. The study showed that 40 percent of surveyed Americans under 30 regularly read newspapers, compared with 62 percent of older Americans. Seventy-one percent of those under 30 who do read news regularly said they viewed all of their news through hand-held devices.
While 42 percent of Americans under 30 read magazines, 50 percent of older adults read magazines.
But in troubling news for tablet makers, the study also found that the subjects under 30 who read electronically were more likely to read books on a cellphone or a computer.
In fact, the study found that 41 percent of readers under 30 view books using a cellphone and 55 percent read from a computer. Only 23 percent of Americans under 30 used an e-reader and 16 percent used a tablet.
"That's definitely something we will keep an eye on," Ms. Zickuhr said.

HEADLINE: Benghazi, Again

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The Romney campaign is spending so much time on Benghazi only because Mr. Obama's foreign policy record is strong. 

 BODY:
At tonight's debate, Mitt Romney will almost certainly criticize President Obama, again, over Benghazi. Republicans seem to have settled on the attack there as the greatest national security failure of our time (a rather odd notion in the post-9/11 world), perhaps because they think it distracts voters from the fact that, as the vice president likes to say, General Motors is alive and Osama bin Laden is dead.
So I spent some time thinking about the worst possible thing one could say about Benghazi and the aftermath, and it seems to be something like this:
Security in Benghazi was lacking. The State Department denied requests for greater security. Afterwards, Obama administration officials spent too much time talking about the anti-Muslim video and were slow to suggest that terrorists may have planned the attack.

This worst-case narrative leaves out crucial mitigating details. Namely, that security requests were largely focused on the Embassy in Tripoli, not the diplomatic mission in Benghazi. That Republicans slashed State Department budgets, making tough choices on security staffing inevitable. And that, as Eric Schmitt's Times article today makes clear, administration officials said in public what the intelligence agencies were telling them in private.
Moreover, as an intelligence official told Mr. Schmitt, "the bulk of available information" at this point "supports the early assessment that the attackers launched their assault opportunistically after they learned about the violence at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo." (Italics mine.) It's still not entirely clear what happened.
Is Benghazi really the most important foreign policy issue facing the candidates in this election? Not even close. If the worst-case-scenario narrative were 100 percent accurate, would that mean Mr. Obama had committed a major blunder? Not even close.
The Romney campaign is spending so much time on Benghazi only because Mr. Obama's foreign policy record is strong.
That's not to say that there's no room for improvement, but on questions of foreign policy and national security, Mr. Obama is more vulnerable to attack from the left than from the right: he has stayed in Afghanistan too long; he didn't close the Guantanamo Bay detention center; he's dangerously fond of drones.
But Mr. Romney won't attack from the left. So he's stuck with trying to turn Benghazi into a scandal.
There are many other issues worth discussing at tonight's debate, like how much money the United States should spend on the military, the European debt crisis, the civil war in Syria and the lack of progress on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, just to name a few. And there are several important foreign policy issues that have been invisible in this campaign, like global warming and AIDS (on which President Bush, to his credit, made an effort), that the candidates really ought to address.
Instead, they'll probably get bogged down talking about Benghazi.

HEADLINE: Obama Could Be Buoyed by Latest W.T.O. Victory Over China

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: China figures to be a centerpiece of the third and final presidential debate, and President Obama will arrive with a newly won victory over Beijing in a trade case. A ruling last week by the World Trade Organization helps two U.S. steelmakers located in the swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - China is expected to be a centerpiece of the third and final U.S. presidential debate on Monday night, and my colleague David Sanger, in a curtain-raiser, calls China"perhaps the most important long-term subject of the debate."
Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, has charged that President Barack Obama has not pressed China hard enough on its trade policies, to the detriment of American firms and jobs. Mr. Obama has countered by calling Mr. Romney "a pioneer of outsourcing" and noting that his administration has brought twice as many trade cases against China as the previous administration.
The United States scored a victory in one of those trade cases last week, as a World Trade Organization panel ruled against China for imposing unfair tariffs on American-made specialty steel. The steel in question was manufactured at two factories - AK Steel of Ohio and ATI Allegheny Ludlum of Pennsylvania.
The W.T.O. ruling could well help Mr. Obama's electoral chances in those key states.
"This is a victory for the United States as well as for American workers and manufacturers," said Ron Kirk, the U.S. trade representative, adding that "China's unfair duties choked off nearly all" of the U.S. exports of the special rolled steel. 
"The Obama administration," Mr. Kirk said, "will not stand by and allow China to break international trade rules."
Mr. Kirk's statement and some background on the case are here. The W.T.O. panel's ruling is on its Web site here. 
James L. Wainscott, the chairman, president and C.E.O. of AK Steel, said in a statement that the company was "very grateful" to Mr. Kirk's office for "this excellent defense of the rights of U.S. manufacturers and U.S. workers." 
The administration filed the case in 2010, and the W.T.O. ruled against China in June of this year. The Ministry of Commerce in Beijing quickly appealed that decision, but the latest ruling effectively settles the matter. 
"We are pleased that China at this point has no further avenue for appeals," Mr. Wainscott said.
Derek Scissors, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative policy-research group, said in a Reuters report that the ruling was "a small benefit for the Obama campaign because it can advertise 'beating China' in Ohio, but it's not a benchmark for anything."
In the second of the three debates, Mr. Romney slammed China for currency manipulation and "stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology. There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods."
Indeed, there have been numerous fake Apple stores operating in China, and knockoff Apple products, which Rendezvous addressed this year. 
At least 25 stores in the city of Kunming alone were discovered last year after an American health-care worker began photographing, videotaping and blogging about the phony stores. 
The blogger, Jessica Angelson, who has since moved to New York to attend nursing and midwifery school, was contacted by the China Real Time blog of The Wall Street Journal after Mr. Romney's debate remarks about the Apple store.
Mr. Romney used the Apple-store example, she said, "as a shorthand to generate outrage about trade practices in China and as a shorthand that he will be quote unquote 'tough on China.' It's a somewhat meaningless shorthand. I'm not entirely sure he knows what he's referring to at this point."
Her blogging from Kunming - she has links to those posts here - drew submissions of other fake Apple outlets around the world, including one in the New York borough of Queens. That shop, according to the Journal blog, was "shut down after she posted a photo of it online."
"It is more of a global issue," Ms. Angelson said, "but it doesn't create as nice a story as China ripping off Apple stores."
Meanwhile, on Saturday, Apple opened an authentic store in Beijing, a gleaming three-level place, the company's largest in Asia. 
The store, Apple's third official outlet in Beijing and its sixth on the Chinese mainland, has a first-class address - the renowned shopping street of Wangfujing, near the Forbidden City. The store employs about 300, local news reports said, and encompasses nearly 25,000 square feet, or 2,300 square meters.
Apple also has three stores in Shanghai, and there are two here in Hong Kong.

HEADLINE: Permira to Buy Ancestry.com for $1.6 Billion

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: A consortium led by the European private equity firm Permira has agreed to buy Ancestry.com for around $1.6 billion. 

 BODY:
 6:47 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON - A consortium led by the European private equity firm Permira has agreed to buy Ancestry.com for around $1.6 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, Permira and its partners will pay $32 a share for Ancestry.com, a genealogy Web site. The agreement represents a 40 percent premium to the company's closing share price in June, when the potential acquisition was first reported.
Permira, which will retain majority control, is partnering with Spectrum Equity, a venture capital firm and an early backer of Ancestry.com, and several of the European private equity firm's direct investors. The Web site's management also will invest in the deal.
"This is a successful outcome for our public stockholders," Ancestry.com's chief executive, Tim Sullivan, said in a statement.
The agreement comes three years after Ancestry.com raised $100 million in an initial public offering. The site, which allows individuals to trace their heritage, has customers in 15 countries, though the majority of its users are based in the United States, Canada, Britain and Australia.
The deal will be a welcome reprieve for the site, which has struggled since becoming a publicly listed company.
After hitting a $45 high in 2011, its stock price has tumbled to around $29 on concerns that consumers are reducing their spending because of the economic crisis. 
The company was started in the 1990s, and has remained profitable despite concerns about the revenue growth of other Internet businesses. Last year, Ancestry.com's net profit roughly doubled, to $62.9 million, on revenue of $400 million. It has more than two million subscribers who pay up to $34.95 a month to use the service. 
Discussions about a potential sale have been continuing since the summer, and other potential bidders have included TPG Capital and Providence Equity Partners.
The deal is expected to close early next year. Permira has arranged financing for the acquisition with Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets, according to a company statement.
Morgan Stanley and the law firms Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson and Clifford Chance advised Permira, while Qatalyst Partners and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Ancestry.com.

HEADLINE: This Week In Small Business: Looking Stupid on Twitter

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Economic alarm bells, a $41,500 refrigerator, Michael Jordan's barbecue sauce, and have you said anything you regretted on Twitter? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 The Election: Binders of Women 
Small-business owners award a narrow victory to President Obama in the second debate, where it seemed the only good business is a small business. Of course, it didn't take long for someone to songify the whole thing or for these reviews of binders for women to appear on Amazon. Matthew Yglesias urges the candidates to stop talking about small businesses and income tax rates: "There are plenty of good ideas out there to spark small-business hiring, but to make them happen, politicians need to take a break from their obsession with arguing about the top marginal-income tax rate and look instead at payroll taxes and monetary policy." J.D. Harrison writes a small-business guide to the upcoming election. A new survey from The Hartford finds that despite their views on the economy, small-business owners see themselves as largely successful. Oddly, gasoline prices seem to be dropping in important electoral states.
 The Economy: Alarm Bells 
Two Americans win Nobel prizes in economics. Business inventories increase, lifted by automobile stocks. Consumers are asking, "What fiscal cliff?" as retail sales and industrial production rise. Gallup says economic confidence is at its highest since May. Residential building permits are strong and housing construction surges. Manufacturing in the Philadelphia area expands, but the New York region continues to contract. A forecast says global steel demand will slow next year. Inflation is up. The federal deficit tops $1 trillion for the fourth year in a row. Third-quarter earnings season has just begun, but companies are already sounding alarm bells about the fourth quarter. Weekly unemployment claims rise sharply.
 Marketing: 140 Characters of Stupid
Rachel Blaufeld says you should get out there and stop hiding behind your computer. Here are four simple ways to get more testimonials for your company. A new holiday card collection from Hallmark offers something for every business. More small businesses are turning to Facebook and mobile marketing to drive growth. Brad Smith explains why you need to start using Google+. Jack Wrigley compares engagement on social media to window shopping on Main Street: "You need to pick products or services you feel will cause someone to stop, walk in the proverbial door, buy what you're selling, and then tell everybody about it." Gaz Copeland explains how to look stupid in 140 characters. Amy Porterfield alerts you to a little-known Facebook feature that can help you monitor customers and competitors.
 Your People: Working From Home 
Kaylie Astin says that the best employees don't work because they love their company or boss; they work to advance personal goals. Hospital workers are the least healthy workers. Amazon plans to hire 50,000 holiday employees and may enter the semiconductor business. Eric C. Sinoway has thoughts on when to fire a top performer who hurts your company's culture. This is how the worst employee ever went on to build a successful company. Here's why your employees shouldn't work from home. A new study says the shortage of skilled workers may be exaggerated. Here are the top 10 reasons first-time freelancers fail. The bloggers at Springwise share some outsourcing ideas.
 Retail: Fashion Grows 
Fashion is the fastest-growing segment of online commerce, and it's being propelled by a surprising source: men. Gartner says fake online reviews are becoming a bigger problem (Yelp hasone answer). Here's how to turn your slowest foot-traffic day into the most popular day of the week. OpenTable is now offering mobile booking for restaurant customers. This is the danger of having a business van with sliding doors.
 Cash Flow: A $41,500 Refrigerator 
Here's why prepaying expenses may not be your best option. Josh Patrick explains why you need to care about the cost of capital: "Owners have to come to a better understanding of what their financial drivers are and figure out ways to produce the needed returns. Or, if that can't be done, you can do what I did and decide the industry is never going to allow you to make the returns you need and find a way to leave." This $41,500 refrigerator is the size of a small car. PayPal bolsters its credit offering for small businesses. The Boston Beer Company introduces a program to offer loans to small businesses (and a speed coaching event) in Los Angeles. Small businesses want better cash flow tools from banks.
 Management: The Power of Criticism
Ben Horowitz explains how to make yourself a better chief executive: "It's important that you give people feedback because you want them to succeed and not because you want them to fail." Deborah Shane wants to know if you are branding your competencies, characteristics and intangibles. Nadia Goodman says criticism can drive you. This is how to create a healthy balance in life. Phil Simon says you are probably forgetting something before making that big speech. Amy Jo Martin explains how Nascar uses access to build loyal fans. Holly G. Green wants you to take her test to determine if you are in the innovation danger zone. Daniel Kehrer suggests five ways to make service part of your business. A new study says that the "Physical Internet" - a concept in which goods are handled, stored and transported in a shared network of manufacturers, retailers and the transportation industry - would benefit the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Over half of global businesses are still constrained by paper invoices. Ashley Halligan suggests four steps nonprofits can take to establish a lasting partnership.
 Red Tape: Does It Come With Fries? 
Looming federal budget cuts are a big risk to small businesses that rely on government dollars. Michael Keating shares his thoughts on landing a government contract. The Internal Revenue Service offers a free tax calendar for 2013. According to this infographic, one in three small-business owners have been sued in recent years. Someone paid $9,995 for a gallon of McDonald's Michael Jordan barbecue sauce from 1992.
 Around the Country: San Francisco Empties 
MSNBC's "Your Business" host JJ Ramberg releases a book to help small-business owners hook customers. The American Beverage Association sues New York City over the mayor's soda ban. An Entrepreneur Roadshow at Rutgers Business School in Newark will discuss pitching investors, the media and retailers. San Francisco becomes empty in this time lapse video. Waste Management and Sam's Club team up to provide membership discounts for small businesses. The National Federation of Independent Business takes "I Built My Business" on tour. A guy falls 24 miles out of the sky.
 Around the World: A Can of Sardines 
As penalties crush the rial, Iranians point fingers. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said leading indicators for the 34-nation body point to "weakening growth in coming quarters" for most major economies. A can of sardines inspired Mark Ruiz - a middle-class, well-educated Filipino from Quezon City, just outside Manila - to begin his road to social entrepreneurship. The world's most expensive cocktail is mixed in London. China's economy shows signs of picking up after a seven-quarter slowdown. A Star Wars flash mob appears.
 Technology: Bad Week on Wall Street 
Wall Street is disappointed by Microsoft, Google and IBM. Intel forecasts a big drop in margins and AMD lays off 15 percent of its workforce. Heather Clancy has four more mobile app development resources for small businesses. Paul McDougall says Windows 8 beats the Mac but Brian Barrett advises against preordering Microsoft's Surface tablet. Here are a few other projects Microsoft is working on. Best Buy plans its own tablet. The Consumer Electronics Association releases a list of technologies to watch. A new report says small businesses are underestimating cyber threats. Take a look inside Google's data centers. As the smartphone-user population climbed over one billion this week, adoption of such wireless devices in the industrial environment is inching ever-closer to its own explosive growth period. NCR upgrades its point of sale systems.
 Tweets of the Week 
@BobBurg
What separates the star #sales people & exceptional leaders is their unabridged focus on the *other* person.
@NThickettGreat sales people never sell. They solve problems! It all starts with great questions and listening.
[#x200f]@DonCooper#Sales Tip: When prospects really trust you, they'll buy what & when you tell them to.
 The Week's Bests 
 Jim Connolly says this is what every business owner needs to know about winning arguments: "I often see small-business owners arguing with their customers, clients and contacts - insisting they are right and the other person is wrong. They insist on winning the argument (imposing their opinion as the only valid one) rather than winning the client. That mindset is toxic to our business."
 Tom Ewer lays out his stress-free approach to business: "The fact is this - best laid plans often go awry. You cannot avoid that eventuality. Most adversities we face become nothing but a blip on the radar in time. So when dealing with business-related issues, consider them in a bigger context. How will this affect you in the long-term? Is your life's work being destroyed, or are your goals just being pushed back by a day or two?"

HEADLINE: Your Fees, Their Bank

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Consumers would do well to pay more attention to what they pay in bank fees and to consider the more consumer-friendly approach of credit unions, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
Financial regulation is a never-ending saga. Restrict banks' opportunities to turn a profit in one area, and, not surprisingly, they redouble their efforts in another. New credit card rules that went into effect in 2010, as well as legal tussles over "swipe fees," have created pressure to find other sources of revenue.
Fees for late payments and overdrafts are making a big contribution to bank balance sheets these days, partly because consumers don't pay as much attention to fees as to interest rates.
Efforts to regulate such fees may prove less effective in the long run than a consumer-driven shift toward nonprofit banks. Credit unions typically charge much lower fees than banks and offer more attractive interest rates. In rankings of customer satisfaction, they beat for-profit banks hands down.
Last year Bloomberg News published an article, "Bank Fees Are a Credit Union's Best Friend," and the trend continues. As one reporter for Forbes put it, "The fee environment worsened for bank customers in virtually every way possible in the first half of 2012."

Consumers aren't oblivious to all fees. Last year, loud protests led Bank of America to scrap its plans to charge for the use of debit cards. But fees based on late payments and overdrafts are less salient, even to highly educated, well-informed customers, for three reasons:
First, the variety of fees paid under different circumstances makes it hard to comparison shop. Try asking your bank for a complete schedule of all the fees it charges. Even if you can get the information, it's not easy to understand. Many banks now aggressively court low-income borrowers who are more likely to make late payments and less likely to ask inconvenient questions.
Second, banks can manipulate the timing of payments to maximize penalty charges. Several banks, including US Bank, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, have paid millions to settle accusations that they improperly manipulated debit card transactions to generate higher overdraft revenue.
Third, people don't like to believe they will make a late payment. If they do, they tend to feel just guilty enough to accept the punishment inflicted. It's hard for customers to know how many others are in the same boat. Yet the boat holds a lot of passengers. A 2007 study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated that about 25 percent of Americans paid at least one overdraft fee that year.
Late mortgage payments are also common. When the financial crisis hit, many families found themselves unable to pay but received relatively little effective assistance renegotiating their loans.
Both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase are facing class-action lawsuits accusing them of charging excessive and abusive fees to people delinquent on mortgage payments.
Late fees are designed to discourage bad behavior and are influenced by estimates of risk. But a study of credit card penalties published last year in the Journal of Financial Stability, "The Cost of Being Late," shows that banks with bigger market shares tend to charge higher fees.
It can be more time-consuming to switch banks than it used to be, because many consumers now rely on direct deposit and online payment systems that can be cumbersome to modify.
Improved regulation could help consumers, even though banks seem to be able to burrow their way around new rules, poking their heads up in different places. The new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may develop strategies in this game of whack-a-mole.
But why bank with moles in the first place? Credit unions charge fees, too, but they don't design them to maximize revenue, because their goal is to serve their member-owners, not to turn a profit. That's why their fees are lower and their loans more open to renegotiation.
Credit unions are painfully small compared with multistate megabanks, representing only about 6 percent of all financial institution assets in 2011. But they are growing fast on the basis of their reputation for excellent customer service.
Your fees, your fault - especially if you pay them to banks instead of to a local credit union.

Last month a new conservation pledge , the American Eagle Compact, was propounded by the leaders of the National Audubon Society and ConservAmerica. Its purpose, like that of some earlier alliances, is to counter the political polarization that now characterizes most debates about clean air, clean water, habitats for plants and animals and, in particular, climate change. 
The notion is to revive the sense of shared purpose that led to overwhelming approval of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency four decades ago. The idea is hardly new: a coalition of sportsmen and progressive environmental groups was organized to lobby President George W. Bush on wildlife issues eight years ago, and local and regional nonpartisan alliances have formed on a number of specific issues. 
These days, however, the very words "environmentalist" and "Environmental Protection Agency" elicit a fiercely hostile reaction in some conservative circles. 
We spoke with Rob Sisson, the president of ConservAmerica, and David Yarnold, the president of the National Audubon Society, about their new alliance's efforts to find common ground and give Republicans "cover" and a base of support when they seek to discuss habitat, climate or pollution. Following are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity. 
 Q. 
 I know you are building on common ground. But in this world there are divides on many issues that seem unbridgeable. Energy is one. How constrained are you on taking stands related to energy exploration? What about fracking for natural gas? 
 A. 
 (Mr. Sisson): Our organization actually has a policy up on our Web site called Cleaner Here and Now. We think natural gas is an incredibly important energy source for the coming decade. Call it a bridge fuel or whatever, we see it as much more preferable to coal. We support nuclear energy - sort of "all of the above" - but we want to find a pathway from the high-carbon fossil fuels. 
 A. 
 (Mr. Yarnold): My view on that is that there are plenty of Republicans who believe in responsible energy legislation and reducing carbon. We know there are plenty of Republicans who, if they weren't so intimidated by the hard right, would be at the table more often, and we know that there are Democrats who if they weren't so afraid of being hammered and labeled as tree-huggers would be more willing to compromise.
 Q. 
 Go to fracking specifically? There have been questions of safety of the water tables, questions of leaking methane into tap water,and particularly what chemicals are used.
 A. 
 (Mr. Sisson): Fracking's been done for 50 years in this country. In Michigan, where I'm based, the natural gas boom is really expanding all of a sudden. We'd like to see fracking come under the Clean Water Act requirements. We think fracking can be done safely to realize the benefits natural gas can bring us environmentally and economically. There are some areas of the country where, based on sound science, it cannot be done safely. We're not ready to go back to the fallback that states should be alone in regulating this. There is a national interest in interstate commerce. 
 A. 
 (Mr. YarnoId): I agree. That's a sound and responsible approach. As Rob said, the Susquehanna River doesn't recognize any boundaries. Audubon actually is not suggesting that fracking is a terrific thing. I think the science is unclear. We think the Clean Water Act ought to apply. We think that a whole lot more needs to be done before we understand what places are suitable and what places aren't.
 Q. 
 The elephant in the room for many conservative Republicans is climate change, or more specifically the question of what causes it and what to do about it. Rob, can conservatives who care about conservation build a consensus in this area ? David, can major environmental groups work with conservatives on this issue? Where is the common ground? 
 A. 
 (Mr. Sisson): Absolutely conservatives can find common ground and develop approaches to solving or mitigating the problem. The issue, as David alluded to earlier, is the way our political system works right now. With primaries so partisan, most Republicans don't dare mention it publicly for fear they won't come out of a primary. 
We have close relationships with maybe 50 or 60 Republicans on the Hill. They all get this - they understand the enormous ramifications and risks to our nation and to national security. But they have a question: "Would you rather have me here or have me lose to someone who comes from an entirely different place?" There are a lot of conversations in conservative circles right now about the evidence that man, particularly with a lot of burning fossil fuels, is the primary driver of what we are seeing.
 Q. 
 Those must be quiet conversations.
 A. 
 They are quiet conversations. That's one of the great things about the compact. These Republicans are looking for cover. They are looking for support back home from a broad range of constituents who will back them up when they take a stand on this and other issues.
 A. 
(Mr. Yarnold): Forty percent of Audubon's members identify as moderate to conservative. They are advocates for clean air, clean water and good habitat. Whether they want to say that climate disruption is human-caused or whether it's natural, I really don't care. I have not found very many who these days resist the evidence that it's human-caused. 
I know from my visits to places like South Carolina, Louisiana and Colorado, where people tell me that getting outdoors, taking kids out, whether fishing or hunting or seeing birds, is something that they value highly. They don't see it as a partisan issue. I think what we have here is yet one more issue where the American people are out ahead of their leaders. The idea of saying, "Enough, enough with conservation being a political football." 
 A. 
 (Mr. Sisson):That plays into a tenet of Republican politics, that is, the best government is that closest to the people, that's in people's backyards, in their communities. That's where a lot of the real work of conservation gets done. On the ground, grass-roots conservatives not only value conservation, they also see how action to protect and conserve natural resources makes a difference. 
 Q. 
 Endangered species issues were one of the sparks for the Sagebrush Rebellion in the Western states in 1979. Not quite two decades later, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt tried to find common ground by introducing habitat conservation plans. But right now, despite cooperative efforts around the West on some issues, things are nearly as divided as they were before. This is particularly true when it comes to the potential listing of the sage grouse. David, is there a way to protect the grouse without reigniting the rebellion? 
 A. 
(Mr. Yarnold): Yes. You've seen it at play in Wyoming. Audubon and other conservation organizations worked with landowners and the governor in Wyoming to come up with the right formula to protect 15 million acres of core sage grouse habitat. The other thing we know about the West is from two recent surveys: a Colorado College one done for the second time and one that the National Wildlife Federation did. What we know from these studies is that Westerners believe that energy development and habitat protections are not contradictions in terms. 
 A. 
 (Mr. Sisson): ConservAmerica's members go from Montana down to the Rockies and New Mexico. With the advent of the big energy boom out west, we have seen a coalition of what David and I would always have thought were likely compatriots but the media see as competitors - ranchers, hunting guides, the granola-eating, Birkenstock-wearing crowd.
 A. 
 (Mr. Yarnold): Hey, those are my people.
 A. 
 (Mr. Sisson): I've got a pair in my closet. They are coming together. Everyone, the Chamber of Commerce is out there - everyone's coming together and saying: these energy booms come and go - our unique landscape, our wildlife, that's what pays the bills decade after decade after decade. And we need to really pay attention and work hard on that. 
 Q. 
 Your common ground begins with animals and landscapes, which most people can easily grasp and feel strongly about. But industrial pollution was the thing that sparked the first two major environmental laws of the current era, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Cleaning up industrial pollution like mercury from power plants is going to quite possibly cost jobs in traditional industries - at least that is what many conservatives argue. Is that a necessary cost of further lowering the levels of pollutants like fine particulates? 
 A. 
(Mr. Sisson): I don't agree with the premise that it is going to cost jobs. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions released a report - it was a survey of the top 500 companies in the country and the amount of money that climate change is already costing them. When you factor in the health costs of mercury and other toxics being emitted by burning fossil fuels - actually solving those and protecting human life and health from environmental threats - there are opportunities to create new industries and new jobs.
 Q. 
 There are other examples of conservative free-marketeers working with more traditional environmental organizations - the former South Carolina congressman Bob Inglis's group, the Energy and Enterprise Initiative at George Mason University or Young Conservatives for Energy Reform. Could you both make common cause with them? David, what price could you pay with members of the Green Group or other longtime allies for working with ConservAmerica? Rob, are there environmental groups you could not join?
 A. 
(Mr. Yarnold) : I don't think that there's a price to pay for working with ConservAmerica. ConservAmerica was active on climate legislation. The green groups know Rob and ConservAmerica's reputation - the green groups know that the divide isn't all that it's cracked up to be. In fact there's more common ground than cable news would like you to believe. 
 Q. 
 You haven't gotten raised eyebrows from your usual allies? 
 A. 
(Mr. Yarnold): We got a little bit of blowback from some chapters, primarily on the West Coast, when we talked about extremes on the left and the right. The fact is there are extremes on the left and the right and we all know it.
 A. 
(Mr. Sisson): I don't think there's any group we couldn't work with in terms of upsetting our membership - about one-third of our members also say they are Audubon members. But we want to work with and influence Republicans and conservatives. We do watch how we lock arms with some of the progressive environmental political groups. 
Republicans in Congress, probably deservedly, get knocked around by the left-of-center enviro groups. In order to maintain their trust and their ear, we try to we let them know we want to help them get to a better spot, for themselves and for the nation. 
 A. 
(Mr. Yarnold): This is not just some kind of feel-good campaign. This is not symbolic. The idea here is to recruit advocates from common sense. The steps are pretty straightforward. We want to identify the advocates; No. 2, to help them organize and help them get out and influence lawmakers.
 A. 
(Mr. Sisson): We try to be very careful and pick and choose the projects and issues we work on at any given time. We might be the only conservation-slash-political group out there that really is excited about natural gas and that accepts fracking as a necessary part of making that natural gas happen. Nobody is going to accuse us of carrying someone else's water. 
More importantly, what we're trying to do - Bob Inglis, did you see what happened to him? He's kind of the poster child for what happens when a real conservative wants to have a conversation about an important issue. The American Eagle Compact is going a long way to helping create an environment where at least we can have an open conversation. To create an environment where it's at least safe to have a dialogue - that's something we're missing right now because of the polarization in our political universe.
 Q. 
 To make the world safe for future Bob Inglises? 
 A. 
(Mr. Sisson): To make it safer for them at least to have a conversation.

HEADLINE: Candidates Debate Rise of China; China Debates Reform

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: The presidential candidates are set to debate the rise of China tonight, but China's next leader may wish his nation's economy were the juggernaut many Americans think it is. 

 BODY:
Monday night's presidential debate will include a 10-minute segment on "the rise of China and tomorrow's world." Expect harsh word from Mitt Romney about trade practices, the value of the renminbi , Chinese financing of the deficit and the need to increase military spending to strengthen the "pivot to Asia."
Mr. Romney may be right to complain about China's structural trade barriers and intellectual property violations. The question is whether he is willing to undermine the World Trade Organization, through which the United States has won several victories against China, upend the global trading order and drive up prices for many of the goods Americans consume.
 A TRADE WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA would also arguably harm many of the allies with whom the United States is working to execute the "pivot to Asia." Those countries may take China's side in a trade war, as two scholars from the Peterson Institute for Institutional Economicsrecently warned:
U.S. leaders would do well to note that for probably the first time since the second world war the dollar bloc in east Asia has been displaced. In its wake a currency bloc based on China's renminbi is emerging... Chinese shenanigans in relation to politics and security have repelled these countries into America's embrace, reflected most vividly in the latter's pivot-to-Asia strategy. The old saying is that politics trumps in the short run but economics wins in the long run.
Both tickets have ties to China. President Obama's half-brother has been a long-time resident of China, M. Romney's Chinese financial interests are well documented, and Paul D. Ryan's brother isa Cargill executive in Shanghai.
President Obama has pursued a China policy that is broadly consistent with those followed by both Republican and Democratic administrations, and supported by most of the United States business community, for the last 30 years. If elected, Mr. Romney is unlikely to change that policy.
In his 2007 book"The China Fantasy" (Viking), James Mann criticized the argument that trade and engagement would bring liberalization and eventual democracy to China. Mr. Mann foresaw a situation in which China "becomes fully integrated into the world's economy, yet it remains also entirely undemocratic."
That may be the crucial challenge for the United States from the rise of China, and one that America's elite has helped create over the last several decades. The United States has much less leverage against China than most Americans think, and the best way for America to respond to China's rise is not to lash out but to get our own house in order.
 CHINA'S PRESUMPTIVE NEXT PRESIDENT, Xi Jinping, may wish his economy were the juggernaut many Americans think it is. He will inherit an economy in desperate need of reform and rebalancing. As discussed in an earlier China Insider, Mr. Xi and his advisers are aware of China's challenges. 
China's growth rate in the third quarterslowed, as expected, to 7.4 percent. Other economic data came in ahead of estimates, leading to contradictory conclusions from financial analysts. 
Goldman Sachs Asset Management's chairman, Jim O'Neill, has raved about the skill of Chinese policymakers and believes China's may have engineered a "soft landing." 
Other analysts were not so impressed and questioned whether Chinamight have overstated its growth:
The growth rebound is too good to be true," said Li Wei, an economist at Standard Chartered in Shanghai. "Maybe the political agenda has played a role. If you are going to hold a board meeting of course you want to report a decent number. It's understandable.
It looks premature to conclude that China's economy has avoided a hard landing, but the bearish sentiment toward China may be shifting as we approach the 18th Party Congress. Expectations that Mr. Xi will move quickly to project confidence and commitment to reform are increasing.
Reuters has learned that Mr. Xi isseeking an ambitious economic reform agendaand canvassing advisers nationwide for ideas. The New York Times reported on Monday that Mr. Xi might be working on a reform agenda that goes beyond economics. And Chinese state media hasrecently run a series of articles calling for continued reform. That said, any political reform will not be toward liberal, Western democracy, and we should avoid the trap of looking for "China's Gorbachev".
Hu Jintao was thought to be a reformer too, although 10 years ago there was not the sense of impending crisis among the elite that there is today. The obstacles to deepening reform are significant, substantive changes will take time, and Mr. Xi and his administration may well fail, but there is at least a little more hope for change in Beijing than I have sensed in a long time. 
Calling for the coming crash of China may be popular, but predicting the coming muddle-through is probably more accurate.

HEADLINE: The "Uncertainty" Scam

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's not about Obama. 

 BODY:
One of the central talking points of right-wing economists is that "uncertainty" caused by Obama is holding the economy back; they cite, again and again, a paper by Bloom et al purporting to find a relationship between uncertainty and jobs, with uncertainty measured via such things as article counts.
But what's driving that uncertainty index? Jan Hatzius and his team at Goldman have an analysis, cited by FT Alphaville, pointing out something that I thought I knew, but with much more clarity: it's not at all about Obama.
Here's my key graph from the Hatzius paper:
For the most part, "uncertainty" seems to reflect the fact that the economy is weak. Not surprising: while economists may define uncertainty in terms of second moments, most people use the term to mean fear that things could get worse.
Now, there is a spike in uncertainty in mid-2011. And we know what that's about: the confrontation over the debt ceiling. There's also some correlation between the Bloom uncertainty index and troubles in Europe.
So think about it: even if you accept the Bloom et al paper as gospel (which you shouldn't), what it's really saying is that the US economy is being held back by Republican extremism, by the GOP's unprecedented willingness to hold the full faith and credit of American hostage for political gain. It is not, repeat not, about Obama looking at rich people funny.

HEADLINE: Farallon Capital's Founder To Step Down This Year

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Another hedge fund is preparing to move onto life beyond its founder, as Farallon Capital announced on Monday that its senior managing member, Thomas F. Steyer, will leave the firm at year-end. 

 BODY:
Another one of the world's biggest hedge funds is preparing for life beyond its founder.
Farallon Capital Management announced on Monday that its senior managing member, Thomas F. Steyer, would leave the firm at the end of the year.
Mr. Steyer, who managed a $20 billion investment firm, is part of a group of hedge fund executives who have started firms from scratch and built large-scale global operations with billions of dollars under management. They now wield influence over Wall Street and the global economy. As they have grown older - and ever richer - they are passing the baton to successors.
Mr. Steyer, 55, made clear that his separation would be final. He will have no official role or responsibilities at Farallon, and his partners will buy out his interest in the share of the hedge fund's profits.
"The announcement is the natural next step, is accepted internally and won't change our mode of operation," Mr. Steyer wrote in a letter to his investors. "The playbook won't change when I leave."
Andrew J. M. Spokes, who has been running Farallon alongside Mr. Steyer, will take the reins.
Because hedge fund firms are so often closely identified with a particular individual, transitions can be rocky. Last year, for instance, Shumway Capital Partners was forced to close after its founder, Chris Shumway, left, even though he had put the fund in the hands of a lieutenant.
But at other big funds, transitions have been smooth. Bruce Kovner of Caxton Associates left the firm last year in the hands of his chief investment officer, Andrew E. Law. And David E. Shaw of D. E. Shaw & Company has passed on management responsibilities to a committee of executives.
Still others, like George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, have decided to leave the business of managing other people's money, closing their funds to outside investors but remaining active in the sector by managing their own fortunes.
Though well known on Wall Street trading floors, Mr. Steyer has mostly operated outside the spotlight. His low profile has been by design and is largely a function of Farallon's being based in San Francisco, known more as a technology hub than a financial center.
Mr. Steyer, a New York City native, graduated from Yale University, where he played varsity soccer, and from Stanford Business School. He joined Goldman Sachs and trained under Robert E. Rubin on the bank's storied risk arbitrage desk alongside other future hedge fund billionaires like Edward S. Lampert and Daniel S. Och.
He started his own firm in 1986, receiving the initial backing from F. Warren Hellman, a co-founder of the San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, who died last year.
Farallon takes its name from a group of islands off the coast of San Francisco.
The fund, which at its peak in 2008 had $37 billion in assets before being buffeted by the financial crisis, has returned about 13.4 percent over its history. Farallon is up about 9.5 percent this year.
In recent years Mr. Steyer has taken on a more public role, becoming a force in California Democratic politics. In 2010, he helped defeat a ballot initiative to repeal California's global warming law, and this year he has donated more than $20 million to support a measure that would close a corporate-tax loophole in the state.
He has also been a major fund-raiser for President Obama.
He and his wife, Kat Taylor, founded One PacificCoast Bank, a community lender based in Oakland that provides capital for small businesses. Mr. Steyer spoke this summer at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., delivering a six-minute speech on energy policy.
Such moves have fueled speculation of a political career for Mr. Steyer, perhaps even a bid for governor of California.
"I want my life to revolve around service in one form or another," Mr. Steyer wrote in his letter on Monday, "including continuing participation in our community bank, in encouraging the advanced energy economy and in specific policy initiatives here in California."
An earlier headline on this article rendered incorrectly the name of the hedge fund. It is s Farallon Capital, not Farrallon.

HEADLINE: Foreign Policy Debate Puts Focus on Leadership

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A debate centering on international affairs may offer a window on the candidates' leadership skills. 

 BODY:
For 90 minutes tonight, President Obama and Mitt Romney will clash over specific foreign policy issues, their differences heightened by a debate intended to draw out sharp contrasts ahead of Election Day in two weeks.
But for viewers, the specifics may be mostly background noise as they search for the answer to a gauzy question: Who would be the best leader?
In polls this year, voters have practically screamed at the top of their lungs how little they care about foreign policy. In recent polls of three battleground states, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, fewer than 10 percent of voters in each state said national security was the most important issue to them, ranking below the economy, deficit and health care. 
And yet, both campaigns have spent plenty of time and money in an effort to claim the mantle of who is best able to lead. Top strategists for both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama seem to believe that foreign policy will help shape those perceptions.
In a strategy memorandum released by the Democratic campaign on Monday, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, argues that Mr. Obama has proved to be a "steady and strong leader" around the world. He accuses Mr. Romney of "endless bluster and a record of dangerous blunders" in foreign affairs.
"He is an extreme and expedient candidate who lacks the judgment and vision so vital for the Oval Office," Mr. Kerry wrote of Mr. Romney. "And he's at the top of the most inexperienced foreign policy ticket to run for president and vice president in decades."
Mr. Romney's campaign countered with a memo of its own, arguing that at the end of Mr. Obama's four years in office, "America stands weakened around the world, with our safety threatened, our allies increasingly isolated, and hostile nations emboldened." The campaign added, "As president, Mitt Romney will deliver where President Obama has failed."
In recent weeks, Mr. Romney and his top surrogates have seized on the killing of the American ambassador in Libya and other developments in the Middle East as evidence of a broader leadership failure on the president's part. Mr. Romney fumbled his efforts to make that broader case in his second debate with Mr. Obama last week.
In that exchange, Mr. Romney's argument about leadership became caught up in his specific assertion about whether the president had called the attacks "terrorism." Now, the Republican candidate will get another chance to make the larger case.
Mr. Obama's advisers have long believed that the president's success in making good on some crucial promises -- leaving Iraq, winding down in Afghanistan and killing Osama bin Laden -- has earned him broad support when it comes to foreign policy leadership.
"Presidential elections are about character and the character of your convictions, and my guy, he never tells you anything he doesn't mean and he doesn't do," Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said at a rally over the weekend in Florida.
Surveys suggest that Mr. Obama remains strong on foreign policy -- to a point. Even as Mr. Romney has been hammering the president on Libya policy, for example, voters in many polls still give Mr. Obama the edge on handling foreign policy matters.
A Quinnipiac University / CBS News poll of voters in Ohio released Monday gives Mr. Obama a seven-point edge over Mr. Romney on that question.
But Mr. Romney does better on the broader question of leadership. In the same survey, Ohio voters gave Mr. Romney the edge when asked whether they view the candidates as strong leaders. Tonight's debate could be an opportunity for Mr. Romney to further widen that gap.
To do that, Mr. Romney will have to find a way to connect his specific criticism of what he calls Mr. Obama's "feckless" foreign policy to a bigger critique of the president's ability to lead on the world stage.
On some crucial foreign policy issues, Mr. Romney's own positions are different more in tone than substance from Mr. Obama's. But Mr. Romney is likely to focus on the continuing standoff with Iran over its nuclear program, the continuing stalemate over peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and the growing security and economic tensions with Russia and China.
The president's challenge is to defend his own record while broadly questioning Mr. Romney's capacity to lead in a complex world. In his Monday memo, Mr. Kerry wrote that a failure by Mr. Romney to answer those concerns would convince people that he has "fallen short of the Commander-in-Chief threshold."
In the past, Mr. Obama has sought to undercut perceptions of his rival's leadership qualities by tying him to the policies of President George W. Bush, and by suggesting that Mr. Romney will undo any progress made during the last four years.
The president's campaign previewed that theme in a new television commercial it released Monday. The commercial claims that Mr. Romney would have left American troops in Iraq and opposes a responsible drawdown of the conflict in Afghanistan.
"President Obama ended the Iraq war. Mitt Romney would have left 30,000 troops there and called bringing them home 'tragic,'" the ad says. "It's time to stop fighting over there and start rebuilding over here."

HEADLINE: Wedded Bliss Trumps Financial Collapse

BYLINE: VIVIAN YEE


HIGHLIGHT: The couple who married at 383 Madison Avenue had a past there, working for the now-defunct Bear Stearns. 

 BODY:
The vast glass and marble lobby of the former Bear Stearns building at 383 Madison Avenue has seen its share of celebration and woe. Between the building's construction in 2001 and the bank's 2008 collapse, it held Christmas parties, executive functions, even an appearance by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In 2008, employees stripped of jobs and pensions left gallows-humor graffiti on a portrait of the bank's former chief executive.
But on Saturday, 383 - as Bear Stearns employees used to call it - played host to a new kind of Bear event: a merger of the nuptial variety between two former employees who had met there.
For the couple, Leigh Holliday, 40, and Justin Brannan, 34, Bear was the place that took them in despite their artists' backgrounds, unconventional personas and lack of Ivy League degrees. It was where they met, on the 36th floor, Mr. Brannan delivering logo umbrellas for his boss to Ms. Holliday's boss (they now have matching umbrella tattoos). Finally, it was where they married, under the soft blue glow of the stock tickers. 
"We knew no one had ever gotten married there before but it didn't matter - we had to try," said Mr. Brannan, a touring punk musician in his pre-Bear days who now runs an art school for children in Brooklyn with Ms. Holliday and is an aide to a city councilman. They called Alan Greenberg, the bank's longtime chairman, who is known as Ace. "He was like, 'We'll take care of it,' and then hung up," Mr. Brannan recalled.
On Saturday, bagpipers from Mr. Brannan's high school in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, led Ms. Holliday, wearing a long white gown and accompanied by her mother, through the revolving doors at 47th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue to the other end of the lobby. 
The officiant, Frank Seddio, chairman of Brooklyn's Democratic Party, slipped in a wisecrack or two before getting on to the traditional vows. "This is an interesting location for a wedding, as you might know," he told the guests. "I guess we can say that something really good did come" out of Bear Stearns's collapse, he added, drawing laughs.
Those who had thought the setting was a little odd found themselves converts by the ceremony's end.
"My first thought was, fantastic!" said the bride's mother, Georgia Holliday. "Then I said, 'Wait a minute, whoever gets married in the lobby of a financial institution?' " But when she realized how much Bear Stearns had meant to the couple, she decided, "Maybe it's meant to be."
Ms. Holliday studied art at Corcoran College of Art and Design and came to Bear Stearns after a stint at a Dutch investment bank, ending up as a project manager in the corporate real estate division. Mr. Brannan had been a temp at several banks in between touring with his hard-core band, Most Precious Blood. At Bear Stearns, he was hired to clerk for several hedge fund managers.
In the budding days of their romance, they wrote words backward in their e-mails to evade compliance officers. ("Little did we know, I think compliance had their hands full at that time and they probably weren't all that concerned with our sweetheart e-mails," Mr. Brannan said.) Their first date was at the fragrance counter at Saks Fifth Avenue. Later on, they met in the shampoo aisle of a pharmacy near Grand Central Terminal to kiss. And on New Year's Eve last year, Mr. Brannan proposed at their art school in Bay Ridge, the Art Room.
When Bear Stearns collapsed, both were asked to join the transition team for the merger with JPMorgan Chase. Ms. Holliday stayed for a year; Mr. Brannan decided that it was time to move on and he began working as a charity fund-raiser. Now, in addition to co-running the art school, he is also the communications director for City Councilman Vincent J. Gentile. 
One guest, Jim Lang, a former managing director of Ms. Holliday's division, found the location particularly poignant. He had overseen the building's development and construction, then lost most of his pension in the collapse.
"The security guard was saying it's such a great building," Mr. Lang said later at the reception, held at Fornino in Park Slope. "It's a shame Bear's gone, but the building is there."
At 383, the security guard in question, Anthony Ortiz, who has worked for JPMorgan for more than a decade, beamed as he watched the bride and groom emerge onto Vanderbilt Avenue. 
"To me, it means a lot," he said. "I think it's great."

HEADLINE: Referendum or Choice, Which Candidate Will Show Fighting Spirit?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: In the final debate, President Obama and Mitt Romney can tweak perceptions in what is a very even race. 

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom about this presidential election, which this blog often endorsed, is that it represented a competition between two competing paradigms. 
Mitt Romney, this theory held, would seek to make the election a referendum on President Obama's performance -- hoping that voters' dissatisfaction with the direction of the country in general, and the economy in particular, would lead them to vote him out of office, almost regardless of what the alternative was.
Mr. Obama, it was thought, would seek to frame the election as a choice -- defeating Mr. Romney on the basis of his own superior favorability ratings and, perhaps, his strong oratorical and campaigning skills.
Like any theory, this one was an oversimplification: every election is both a referendum and a choice to some degree. But the election mostly played to form in the spring and summer.
Then came the two defining events of the campaign -- and both went against type.
At their convention in Charlotte, N.C., Democrats -- especially former President Bill Clinton and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- gave a vigorous defense of Mr. Obama's performance in office. Although Democrats also took opportunities to tweak Mr. Romney, the gain Mr. Obama made in head-to-head polls after the convention seemed most to be driven by increased voter satisfaction with his performance. 
Mr. Obama's approval ratings improved, rising to about 49 percent, where they remain today -- probably just enough to make an incumbent the favorite given a strong turnout. Voter perceptions about the economy, including the consumer confidence numbers, also improved.
Then came the first presidential debate, in Denver. Mr. Romney, for the first time, had the chance to share a stage with the president -- and based on the postdebate polls, he defeated Mr. Obama soundly. 
While Mr. Romney critiqued Mr. Obama's performance in office at the debate, he also articulated his own vision for the country -- in a clearer way, probably, than he had at his own convention in Tampa, Fla. 
Mr. Romney's favorability ratings shot up after the debate -- to the point that they are now net-positive in most surveys and often the equal of Mr. Obama's. And Mr. Romney has gained in the head-to-head polls to make the presidential race very close, even as Mr. Obama's approval ratings and favorability numbers held steady.
In Charlotte, in other words, Mr. Obama demonstrated that perhaps he could win a referendum election after all. And in Denver, Mr. Romney showed that he would have a fighting chance even if voters saw the election as a clash of personalities.
So what does this mean for the final debate, on Monday night in Boca Raton, Fla.?
To the extent that foreign policy gives the commander in chief a home-court advantage, the timbre of the debate is probably more up to Mr. Obama. He could tout his own foreign policy accomplishments, which voters tend to rate more highly than his handling of economic affairs. Or he could seek to draw sharper contrasts with Mr. Romney, perhaps hoping to convince voters that Mr. Romney is unready for office.
But so far this year, in both primary and general election debates, the best defense has often been a good offense. Mr. Obama made the mistake in Denver of seeming too willing to rest on his laurels, and what was then a four- or five-point lead in head-to-head polls. What might have seemed like presidential composure in the briefing room came across as aloofness and even disinterestedness in the debate hall. 
Even if Mr. Obama thinks he can win a referendum election -- and he possibly can -- he will need to engage his opponent and show some fighting spirit.
Mr. Romney's calibration of these moods may be a little different, because his worst moments in the debates have tended to be characterized by his being hot-tempered. Still, Mr. Romney seems to trail Mr. Obama just slightly in the most important swing states, meaning that Mr. Romney will not necessarily benefit from playing the debate to a draw.

HEADLINE: The Foreign Policy Debate

BYLINE: DAVID C. UNGER


HIGHLIGHT: Ten issues that President Obama and Mitt Romney should address at tonight's debate. 

 BODY:
Here are ten foreign policy issues that President Obama and Mitt Romney should discuss at tonight's debate.
1. Afghanistan end game. Both candidates more or less agree on a 2014 withdrawal. They should explain what we can gain by staying two more years instead of packing up now, and what they will do to protect American security interests in Afghanistan after U.S. troops are gone.
2. Arab spring. What, exactly, is America's role in shaping the new Middle East? As the old autocratic order comes under attack from a wide variety of opponents, how can the United States best encourage democracy while protecting vital national interests?

3. Iran nukes. Both candidates have said Iran cannot be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Is that still a realistic position? If so, what economic or military measures could guarantee that Iran never builds a nuclear bomb?
4. Drones. What are the legal and constitutional ground rules for using armed drones to target and kill people in countries the U.S. is not at war with, and whose governments have not consented to such attacks? Is there any practical alternative to making the White House or the executive branch the sole judge, jury and executioner in such cases?
5. China. China sees the Pentagon's pivot to the Pacific as a military challenge to Beijing's legitimate rise to regional power. How can the U.S. convey that this repositioning of U.S. naval and other forces is not an effort to contain China in the same way America once sought to contain the Soviet Union?
6. Russia. Despite President Obama's efforts to reset the U.S. relationship with Russia, President Putin has thrown out the USAID office, terminated Nunn-Lugar aid for securing nuclear material and helped the Assad regime prolong the bloodbath in Syria. Has the reset failed? What should the U.S. do now?
7. Israel-Palestine. Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians are frozen. Does the U.S. have any role to play in fostering a negotiated peace between Israel and the Palestinians? If so, how should the U.S. go about breaking the current stalemate?
8. NATO. European NATO partners' military effectiveness in Afghanistan was limited by unrealistically restrictive rules of engagement. In Libya, it was limited by years of under-investment in specialized equipment. Yet under pressure from the economic crisis, virtually all of our European NATO allies are further cutting back on military spending and investment, leaving it to the U.S. to pick up the slack. What future does NATO have if such trends continue, and can the U.S. reverse them?
9. Military budget. Both candidates want to reduce the deficit. But with more than half of all federal discretionary spending going to national security, how can that be done without big cuts in military spending?
10. Global climate change. Slowing the rapid increase in greenhouse gas emissions predicted for the next few decades will require international agreement. No one country, including the U.S., can manage this on its own. How can the U.S. achieve fair, realistic and enforceable international agreements in this area?

 11:38 P.M. | Report From Spin Alley 
Oh dear. Your spin-alley correspondent has emerged from the elbow-throwing, toe-crushing mosh pit of several hundred reporters and 40 or so Democratic and Republican officials, but he's forgotten who said what. He had his voice recorder, but they all sound so much alike, give or take a party affiliation. Please help him match the names after each letter to the words following the numbers. Feel free to print out and draw arrows between spinner and spin.
A. Ed Gillespie, senior adviser to Mr. Romney.
B. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.
C. Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager.
D. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts.
E. David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama.
F. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah
No. 1. "I thought Mitt Romney was pitch perfect when it came to intertwining the role of the economy as it relates to foreign policy and sharing a vision of the world, rather than prosecuting the intimate details of what happened or didn't' happen in Benghazi."
No. 2. "You saw a strong and decisive president; you saw a wrong and reckless Romney, on defense the entire evening, looking unsteady. I thought it was a great performance by the president."
No. 3. "The game Battleship came up in there. I think the president sank his battleship tonight. He didn't have enough binders on foreign policy, folks."
No. 4. "When polls were irrationally exuberant, I said the race was going to be a close race. We won with 53 percent of the vote last time with all the wind at our back, and this was going to be a closer race. This race is basically the race we expected."
No. 5. "In many respects I thought the roles were reversed: you saw Barack Obama look more like a challenger who was behind, because of his attacks. And Governor Romney was calmer, more thoughtful, acting as though he was the incumbent president."
No. 6. "I think the momentum continues tonight as the American people see Mitt Romney directly for themselves."
- Trip Gabriel 
 11:30 P.M. | Fact-Check: Bilateral Talks With Iran 
Mr. Obama said on Monday that a front-page report in The New York Times on Sunday was "not true," that the United States and Iran have not agreed to meet after the American election, in one-on-one talks over the Iranian nuclear program. 
But a few minutes later, after declaring that Mr. Romney was "all over the map" on foreign policy, Mr. Obama said to him, "I'm pleased that you are now endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program."
The Times, citing senior administration officials, reported that the United States and Iran had an "agreement in principle" for one-on-one talks after the election. But the article said it was not clear if the plan had been approved by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Nor did it did say the two sides had agreed on a date or an agenda for those negotiations.
On the latter point, the article pointed out that there remained a substantial disagreement: the United States wants to keep the talks narrowly focused on the nuclear program; Iran wants to broaden them to include regional issues like Syria and Bahrain.
News of this diplomatic initiative, two weeks before the election, poses significant political risks for Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney has accused the president of appeasing foes like Iran and of allowing ties with a close ally, Israel, to fray. Mr. Romney has said he would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel against the nuclear threat from Iran.
For Mr. Romney, the prospect of direct talks poses a different problem. He has publicly declared that Iran must cease all enrichment of uranium. Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes, is almost certain to reject that demand. If Mr. Romney were elected, that could doom the one-on-one talks before they could even start.
- Mark Landler 
 11:19 P.M. | Fact-Check: Trade War With China 
Mr. Romney said that the United States was currently engaged in an unacknowledged trade war with China - and that China was winning, as evidenced by its trade imbalance with the United States. Many economists agree that what is happening now are skirmishes on the sidelines, not a full-scale trade war in which both sides lose heavily.
Trade experts say that perhaps 90 percent of trade between the United States and China is unaffected by the current trade disputes. In fact, the United States and China are much more economically interdependent than any listener to these three debates might think. In today's multinational supply chain, both imports and exports support American jobs, according to trade experts like Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington that focuses on libertarian issues.
A of one fifth-generation iPod showed how the trade deficit figure can be misleading. For every $300 iPod that was sold in the United States, the study said, the trade deficit with China rose by $150, the factory cost. But in fact, China probably only added a few dollars to the product's value because companies headquartered in Japan, the United States and elsewhere made the high-value components while China only assembled them.
A study a year ago by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco argued that despite China's export juggernaut, Americans still buy American. It concluded that 88.5 percent of the goods and services purchased by ordinary Americans were produced in the United States. Chinese products accounted for only 2.7 percent of personal consumption expenditures in the United States.
- Sharon LaFraniere 
 11:00 P.M. | Fact-Check: On the Side of Democracy 
Mr. Obama spoke of the role the United States has played during the Arab Spring uprisings, saying, "We have stood on the side of democracy." But that is not true across the board.
Consider Bahrain, where thousands of people rose up more than a year ago to demand political liberties, social equality and an end to corruption. Its Sunni monarchy, seen by the United States and Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally and as a bulwark against Iran, was never left to face the rage on its own.
More than a thousand Saudi troops helped put down the uprising, and the United States, a sometimes critical but ultimately unshakable friend, called for political reform but strengthened its support for the government.
- Michael Cooper 
 10:56 P.M. | Fact-Check: Drawing 'Red Lines' on Iran 
At some points in the campaign, there has been a clear difference in where Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney would draw a "red line'' beyond which they would not let Iran go toward a nuclear weapon. But more often than not, it has been more like a red smudge, giving both candidates maximum flexibility, while each tries to sound more determined to stop the Iranian program.
Mr. Obama's position has been the most consistent. He has said consistently that Iran would not be permitted to get a nuclear weapon. But when pressed about whether the United States would block Iran from getting a weapons "capability" - that is, to obtain the fuel and technology to stop just short of obtaining a weapon - he said, "I'm not going to parse that." And he hasn't.
Mr. Romney, in contrast, has parsed it - but inconsistently. He usually says he will not allow Iran to have the capability, or to be, as his aides put it, just a few screwdriver turns away from a bomb. But in an interview last month with George Stephanopoulos of ABC, Mr. Romney forgot his own position and made it sound as if he and Mr. Obama were on the same page. A few days later he went back to his old formulation.
It sounds like a small difference, but it is a huge one - technologically and politically. Many experts believe Iran only intends to go up to the line of a weapon, stopping a step or two short. That would enable it to stay inside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which it is a signatory. And it would make it harder for Israel, or the United States, to mount an attack that gained global support. Moreover, a "capability" may be all Iran needs, in a world where a virtual bomb brings with it almost as much symbolic power as a real one.
But Mr. Obama is being vague for a reason. "He doesn't want to agree to a certain amount of uranium, or a certain deadline, that triggers a war," one of his aides said last month. "He needs room to resolve this peacefully."
- David E. Sanger 
 10:58 P.M. | Fact-Check: Trade Cases Against China 
President Obama said, "We have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other - the previous administration had done in two terms." It is true that the Obama administration has brought eight cases against China in the past four years - an average of two a year - before the World Trade Organization.
The tariff on Chinese-made tires, imposed unilaterally by the Commerce Department, makes nine challenges. In eight years under President George W. Bush, the United States brought seven cases - or an average of one a year since China joined the World Trade Organization.
But Dan Ikenson, a trade expert with the Cato Institute, a nonprofit research group in Washington that focuses on libertarian causes, said the president's claim was "somewhat bogus" because China was granted a kind of honeymoon after it joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001 in recognition of all the effort it had to make to rewrite laws and regulations. "Now we are at a different stage of our relationship," Mr. Ikenson says. That has led to increasing demands that China practice fair trade, he and other trade experts contend.
- Sharon LaFraniere 
 10:53 P.M. | Fact-Check: 'Obamacare' and Military Spending 
When Mr. Romney was asked how he would find the money to pay for the increased military spending he seeks, he said: "We do it by getting - by reducing spending in a whole series of programs. By the way, No. 1 I get rid of is 'Obamacare.' " But repealing the health care law would actually increase the federal deficit.
This summer, after Republicans in the House of Representative passed a bill to repeal the law, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would increase the federal deficit by $109 billion over the next decade. That is because the parts of the law that would require more spending to expand coverage would be offset by the parts of the law that raise new revenues and curb spending - including provisions calling to curb the growth of Medicare costs and several new taxes and fees. Repealing the law would also mean that 30 million fewer people would have health insurance in 2022, it projected.
- Michael Cooper 
 10:51 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney Investments and Outsourcing 
 Mr. Obama accused Mr. Romney of investing in companies that shipped jobs overseas. Is this true?
 In short, yes. Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mr. Romney founded and whose funds remain a big part of his portfolio, has invested over the years in a variety of companies that moved jobs overseas, as detailed in a Washington Post article that ran this summer. 
The attack line Mr. Obama used in the debate is actually a tweak of a stronger one the Obama campaign had previously used against Mr. Romney, accusing him of being more directly involved in shipping jobs to Asia and elsewhere through Bain, as opposed to being a mere passive investor. 
Fact-checkers, including Politifact.com, FactCheck.org and The Washington Post's Fact Checker column, had questioned the more direct line of attack on outsourcing, because most of the companies cited by the Obama campaign were investments that occurred after Mr. Romney had left day-to-day management of Bain in 1999 to run the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Mr. Romney was indisputably involved with at least one Bain-owned company that outsourced jobs overseas - to China, in particular - the Holson Burnes Group, a picture frame and photo album manufacturer that Bain owned from 1987 to 1995. But FactCheck.org, which examined the issue, pointed out that it is unclear whether the company's outsourcing increased or decreased under Bain, or if the manufacturing overseas came at the expense of American jobs. 
The question of whether Bain Capital ever invested in such companies, with Mr. Romney benefiting as an investor, is a much less controversial one. Besides the companies mentioned in the Washington Post article, a recent New York Times article highlighted another example: an auto parts manufacturer, Asimco Technologies, shut down two camshaft factories in Michigan and went on to make the same parts in China.

 10:50 P.M. | Fact-Check: Fund-raisers in Israel 
After Mr. Romney complained that Mr. Obama had not visited Israel during a trip to the region, Mr. Obama responded by contrasting the trip he took to Israel as a candidate with the one that Mr. Romney took as a candidate.
Mr. Obama said: "when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors. I didn't attend fund-raisers. I went to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable."
He was alluding to Mr. Romney's remarks this summer at a fund-raiser in Israel, where he offended Palestinian leaders by suggesting that cultural differences explain why the Israelis are so much more economically successful than Palestinians. The remarks drew strong rebukes from Palestinians who noted that Mr. Romney had failed to mention the years of trade restrictions imposed by Israel.
Mr. Romney was speaking at a fund-raiser with prominent Jewish-American backers in July when he mentioned that he had been influenced by "The Wealth and Poverty of Nations," by David S. Landes, which argues that culture is the defining factor in determining the success of a society.
"Culture makes all the difference," Mr. Romney said. "And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things."
He added: "As you come here and you see the G.D.P. per capita, for instance, in Israel, which is about $21,000, and compare that with the G.D.P. per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality. And that is also between other countries that are near or next to each other. Chile and Ecuador, Mexico and the United States."
In fact, the share of the gross domestic product per capita in the West Bank was estimated to be $2,900 in 2008, the most recent year available, according to the . Israel's has been about 10 times as high in recent years, according to the agency. The agency said that in the West Bank, "Israeli closure policies continue to disrupt labor and trade flows, industrial capacity, and basic commerce, eroding the productive capacity of the West Bank economy."
Mr. Romney's remarks, which were first reported by The Associated Press, drew a swift rejoinder from Palestinian leaders. Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, told the news agency that "it is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation."

 10:40 P.M. | Auto Bailout Accusations 
If there's one thing that gets Mr. Romney angry, it's being accused of wanting to let the American auto industry go bankrupt.
After Mr. Obama repeated the accusation, Mr. Romney insisted on a retort.
"Never," he said, describing himself as a "son of Detroit."
He insisted that he supported a "managed bankruptcy" and said that what ended up happening is what he called for.
Mr. Obama would not let the comments pass. He insisted that "you keep on trying to airbrush history."
The president insisted that Mr. Romney would not have provided government assistance to the auto companies, which the vast majority of economists say would have meant the companies would have had to liquidate.
"You said they could get it in the private sector," Mr. Obama said, noting that it would never have happened that way.
Mr. Obama said the fact-checkers would quickly check out who was right, a point that Mr. Romney agreed upon.
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:39 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney Position on Troops in Afghanistan 
Has Romney changed his view on an Afghan withdrawal and timeline? Yes, about an hour into the debate, Mr. Romney seemed to tweak his long-held position on Afghan troop withdrawals.
In the past, he has said that while he wanted to follow the same 2014 withdrawal timeline as the Obama administration and NATO allies, he would seek the advice of military commanders on the ground before making a decision. This prompted critics to suggest that Mr. Romney was giving himself wiggle room to keep regular combat brigades in Afghanistan past 2014. (Both the Obama administration and the Romney campaign have talked about keeping a small residual force, presumably of special operations forces and military trainers, after 2014 - if the government of Afghanistan allows it.)
But Monday night, Mr. Romney seemed to draw a much clearer line that he would take all regular combat troops out of Afghanistan by 2014 - without the caveat of first asking military commanders whether they believed that was a good idea.
In response to a question about whether he would withdraw troops even if it were obvious that the Afghans were not able to handle their own security, Mr. Romney said, "We're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014."
He made no mention of first getting input from military commanders, as he has in the past in response to similar questions. "We're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014, so our troops will come home at that point," Mr. Romney said.

 10:37 P.M. | Fact-Check: A 'Pivot' to the Pacific 
Mr. Obama spoke of his administration's "pivot" to the Pacific, but Mr. Romney's defense advisers say that President Obama's plan to shift from a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan and move national security resources toward Asia and the Pacific - read, China - is rhetorical flourish, not real policy. "The so-called pivot is hollow," Roger Zakheim, one of Mr. Romney's defense advisers, told reporters earlier this month. But is it? 
An initial glance shows that the United States is hardly defenseless in the region. Right now some 325,000 American military and civilian personnel are assigned to the region, including 40,000 in Japan and 28,500 in South Korea. The Navy has 180 ships and 2,000 aircraft in the area; the Air Force has roughly 300 planes and 40,000 airmen at nine bases.
As part of the "pivot," the Pentagon is deploying only a relative handful of additional forces - 2,500 Marines for six months of the year to train with the Australian Defense Force - but they are based in Darwin, China's strategic backyard.
The Pentagon is also increasing its naval presence in the region to 60 percent of its fleet from the 50 percent that has been there until now. Even before the administration announced what it calls its rebalancing toward the region, the Pentagon had responded to China's increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea by stepping up investments in a range of weapons, jet fighters and technology, including in a new generation of electronic jammers for the Navy designed to thwart a missile from finding and hitting a target. The jammers would be a safeguard against China's development of antiship ballistic missiles, potentially capable of hitting an American aircraft carrier in the Pacific.
Despite the Obama administration's assertions that its rebalancing is real, an independent review of the pivot has been critical of the Pentagon, saying it has not sufficiently explained how the government would sharpen its focus in the region. The review, released in August by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan policy institute in Washington, found that the Defense Department "has not adequately articulated the strategy behind its force posture planning, nor aligned the strategy with resources in a way that reflects current budget realities."
The review called for one or more additional nuclear attack submarines in Guam, the deployment of more Marines in the region and the bolstering of missile defense systems.
As part of his focus on Asia, Mr. Romney would build more military ships - 15 a year to Mr. Obama's 9 or 10 - although he has not provided a detailed explanation of how he would pay for them beyond substantially increasing the defense budget. Of those 15 ships, Mr. Romeny would like three to be submarines. A Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine costs more than $2 billion.
In the midst of all the charges and countercharges, it is important to remember that China is not equipped to mount a frontal military challenge to the United States. China's total military budget in 2010 was an estimated $160 billion - roughly a tripling since the 1990s. By comparison, the Pentagon spent more than $500 billion in 2010, or closer to $700 billion if the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are included. Although the estimated 1.25 million ground troops of the People's Liberation Army make it the largest in the world (there are about 750,000 active-duty United States Army soldiers and Marines), there is a vast difference in training and ability.
Still, nearly all of China's spending is Asia-focused while only a portion of American defense spending is. And in lessons learned from the Soviet Union, American defense officials say the Chinese are not trying to compete comprehensively with the United States, but "asymmetrically," where they have an advantage - the Pacific.

 10:31 P.M. | Fact-Check: The Case of China and Cheap Tires 
President Obama again brought up the tire case, saying that China was flooding the United States with cheap tires and that he put a stop to it and saved jobs. But in fact, many economists criticize the administration's action.
In 2009, the Obama administration unilaterally imposed a duty on imports of Chinese tires - a move sought by the United Steelworkers union. It was one of nine trade enforcement actions taken by the United States against China under President Obama and, some economists argue, the most questionable. The tariff protected 1,200 American jobs, at most, according to a study by Gary Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But the same study found that the tariff cost American consumers $1.1 billion last year alone in higher-priced tires - or about $900,000 per job. Moreover, China responded by slapping tariffs on imports of American chicken parts that cost American poultry producers an estimated $1 billion in lost sales. Last month, the Obama administration let the tire tariff quietly expire. Critics argue that is because it was a lose-lose scenario for the United States.

 10:29 P.M. | Fact-Check: Mission Creep in Libya 
Mr. Obama noted more than once that Mr. Romney had called the Obama administration's intervention in Libya "mission creep" and "mission muddle." Here, Mr. Romney can make a strong case.
When NATO and the Arab League went into Libya in 2011, it was to protect the population against the forces of Muammar el-Qadaffi, which were promising to hunt down Mr. Qaddafi's opponents "like rats." But nowhere was regime change - deposing Mr. Qaddafi - an explicit, agreed-upon goal. It became a de facto one: NATO officials said the population could not be secure if it thought Mr. Qaddafi would come back to power. Soon, they were chasing the leader around the Libyan desert.
Eventually he was found - pulled from a ditch and shot. Washington did not exactly protest. But while there was mission creep, whether the outcome was a "muddle'' depends on what the West intended. Mr. Obama made clear from the start that he did not plan to send in American ground troops or remain in Libya to try to shape the society. In fact, he stayed out - and Mr. Romney now argues that contributed to the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans at the consulate in Benghazi.
Mr. Obama pressed his case for removing Mr. Qaddafi from power. "Imagine if we had pulled out at that point," he said at the debate, noting that Mr. Qaddafi "had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:27 P.M. | On China, a Partner and an Adversary on Trade 
Mr. Romney went out of the way to praise China, saying that the largest country in the world wants "the economy to work and the world to be free and open."
But moments later, he once again vowed that, "On Day 1, I will label them a currency manipulator."
The dueling messages were apparently an effort to talk about China as a "partner" but also to say that it needs to follow trade rules that keep things fair.
"We can work with them. We can collaborate with them," Mr. Romney said.
That echoed what Mr. Obama said about China. He called the country "an adversary but also a potential partner in the international community if it is following the rules."
But Mr. Obama aggressively accused Mr. Romney of investing in companies that ship jobs to places like China and of opposing trade complaints about cheap Chinese tires being dumped in America.
"We put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America," Mr. Obama said. "Those workers don't feel that way. They feel as if they had an administration who was finally going to take them seriously."
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:27 P.M. | Fact-Check: 'Let Detroit Go Bankrupt'? 
Mr. Obama just stated that when Mr. Romney argued in late 2008 that Detroit auto companies should be denied a government bailout and instead turn to the private marketplace, no private financing was available. This is consistent with what auto executives have said. 
At the time Mr. Romney wrote his now infamous New York Times op-ed the financial markets had ground to a halt. It was November 2008, and there was little available liquidity for anyone seeking financing. There were certainly no financial institutions - not even Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's private equity firm - looking to invest to the tune of the $80 billion the car companies needed at the time.
No private companies would come to the industry's aid, and the only path through bankruptcy would have been Chapter 7 liquidation, not the more orderly Chapter 11 reorganization that the company ultimately followed, people inside and outside the car companies have said.
In fact, the task force asked Bain if it was interested in investing in General Motors' European operations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the discussions.
Bain declined, this person said, speaking anonymously to discuss private negotiations.
- Jeremy W. Peters 
 10:22 P.M. | Fact-Check: Troops on the Ground in Syria 
Mr. Romney said at the debate that "we don't want to have military involvement" in Syria. And with that statement, he essentially put himself in a place pretty close to where President Obama and Mr. Biden have been: that America's options are limited if putting ground troops into the country is off the table.
The essence of Mr. Romney's argument was that the Obama administration had acted too slowly, and given Russia a veto at the United Nations. But that veto - which the Russians have as a member of the Security Council - wasn't about taking military action against Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president who is clinging to power. It was about sanctions.
So in the end, the two sides seemed to come out in the same place: the only event that would prompt America to go into Syria was the need to secure its chemical weapons stockpiles. Anything short of that was not worth the risks.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:18 P.M. | Fact-Check: Leaving Afghanistan in 2014? 
Mr. Obama said at the debate that he wanted to "transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way." But when is the United States leaving? In every major conversation with the Afghans and the Pakistanis, American officials talk about their plans for an "enduring presence" of American troops - mostly behind high walls - who would stay in Afghanistan for years to come.
None of this is exactly a state secret. The opening paragraph of the White House on the summit meeting last May in Chicago among NATO nations in Afghanistan, for which the United States provides the lion's share of the troops, reads: "NATO Heads of State and Government agreed to an enduring partnership between NATO and Afghanistan that would last beyond the transition of full security responsibility for Afghanistan" from the international security force to Afghan forces.
"At the Chicago Summit, leaders reaffirmed this partnership, sending a clear message to the Afghan people that as they stand up to take responsibility for their own country, they will not stand alone," it said.
No one says, at least officially, how big that enduring force would be. But the internal estimates cited by American officials in recent interviews run from 10,000 to 15,000 troops. That would include a counterterrorism force, probably made up of special forces and training forces. They would be there to keep the Afghan security forces on track and to act as a trip wire to keep the Taliban from taking Kabul, if they ever threatened the capital again. It includes drone operators, so that the United States can keep patrolling the skies and, on occasion, launch missile attacks inside Pakistan or in Afghan territory.
And, least discussed of all, it includes bomb-search teams and other specialists to keep an eye on Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. There is no bigger concern inside the Obama administration than how to respond if a Pakistani weapon or nuclear material goes loose, and after a 2009 scare - when the White House briefly thought the Pakistani Taliban might have gotten nuclear material - President Obama has been insistent that the United States be in a position to respond quickly, according to interviews with current and former administration officials.
Of course, the "enduring presence" has not been agreed to yet by the Afghan government. It could fall apart, as a continuing presence in Iraq did. But many in the administration believe that President Karzai will have little choice, given the weakness of his own forces.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:17 P.M. | Israel as Our 'Greatest Ally' 
In this debate, Mr. Obama has been careful to describe Israel as "our greatest ally in the region." This is a change from his appearance on "60 Minutes" last month in which he described Israel as "one of our closest allies in the region." That was a characterization that Romney aides quickly attacked, arguing that it showed a lack of support and loyalty to Israel. But by mentioning twice Monday night that Israel is the closest friend of the United States in that region, Mr. Obama seems to be going out of his way to avoid describing Israel the way he did last month.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 10:15 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney's Bipartisan Success 
 Earlier in the debate, Mr. Romney said that bipartisan cooperation with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature allowed him as Massachusetts governor to balance the state's budget for four straight years and propel the state's schools to first in the nation on standardized tests. Many experts, however, say those claims are less than fully credible.
 Mr. Romney's assertion that he and the legislature came together to balance Massachusetts's budget omits the fact that the state constitution requires a balanced budget. And despite his statement that bipartisan cooperation with the legislature helped propel Massachusetts schools to first in the nation, most experts agree that the state's academic successes are rooted in school reform promoted a decade earlier by another Republican governor, William F. Weld.
 Mr. Romney did propose education reforms during his term as governor from 2003 to 2007. But by and large, they failed to become law. "I don't think he put any major effort into sweeping education legislation that would be his," said Paul Grogan, who as head of the Boston Foundation headed an education reform commission created by Mr. Romney. Asked what happened to the report that his commission produced, he replied: "Nothing much. It didn't go anywhere."

 10:13 P.M. | Fact-Check: 'Apology Tour' 
Mitt Romney stated that President Obama went on a foreign "apology tour." Is this true? News organizations have repeatedly found the claim that Mr. Obama has apologized for American values and principles to be inaccurate.
While Mr. Obama has admitted American failings at times - and, like President George W. Bush, has apologized for specific acts of American wrongdoing abroad - he has never explicitly apologized for American values or principles.
Republicans have sought to use a number of excerpts from Mr. Obama's speeches or interviews to make their case that he has. One of the most commonly used is a 2009 speech in France in which Mr. Obama said that "there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But critics typically ignore what Mr. Obama said next: "But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad." In other words, Mr. Obama was saying that the United States and Europe had at times each dealt unfairly with each other - he never said he was sorry for American values or diplomacy.
In February, Mr. Obama did apologize to the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, after American military personnel were involved in burning copies of the Koran, an episode that spawned violence throughout Afghanistan. But his expression of regret came after Marine Gen. John R. Allen, the American commander in Afghanistan, had already apologized. It also brought to mind the apology then-President Bush made in 2004 to King Abdullah of Jordan for abuses at Abu Ghraib prison.
In an interview in February with Fox News, Mr. Romney seemed to object to the Koran-burning apology, saying, "For us to be apologizing at a time like this is something which is very difficult for the American people to countenance."

 10:11 P.M. | Obama Responds to Romney on 'Apology Tour' 
There is almost nothing that makes Mr. Obama angrier than the accusation that he went on an "apology tour" early in his administration.
And Mr. Romney went there.
Responding the Mr. Obama's defense of his foreign policy in the region, Mr. Romney accused the president of taking "what I've called an apology tour."
Mr. Obama's eyes flashed with anger that was palpable. He said that nothing Mr. Romney said was true.
Mr. Obama said that the "apology tour" accusation was "probably the biggest whopper that has been told during the course of this campaign."
Mr. Romney refused to relent, saying that Mr. Obama had flown to the Middle East - and skipped a trip to Israel in the process.
He said the president told the world that "America had been dismissive and derisive." He looked at the president and said, "America has not dictated to other nations."
In response, Mr. Obama shot back that as a candidate, he had taken a trip to visit troops abroad, unlike Mr. Romney. He also said that he visited Israel - and its Holocaust museum - and noted that Mr. Romney had met with donors in Israel.
The president also described visiting an Israeli border town that suffered repeated missile attacks from terrorists.
"That's how I've used my travels," the president said. "The central question st this point is going to be who is going to be credible to all parties involved?"
- Michael D. Shear 
 10:05 P.M. | Fact-Check: Sanctions on Iran 
Mr. Obama has a lot of history on his side with his assertion that Iran's economy is being crippled by sanctions imposed over the past few years and that Iran's oil sales have plummeted. Mr. Romney called for tightening them more. [#x2028]
"We put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever," Mr. Obama said. 
Until Mr. Obama came to office, the United Nations sanctions on Iran were pretty ineffective. There were travel bans on some scientists linked to the missile and nuclear programs, and restrictions on some banks. Sales of sensitive equipment were blocked. But the sanctions did not go after the heart of the Iranian economy: oil sales. Mr. Obama toughened them, step by step, making it hard for Iran to get access to dollars, to get international loans and even to deliver oil. He pressed some of Iran's biggest customers to buy oil elsewhere. Even today, scores of loaded Iranian oil tankers are bobbing off the country's coast, with nowhere to go.
[#x2028]
The result is that the sanctions in place today are far greater than they were under President George W. Bush. But could they be tighter still, even[#x2028] "crippling," to use the phrase Mr. Romney likes? (He borrowed it from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.) 
Certainly they could - but only[#x2028] if other countries agree. Because the United States has not had diplomatic relations or any significant trade with Iran for more than three decades, this is all a matter of persuading allies and others, and giving them an alternative to Iranian oil. Mr. Romney has not said how he would do that.[#x2028][#x2028] 
What Mr. Obama can't say is that while he ratcheted up the sanctions, he also expanded the covert program to sabotage Iran's nuclear centrifuges - a highly classified program called Olympic Games. It introduced cyberweapons - a computer worm - to destabilize the machinery, buying a bit more time for sanctions to work - but not much. The Iranians have now recovered, however, and are producing new nuclear fuel at a steady rate, despite sanctions and sabotage.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:05 P.M. | Fact-Check: How Close Is Iran to a Bomb? 
Mr. Romney said at the debate that Iran was "four years closer to a nuclear weapon." How close is that?
The answer depends on three factors. The first is how long it would take Iran to manufacture bomb-grade uranium. The second is how long it would take to fashion that uranium into a weapon - without getting caught, and getting bombed, along the way. And the third is how long it would take to make the weapon small enough to fit atop a Shahab III, Iran's longest-range missile.
Right now the Iranians have enough low-enriched and medium-enriched uranium on hand to make five or six bombs - but it would require further enrichment, and they would almost certainly be caught by international weapons inspectors, who visit Iran's enrichment facilities every few weeks.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel argued in a recent speech in front of the United Nations that Iran would be ready to make a short, perhaps undetectable sprint to a bomb by next spring. American officials agree, but say the sprint would be hard to hide. So far, Iran's stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium - the closest to bomb grade - is short of a single bomb, and the amount was reduced recently because some was diverted to fuel a research reactor used for medical purposes. But Iran is working to make more.
Then comes the next part of the process: "weaponizing." The physics is not that hard, but again, the risk of detection is fairly high. Obama administration officials say the United States would almost certainly detect what was happening. The Israelis are not so sure - especially because weapons labs can be hidden in caves, tunnels or university laboratories.
Even then, Iran would have only a crude bomb - something it might put on a cargo ship, but nothing that could be aimed with precision. That process would take a year or more, and involve engineers who would most likely have to redesign Iran's missile warheads. "We'd see them coming," one senior intelligence official said.
But that does not guarantee they could be stopped: The United States saw China, India, Pakistan and North Korea becoming nuclear powers, and decided in each case that it was not worth a war to stop them.
- David E. Sanger 
 10:02 P.M. | Fact-Check: The Size of the Navy 
On military matters, Mr. Romney repeated a challenge to the Obama administration that he has used with repeated intensity: that the United States Navy is the smallest since 1917. Yes, today's Navy is much smaller than in past generations. But Navy commanders also point out that each individual warship at sea today is far more capable than any individual predecessor in that class of vessel. The commander in chief, Mr. Obama, made the same point in the debate, saying that today's Navy includes aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines far beyond comparison to the fleet early in the last century.
"You mention the Navy, for example, and the fact that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916," Mr. Obama said to Mr. Romney. "Well governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets."
Even so, greater numbers of warships do allow greater presence. But the American economy, the global economy - and Congress, which includes advocates of both increased military spending and of Pentagon cuts - all get a of vote.
Mr. Romney has made what he calls the nation's underfinanced military a centerpiece of his argument that Mr. Obama has failed to safeguard American strength abroad.
How many trillions of dollars are at stake remains in dispute. Mr. Obama and his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., say Mr. Romney wants to add $2 trillion to military spending, a figure that Mr. Romney's advisers have rejected as exaggerated. The $2 trillion figure is reached by calculating Mr. Romney's pledge to spend 4 percent of gross domestic product on the military, which government budget experts put at about $1.8 trillion. Mr. Romney's advisers point out that this extra spending would not be immediate, but over many years.
In the debate. Mr. Romney did not use, or counter, the $2 trillion figure. He said he would add $1 trillion to the Pentagon budget, by restoring current cuts and preventing deeper spending reductions under sequestration. He seems to have gotten that number by adding together the $450 billion-plus defense spending cuts proposed by the Obama administration, over the next decade, with the approximately $500 billion in cuts that would be required if Congress fails to reach a budget accord.
But that second cut, under a program called sequestration, has not happened yet - and both Democrats and Republicans are trying to avoid it. Mr. Obama responded by pledging that sequestration would be avoided, and he stressed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had signed off on current budget proposals.

 10:02 P.M. | From Obama, a Sarcastic Retort 
The president offered one of the most sarcastic retorts seen during any of the four debates, responding to Mr. Romney's desire for an increase in the number of naval ships for the United States.
Looking directly at Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama scoffed at the notion.
"We also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military has changed," the president said. "We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."
Mr. Obama was not finished. He described Mr. Romney's desire for increased naval ships as short-sighted and not in the long-term interests of the military.
"So the question is not a game of Battleship where we are counting ships," Mr. Obama said. "It's what are our capabilities?"
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:54 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney's Shifting Tone on Iran 
 Mr. Romney's remark that he wants to use "peaceful and diplomatic means" to persuade Iran not to pursue its nuclear program was a striking departure from the more hawkish tone he has used throughout the campaign. 
 Mr. Romney urged preparations for war against Iran last year in an opinion piece that he wrote in The Wall Street Journal. "Si vis pacem, para bellum,'' he wrote. "That is a Latin phrase, but the ayatollahs will have no trouble understanding its meaning from a Romney administration: If you want peace, prepare for war."
 And it was only a few weeks ago that Mr. Romney called for more muscle-flexing aimed at Iran - saying he would "restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region" - in a speech on Oct. 8 at the Virginia Military Institute.
"For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions - not just words - that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated," he said.
And Mr. Romney has long been dismissive of Mr. Obama's attempts to use diplomacy to persuade Iran to abandon its weapons programs.
"In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran," Mr. Romney said in his speech at the Republican National Convention. "We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning."
He spoke out against bilateral negotiations in 2007, saying: "But until there are indications that high-level engagement would do anything other than reward bad behavior, I don't believe that we should be engaging Iran in direct, bilateral negotiations over their nuclear weapons program. Iran's nuclear intransigence is repulsive to the entire world, and we shouldn't let Iran try to position it as an Iran versus a U.S. thing."
He continued to be dismissive of the diplomatic approach in his 2010 book "No Apology."
"President Obama sends a signal that he is eager to negotiate at any time, any place, without conditions; the effect of this is to cede all of the power and leverage to our enemies,'' he wrote. "Time and again, President Obama's open hand has been met with a clenched fist.''
Mr. Romney made a similar point in the secretly-recorded videotape of a Florida fund-raiser in which he made headlines for his remark that 47 percent of Americans pay no income taxes and see themselves as victims. 
"The president's foreign policy, in my opinion, is formed in part by a perception he has that his magnetism and his charm and his persuasiveness is so compelling, that he can sit down with people like Putin and Chavez and Ahmadinejad and they'll find that we're such wonderful people that they'll go on with us," Mr. Romney said. 
"And they'll stop doing bad things. It's an extraordinarily nave perception, and it led to huge errors in North Korea, in Iraq, obviously in Iran, in Egypt, around the world. My own view is that the centerpiece of American foreign policy has to be strength."
And last year Mr. Romney spoke about the possibility of a military strike against Iran in an interview with Fox News. When Bret Baier of Fox News asked Mr. Romney last year what kind of military action he would consider against Iran, Mr. Romney said, "There's a lot more information I need to have to know what type of military strike would be appropriate and effective."
"Would you be prepared to do it unilaterally if need be?" Mr. Baier asked.
"Of course,'' Mr. Romney replied.

Has President Obama promised large cuts to the military? The looming cuts to the military that Mr. Romney alluded to were not the president's doing. They are the bipartisan product of a messy deal he reached last year with House Republicans to raise the debt ceiling and avert default.
While Mr. Romney often attacks Mr. Obama for the across-the-board defense cuts that are currently scheduled to begin in January, the cuts - which Congress may very well intervene to block - were a result of a bipartisan law: the Budget Control Act of 2011, which Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, supported.
The law had its origins in the debt ceiling debate of 2011. When the White House asked Congress for the authority to borrow more money to pay for spending that Congress had already authorized, Republicans in the House of Representatives, including Mr. Ryan, balked at raising the debt limit without a guarantee of big spending cuts.
With the threat of default looming, a compromise was reached: Congress agreed to raise the debt limit in exchange for deficit-reduction measures, and a Congressional "supercommittee" was formed to hammer out the details. To spur the committee to act, the deal included what some officials described at the time as a hammer: the law said that failing to reach a deal would trigger $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts over the next decade that neither side wanted, with roughly half coming from the military.
Mr. Romney criticized the deal at the time, but Mr. Ryan praised it, issuing a statement calling it "a victory for those committed to controlling government spending."
But even facing the prospect of the automatic spending cuts, the supercommittee failed to reach a deal. Now the automatic cuts are scheduled to begin in 2013 - unless Congress and the president agree to avert them after the election.
"It will not happen," Mr. Obama said of the cuts at the debate.
- Michael Cooper 
 9:50 P.M. | Fact-Check: Debt as a National Security Risk 
In the debate, Mr. Romney cited the United States' growing debt as a major national security risk. 
Many analysts share that assessment, including retired Navy Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "I believe the single biggest threat to our national security is our debt, so I also believe we have every responsibility to help eliminate that threat," he said last year. "We must, and will, do our part."
The general thrust of the argument is that the United States' huge deficits and debt might force cuts to its spending on human and built infrastructure, as well as research and development. The debt might also undermine confidence overseas in the United States' ability to lead.
It's a broad argument about national priorities. But on the more specific question of whether the amount of United States debt held by China poses a threat, the Pentagon has said, generally, no.
- Annie Lowrey 
 9:49 P.M. | Fact-Check: Massachusetts Test Scores 
Mr. Romney said that grade-school students in Massachusetts, where he served as governor, took the national lead in test scores, because "Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis." Mr. Obama countered, "but that was 10 years before you took office." They are both right.
The National Assessment of Educational Progress commonly called the nation's report card, does show that Massachusetts took the top spot shortly after Mr. Romney took office in 2003. But education experts have attributed that to a 1993 school reform law passed under another Republican governor, William Weld, and Mr. Romney, himself, has given that law much of the credit for his state's progress.

 9:47 P.M. | Enter Bush and Cheney 
Mr. Obama name-checked the former president and vice president, accusing Mr. Romney of praising George W. Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as good in foreign policy.
That may be the first time Mr. Cheney's name popped up during a debate this year. The former vice president was one of Mr. Obama's chief foreign policy critics during the early part of Mr. Obama's term.
That faded a bit as Mr. Cheney underwent heart surgery. But in recent months, the former vice president has recovered and begun his harsh critiques of the current president's approaches.
Mr. Bush, by contrast, has largely stayed out of the fray, although his policies have been at the heart of the debate over the direction the country should go during the next four years, as The Times's John Harwood wrote on Monday.
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:45 P.M. | Fact-Check: A Quick Note on Geography 
A small note on global geography to Mr. Romney.
During a discussion concerning the bloodshed in Syria - and Iran's role - Mr. Romney said: "Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world. It's their route to the sea."
Yes, Syria and Iran are allies. But Iran has a lengthy and sovereign coastline that stretches along the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and then linking to the Arabian Sea - which, in turn, leads to the Indian Ocean and onward to the world's high seas.
- Thom Shanker 
 9:43 P.M. | Fact-Check: Obama Reaction to Iran Uprisings 
Mr. Romney said President Obama had been "silent" in the face of Iran's opposition uprising in 2009 and 2010. That is a common criticism with some truth, but it is not the whole story.
As Iranians took to the streets to protest how the vote was held that re-elected Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the first such public uprising in recent memory in Iran, Mr. Obama waited for days to say anything. Then he was lukewarm in his public support of the protesters, though he eventually used strong language to condemn the force used against them.
On June 15, 2009, as reports on protests and their brutal suppression grew, Mr. Obama said that he was watching the situation and that it was "up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be," adding that "we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States' being the issue inside of Iran." He also said: "I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process - free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent - all those are universal values and need to be respected."
By June 26, he was using stronger language: "The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous," Mr. Obama said. "And despite the government's efforts to keep the world from bearing witness to that violence, we see it, and we condemn it." Six months later, in December, he said, "For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality."
Mr. Obama's aides have acknowledged that his initial reaction was slow and understated, but they said he feared that any public expression of support would enable the mullahs to claim that the uprising was the work of the C.I.A., and crush it. There's a lot of history there: back in the 1950s the C.I.A. did help stage a coup in Iran, bring to power the shah.
Publicly, the White House insists it got it right. Privately many of the president's aides have their doubts. And when the next protests came, in Egypt in 2011, Mr. Obama quickly sided with the protesters, after younger members of his staff said he had to get "on the right side of history.''

 9:41 P.M. | A Focus on the (U.S.) Economy 
Another big question Monday night: which candidate would seek to move first from the official topic of the debate - foreign policy - back to these shores and to the economy. Point: Mr. Romney, who went to joblessness. Mr. Obama came back a few minutes later to talk about reducing the deficit.
As a result, 30 minutes into the debate, the candidates are debating the economy and Mr. Romney is going through his five-point economic program, while Mr. Obama is criticizing Mr. Romney's record as governor of Massachusetts on economic development and education. "We didn't have a chance to talk about this in the last debate," Mr. Obama said.
This was perhaps inevitable. The real big differences between these two candidates are over domestic issues, and every poll suggests that the economy, education and jobs are the top concerns of the voters. (No knock on the Middle East here, by the way.)

 9:36 P.M. | Fact-Check: Arming Syrian Rebels 
On the question of whether to arm the Syrian rebels, President Obama and Mr. Romney have a genuine difference of opinion. Mr. Obama has steadfastly refused to give the Syrian rebels heavy weapons to take out President Bashar al-Assad's fighter jets and tanks, and even light arms have been transferred at the behest of two neighboring Arab states, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
Mr. Romney said at the debate that he wanted to make sure that responsible groups in Syria receive the arms that they need to defend themselves. Mr. Obama said that the administration was mobilizing support for the opposition there but that it wanted to make sure that "we're not putting arms in the hands" of people who could eventually turn them against the United States or its allies in the region.
Administration officials argue it would be madness to give heavier arms to the rebels, because some of the groups are feared to be linked to Al Qaeda. "We did this once before,'' one of Mr. Obama's top defense advisers said, referring to the arming of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, fighters who later took on the United States.
Mr. Romney is far more willing to allow the rebels - at least those who "share our values'' - to get those arms, as he indicated at a speech at the Virginia Military Institute. But he stopped short of saying the United States would provide those arms directly.
Lurking over these last few weeks until the election is a ground truth: the arms that have flowed to the anti-Assad insurgents so far have gone overwhelmingly to the hardline jihadists. Efforts by the director of central intelligence, David Petraeus, and others have so far failed to come up with an effective way to vet the rebels, that is, sorting out extremists from secularists. There is no reason to believe it would be any easier in a Romney administration. Figuring out friend from foe in the arms bazaar along the Turkish-Syrian border is virtually impossible, American officials say, and once the arms are transferred, they are hard to track.
- David E. Sanger 
 9:34 P.M. | Bringing Foreign Policy Back Home 
Mr. Obama has twice sought to guide the foreign policy discussion back to the economy at home.
In answer to a question about Egypt, Mr. Obama said America must repair its own economy even as it looks abroad.
"There are some things we are going to have to do at home as well," Mr. Obama said. "We've neglected developing our own economy."
Earlier, the president sought to do the same thing during a discussion about Libya.
"We can't continue to do nation-building in those regions," Mr. Obama said, without doing some "nation-building at home."
After the president's Egypt answer, Mr. Romney jumped on the bandwagon, saying that "we have weakened our economy" at home while dealing with issues abroad.
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:29 P.M. | Fact-Check: Romney on Russia 
Mr. Obama attacked Mr. Romney for describing Russia as America's "No. 1 geopolitical foe." "When you were asked what was the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaeda, you said Russia," Mr. Obama told Mr. Romney during the debate. "And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back." Mr. Romney did characterize Russia that way, although he also cited other more immediate security threats.
Mr. Romney's characterization of Russia is one that has puzzled some Republican foreign policy experts - like Colin Powell, who said, "Come on, Mitt, think," - as well as some of Mr. Romney's own foreign policy advisers.
More recently, Mr. Romney seemed to soften his language a bit, saying in a radio interview that Russia is a "geopolitical adversary" but not describing the country as America's top foe. But Mr. Romney's concerns about Russia are deep seated. He believes that President Vladimir V. Putin will use political repression to further tighten his grip on power. And, more broadly, he argues that Russia will use its vast natural resources wealth to dominate much of Eurasia.
But some experts say that analysis is backward: They say that Mr. Putin and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev have been using high petroleum and mineral prices to support domestic and defense programs, and that those programs are now vulnerable to volatility or even stagnation in commodity prices. Mr. Romney's critics also say he ignores important help that Russian leaders have provided, like supporting a United Nations heavy-arms embargo on Iran; canceling a surface-to-air missile system sale to Iran; and allowing supplies to be sent through Russia to NATO troops in Afghanistan.
- Richard A. Oppel Jr. 
 9:25 P.M. | Fact-Check: A Status of Forces Agreement? 
President Obama suggested that Mr. Romney was mistaken in seeking to keep 10,000 American troops in Iraq. But the Obama administration initially sought to do just that - and ultimately never managed to negotiate an agreement to allow any American troops in Iraq.
Mr. Obama sought to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement that would have allowed United States troops to stay in Iraq after 2011. Initially, the Obama administration was prepared to keep up to 10,000 troops in Iraq. Later, the Obama administration lowered the figure to about 5,000 troops - some 3,500 of which would be continuously based in the country while the remainder would periodically be rotated through. The role of the American forces would be to train Iraqi troops, patrol Iraq's skies and help Iraqi commandos fight Al Qaeda.
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki indicated that he might be willing to work out an agreement to allow some American troops to stay. But the Iraqis did not agree to an American demand that such an agreement be submitted to their parliament for approval, a step the Obama administration insisted was needed to ensure that any American troops that stayed would be immune from prosecution under Iraqi law.
Mr. Obama relied on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well as American officials in Iraq to negotiate the agreement. The president spoke to Mr. Maliki only twice during the negotiations - at the start and at the end of the talks. Also, the Obama administration did not begin formal talks with the Iraqis until June 2, 2011, which did not leave much time for negotiation.
The Obama administration says that it was willing to keep some troops in Iraq, but the Iraqis, reflecting their concerns over sovereignty, failed to agree to the necessary immunities.
After the talks broke down, the Obama administration withdrew the remaining American troops in December 2011, the deadline set for withdrawing all American forces from Iraq under the Status of Forces Agreement that was concluded by George W. Bush and Mr. Mailiki in 2008.
Iran has taken advantage of the absence of American forces to fly hundreds of tons of military equipment through Iraqi airspace to Syria.
- Michael R. Gordon and Scott Shane 
 9:26 P.M. | Candidates Attack and Critique Credentials 
President Obama offered an early, forceful critique of Mr. Romney's foreign policy credentials, accusing his rival of "wrong and reckless" foreign policy that is "all over the map."
Coming out quickly to assert his national security credentials, the president repeatedly hammered Mr. Romney as not ready to take over as commander in chief.
"Every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong," Mr. Obama said. "Not only were you wrong, but you were confusing in sending mixed messages to our troops and to our allies."
Mr. Romney said the president's characterizations of his record "don't happen to be accurate." And he sought to make Mr. Obama's critique a negative in the debate.
"Attacking me is not an agenda," Mr. Romney said. "Attacking me is not talking about how we are going to deal with the challenges of the Middle East."
But Mr. Romney's approach in the first few minutes of the debate was far less aggressive, suggesting that American policy in the Middle East should be one of seizing opportunities, not making war.
"We can't kill our way out of this mess," Mr. Romney said.
- Michael D. Shear 
 9:21 P.M. | Candidates Take Aggressive Stance From the Start 
The predictions were that the format of this debate - both candidates sitting down; the subject being foreign policy; the desire of both the president and Mr. Romney to convey the demeanor commander-in-chief - would lead to this being a slightly more decorous debate than last one. So far, that does not appear to be true. No finger-pointing yet, but Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are talking over each other, challenging each other's facts and veracity, as Mr. Obama comes in - again - seemingly intent on not giving an inch to Mr. Romney after his disastrous first debate.
And Mr. Obama, once again, has come armed with the sound-bites that he once disdained. "The Cold War has been over for 20 years," he said, criticizing Mr. Romney for identifying Russia as the top international foe to the United States. "But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s."
- Adam Nagourney 
 9:17 P.M. | Fact-Check: The Strength of Al Qaeda 
Mr. Romney said Al Qaeda remained "an enormous threat," and Mr. Obama said his administration had "decimated" its leadership. Who is right? Both are.
The Obama administration has waged a secret war of drone strikes and commando raids against Al Qaeda in roughly a dozen countries and claimed victory in killing not only Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda's founder, but also much of the group's top leadership. Last year Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta declared that the United States was "within reach of strategically defeating Al Qaeda'' and that the American focus had narrowed to only 10 or 20 crucial leaders in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia.
In January, the nation's top intelligence official, James R. Clapper, testified that continued pressure would likely reduce Al Qaeda's core leadership in Pakistan to "largely symbolic importance" by 2015.
But even as Al Qaeda central has come under intense pressure in Pakistan, its ideology has spread and given birth to dangerous affiliates in Yemen, Somalia and elsewhere. Michael G. Vickers, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, has said that even if the United States should kill all of the group's leadership, "you still have Al Qaeda, the idea."
The Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is viewed as the most immediate threat and remains very dangerous, Mr. Clapper said, because political instability has allowed it to seize large areas of southern Yemen. In North Africa, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has stepped up kidnapping for ransom and has been bolstered by rebels returning from Libya with heavy weapons.
Last month Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested that there was a link between Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the attack at the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed the United States ambassador and three others. Officials have said the question of any Al Qaeda involvement would be settled only after the F.B.I. completed a criminal investigation, which could take months.
- Elisabeth Bumiller 
 9:12 P.M. | Fact-Check: Conditions on Foreign Aid 
On foreign aid, Mitt Romney has been much more explicit than President Obama: he would make aid to Egypt, and other "Arab Spring'' states, conditional on how they formed their governments. He has not said what the conditions would be, but aides have: the country has to be tolerant of other religions, enshrine basic human rights, educate girls, preserve peace treaties (especially Egypt's treaty with Israel) and move toward Western forms of justice.
Mr. Obama has been less specific, but his aides note that cutting aid can become a two-way street. For example, the $1.3 billion in military aid given annually to the Egyptian military was the price of the peace treaty with Israel. Cut the aid and it might be easier to jettison the treaty.

 9:12 P.M. | New Ad From Conservatives to Follow Debate 

BOCA RATON, Fla. - A provocative ad that imagines what the world will be like in 2030 through the eyes of a menacing Chinese professor will hit the air on Monday night right after the final presidential debate concludes.
A reprise of a popular commercial that first ran in 2010, the ad features the professor speaking in Chinese to his students as English subtitles flash on the screen.
Two conservative groups, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation and Citizens Against Government Waste, are spending $2 million this week to run it.
 "The ancient Greeks, the Roman empire, the British empire and the United States of America: They all make the same mistakes, turning their back on the principles that made them great," the professor says. "America tried to tax and spend itself out of a great recession. Enormous so-called 'stimulus' spending, massive changes to health care, government takeovers of private industries and crushing debt."
Then the professor cracks a sinister smile and chuckles: "Of course we owned most of their debt. So now they work for us." His class erupts in laughter.
- Jeremy W. Peters 
 9:00 P.M. | Expect a Question on Negotiations With Iran 
The question of whether the United States should engage in direct negotiations with Iran is almost certain to come up, thanks to a report in The Times that such talks are being considered by both sides.
Mr. Obama's administration pushed back against the report, saying, "It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections."
Iran has also denied that direct talks are in the works.
But Mr. Schieffer, the moderator of the debate, is almost certain to ask Mr. Obama and his challenger, Mr. Romney, about whether such talks should proceed, and if so, under what circumstances.
Mr. Romney declined over the weekend to say whether such talks are a good idea. In 2007, he warned against direct negotiations with Iran, saying that "until there are indications that high-level engagement would do anything other than reward bad behavior, I don't believe that we should be engaging Iran in direct, bilateral negotiations over their nuclear weapons program."
He added in 2007: "Iran's nuclear intransigence is repulsive to the entire world, and we shouldn't let Iran try to position it as an Iran versus. a U.S. thing." 
Since then, Mr. Romney has been more bellicose toward Iran as he has sought to characterize Mr. Obama as having been too weak in dealing with the leaders of the country.
"Si vis pacem, para bellum," Mr. Romney wrote in an editorial in The Wall Street Journal last year. "That is a Latin phrase, but the ayatollahs will have no trouble understanding its meaning from a Romney administration: If you want peace, prepare for war."

 8:51 P.M. | A Look at the Foreign Policy Advisers 
On the stage Monday night, the two candidates will be speaking.
But their words will echo their foreign policy advisers, the small cadre of national security experts they have each assembled to guide their thinking.
Who are these folks?
The Times's David Sanger wrote what may be the definitive piece about Mr. Romney's advisers, who include John R. Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador; Richard S. Williamson, a former Ronald Reagan official; Jim Talent, a former Missouri senator; and Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney.
One of the most visible advisers for Mr. Romney? Dan Senor, a former spokesman for the American coalition in Iraq who is close to Mr. Romney. The Cable blog, at foreignpolicy.com, also has a list of Romney advisers.
Mr. Obama's inner circle is easier to see. As president, it's the one he has assembled in the White House.
Among his advisers: Tom Donilon, the national security adviser; Dennis McDonough, the deputy national security adviser; John Brennan, Mr. Obama's chief counterterrorism aide; and Susan Rice, the United Nations ambassador.
Most visible of late? Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who has been playing Mr. Romney in debate preparations.
- Michael D. Shear 
 8:44 P.M. | Fielding Questions Sitting Down 
President Obama has joked that he took a nap behind the lectern in the first debate
Freed from that constraint in the second debate, Mr. Obama and his rival, Mitt Romney, veered toward each other - literally and repeatedly.
So what about Monday night?
This time, both candidates will be seated, more like their vice presidential running mates were during their debate two weeks ago.
How that will change things is anyone's guess. Both camps are certain to have warned the candidates about the danger of the split screen, which showed a grinning Mr. Biden and a thirsty Mr. Ryan during their exchange.
The seated position should make it more difficult for the two men to be as physically demonstrative toward each other. But it also could make it harder to appear dominating, or presidential, while seated.
For Mr. Obama, the risk is that he loses the assertive posture he took in the second debate, treating the moment more like one of the television interviews he has done so often during the last several years.
In Mr. Romney's case, being seated could make it tougher to project a presidential, commander-in-chief image.

 8:32 P.M. | Post Card From Boca Raton 
BOCA RATON, Fla. - In the Mediterranean-style Mizner Park downtown, the grass is cropped as close as a golf green and three watch sellers, Van Cleef and Arpels, Hublot and Jaeger-LeCultre, sit side by side. 
This is a town of "amazing wealth, you just shake your head sometimes," said Melissa Berg, who was doing some midday shopping. 
Boca Raton has twice earned a place in the political narrative this year, as the host of Monday night's presidential debate and earlier as the setting of a high-donor dinner where Mr. Romney uttered his 47 percent remark.
No question, it's a rich town. Forbes ranked three of its gated communities among the 10 most expensive in the United States in 2004. But it also a place where middle-class families move for the good public schools, and relatively affordable housing is within walking distance of the beach. 
"We're ordinary people,'' said a man in orange swim trunks leaving the beach at Spanish River Park on Monday afternoon. He did not want to give his name. "I drive a Honda, my wife drives a Mazda," he said.
He plans to vote to re-elect the president. "President Obama is for the guy in the middle class trying to work their way through it and pay the bills every month," he said.
Carole Gotthilf, a 25-year-resident, said Boca residents were "very strong Obama for a long time; I think there's mixed emotions now."
The president won Palm Beach County, where Boca Raton is located, with a commanding 61.5 percent in 2008. He seems unlikely to enjoy that margin again. 
"He's done a good job," said Ms. Gotthilf, who was looking at shoes through a window at Mizner Park. "People around me who agreed with me at one point now disagree ferociously." 
Ms. Berg, 53, a real estate agent in the luxury division of a local firm, said she was "a Republican at heart" who supported Mr. Romney, but she worried about his proposal to replace Medicare with a voucher-like system. She went to hear Mr. Romney at a big rally a couple of weeks ago in hopes he would describe his plans. "They don't really say all that much at rallies," she said. "I just want a direct answer."
It was a blustery day at the beach, with a purple flag warning to keep out of the water. Scattered bathers lay in the sun. A sign said the street lights on Ocean Boulevard were now switched off for the season to protect nesting sea turtles.
Alan Hernandez, 77, and Jane Foster, 70, a couple who each retired last week - he cleaned the hulls of luxury yachts; she worked in administration for a nearby city - said Boca was not as friendly as when they moved here years ago. They, too, mentioned the wealth. "You stop at a light and say, whoa, that's a Bentley on my right," Mr. Hernandez said. Ms. Foster said she was "not intimidated, we've been here longer than them." 
Who did they plan to vote for? "I have a feeling that either one, you're going to say, 'What was I thinking?'," Mr. Hernandez said.

 8:15 P.M. | Florida, Florida, Florida 
States like Virginia, Iowa and, especially, Ohio, may be getting all of the attention of late. But that doesn't mean Florida - with its haul of 29 electoral votes - isn't still the big prize.
Monday night's debate in Boca Raton is a symbol of that importance.
The debate may not be focused on the issues that most interest Florida's voters - the economy, the housing market, Social Security and Medicare. But it's no accident that the concluding debate is here.
And while the candidates themselves hunkered down for last-minute debate preparations on Monday, their best surrogates took advantage of being here.
"This election will be closer than the last one," the first lady Michelle Obama said Monday at a rally in Davie, Fla. "That's the only guarantee. And it could all come down to what happens in just a few key battleground states like right here in Florida."
Over the weekend, Mr. Romney himself rallied supporters in Daytona Beach.
"Are you ready for four very different years?" Mr. Romney asked the crowd. "We can endure 18 more days of the agenda of President Obama, but we cannot endure four more years, that's why we're going to replace him."
The president and Mr. Romney have been battling fiercely in Florida, which decided the election in 2000 and has remained ideologically split since then. Polls suggest Mr. Romney has momentum in the state, though the growth in the Latino vote, which is expected to go heavily for Mr. Obama, could be key.
- Michael D. Shear 
 8:08 P.M. | Debate Questions Most Likely Left Unasked 
They have been asked about the economy, Libya, health care, student loans and gas prices. 
But if Monday night's debate sticks to its stated theme of foreign policy, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney will have withstood three general election debates without answering a direct question about arguably the two most polarizing social issues of our time: abortion and same-sex marriage. 
Martha Raddatz of ABC News, the moderator of the vice presidential debate, asked Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Representative Paul D. Ryan about abortion, putting it in the context of faith: "I would like to ask you both to tell me what role your religion has played in your own personal views on abortion."
But neither Jim Leher of PBS, Candy Crowley of CNN or any of the town hall participants asked Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama about the issues. 
(The two candidates' views on contraception arose during the last debate, but not because of a specific question about the topic - it stemmed from a inquiry about women and workplace inequality.)
Granted, their positions on abortion and same-sex marriage are not exactly hidden - but for those who do not follow politics closely, the nuances of their views on both may remain a mystery. 
So will either man be asked about abortion or gay marriage before a national audience before election day? It seems unlikely, unless an audience member at one of their rallies asks between now and Nov. 6.
- Michael Barbaro 
 8:04 P.M. | Foreign Policy Debate Format Explained 
Like the first presidential debate, Monday night's face-off will be divided up into segments, chosen by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, the host of CBS News's "Face the Nation" program.
Here are the broad topics that Mr. Schieffer has picked:
* America's Role in the World
* Our Longest War - Afghanistan
* Red Lines - Israel and Iran
* The Changing Middle East and the New Face of Terrorism - I
* The Changing Middle East and the New Face of Terrorism - II
* The Rise of China and Tomorrow's World
The debate commission says those topics will not necessarily be discussed in that order. And the topics are broad enough to encompass a broad range of specific issues.

 8:01 P.M. | Foreign Policy Debate Puts Focus on Leadership 
For 90 minutes Monday night, President Obama and Mitt Romney will clash over specific foreign policy issues, their differences heightened by a debate intended to draw out sharp contrasts ahead of Election Day in two weeks.
But for viewers, the specifics may be mostly background noise as they search for the answer to a gauzy question: Who would be the better leader?
In polls this year, voters have practically screamed at the top of their lungs how little they care about foreign policy. In recent polls of three battleground states, Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin, fewer than 10 percent of voters in each state said national security was the most important issue to them, ranking below the economy, deficit and health care.
And yet, both campaigns have spent plenty of time and money in an effort to claim the mantle of who is better able to lead. Top strategists for both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama seem to believe that foreign policy will help shape those perceptions. Read more ...

HEADLINE: Casting Dual Roles, at Treasury and the Fed

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: If Mitt Romney wins the presidency, he has already pledged he will replace Ben Bernanke, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman ends in January 2014, in just over 15 months. Mr. Bernanke, however, has told close friends that even if Mr. Obama wins, he probably will not stand for re-election. 

 BODY:
For the last couple of months, there has been a parlor game on Wall Street and in Washington about who will become the next Treasury secretary. After all, Timothy F. Geithner has made it clear he plans to be out of that office at the end of the year whether President Obama is re-elected or not.
But there is another wrinkle in the parlor game calculus: Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, is likely to need a successor, too. If Mitt Romney wins the presidency, he has already pledged he will replace Mr. Bernanke, whose term as chairman ends in January 2014, in just over 15 months. However, Mr. Bernanke has told close friends that even if Mr. Obama wins, he probably will not stand for re-election.
That would be a one-two punch, with two of the most important jobs in the nation up for grabs. And over the last couple of years, especially at the depth of the financial crisis, the relationship between the two people in those roles has been increasingly important. They are the equivalent of roles in a buddy movie.
Lots of names are regularly bandied about for both positions. But they are not always thought about in tandem. So here is a field guide to handicapping the next Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman:
The top Democratic name that pops up when discussing the Treasury position is usually Erskine Bowles, the former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who reinvented himself with his Simpson-Bowles bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. The business community, on both sides, appear to love the plan and say they love him.
About a year ago, when Mr. Geithner first told the president that he wanted to step down - before the president persuaded him to stick around for another year - Mr. Bowles was at, or near, the top of the list, according to people involved in the process. That may have changed, however: Mr. Bowles has privately criticized the president to business leaders as he has sought to gain support for his plan.
Some of that criticism has made its way back to the president, these people said, so it is unclear how strongly Mr. Obama would support him.
Another, perhaps more intriguing idea has made the rounds: Mr. Bowles as a Romney appointee. Several supporters of Mr. Romney have pitched him and his team on the idea. An appointment of Mr. Bowles under Mr. Romney would be a quick and clever way to show that he wants to reach across the aisle and find bipartisan ways to comprise.
Among the names on Wall Street that are thrown around, virtually none has a real shot, if for no other reason than, well, they work on Wall Street. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, once considered a contender, is off the list. He recently told Vanity Fair, "I intend to be here for many more years," adding, "and I will not run for office."
Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the asset management juggernaut, has been a big supporter of the president and has told friends he would love the job, but people close to the administration say it is unlikely he would get it, given his title and his firm's previous relationship as an adviser to the Treasury.
The same most likely can be said of Roger Altman, chairman of Evercore Partners and a former deputy Treasury secretary, who is well liked by the administration but may be unable to shed the "investment banker" baggage.
And then there is Kenneth Chenault, the chief executive of American Express. Consider him a dark horse candidate, but perhaps the only person connected to the world of finance who would have a shot. His name was put on a list last summer when Mr. Geithner was considering leaving, people briefed on the list said. Given his history - an African-American who made his way up the ranks at American Express starting in 1981 - he could be the perfect mix of finance background and market experience, but one step removed from Wall Street banker.
The chances of an executive from what people in Washington call a "real company" - as in, not a financial business - also do not appear good. The one name that is buzzed about most, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, is likely to be off the table after Facebook's problematic I.P.O.
Here's a wild card: Dan Doctoroff, chief executive of Bloomberg L.P. and a former deputy mayor of New York under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is hardly campaigning for the job, but his name was put on an internal list at the Treasury Department last summer, these people said, though it is unclear whether he would want the position.
So who is most likely to get the job under President Obama? Drum roll, please. Jacob Lew.
Huh? If you're a business person, you might be asking, Mr. Lew who? That is probably the biggest knock against him, which gives everyone else on the list a chance. Mr. Lew is Mr. Obama's chief of staff, which makes him very confirmable. A former lawyer and career technocrat, he does not have much of a business background - he was briefly chief operating officer of Citigroup's Alternative Investments unit, between the Clinton and Obama administrations - but the president is very comfortable with him, and that can go a long way.
Now, on to the role of Federal Reserve chairman under President Obama.
It is slim pickings. At the top of the list is Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under President Clinton and director of the National Economic Council for President Obama. He's a serious economist who knows his numbers and has a worldview that is similar to the president's. He would be expected to continue the loose money policy of Mr. Bernanke.
But one of the knocks against Mr. Summers is that he has a reputation for not playing well with others. He has had his own run-ins with the president. And if you consider the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman as a tag team, you would have to be confident that whomever you pick for Treasury secretary would get along well with Mr. Summers.
There are a couple of other names in the Democratic economist world, but virtually all of them would be long shots: Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. She would be the first woman to run the Federal Reserve and could provide some continuity. Alan Krueger, an economist who was briefly an assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy under President Obama, is less of a classic choice, but is considered highly by the president.
If you want to be really daring, let's add one more name to the list, perhaps the perfect candidate from the president's perspective: Mr. Geithner. He would have had a year to recover from his current position and may have tired of the speaking circuit. Given his former role as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the financial crisis, he would bring steadiness to the job with Mr. Bernanke's departure, and a level of comfort for the president.
Now, if Mr. Romney wins the presidency, the chessboard for possible appointments for Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman becomes a little more crowded.
Glenn Hubbard, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and is a top adviser to Mr. Romney, is often mentioned as a top candidate for the Federal Reserve job - and the Treasury secretary job. It is likely that he would get one of the two.
So the question is, who gets the other? If Mr. Hubbard takes the Treasury secretary job, the other candidates for Federal Reserve chairman are N. Gregory Mankiw, who also headed the Council of Economic Advisers, and John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist, though he is considered more of a long shot.
If Mr. Hubbard gets the Federal Reserve job, however, the Treasury role becomes wide open.
Robert B. Zoellick, former president of the World Bank, is said to be among the names in the hopper for the Treasury secretary job. (He was previously a managing director at Goldman Sachs, but his role at the World Bank may have cleansed him of his Wall Street association and Mr. Romney is less concerned about ties to finance given his own background.)
Also on the list is Rob Portman, the senator from Ohio, who has become very close to Mr. Romney and knows a spreadsheet: he was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bush. Whether Mr. Romney would be willing to give up Mr. Portman's seat in the Senate is a question mark.
Finally, there is Mike Leavitt, the former governor of Utah, who is a close confidant and adviser to Mr. Romney. He is likely to get a big role in Mr. Romney's cabinet.
Oddly enough, given Wall Street's support for Mr. Romney, there are very few bankers or other business people on his short lists.
Whoever gets these two roles, let's hope this buddy movie isn't too much of a thriller.

HIGHLIGHT: Analysts look at the third presidential debate region by region, argument by argument.

10:14 p.m. Lynn Vavreck | Why Won't They Stop Agreeing? 
If we ask people to assess President Obama's performance on foreign policy issues, we get judgments so closely tied to party identification they are hardly worth discussing. But when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on America's role in the world, there are some surprising areas of agreement - in fact, strong agreement it turns out.
Using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project on the appropriate use of military force, we find that we are not polarized over everything. Ensuring access to oil, destroying terrorist camps, intervening in a civil war, assisting the spread of democracy, and helping our allies are all actions on which most Americans agree - and sometimes profoundly so. The only worthy uses of our military forces, the respondents say, are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies; the rest are not.
Helping the United Nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties - Democrats think it is appropriate and Republicans soundly disagree (I've presented the percentages separately on this line for Democrats and Republicans).
But, lest you think the nation isn't polarized on foreign policy, consider this: on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties. On the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp, 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve. On average, women's support for the use of force is less strong than men's, by about 10 points.
With women making up the larger share (60 percent) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes, it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement. And although there is no gender divide on whether Romney "says what he believes," there is a gender difference on whether Obama is sincere. Women are 11 points more likely, on average, to think Obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about Obama relative to Romney.

11:22 p.m. Husain Haqqani | A Doomed Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan
President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden's killing, "If we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him." But if Pakistan can't be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he'd deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years. 
Mr. Romney seems committed to changing Pakistani behavior. And although he claims he wouldn't "divorce" Pakistan, Mr. Romney's answer showed that he would downgrade Pakistan's status as an American ally. Demanding policy changes from Pakistan in return for American support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the United States might successfully deploy to that end.
The discussion over Afghanistan and Pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing Islamist extremism. Mr. Obama defines success against Al Qaeda very narrowly, glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region after the withdrawal of American combat forces in 2014. Mr. Obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge. 
Killing bin Laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the United States and its allies safe from terrorists. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the Muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan has not been completely disrupted. Little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young Muslims into terrorist training camps. And the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that America simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from Muslim regions at very little cost.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table. It is unrealistic to assume that a professional Afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame. The Taliban's ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy.
The United States could have withdrawn from Afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn't announced a deadline for its withdrawal. That deadline also took away any incentive for Pakistan's military to work with the United States against the Taliban, thinking that it could instead sit the Americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a post-American Afghanistan. The Obama administration didn't succeed in persuading or coercing Pakistan into acting against the Taliban and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few pro-American elements in Pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists. 
It's fine to say "We do not want or like war'' but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy, such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, are wars of necessity. Such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war's aims and its strategy.

11:37 p.m. Eric L. Lewis | Mitt's Romney's Egypt
Pity poor Egypt. After suffering through thirty years of the Mubarak kleptocracy, the people of Egypt rose up, deposed the dictator and elected a new president, Mohammed Morsi. To be sure, the victory of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood may not have been the first choice of American policy makers, but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes.
The new Egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the Mubarak regime, which was reliable, but at the expense of human rights, economic development, transparency and hope for the Egyptian people. Yet Morsi promptly reaffirmed what President Obama called in tonight's debate a "red line," the peace treaty with Israel, which has permitted Israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region.
None of these developments appear to satisfy Mitt Romney, who characterized Egypt as part of the "chaos" and "extremism" of Syria and Mali. While hailing the new regime in Libya as "wonderful," he warns that "next door" is Egypt, where the election of a "Muslim brotherhood President" constitutes a "reversal of hopes for the region." Romney said he would not have supported retaining Mubarak, but he views the outcome of a free election - indeed a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution - as a failure of the Arab Spring.
It is way too early to declare Egypt a success. It is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for sixty years. It is a country of 80 million people, many of whom live in terrible poverty. It exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them. Its Coptic Christian minority is uneasy, to say the least. The business community has largely remained on the sidelines. And many in its new government have spent the last thirty years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the Mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state.
But Romney's suggestion that the election of a Muslim Brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of Muslim ruling parties with "jihadism" and "terrorism." Syria and Iran were Baathist governments, nominally socialist secular states. The Assad clan and Saddam Hussein did not kill in the name of jihad. President Recip Erdogan in Turkey governs as a moderate Islamist, sharing some ideological roots with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran?
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter the Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that. 
 Dennis Ross, a former State Department and National Security Council official, was a special assistant to President Obama for the Middle East and South Asia from 2009 to 2011. He is now a counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran? 
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that.

12:01 a.m. Michael S. Doran | Romney's Strategy for Syria 
On Syria, Mitt Romney won - but only on points, certainly not with a knock-out blow. Mr. Romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision. He framed the civil war in Syria as an opportunity, a chance to strike at Iran. "Syria," Mr. Romney said, "is Iran's only ally in the Arab world," stressing the role the regime of Bashar al-Assad plays as Iran's base for extending its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Toppling Mr. Assad, Mr. Romney correctly explained, would deal a blow to Hezbollah and roll back Iranian influence throughout the region.
By contrast, President Obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken, but failed to place them in a wider context. He did not even mention Iran in the course of the discussion.
Syria represents a very rare thing in international politics: a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment. At least 30,000 have died, and millions have been made refugees. As the greatest power in the Middle East, the United States is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity. 
Yet, in fact, the Obama administration has been relatively passive, as Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey recently complained. "Right now," Mr. Erdogan said, "there are certain things being expected from the United States," but America has "not yet catered to those expectations." In the debate tonight Mr. Romney struck a similar note, stressing that America "should be playing the leadership role." 
But Mr. Romney did not define a clear path forward. The president claimed that Romney "doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership." There was truth in the statement.
At a moment when there is no appetite among Americans for a new foreign adventure, Mr. Romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the American military in Syria. He even rejected the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. Yet an American-implemented no-fly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the Romney strategic vision into a practical reality.
Mr. Romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in Syria, but when it came to specifics, his policy differed little from the president's.

12:02 a.m. Daniel W. Drezner | The Anti-Bellum Romney 
Many people believe that Mitt Romney won the first debate because of Barack Obama's somnambulant performance. That overlooked Romney's deft pivot to the center, which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation. This is consistent with a truism in political science: in an election, candidates try to target the median voter. In presidential politics, candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party's ideological base - but in general elections, they target the moderates, because those are the voters decide the election.
Romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate. After a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric, the governor sounded different tonight. He argued that "we can't kill our way out of" the problems in the Middle East. He averred that "we want a peaceful planet." He explicitly stated he didn't want to get involved militarily in Syria. Romney said the sanctions in Iran were working. He praised the president on numerous fronts - Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular. He even talked about China as a partner before bashing its trade policies. To be fair, the governor has said some of this before, but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace, not brute force.
In doing all this, Romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas. Romney's sotto voce message was that he would be a hot-headed, trigger-happy cowboy - like the Last Republican President Who Shall Not Be Named. For undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars, this could be very soothing indeed.
Will it work? One difference between this debate and the one in Denver is that President Obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time. The president was ready, willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in Romney's previous statements and claims. He accused Romney of being "all over the map" on numerous issues. He also ridiculed Romney's proposed naval buildup, pointing out that foreign policy wasn't a game of Battleship. It seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments - as opposed to simply treading water on the economy.
For the past month, Mitt Romney had been chipping away at Obama's foreign policy record. Tonight he seemed to want to emulate it. His clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander-in-chief. That way, they can ignore Obama's critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years. We'll find out over the next few days if he succeeded.

12:21 a.m. Anne-Marie Slaughter | America's Narcissism 
The much-heralded foreign policy debate wasn't really a debate, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues. And it was barely about foreign policy, as education reform (we all love teachers), Detroit, nation-building at home, and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and China. 
Romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme: "America must promote principles of peace." Obama looked and sounded every inch the commander-in-chief. But the lasting impression of the debate, certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world, is just how narrowly Americans define foreign policy. Neither candidate mentioned NATO. Indeed, neither candidate mentioned the European Union or the Eurozone crisis, other than Mr. Romney's dire predictions that the United States will soon be Greece unless he is elected. 
Moving east, the candidates barely mentioned a single country in East Asia other than China. There was only the briefest reference to Japan (our closest ally in Asia) by the moderator and a single mention of North Korea (another very dangerous nuclear power). Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, didn't come up. For that matter, there was no reference to India (a mere billion people). This silence is all the more striking given Mr. Obama's reference at the end of the debate to his administration's purported "pivot to Asia," a pivot that was supposed to be away from the Middle East. Yet when Mr. Obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the United States he said terrorist networks; Mr. Romney said a nuclear Iran.
Beyond individual countries, consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world. Neither candidate ever uttered the word "climate."Or drug violence. Or poverty, disease, food, water, or even energy. 
This really wasn't a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio. From a real foreign policy perspective, a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems, we can only hope the rest of the world wasn't listening.

12:41 a.m. Hanin Ghaddar | The Winner: Bashar al-Assad 
Tonight's debate was expected to reveal the candidates' thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the American foreign policy. However, this debate offered very little. 
Syria is a case in point. Both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards Syria. They both want to make friends with the Syrian people, but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to Israel. 
Governor Mitt Romney was simply advocating President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, which is inaction. There are simply no meaningful differences. Both want to let the Syrian people "determine their own fate," which so far has been a very bloody and dark one. 
Power comes with responsibility, and the Syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world. On both Twitter and Facebook, Syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates. They saw America's power implemented in Libya and wanted the same treatment. However, it seems both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have washed their hands of the Syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat. 
The policy of inaction in Syria, which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins, has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented, and also to the rise of Islamists. Because of inaction in Syria, the United States is losing the opportunity to lead. America's inaction in Syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, and last but not least Lebanon, where a car bomb killed senior Lebanese security official Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country. More inaction will mean more sectarian violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the region. The United States and its allies surely do not wish to see that. 
For the Syrian people, intervention never meant boots on the ground. They have specifically asked for safe havens and anti-aircraft missiles, not more. That's all they need to defeat the Assad regime. Both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail. The Syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the United States to offer. Instead, all they heard was "we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won't use it against us." Without trust, there can be no friendship. 
The only difference between the two was that Romney seemed to see the Middle East as one big space of terror. He repeatedly referred to the developments in past two years in the region as chaos and tumult. This is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives, and still are, in order to topple their dictators. That's also a bad way to make friends. 
The Syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins, they are on their own, and that the big winner of this debate is Bashar al-Assad.

12:47 a.m. Danielle Pletka | Don't Diss Defense Workers 
If what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight, you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by Barack Obama's rather robotic insistence on "nation building here at home." If you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration (the plan that would likely cut $500 billion from the defense budget in January 2013), the President's blithe assertion that it won't happen - no proof, no policy, just "I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message" - may not have convinced you. 
On the other hand, Mitt Romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that, by the end of this decade, Americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt that they will on national security. 
Mr. Romney recycled the oft-used sentiment that the President's request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917. Mr. Obama quoted Mr. Romney's talking points back to him, citing the actual year - 1916 - and ridiculed Romney's failure to understand that the military doesn't fight with bayonets and horses anymore. But the reality is that Mr. Obama's request is for a Navy unseen since 1916. And for an Air Force little improved from the one our fathers knew. And for a tanker fleet so ancient, all operations are analog. And for a bomber fleet conceived during the Carter years. In that context, cute horse comments are a lame comeback.
If your aim is to win in Virginia, it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet (note to the Obama team). Defense workers in Ohio and Virginia are game for more investment. If you want to score points on national defense, it's probably best not to be snide (though hipsters love it). Truth be told, many who believe in America's national mission are comfortable with the "peace through strength" message Mr. Romney sought to convey. 
Fundamentally, the question is less about the score that Twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession. Rather, it's about who sends a message of American resolve, belief in American power, and commitment to American investment in defense. If that's what matters to you - be you American voter, adversary, or terrorist - then it's likely that Mr. Romney's message, on principle and politics, hit home a little harder than Mr. Obama's. And that, folks, is what the debates are all about.

12:52 a.m. Ross Douthat | Mitt's New Modesty 
When Mitt Romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the Islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of Mali - a reference obscure to almost every viewer, except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our Libyan intervention - I had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time: I thought, hey, he's talking to me. 
That sense persisted for much of the night. As a conservative who's grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn't turn up in Iraq, I've been critical of Romney throughout this campaign for trying to out-hawk President Obama at every turn, and for trying to sell a war-weary public on the largely implausible idea that Obama is a weak-kneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas. But tonight, given the chance to throw that argument in the president's face, the Republican nominee mostly soft-pedaled it, shying away from sharp contrasts, emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace.
Romney's turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on Afghanistan, where he basically endorsed the White House's plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats. But the same difference-blurring thread ran through almost all his answers. Yes, he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on Obama's supposed "apology tour" in the Middle East, but otherwise this debate felt like a 90-minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out: Strip away the "no apologies" rhetoric, and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest.
This isn't necessarily a good thing for the country, which probably deserves a more robust debate over American strategy than the one we just watched. And by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president's, Romney almost guaranteed that Obama would win the debate on points - which the president pretty clearly did, deploying the advantages of incumbency (not to mention the execution of a certain Al Qaeda leader) effectively in an arena where Americans are still inclined to trust him.
The question is what the audience was looking for. If they were looking for evidence that a Romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas, then they probably came away disappointed, and Obama's win will boost him in the polls. But if they were just looking (as I'll admit that I was looking) to be reassured that Romney is something other than a wild-eyed warmonger, then the Republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat.

10:14 p.m. Lynn Vavreck | Why Won't They Stop Agreeing? 
If we ask people to assess President Obama's performance on foreign policy issues, we get judgments so closely tied to party identification they are hardly worth discussing. But when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on America's role in the world, there are some surprising areas of agreement - in fact, strong agreement it turns out.
Using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project on the appropriate use of military force, we find that we are not polarized over everything. Ensuring access to oil, destroying terrorist camps, intervening in a civil war, assisting the spread of democracy, and helping our allies are all actions on which most Americans agree - and sometimes profoundly so. The only worthy uses of our military forces, the respondents say, are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies; the rest are not.
Helping the United Nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties - Democrats think it is appropriate and Republicans soundly disagree (I've presented the percentages separately on this line for Democrats and Republicans).
But, lest you think the nation isn't polarized on foreign policy, consider this: on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties. On the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp, 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve. On average, women's support for the use of force is less strong than men's, by about 10 points.
With women making up the larger share (60 percent) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes, it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement. And although there is no gender divide on whether Romney "says what he believes," there is a gender difference on whether Obama is sincere. Women are 11 points more likely, on average, to think Obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about Obama relative to Romney.

11:22 p.m. Husain Haqqani | A Doomed Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan
President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden's killing, "If we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him." But if Pakistan can't be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he'd deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years. 
Mr. Romney seems committed to changing Pakistani behavior. And although he claims he wouldn't "divorce" Pakistan, Mr. Romney's answer showed that he would downgrade Pakistan's status as an American ally. Demanding policy changes from Pakistan in return for American support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the United States might successfully deploy to that end.
The discussion over Afghanistan and Pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing Islamist extremism. Mr. Obama defines success against Al Qaeda very narrowly, glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region after the withdrawal of American combat forces in 2014. Mr. Obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge. 
Killing bin Laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the United States and its allies safe from terrorists. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the Muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan has not been completely disrupted. Little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young Muslims into terrorist training camps. And the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that America simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from Muslim regions at very little cost.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table. It is unrealistic to assume that a professional Afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame. The Taliban's ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy.
The United States could have withdrawn from Afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn't announced a deadline for its withdrawal. That deadline also took away any incentive for Pakistan's military to work with the United States against the Taliban, thinking that it could instead sit the Americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a post-American Afghanistan. The Obama administration didn't succeed in persuading or coercing Pakistan into acting against the Taliban and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few pro-American elements in Pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists. 
It's fine to say "We do not want or like war'' but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy, such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, are wars of necessity. Such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war's aims and its strategy.

11:37 p.m. Eric L. Lewis | Mitt's Romney's Egypt
Pity poor Egypt. After suffering through thirty years of the Mubarak kleptocracy, the people of Egypt rose up, deposed the dictator and elected a new president, Mohammed Morsi. To be sure, the victory of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood may not have been the first choice of American policy makers, but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes.
The new Egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the Mubarak regime, which was reliable, but at the expense of human rights, economic development, transparency and hope for the Egyptian people. Yet Morsi promptly reaffirmed what President Obama called in tonight's debate a "red line," the peace treaty with Israel, which has permitted Israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region.
None of these developments appear to satisfy Mitt Romney, who characterized Egypt as part of the "chaos" and "extremism" of Syria and Mali. While hailing the progress in Libya as "wonderful," he warns that "next door" is Egypt, where the election of a "Muslim brotherhood President" constitutes a "reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region." Romney said he would not have supported retaining Mubarak, but he views the outcome of a free election - indeed a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution - as a failure of the Arab Spring.
It is way too early to declare Egypt a success. It is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for sixty years. It is a country of 80 million people, many of whom live in terrible poverty. It exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them. Its Coptic Christian minority is uneasy, to say the least. The business community has largely remained on the sidelines. And many in its new government have spent the last thirty years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the Mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state.
But Romney's suggestion that the election of a Muslim Brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of Muslim ruling parties with "jihadists" and "terrorists." Syria and Iran were Baathist governments, nominally socialist secular states. The Assad clan and Saddam Hussein did not kill in the name of jihad. President Recip Erdogan in Turkey governs as a moderate Islamist, sharing some ideological roots with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran?
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that.

12:01 a.m. Michael S. Doran | Romney's Strategy for Syria 
On Syria, Mitt Romney won - but only on points, certainly not with a knock-out blow. Mr. Romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision. He framed the civil war in Syria as an opportunity, a chance to strike at Iran. "Syria," Mr. Romney said, "is Iran's only ally in the Arab world," stressing the role the regime of Bashar al-Assad plays as Iran's base for extending its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Toppling Mr. Assad, Mr. Romney correctly explained, would deal a blow to Hezbollah and roll back Iranian influence throughout the region.
By contrast, President Obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken, but failed to place them in a wider context. He did not even mention Iran in the course of the discussion.
Syria represents a very rare thing in international politics: a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment. At least 30,000 have died, and millions have been made refugees. As the greatest power in the Middle East, the United States is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity. 
Yet, in fact, the Obama administration has been relatively passive, as Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey recently complained. "Right now," Mr. Erdogan said, "there are certain things being expected from the United States," but America has "not yet catered to those expectations." In the debate tonight Mr. Romney struck a similar note, stressing that America "should be playing the leadership role." 
But Mr. Romney did not define a clear path forward. The president claimed that Romney "doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership." There was truth in the statement.
At a moment when there is no appetite among Americans for a new foreign adventure, Mr. Romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the American military in Syria. He even rejected the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. Yet an American-implemented no-fly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the Romney strategic vision into a practical reality.
Mr. Romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in Syria, but when it came to specifics, his policy differed little from the president's.

12:02 a.m. Daniel W. Drezner | The Anti-Bellum Romney 
Many people believe that Mitt Romney won the first debate because of Barack Obama's somnambulant performance. That overlooked Romney's deft pivot to the center, which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation. This is consistent with a truism in political science: in an election, candidates try to target the median voter. In presidential politics, candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party's ideological base - but in general elections, they target the moderates, because those are the voters decide the election.
Romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate. After a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric, the governor sounded different tonight. He argued that "we can't kill our way out of" the problems in the Middle East. He averred that "we want a peaceful planet." He explicitly stated he didn't want to get involved militarily in Syria. Romney said the sanctions in Iran were working. He praised the president on numerous fronts - Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular. He even talked about China as a partner before bashing its trade policies. To be fair, the governor has said some of this before, but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace, not brute force.
In doing all this, Romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas. Romney's sotto voce message was that he would be a hot-headed, trigger-happy cowboy - like the Last Republican President Who Shall Not Be Named. For undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars, this could be very soothing indeed.
Will it work? One difference between this debate and the one in Denver is that President Obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time. The president was ready, willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in Romney's previous statements and claims. He accused Romney of being "all over the map" on numerous issues. He also ridiculed Romney's proposed naval buildup, pointing out that foreign policy wasn't a game of Battleship. It seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments - as opposed to simply treading water on the economy.
For the past month, Mitt Romney had been chipping away at Obama's foreign policy record. Tonight he seemed to want to emulate it. His clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander-in-chief. That way, they can ignore Obama's critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years. We'll find out over the next few days if he succeeded.

12:21 a.m. Anne-Marie Slaughter | America's Narcissism 
The much-heralded foreign policy debate wasn't really a debate, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues. And it was barely about foreign policy, as education reform (we all love teachers), Detroit, nation-building at home, and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and China. 
Romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme: "America must promote principles of peace." Obama looked and sounded every inch the commander-in-chief. But the lasting impression of the debate, certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world, is just how narrowly Americans define foreign policy. Neither candidate mentioned NATO. Indeed, neither candidate mentioned the European Union or the Eurozone crisis, other than Mr. Romney's dire predictions that the United States will soon be Greece unless he is elected. 
Moving east, the candidates barely mentioned a single country in East Asia other than China. There was only the briefest reference to Japan (our closest ally in Asia) by the moderator and a single mention of North Korea (another very dangerous nuclear power). Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, didn't come up. For that matter, there was no reference to India (a mere billion people). This silence is all the more striking given Mr. Obama's reference at the end of the debate to his administration's purported "pivot to Asia," a pivot that was supposed to be away from the Middle East. Yet when Mr. Obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the United States he said terrorist networks; Mr. Romney said a nuclear Iran.
Beyond individual countries, consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world. Neither candidate ever uttered the word "climate." Or drug violence. Or poverty, disease, food, water, or even energy. 
This really wasn't a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio. From a real foreign policy perspective, a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems, we can only hope the rest of the world wasn't listening.

12:41 a.m. Hanin Ghaddar | The Winner: Bashar al-Assad 
Tonight's debate was expected to reveal the candidates' thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the American foreign policy. However, this debate offered very little. 
Syria is a case in point. Both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards Syria. They both want to make friends with the Syrian people, but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to Israel. 
Governor Mitt Romney was simply advocating President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, which is inaction. There are simply no meaningful differences. Both want to let the Syrian people "determine their own fate," which so far has been a very bloody and dark one. 
Power comes with responsibility, and the Syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world. On both Twitter and Facebook, Syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates. They saw America's power implemented in Libya and wanted the same treatment. However, it seems both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have washed their hands of the Syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat. 
The policy of inaction in Syria, which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins, has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented, and also to the rise of Islamists. Because of inaction in Syria, the United States is losing the opportunity to lead. America's inaction in Syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, and last but not least Lebanon, where a car bomb killed senior Lebanese security official Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country. More inaction will mean more sectarian violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the region. The United States and its allies surely do not wish to see that. 
For the Syrian people, intervention never meant boots on the ground. They have specifically asked for safe havens and anti-aircraft missiles, not more. That's all they need to defeat the Assad regime. Both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail. The Syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the United States to offer. Instead, all they heard was "we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won't use it against us." Without trust, there can be no friendship. 
The only difference between the two was that Romney seemed to see the Middle East as one big space of terror. He repeatedly referred to the developments in past two years in the region as chaos and tumult. This is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives, and still are, in order to topple their dictators. That's also a bad way to make friends. 
The Syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins, they are on their own, and that the big winner of this debate is Bashar al-Assad.

12:47 a.m. Danielle Pletka | Don't Diss Defense Workers 
If what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight, you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by Barack Obama's rather robotic insistence on "nation building here at home." If you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration (the plan that would likely cut $500 billion from the defense budget in January 2013), the President's blithe assertion that it won't happen - no proof, no policy, just "I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message" - may not have convinced you. 
On the other hand, Mitt Romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that, by the end of this decade, Americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt that they will on national security. 
Mr. Romney recycled the oft-used sentiment that the President's request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917. Mr. Obama quoted Mr. Romney's talking points back to him, citing the actual year - 1916 - and ridiculed Romney's failure to understand that the military doesn't fight with bayonets and horses anymore. But the reality is that Mr. Obama's request is for a Navy unseen since 1916. And for an Air Force little improved from the one our fathers knew. And for a tanker fleet so ancient, all operations are analog. And for a bomber fleet conceived during the Carter years. In that context, cute horse comments are a lame comeback.
If your aim is to win in Virginia, it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet (note to the Obama team). Defense workers in Ohio and Virginia are game for more investment. If you want to score points on national defense, it's probably best not to be snide (though hipsters love it). Truth be told, many who believe in America's national mission are comfortable with the "peace through strength" message Mr. Romney sought to convey. 
Fundamentally, the question is less about the score that Twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession. Rather, it's about who sends a message of American resolve, belief in American power, and commitment to American investment in defense. If that's what matters to you - be you American voter, adversary, or terrorist - then it's likely that Mr. Romney's message, on principle and politics, hit home a little harder than Mr. Obama's. And that, folks, is what the debates are all about.

12:52 a.m. Ross Douthat | Mitt's New Modesty 
When Mitt Romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the Islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of Mali - a reference obscure to almost every viewer, except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our Libyan intervention - I had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time: I thought, hey, he's talking to me. 
That sense persisted for much of the night. As a conservative who's grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn't turn up in Iraq, I've been critical of Romney throughout this campaign for trying to out-hawk President Obama at every turn, and for trying to sell a war-weary public on the largely implausible idea that Obama is a weak-kneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas. But tonight, given the chance to throw that argument in the president's face, the Republican nominee mostly soft-pedaled it, shying away from sharp contrasts, emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace.
Romney's turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on Afghanistan, where he basically endorsed the White House's plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats. But the same difference-blurring thread ran through almost all his answers. Yes, he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on Obama's supposed "apology tour" in the Middle East, but otherwise this debate felt like a 90-minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out: Strip away the "no apologies" rhetoric, and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest.
This isn't necessarily a good thing for the country, which probably deserves a more robust debate over American strategy than the one we just watched. And by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president's, Romney almost guaranteed that Obama would win the debate on points - which the president pretty clearly did, deploying the advantages of incumbency (not to mention the execution of a certain Al Qaeda leader) effectively in an arena where Americans are still inclined to trust him.
The question is what the audience was looking for. If they were looking for evidence that a Romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas, then they probably came away disappointed, and Obama's win will boost him in the polls. But if they were just looking (as I'll admit that I was looking) to be reassured that Romney is something other than a wild-eyed warmonger, then the Republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat.

1:09 a.m. Dalia Dassa Kaye | A Crucial Difference on Iran
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama had some sharp rhetorical exchanges, but on substance there were few discernible differences. If Mr. Obama was expecting Mr. Romney to distinguish himself by supporting military policies that would be unpopular with Americans (whether in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Iran), he was likely disappointed. Mr. Romney went out of his way to argue that killing bad guys would not be enough to fight radical forces; economic development, education and civil society are key ingredients to future stability. Mr. Obama couldn't agree more.
Mr. Obama said his aim is to get Iran to stop its "nuclear program," while Romney spoke about preventing a "nuclear-capable" Iran. But neither candidate defined the point in Iran's nuclear enrichment that would trigger military action. Both agreed military action would be the last resort. And Mr. Romney even credited Mr. Obama for applying crippling sanctions, only criticizing him for not doing it earlier (which of course Mr. Obama denied) and suggesting he would find ways to strengthen them. 
But on the Iran file, a consequential distinction emerged. For Mr. Obama, the intent of crippling sanctions is to bring Iran to the negotiating table to agree to give up its nuclear program and abide by United Nations resolutions, arguing there's a "deal to be had." In contrast, Mr. Romney called for diplomatic isolation of Iran, arguing Iran's diplomats should be treated like pariahs around the world. Diplomatic pressure, as Mr. Romney advocates, is not the same as negotiations. The dilemma is how sanctions and pressure would dissuade Iran's leaders from pursuing their nuclear program (as Mr. Romney recommended) if a President Romney wouldn't agree to sit down and talk with them. 
Mr. Obama did not appear to pick up on this disconnect, most likely because he wanted to emphasize the "tough" aspects of his Iran policy and not the off-ramp strategy that will inevitably involve bilateral negotiations with Iran. But if a Romney administration were to pursue a policy shunning diplomacy, it is hard to see how the current sanctions policies, and more covert actions like sabotage, would lead to a resolution. The more likely scenario if diplomacy is rejected or fails is continued escalation--and potentially war.

1:35 a.m. Sheena Chestnut Greitens | Where was Asia?
Tonight both presidential candidates acknowledged the centrality of Asia to America's interests. The Obama administration offers its "Asia pivot" as a foreign policy success story. Mitt Romney wants a bigger Navy to keep America's commitments in the region credible and robust. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, 60 percent of the Navy's warships will be located in the Pacific by 2020. 
Not once tonight did anyone talk about what those ships are going to do when they get there. 
Tonight's foreign policy debate allotted less than 15 of its 90 minutes to Asia, a region with the world's fastest economic growth rates and over half of its population. The only country receiving more than a passing mention was China, and even China was discussed only in economic terms. 
How to handle the security relationship between the two countries with the world's largest military budgets went unmentioned, as did the United States' broader strategy in a region critical to American security interests, where the next president will have to make a series of tough choices and may well face multiple foreign policy crises. 
There was no discussion of American policy on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 American forces stand watch in a war that has not ended, and where our allies this weekend evacuated residents along the DMZ after North Korea threatened to retaliate against an activist group's balloon launch with artillery fire. 
There was no discussion of the recently announced plan to rotate more American planes, ships, and personnel through the Philippines, which in April sailed an American-made cutter into confrontation with China in disputed waters, and then suggested that America was obligated to assist in that confrontation under the terms of a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. 
There was no discussion of Taiwan, which asked the United States for over 60 new F-16 fighters and last year got a $5.8 billion upgrade to its old ones instead - a decision that the official Chinese press called "a despicable breach of faith" - or of the American "Air-Sea Battle" concept generally perceived to be a template for future conflict with China. 
There was no discussion of whether America's commitment to those who call for democracy and human rights - a commitment both candidates affirmed - can or should extend past Tunisia and Tahrir to Tibet, where over fifty people have set themselves on fire without producing the political change that a single self-immolation sparked in the Arab World. 
Today the world's attention is riveted on crises in the Middle East. Tomorrow's flashpoints lie in Asia. Unfortunately, tonight's debate did little to clarify how either candidate would handle a 3 a.m. phone call that comes not from Benghazi, but from Beijing.

1:48 a.m. Nathan Thrall | Not Enough Daylight on Israel 
Monday's debate in Boca Raton offered another venue for President Obama and Mitt Romney to compete over who can appear closer to Israel. Mr. Obama trumpeted his administration's "unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation" with Israel, while Mr. Romney advertised his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Mr. Obama contrasted Mr. Romney's decision to use his recent trip to Israel to "take donors" and "attend fundraisers" with the president's own visits to Israel's Holocaust memorial and the "town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas." Mr. Romney countered by asserting that the president had generated "turmoil" with Israel, noting that 38 Democratic senators had signed a letter urging him to repair the damage. 
Mr. Romney also repeated his earlier criticism of the president having reportedly stated that there should be daylight between the United States and Israel when negotiating a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet, by definition, some distance must exist between a mediator and the parties to a negotiation if that mediator is to live up to its claim of being an honest broker. 
If wishing to eliminate any daylight between the America and one party to the conflict is Mr. Romney's desire, it is one at odds with his professed goal to help Israel and the Palestinians reach a peace agreement - a goal he did not seem to possess when at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida earlier this year he said the Palestinians have "no interest whatsoever in establishing peace," and "the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish." Romney went on:
You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem - and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.
Kicking the ball down the field while professing an interest in an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is precisely what President Obama has been doing for the last several years. The policy of the next administration, whether Mr. Romney's first or Mr. Obama's second, will be to uphold this status quo: supporting an unelected Palestinian prime minister and a Palestinian president whose term long ago expired; continuing to prevent the exercise of power by the victors in the last Palestinian national election; negotiating with a set of unelected P.L.O. leaders who cannot credibly claim to represent most Palestinians; prioritizing the funding of Palestinian security forces who arrest their political opponents and prevent peaceful protests against Israeli settlements and military installations; and meekly criticizing Israel's expanding settlement construction while exercising no leverage in order to thwart it. 
These policies will eventually backfire, as they have in other parts of the region where the United States stood against popular aspirations and supported authoritarian regimes. But between the candidates on these issues there is precious little daylight.

10:14 p.m. Lynn Vavreck | Why Won't They Stop Agreeing? 
If we ask people to assess President Obama's performance on foreign policy issues, we get judgments so closely tied to party identification they are hardly worth discussing. But when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on America's role in the world, there are some surprising areas of agreement - in fact, strong agreement it turns out.
Using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project on the appropriate use of military force, we find that we are not polarized over everything. Ensuring access to oil, destroying terrorist camps, intervening in a civil war, assisting the spread of democracy, and helping our allies are all actions on which most Americans agree - and sometimes profoundly so. The only worthy uses of our military forces, the respondents say, are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies; the rest are not.
Helping the United Nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties - Democrats think it is appropriate and Republicans soundly disagree (I've presented the percentages separately on this line for Democrats and Republicans).
But, lest you think the nation isn't polarized on foreign policy, consider this: on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties. On the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp, 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve. On average, women's support for the use of force is less strong than men's, by about 10 points.
With women making up the larger share (60 percent) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes, it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement. And although there is no gender divide on whether Romney "says what he believes," there is a gender difference on whether Obama is sincere. Women are 11 points more likely, on average, to think Obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about Obama relative to Romney.

11:22 p.m. Husain Haqqani | A Doomed Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan
President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden's killing, "If we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him." But if Pakistan can't be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he'd deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years. 
Mr. Romney seems committed to changing Pakistani behavior. And although he claims he wouldn't "divorce" Pakistan, Mr. Romney's answer showed that he would downgrade Pakistan's status as an American ally. Demanding policy changes from Pakistan in return for American support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the United States might successfully deploy to that end.
The discussion over Afghanistan and Pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing Islamist extremism. Mr. Obama defines success against Al Qaeda very narrowly, glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region after the withdrawal of American combat forces in 2014. Mr. Obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge. 
Killing bin Laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the United States and its allies safe from terrorists. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the Muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan has not been completely disrupted. Little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young Muslims into terrorist training camps. And the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that America simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from Muslim regions at very little cost.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table. It is unrealistic to assume that a professional Afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame. The Taliban's ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy.
The United States could have withdrawn from Afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn't announced a deadline for its withdrawal. That deadline also took away any incentive for Pakistan's military to work with the United States against the Taliban, thinking that it could instead sit the Americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a post-American Afghanistan. The Obama administration didn't succeed in persuading or coercing Pakistan into acting against the Taliban and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few pro-American elements in Pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists. 
It's fine to say "We do not want or like war'' but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy, such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, are wars of necessity. Such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war's aims and its strategy.

11:37 p.m. Eric L. Lewis | Mitt's Romney's Egypt 
Pity poor Egypt. After suffering through thirty years of the Mubarak kleptocracy, the people of Egypt rose up, deposed the dictator and elected a new president, Mohammed Morsi. To be sure, the victory of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood may not have been the first choice of American policy makers, but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes.
The new Egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the Mubarak regime, which was reliable, but at the expense of human rights, economic development, transparency and hope for the Egyptian people. Yet Morsi promptly reaffirmed what President Obama called in tonight's debate a "red line," the peace treaty with Israel, which has permitted Israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region.
None of these developments appear to satisfy Mitt Romney, who characterized Egypt as part of the "chaos" and "extremism" of Syria and Mali. While hailing the progress in Libya as "wonderful," he warns that "next door" is Egypt, where the election of a "Muslim brotherhood President" constitutes a "reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region." Romney said he would not have supported retaining Mubarak, but he views the outcome of a free election - indeed a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution - as a failure of the Arab Spring.
It is way too early to declare Egypt a success. It is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for sixty years. It is a country of 80 million people, many of whom live in terrible poverty. It exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them. Its Coptic Christian minority is uneasy, to say the least. The business community has largely remained on the sidelines. And many in its new government have spent the last thirty years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the Mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state.
But Romney's suggestion that the election of a Muslim Brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of Muslim ruling parties with "jihadists" and "terrorists." Syria and Iran were Baathist governments, nominally socialist secular states. The Assad clan and Saddam Hussein did not kill in the name of jihad. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey governs as a moderate Islamist, sharing some ideological roots with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran? 
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that.

12:01 a.m. Michael S. Doran | Romney's Strategy for Syria 
On Syria, Mitt Romney won - but only on points, certainly not with a knock-out blow. Mr. Romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision. He framed the civil war in Syria as an opportunity, a chance to strike at Iran. "Syria," Mr. Romney said, "is Iran's only ally in the Arab world," stressing the role the regime of Bashar al-Assad plays as Iran's base for extending its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Toppling Mr. Assad, Mr. Romney correctly explained, would deal a blow to Hezbollah and roll back Iranian influence throughout the region.
By contrast, President Obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken, but failed to place them in a wider context. He did not even mention Iran in the course of the discussion.
Syria represents a very rare thing in international politics: a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment. At least 30,000 have died, and millions have been made refugees. As the greatest power in the Middle East, the United States is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity. 
Yet, in fact, the Obama administration has been relatively passive, as Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey recently complained. "Right now," Mr. Erdogan said, "there are certain things being expected from the United States," but America has "not yet catered to those expectations." In the debate tonight Mr. Romney struck a similar note, stressing that America "should be playing the leadership role." 
But Mr. Romney did not define a clear path forward. The president claimed that Romney "doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership." There was truth in the statement.
At a moment when there is no appetite among Americans for a new foreign adventure, Mr. Romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the American military in Syria. He even rejected the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. Yet an American-implemented no-fly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the Romney strategic vision into a practical reality.
Mr. Romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in Syria, but when it came to specifics, his policy differed little from the president's.

12:02 a.m. Daniel W. Drezner | The Anti-Bellum Romney 
Many people believe that Mitt Romney won the first debate because of Barack Obama's somnambulant performance. That overlooked Romney's deft pivot to the center, which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation. This is consistent with a truism in political science: in an election, candidates try to target the median voter. In presidential politics, candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party's ideological base - but in general elections, they target the moderates, because those are the voters decide the election.
Romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate. After a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric, the governor sounded different tonight. He argued that "we can't kill our way out of" the problems in the Middle East. He averred that "we want a peaceful planet." He explicitly stated he didn't want to get involved militarily in Syria. Romney said the sanctions in Iran were working. He praised the president on numerous fronts - Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular. He even talked about China as a partner before bashing its trade policies. To be fair, the governor has said some of this before, but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace, not brute force.
In doing all this, Romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas. Romney's sotto voce message was that he would be a hot-headed, trigger-happy cowboy - like the Last Republican President Who Shall Not Be Named. For undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars, this could be very soothing indeed.
Will it work? One difference between this debate and the one in Denver is that President Obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time. The president was ready, willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in Romney's previous statements and claims. He accused Romney of being "all over the map" on numerous issues. He also ridiculed Romney's proposed naval buildup, pointing out that foreign policy wasn't a game of Battleship. It seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments - as opposed to simply treading water on the economy.
For the past month, Mitt Romney had been chipping away at Obama's foreign policy record. Tonight he seemed to want to emulate it. His clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander-in-chief. That way, they can ignore Obama's critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years. We'll find out over the next few days if he succeeded.

12:21 a.m. Anne-Marie Slaughter | America's Narcissism 
The much-heralded foreign policy debate wasn't really a debate, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues. And it was barely about foreign policy, as education reform (we all love teachers), Detroit, nation-building at home, and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and China. 
Romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme: "America must promote principles of peace." Obama looked and sounded every inch the commander-in-chief. But the lasting impression of the debate, certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world, is just how narrowly Americans define foreign policy. Neither candidate mentioned NATO. Indeed, neither candidate mentioned the European Union or the Eurozone crisis, other than Mr. Romney's dire predictions that the United States will soon be Greece unless he is elected. 
Moving east, the candidates barely mentioned a single country in East Asia other than China. There was only the briefest reference to Japan (our closest ally in Asia) by the moderator and a single mention of North Korea (another very dangerous nuclear power). Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, didn't come up. For that matter, there was no reference to India (a mere billion people). This silence is all the more striking given Mr. Obama's reference at the end of the debate to his administration's purported "pivot to Asia," a pivot that was supposed to be away from the Middle East. Yet when Mr. Obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the United States he said terrorist networks; Mr. Romney said a nuclear Iran.
Beyond individual countries, consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world. Neither candidate ever uttered the word "climate." Or drug violence. Or poverty, disease, food, water, or even energy. 
This really wasn't a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio. From a real foreign policy perspective, a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems, we can only hope the rest of the world wasn't listening.

12:41 a.m. Hanin Ghaddar | The Winner: Bashar al-Assad 
Tonight's debate was expected to reveal the candidates' thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the American foreign policy. However, this debate offered very little. 
Syria is a case in point. Both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards Syria. They both want to make friends with the Syrian people, but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to Israel. 
Governor Mitt Romney was simply advocating President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, which is inaction. There are simply no meaningful differences. Both want to let the Syrian people "determine their own fate," which so far has been a very bloody and dark one. 
Power comes with responsibility, and the Syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world. On both Twitter and Facebook, Syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates. They saw America's power implemented in Libya and wanted the same treatment. However, it seems both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have washed their hands of the Syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat. 
The policy of inaction in Syria, which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins, has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented, and also to the rise of Islamists. Because of inaction in Syria, the United States is losing the opportunity to lead. America's inaction in Syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, and last but not least Lebanon, where a car bomb killed senior Lebanese security official Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country. More inaction will mean more sectarian violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the region. The United States and its allies surely do not wish to see that. 
For the Syrian people, intervention never meant boots on the ground. They have specifically asked for safe havens and anti-aircraft missiles, not more. That's all they need to defeat the Assad regime. Both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail. The Syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the United States to offer. Instead, all they heard was "we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won't use it against us." Without trust, there can be no friendship. 
The only difference between the two was that Romney seemed to see the Middle East as one big space of terror. He repeatedly referred to the developments in past two years in the region as chaos and tumult. This is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives, and still are, in order to topple their dictators. That's also a bad way to make friends. 
The Syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins, they are on their own, and that the big winner of this debate is Bashar al-Assad.

12:47 a.m. Danielle Pletka | Don't Diss Defense Workers 
If what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight, you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by Barack Obama's rather robotic insistence on "nation building here at home." If you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration (the plan that would likely cut $500 billion from the defense budget in January 2013), the President's blithe assertion that it won't happen - no proof, no policy, just "I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message" - may not have convinced you. 
On the other hand, Mitt Romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that, by the end of this decade, Americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt that they will on national security. 
Mr. Romney recycled the oft-used sentiment that the President's request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917. Mr. Obama quoted Mr. Romney's talking points back to him, citing the actual year - 1916 - and ridiculed Romney's failure to understand that the military doesn't fight with bayonets and horses anymore. But the reality is that Mr. Obama's request is for a Navy unseen since 1916. And for an Air Force little improved from the one our fathers knew. And for a tanker fleet so ancient, all operations are analog. And for a bomber fleet conceived during the Carter years. In that context, cute horse comments are a lame comeback.
If your aim is to win in Virginia, it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet (note to the Obama team). Defense workers in Ohio and Virginia are game for more investment. If you want to score points on national defense, it's probably best not to be snide (though hipsters love it). Truth be told, many who believe in America's national mission are comfortable with the "peace through strength" message Mr. Romney sought to convey. 
Fundamentally, the question is less about the score that Twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession. Rather, it's about who sends a message of American resolve, belief in American power, and commitment to American investment in defense. If that's what matters to you - be you American voter, adversary, or terrorist - then it's likely that Mr. Romney's message, on principle and politics, hit home a little harder than Mr. Obama's. And that, folks, is what the debates are all about.

12:52 a.m. Ross Douthat | Mitt's New Modesty 
When Mitt Romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the Islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of Mali - a reference obscure to almost every viewer, except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our Libyan intervention - I had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time: I thought, hey, he's talking to me. 
That sense persisted for much of the night. As a conservative who's grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn't turn up in Iraq, I've been critical of Romney throughout this campaign for trying to out-hawk President Obama at every turn, and for trying to sell a war-weary public on the largely implausible idea that Obama is a weak-kneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas. But tonight, given the chance to throw that argument in the president's face, the Republican nominee mostly soft-pedaled it, shying away from sharp contrasts, emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace.
Romney's turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on Afghanistan, where he basically endorsed the White House's plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats. But the same difference-blurring thread ran through almost all his answers. Yes, he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on Obama's supposed "apology tour" in the Middle East, but otherwise this debate felt like a 90-minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out: Strip away the "no apologies" rhetoric, and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest.
This isn't necessarily a good thing for the country, which probably deserves a more robust debate over American strategy than the one we just watched. And by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president's, Romney almost guaranteed that Obama would win the debate on points - which the president pretty clearly did, deploying the advantages of incumbency (not to mention the execution of a certain Al Qaeda leader) effectively in an arena where Americans are still inclined to trust him.
The question is what the audience was looking for. If they were looking for evidence that a Romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas, then they probably came away disappointed, and Obama's win will boost him in the polls. But if they were just looking (as I'll admit that I was looking) to be reassured that Romney is something other than a wild-eyed warmonger, then the Republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat.

1:09 a.m. Dalia Dassa Kaye | A Crucial Difference on Iran 
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama had some sharp rhetorical exchanges, but on substance there were few discernible differences. If Mr. Obama was expecting Mr. Romney to distinguish himself by supporting military policies that would be unpopular with Americans (whether in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Iran), he was likely disappointed. Mr. Romney went out of his way to argue that killing bad guys would not be enough to fight radical forces; economic development, education and civil society are key ingredients to future stability. Mr. Obama couldn't agree more.
Mr. Obama said his aim is to get Iran to stop its "nuclear program," while Romney spoke about preventing a "nuclear-capable" Iran. But neither candidate defined the point in Iran's nuclear enrichment that would trigger military action. Both agreed military action would be the last resort. And Mr. Romney even credited Mr. Obama for applying crippling sanctions, only criticizing him for not doing it earlier (which of course Mr. Obama denied) and suggesting he would find ways to strengthen them. 
But on the Iran file, a consequential distinction emerged. For Mr. Obama, the intent of crippling sanctions is to bring Iran to the negotiating table to agree to give up its nuclear program and abide by United Nations resolutions, arguing there's a "deal to be had." In contrast, Mr. Romney called for diplomatic isolation of Iran, arguing Iran's diplomats should be treated like pariahs around the world. Diplomatic pressure, as Mr. Romney advocates, is not the same as negotiations. The dilemma is how sanctions and pressure would dissuade Iran's leaders from pursuing their nuclear program (as Mr. Romney recommended) if a President Romney wouldn't agree to sit down and talk with them. 
Mr. Obama did not appear to pick up on this disconnect, most likely because he wanted to emphasize the "tough" aspects of his Iran policy and not the off-ramp strategy that will inevitably involve bilateral negotiations with Iran. But if a Romney administration were to pursue a policy shunning diplomacy, it is hard to see how the current sanctions policies, and more covert actions like sabotage, would lead to a resolution. The more likely scenario if diplomacy is rejected or fails is continued escalation--and potentially war.

1:35 a.m. Sheena Chestnut Greitens | Where was Asia? 
Tonight both presidential candidates acknowledged the centrality of Asia to America's interests. The Obama administration offers its "Asia pivot" as a foreign policy success story. Mitt Romney wants a bigger Navy to keep America's commitments in the region credible and robust. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, 60 percent of the Navy's warships will be located in the Pacific by 2020. 
Not once tonight did anyone talk about what those ships are going to do when they get there. 
Tonight's foreign policy debate allotted less than 15 of its 90 minutes to Asia, a region with the world's fastest economic growth rates and over half of its population. The only country receiving more than a passing mention was China, and even China was discussed only in economic terms. 
How to handle the security relationship between the two countries with the world's largest military budgets went unmentioned, as did the United States' broader strategy in a region critical to American security interests, where the next president will have to make a series of tough choices and may well face multiple foreign policy crises. 
There was no discussion of American policy on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 American forces stand watch in a war that has not ended, and where our allies this weekend evacuated residents along the DMZ after North Korea threatened to retaliate against an activist group's balloon launch with artillery fire. 
There was no discussion of the recently announced plan to rotate more American planes, ships, and personnel through the Philippines, which in April sailed an American-made cutter into confrontation with China in disputed waters, and then suggested that America was obligated to assist in that confrontation under the terms of a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. 
There was no discussion of Taiwan, which asked the United States for over 60 new F-16 fighters and last year got a $5.8 billion upgrade to its old ones instead - a decision that the official Chinese press called "a despicable breach of faith" - or of the American "Air-Sea Battle" concept generally perceived to be a template for future conflict with China. 
There was no discussion of whether America's commitment to those who call for democracy and human rights - a commitment both candidates affirmed - can or should extend past Tunisia and Tahrir to Tibet, where over fifty people have set themselves on fire without producing the political change that a single self-immolation sparked in the Arab World. 
Today the world's attention is riveted on crises in the Middle East. Tomorrow's flashpoints lie in Asia. Unfortunately, tonight's debate did little to clarify how either candidate would handle a 3 a.m. phone call that comes not from Benghazi, but from Beijing.

1:48 a.m. Nathan Thrall | Not Enough Daylight on Israel 
Monday's debate in Boca Raton offered another venue for President Obama and Mitt Romney to compete over who can appear closer to Israel. Mr. Obama trumpeted his administration's "unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation" with Israel, while Mr. Romney advertised his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Mr. Obama contrasted Mr. Romney's decision to use his recent trip to Israel to "take donors" and "attend fundraisers" with the president's own visits to Israel's Holocaust memorial and the "town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas." Mr. Romney countered by asserting that the president had generated "turmoil" with Israel, noting that 38 Democratic senators had signed a letter urging him to repair the damage. 
Mr. Romney also repeated his earlier criticism of the president having reportedly stated that there should be daylight between the United States and Israel when negotiating a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet, by definition, some distance must exist between a mediator and the parties to a negotiation if that mediator is to live up to its claim of being an honest broker. 
If wishing to eliminate any daylight between America and one party to the conflict is Mr. Romney's desire, it is one at odds with his professed goal to help Israelis and the Palestinians reach a peace agreement - a goal he did not seem to possess when at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida earlier this year he said the Palestinians have "no interest whatsoever in establishing peace," and "the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish." Romney went on:
You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem - and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.
Kicking the ball down the field while professing an interest in an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is precisely what President Obama has been doing for the last several years. The policy of the next administration, whether Mr. Romney's first or Mr. Obama's second, will be to uphold this status quo: supporting an unelected Palestinian prime minister and a Palestinian president whose term long ago expired; continuing to prevent the exercise of power by the victors in the last Palestinian national election; negotiating with a set of unelected P.L.O. leaders who cannot credibly claim to represent most Palestinians; prioritizing the funding of Palestinian security forces who arrest their political opponents and prevent peaceful protests against Israeli settlements and military installations; and meekly criticizing Israel's expanding settlement construction while exercising no leverage in order to thwart it. 
These policies will eventually backfire, as they have in other parts of the region where the United States stood against popular aspirations and supported authoritarian regimes. But on these issues, there is precious little daylight between the candidates.

2:09 a.m. Marisa Porges | Shopping List Foreign Policy 
At least Game 7 of the National League Championship Series was a blowout. But if you chose to watch tonight's debate instead of baseball - hoping, like many of us, for clarity on the next four years of American foreign policy - you were sorely disappointed.
What did we hear? Not a lot. Not a single mention of looming cyber threats, despite the fact that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently sounded an alarm about America's vulnerability to a possible "cyber Pearl Harbor." No mention of Yemen and the growing influence of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many consider the most significant terrorist threat in the world. Nor was there any discussion of Guantnamo or the future of American detention operations, leaving major questions unanswered about how the United States would handle captured terrorists in the future.
How would each candidate face the considerable challenges of the Afghanistan transition - like propping up the Afghan security forces, trying to negotiate a settlement with the Taliban, or forestalling a full-scale civil war after American and NATO forces depart? Apparently, it's not a concern. For Mr. Romney, it was simple as saying the Afghans "will be ready by the end of 2014." Full stop. While President Obama acknowledged in passing that the transition in Afghanistan "has to take place in a responsible fashion," he quickly changed course and began talking about veterans and jobs in America. Both are critical issues, to be sure. But neither is particularly helpful for those wondering if thousands of American lives lost and billions of dollars spent in Afghanistan will be wasted by a poorly executed transition.
Those concerned with the future of American engagement in the Middle East were likewise frustrated. Regarding the ongoing threat of extremism in the Arab World, Mr. Romney simply suggested a shopping list of grand objectives: economic development, better education, gender equality, and rule of law--a plan that sounds an awful lot like nation building. What remained entirely unclear is how Mr. Romney would actually make progress on any of these fronts, particularly in countries of critical concern. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama pointed out that we "cannot just meet these challenges militarily" and quickly mentioned religious minorities and women and encouraging economic development before neatly sidestepping to "nation building here at home."
Ultimately, tonight's debate didn't change many (any?) voters' opinions about either candidate. And it left national security wonks I know banging their heads against the table, still wondering how the election will affect America's foreign policies in the years ahead. But at least we're now certain the military has fewer bayonets than it did in 1916.

10:14 p.m. Lynn Vavreck | Why Won't They Stop Agreeing? 
If we ask people to assess President Obama's performance on foreign policy issues, we get judgments so closely tied to party identification they are hardly worth discussing. But when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on America's role in the world, there are some surprising areas of agreement - in fact, strong agreement it turns out.
Using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project on the appropriate use of military force, we find that we are not polarized over everything. Ensuring access to oil, destroying terrorist camps, intervening in a civil war, assisting the spread of democracy, and helping our allies are all actions on which most Americans agree - and sometimes profoundly so. The only worthy uses of our military forces, the respondents say, are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies; the rest are not.
Helping the United Nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties - Democrats think it is appropriate and Republicans soundly disagree (I've presented the percentages separately on this line for Democrats and Republicans).
But, lest you think the nation isn't polarized on foreign policy, consider this: on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties. On the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp, 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve. On average, women's support for the use of force is less strong than men's, by about 10 points.
With women making up the larger share (60 percent) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes, it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement. And although there is no gender divide on whether Romney "says what he believes," there is a gender difference on whether Obama is sincere. Women are 11 points more likely, on average, to think Obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about Obama relative to Romney.

11:22 p.m. Husain Haqqani | A Doomed Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan
President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden's killing, "If we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him." But if Pakistan can't be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he'd deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years. 
Mr. Romney seems committed to changing Pakistani behavior. And although he claims he wouldn't "divorce" Pakistan, Mr. Romney's answer showed that he would downgrade Pakistan's status as an American ally. Demanding policy changes from Pakistan in return for American support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the United States might successfully deploy to that end.
The discussion over Afghanistan and Pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing Islamist extremism. Mr. Obama defines success against Al Qaeda very narrowly, glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region after the withdrawal of American combat forces in 2014. Mr. Obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge. 
Killing bin Laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the United States and its allies safe from terrorists. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the Muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan has not been completely disrupted. Little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young Muslims into terrorist training camps. And the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that America simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from Muslim regions at very little cost.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table. It is unrealistic to assume that a professional Afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame. The Taliban's ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy.
The United States could have withdrawn from Afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn't announced a deadline for its withdrawal. That deadline also took away any incentive for Pakistan's military to work with the United States against the Taliban, thinking that it could instead sit the Americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a post-American Afghanistan. The Obama administration didn't succeed in persuading or coercing Pakistan into acting against the Taliban and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few pro-American elements in Pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists. 
It's fine to say "We do not want or like war'' but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy, such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, are wars of necessity. Such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war's aims and its strategy.

11:37 p.m. Eric L. Lewis | Mitt's Romney's Egypt 
Pity poor Egypt. After suffering through thirty years of the Mubarak kleptocracy, the people of Egypt rose up, deposed the dictator and elected a new president, Mohammed Morsi. To be sure, the victory of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood may not have been the first choice of American policy makers, but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes.
The new Egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the Mubarak regime, which was reliable, but at the expense of human rights, economic development, transparency and hope for the Egyptian people. Yet Morsi promptly reaffirmed what President Obama called in tonight's debate a "red line," the peace treaty with Israel, which has permitted Israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region.
None of these developments appear to satisfy Mitt Romney, who characterized Egypt as part of the "chaos" and "extremism" of Syria and Mali. While hailing the progress in Libya as "wonderful," he warns that "next door" is Egypt, where the election of a "Muslim brotherhood President" constitutes a "reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region." Romney said he would not have supported retaining Mubarak, but he views the outcome of a free election - indeed a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution - as a failure of the Arab Spring.
It is way too early to declare Egypt a success. It is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for sixty years. It is a country of 80 million people, many of whom live in terrible poverty. It exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them. Its Coptic Christian minority is uneasy, to say the least. The business community has largely remained on the sidelines. And many in its new government have spent the last thirty years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the Mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state.
But Romney's suggestion that the election of a Muslim Brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of Muslim ruling parties with "jihadists" and "terrorists." Syria and Iran were Baathist governments, nominally socialist secular states. The Assad clan and Saddam Hussein did not kill in the name of jihad. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey governs as a moderate Islamist, sharing some ideological roots with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran? 
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that.

12:01 a.m. Michael S. Doran | Romney's Strategy for Syria 
On Syria, Mitt Romney won - but only on points, certainly not with a knock-out blow. Mr. Romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision. He framed the civil war in Syria as an opportunity, a chance to strike at Iran. "Syria," Mr. Romney said, "is Iran's only ally in the Arab world," stressing the role the regime of Bashar al-Assad plays as Iran's base for extending its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Toppling Mr. Assad, Mr. Romney correctly explained, would deal a blow to Hezbollah and roll back Iranian influence throughout the region.
By contrast, President Obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken, but failed to place them in a wider context. He did not even mention Iran in the course of the discussion.
Syria represents a very rare thing in international politics: a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment. At least 30,000 have died, and millions have been made refugees. As the greatest power in the Middle East, the United States is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity. 
Yet, in fact, the Obama administration has been relatively passive, as Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey recently complained. "Right now," Mr. Erdogan said, "there are certain things being expected from the United States," but America has "not yet catered to those expectations." In the debate tonight Mr. Romney struck a similar note, stressing that America "should be playing the leadership role." 
But Mr. Romney did not define a clear path forward. The president claimed that Romney "doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership." There was truth in the statement.
At a moment when there is no appetite among Americans for a new foreign adventure, Mr. Romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the American military in Syria. He even rejected the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. Yet an American-implemented no-fly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the Romney strategic vision into a practical reality.
Mr. Romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in Syria, but when it came to specifics, his policy differed little from the president's.

12:02 a.m. Daniel W. Drezner | The Anti-Bellum Romney 
Many people believe that Mitt Romney won the first debate because of Barack Obama's somnambulant performance. That overlooked Romney's deft pivot to the center, which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation. This is consistent with a truism in political science: in an election, candidates try to target the median voter. In presidential politics, candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party's ideological base - but in general elections, they target the moderates, because those are the voters decide the election.
Romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate. After a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric, the governor sounded different tonight. He argued that "we can't kill our way out of" the problems in the Middle East. He averred that "we want a peaceful planet." He explicitly stated he didn't want to get involved militarily in Syria. Romney said the sanctions in Iran were working. He praised the president on numerous fronts - Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular. He even talked about China as a partner before bashing its trade policies. To be fair, the governor has said some of this before, but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace, not brute force.
In doing all this, Romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas. Romney's sotto voce message was that he would be a hot-headed, trigger-happy cowboy - like the Last Republican President Who Shall Not Be Named. For undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars, this could be very soothing indeed.
Will it work? One difference between this debate and the one in Denver is that President Obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time. The president was ready, willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in Romney's previous statements and claims. He accused Romney of being "all over the map" on numerous issues. He also ridiculed Romney's proposed naval buildup, pointing out that foreign policy wasn't a game of Battleship. It seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments - as opposed to simply treading water on the economy.
For the past month, Mitt Romney had been chipping away at Obama's foreign policy record. Tonight he seemed to want to emulate it. His clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander-in-chief. That way, they can ignore Obama's critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years. We'll find out over the next few days if he succeeded.

12:21 a.m. Anne-Marie Slaughter | America's Narcissism 
The much-heralded foreign policy debate wasn't really a debate, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues. And it was barely about foreign policy, as education reform (we all love teachers), Detroit, nation-building at home, and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and China. 
Romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme: "America must promote principles of peace." Obama looked and sounded every inch the commander-in-chief. But the lasting impression of the debate, certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world, is just how narrowly Americans define foreign policy. Neither candidate mentioned NATO. Indeed, neither candidate mentioned the European Union or the Eurozone crisis, other than Mr. Romney's dire predictions that the United States will soon be Greece unless he is elected. 
Moving east, the candidates barely mentioned a single country in East Asia other than China. There was only the briefest reference to Japan (our closest ally in Asia) by the moderator and a single mention of North Korea (another very dangerous nuclear power). Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, didn't come up. For that matter, there was no reference to India (a mere billion people). This silence is all the more striking given Mr. Obama's reference at the end of the debate to his administration's purported "pivot to Asia," a pivot that was supposed to be away from the Middle East. Yet when Mr. Obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the United States he said terrorist networks; Mr. Romney said a nuclear Iran.
Beyond individual countries, consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world. Neither candidate ever uttered the word "climate." Or drug violence. Or poverty, disease, food, water, or even energy. 
This really wasn't a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio. From a real foreign policy perspective, a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems, we can only hope the rest of the world wasn't listening.

12:41 a.m. Hanin Ghaddar | The Winner: Bashar al-Assad 
Tonight's debate was expected to reveal the candidates' thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the American foreign policy. However, this debate offered very little. 
Syria is a case in point. Both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards Syria. They both want to make friends with the Syrian people, but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to Israel. 
Governor Mitt Romney was simply advocating President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, which is inaction. There are simply no meaningful differences. Both want to let the Syrian people "determine their own fate," which so far has been a very bloody and dark one. 
Power comes with responsibility, and the Syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world. On both Twitter and Facebook, Syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates. They saw America's power implemented in Libya and wanted the same treatment. However, it seems both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have washed their hands of the Syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat. 
The policy of inaction in Syria, which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins, has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented, and also to the rise of Islamists. Because of inaction in Syria, the United States is losing the opportunity to lead. America's inaction in Syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, and last but not least Lebanon, where a car bomb killed senior Lebanese security official Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country. More inaction will mean more sectarian violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the region. The United States and its allies surely do not wish to see that. 
For the Syrian people, intervention never meant boots on the ground. They have specifically asked for safe havens and anti-aircraft missiles, not more. That's all they need to defeat the Assad regime. Both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail. The Syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the United States to offer. Instead, all they heard was "we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won't use it against us." Without trust, there can be no friendship. 
The only difference between the two was that Romney seemed to see the Middle East as one big space of terror. He repeatedly referred to the developments in past two years in the region as chaos and tumult. This is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives, and still are, in order to topple their dictators. That's also a bad way to make friends. 
The Syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins, they are on their own, and that the big winner of this debate is Bashar al-Assad.

12:47 a.m. Danielle Pletka | Don't Diss Defense Workers 
If what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight, you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by Barack Obama's rather robotic insistence on "nation building here at home." If you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration (the plan that would likely cut $500 billion from the defense budget in January 2013), the President's blithe assertion that it won't happen - no proof, no policy, just "I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message" - may not have convinced you. 
On the other hand, Mitt Romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that, by the end of this decade, Americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt that they will on national security. 
Mr. Romney recycled the oft-used sentiment that the President's request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917. Mr. Obama quoted Mr. Romney's talking points back to him, citing the actual year - 1916 - and ridiculed Romney's failure to understand that the military doesn't fight with bayonets and horses anymore. But the reality is that Mr. Obama's request is for a Navy unseen since 1916. And for an Air Force little improved from the one our fathers knew. And for a tanker fleet so ancient, all operations are analog. And for a bomber fleet conceived during the Carter years. In that context, cute horse comments are a lame comeback.
If your aim is to win in Virginia, it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet (note to the Obama team). Defense workers in Ohio and Virginia are game for more investment. If you want to score points on national defense, it's probably best not to be snide (though hipsters love it). Truth be told, many who believe in America's national mission are comfortable with the "peace through strength" message Mr. Romney sought to convey. 
Fundamentally, the question is less about the score that Twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession. Rather, it's about who sends a message of American resolve, belief in American power, and commitment to American investment in defense. If that's what matters to you - be you American voter, adversary, or terrorist - then it's likely that Mr. Romney's message, on principle and politics, hit home a little harder than Mr. Obama's. And that, folks, is what the debates are all about.

12:52 a.m. Ross Douthat | Mitt's New Modesty 
When Mitt Romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the Islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of Mali - a reference obscure to almost every viewer, except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our Libyan intervention - I had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time: I thought, hey, he's talking to me. 
That sense persisted for much of the night. As a conservative who's grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn't turn up in Iraq, I've been critical of Romney throughout this campaign for trying to out-hawk President Obama at every turn, and for trying to sell a war-weary public on the largely implausible idea that Obama is a weak-kneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas. But tonight, given the chance to throw that argument in the president's face, the Republican nominee mostly soft-pedaled it, shying away from sharp contrasts, emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace.
Romney's turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on Afghanistan, where he basically endorsed the White House's plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats. But the same difference-blurring thread ran through almost all his answers. Yes, he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on Obama's supposed "apology tour" in the Middle East, but otherwise this debate felt like a 90-minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out: Strip away the "no apologies" rhetoric, and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest.
This isn't necessarily a good thing for the country, which probably deserves a more robust debate over American strategy than the one we just watched. And by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president's, Romney almost guaranteed that Obama would win the debate on points - which the president pretty clearly did, deploying the advantages of incumbency (not to mention the execution of a certain Al Qaeda leader) effectively in an arena where Americans are still inclined to trust him.
The question is what the audience was looking for. If they were looking for evidence that a Romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas, then they probably came away disappointed, and Obama's win will boost him in the polls. But if they were just looking (as I'll admit that I was looking) to be reassured that Romney is something other than a wild-eyed warmonger, then the Republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat.

1:09 a.m. Dalia Dassa Kaye | A Crucial Difference on Iran 
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama had some sharp rhetorical exchanges, but on substance there were few discernible differences. If Mr. Obama was expecting Mr. Romney to distinguish himself by supporting military policies that would be unpopular with Americans (whether in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Iran), he was likely disappointed. Mr. Romney went out of his way to argue that killing bad guys would not be enough to fight radical forces; economic development, education and civil society are key ingredients to future stability. Mr. Obama couldn't agree more.
Mr. Obama said his aim is to get Iran to stop its "nuclear program," while Romney spoke about preventing a "nuclear-capable" Iran. But neither candidate defined the point in Iran's nuclear enrichment that would trigger military action. Both agreed military action would be the last resort. And Mr. Romney even credited Mr. Obama for applying crippling sanctions, only criticizing him for not doing it earlier (which of course Mr. Obama denied) and suggesting he would find ways to strengthen them. 
But on the Iran file, a consequential distinction emerged. For Mr. Obama, the intent of crippling sanctions is to bring Iran to the negotiating table to agree to give up its nuclear program and abide by United Nations resolutions, arguing there's a "deal to be had." In contrast, Mr. Romney called for diplomatic isolation of Iran, arguing Iran's diplomats should be treated like pariahs around the world. Diplomatic pressure, as Mr. Romney advocates, is not the same as negotiations. The dilemma is how sanctions and pressure would dissuade Iran's leaders from pursuing their nuclear program (as Mr. Romney recommended) if a President Romney wouldn't agree to sit down and talk with them. 
Mr. Obama did not appear to pick up on this disconnect, most likely because he wanted to emphasize the "tough" aspects of his Iran policy and not the off-ramp strategy that will inevitably involve bilateral negotiations with Iran. But if a Romney administration were to pursue a policy shunning diplomacy, it is hard to see how the current sanctions policies, and more covert actions like sabotage, would lead to a resolution. The more likely scenario if diplomacy is rejected or fails is continued escalation--and potentially war.

1:35 a.m. Sheena Chestnut Greitens | Where was Asia? 
Tonight both presidential candidates acknowledged the centrality of Asia to America's interests. The Obama administration offers its "Asia pivot" as a foreign policy success story. Mitt Romney wants a bigger Navy to keep America's commitments in the region credible and robust. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, 60 percent of the Navy's warships will be located in the Pacific by 2020. 
Not once tonight did anyone talk about what those ships are going to do when they get there. 
Tonight's foreign policy debate allotted less than 15 of its 90 minutes to Asia, a region with the world's fastest economic growth rates and over half of its population. The only country receiving more than a passing mention was China, and even China was discussed only in economic terms. 
How to handle the security relationship between the two countries with the world's largest military budgets went unmentioned, as did the United States' broader strategy in a region critical to American security interests, where the next president will have to make a series of tough choices and may well face multiple foreign policy crises. 
There was no discussion of American policy on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 American forces stand watch in a war that has not ended, and where our allies this weekend evacuated residents along the DMZ after North Korea threatened to retaliate against an activist group's balloon launch with artillery fire. 
There was no discussion of the recently announced plan to rotate more American planes, ships, and personnel through the Philippines, which in April sailed an American-made cutter into confrontation with China in disputed waters, and then suggested that America was obligated to assist in that confrontation under the terms of a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. 
There was no discussion of Taiwan, which asked the United States for over 60 new F-16 fighters and last year got a $5.8 billion upgrade to its old ones instead - a decision that the official Chinese press called "a despicable breach of faith" - or of the American "Air-Sea Battle" concept generally perceived to be a template for future conflict with China. 
There was no discussion of whether America's commitment to those who call for democracy and human rights - a commitment both candidates affirmed - can or should extend past Tunisia and Tahrir to Tibet, where over fifty people have set themselves on fire without producing the political change that a single self-immolation sparked in the Arab World. 
Today the world's attention is riveted on crises in the Middle East. Tomorrow's flashpoints lie in Asia. Unfortunately, tonight's debate did little to clarify how either candidate would handle a 3 a.m. phone call that comes not from Benghazi, but from Beijing.

1:48 a.m. Nathan Thrall | Not Enough Daylight on Israel 
Monday's debate in Boca Raton offered another venue for President Obama and Mitt Romney to compete over who can appear closer to Israel. Mr. Obama trumpeted his administration's "unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation" with Israel, while Mr. Romney advertised his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Mr. Obama contrasted Mr. Romney's decision to use his recent trip to Israel to "take donors" and "attend fundraisers" with the president's own visits to Israel's Holocaust memorial and the "town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas." Mr. Romney countered by asserting that the president had generated "turmoil" with Israel, noting that 38 Democratic senators had signed a letter urging him to repair the damage. 
Mr. Romney also repeated his earlier criticism of the president having reportedly stated that there should be daylight between the United States and Israel when negotiating a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet, by definition, some distance must exist between a mediator and the parties to a negotiation if that mediator is to live up to its claim of being an honest broker. 
If wishing to eliminate any daylight between America and one party to the conflict is Mr. Romney's desire, it is one at odds with his professed goal to help Israelis and Palestinians reach a peace agreement - a goal he did not seem to possess when at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida earlier this year he said the Palestinians have "no interest whatsoever in establishing peace," and "the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish." Romney went on:
You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem - and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.
Kicking the ball down the field while professing an interest in an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is precisely what President Obama has been doing for the last several years. The policy of the next administration, whether Mr. Romney's first or Mr. Obama's second, will be to uphold this status quo: supporting an unelected Palestinian prime minister and a Palestinian president whose term long ago expired; continuing to prevent the exercise of power by the victors in the last Palestinian national election; negotiating with a set of unelected P.L.O. leaders who cannot credibly claim to represent most Palestinians; prioritizing the funding of Palestinian security forces who arrest their political opponents and prevent peaceful protests against Israeli settlements and military installations; and meekly criticizing Israel's expanding settlement construction while exercising no leverage in order to thwart it. 
These policies will eventually backfire, as they have in other parts of the region where the United States stood against popular aspirations and supported authoritarian regimes. But on these issues, there is precious little daylight between the candidates.

2:09 a.m. Marisa Porges | Shopping List Foreign Policy 
At least Game 7 of the National League Championship Series was a blowout. But if you chose to watch tonight's debate instead of baseball - hoping, like many of us, for clarity on the next four years of American foreign policy - you were sorely disappointed.
What did we hear? Not a lot. Not a single mention of looming cyber threats, despite the fact that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently sounded an alarm about America's vulnerability to a possible "cyber Pearl Harbor." No mention of Yemen and the growing influence of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many consider the most significant terrorist threat in the world. Nor was there any discussion of Guantnamo or the future of American detention operations, leaving major questions unanswered about how the United States would handle captured terrorists in the future.
How would each candidate face the considerable challenges of the Afghanistan transition - like propping up the Afghan security forces, trying to negotiate a settlement with the Taliban, or forestalling a full-scale civil war after American and NATO forces depart? Apparently, it's not a concern. For Mr. Romney, it was simple as saying the Afghans "will be ready by the end of 2014." Full stop. While President Obama acknowledged in passing that the transition in Afghanistan "has to take place in a responsible fashion," he quickly changed course and began talking about veterans and jobs in America. Both are critical issues, to be sure. But neither is particularly helpful for those wondering if thousands of American lives lost and billions of dollars spent in Afghanistan will be wasted by a poorly executed transition.
Those concerned with the future of American engagement in the Middle East were likewise frustrated. Regarding the ongoing threat of extremism in the Arab World, Mr. Romney simply suggested a shopping list of grand objectives: economic development, better education, gender equality, and rule of law--a plan that sounds an awful lot like nation building. What remained entirely unclear is how Mr. Romney would actually make progress on any of these fronts, particularly in countries of critical concern. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama pointed out that we "cannot just meet these challenges militarily" and quickly mentioned religious minorities and women and encouraging economic development before neatly sidestepping to "nation building here at home."
Ultimately, tonight's debate didn't change many (any?) voters' opinions about either candidate. And it left national security wonks I know banging their heads against the table, still wondering how the election will affect America's foreign policies in the years ahead. But at least we're now certain the military has fewer bayonets than it did in 1916.

10:14 p.m. Lynn Vavreck | Why Won't They Stop Agreeing? 
If we ask people to assess President Obama's performance on foreign policy issues, we get judgments so closely tied to party identification they are hardly worth discussing. But when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on America's role in the world, there are some surprising areas of agreement - in fact, strong agreement it turns out.
Using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project on the appropriate use of military force, we find that we are not polarized over everything. Ensuring access to oil, destroying terrorist camps, intervening in a civil war, assisting the spread of democracy, and helping our allies are all actions on which most Americans agree - and sometimes profoundly so. The only worthy uses of our military forces, the respondents say, are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies; the rest are not.
Helping the United Nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties - Democrats think it is appropriate and Republicans soundly disagree (I've presented the percentages separately on this line for Democrats and Republicans).
But, lest you think the nation isn't polarized on foreign policy, consider this: on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties. On the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp, 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve. On average, women's support for the use of force is less strong than men's, by about 10 points.
With women making up the larger share (60 percent) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes, it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement. And although there is no gender divide on whether Romney "says what he believes," there is a gender difference on whether Obama is sincere. Women are 11 points more likely, on average, to think Obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about Obama relative to Romney.

11:22 p.m. Husain Haqqani | A Doomed Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan
President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden's killing, "If we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him." But if Pakistan can't be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he'd deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years. 
Mr. Romney seems committed to changing Pakistani behavior. And although he claims he wouldn't "divorce" Pakistan, Mr. Romney's answer showed that he would downgrade Pakistan's status as an American ally. Demanding policy changes from Pakistan in return for American support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the United States might successfully deploy to that end.
The discussion over Afghanistan and Pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing Islamist extremism. Mr. Obama defines success against Al Qaeda very narrowly, glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region after the withdrawal of American combat forces in 2014. Mr. Obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge. 
Killing bin Laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the United States and its allies safe from terrorists. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the Muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan has not been completely disrupted. Little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young Muslims into terrorist training camps. And the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that America simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from Muslim regions at very little cost.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table. It is unrealistic to assume that a professional Afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame. The Taliban's ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy.
The United States could have withdrawn from Afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn't announced a deadline for its withdrawal. That deadline also took away any incentive for Pakistan's military to work with the United States against the Taliban, thinking that it could instead sit the Americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a post-American Afghanistan. The Obama administration didn't succeed in persuading or coercing Pakistan into acting against the Taliban and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few pro-American elements in Pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists. 
It's fine to say "We do not want or like war'' but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy, such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, are wars of necessity. Such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war's aims and its strategy.

11:37 p.m. Eric L. Lewis | Mitt's Romney's Egypt 
Pity poor Egypt. After suffering through thirty years of the Mubarak kleptocracy, the people of Egypt rose up, deposed the dictator and elected a new president, Mohammed Morsi. To be sure, the victory of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood may not have been the first choice of American policy makers, but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes.
The new Egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the Mubarak regime, which was reliable, but at the expense of human rights, economic development, transparency and hope for the Egyptian people. Yet Morsi promptly reaffirmed what President Obama called in tonight's debate a "red line," the peace treaty with Israel, which has permitted Israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region.
None of these developments appear to satisfy Mitt Romney, who characterized Egypt as part of the "chaos" and "extremism" of Syria and Mali. While hailing the progress in Libya as "wonderful," he warns that "next door" is Egypt, where the election of a "Muslim brotherhood President" constitutes a "reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region." Romney said he would not have supported retaining Mubarak, but he views the outcome of a free election - indeed a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution - as a failure of the Arab Spring.
It is way too early to declare Egypt a success. It is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for sixty years. It is a country of 80 million people, many of whom live in terrible poverty. It exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them. Its Coptic Christian minority is uneasy, to say the least. The business community has largely remained on the sidelines. And many in its new government have spent the last thirty years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the Mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state.
But Romney's suggestion that the election of a Muslim Brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of Muslim ruling parties with "jihadists" and "terrorists." Syria and Iran were Baathist governments, nominally socialist secular states. The Assad clan and Saddam Hussein did not kill in the name of jihad. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey governs as a moderate Islamist, sharing some ideological roots with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran? 
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that.

12:01 a.m. Michael S. Doran | Romney's Strategy for Syria 
On Syria, Mitt Romney won - but only on points, certainly not with a knock-out blow. Mr. Romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision. He framed the civil war in Syria as an opportunity, a chance to strike at Iran. "Syria," Mr. Romney said, "is Iran's only ally in the Arab world," stressing the role the regime of Bashar al-Assad plays as Iran's base for extending its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Toppling Mr. Assad, Mr. Romney correctly explained, would deal a blow to Hezbollah and roll back Iranian influence throughout the region.
By contrast, President Obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken, but failed to place them in a wider context. He did not even mention Iran in the course of the discussion.
Syria represents a very rare thing in international politics: a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment. At least 30,000 have died, and millions have been made refugees. As the greatest power in the Middle East, the United States is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity. 
Yet, in fact, the Obama administration has been relatively passive, as Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey recently complained. "Right now," Mr. Erdogan said, "there are certain things being expected from the United States," but America has "not yet catered to those expectations." In the debate tonight Mr. Romney struck a similar note, stressing that America "should be playing the leadership role." 
But Mr. Romney did not define a clear path forward. The president claimed that Romney "doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership." There was truth in the statement.
At a moment when there is no appetite among Americans for a new foreign adventure, Mr. Romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the American military in Syria. He even rejected the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. Yet an American-implemented no-fly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the Romney strategic vision into a practical reality.
Mr. Romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in Syria, but when it came to specifics, his policy differed little from the president's.

12:02 a.m. Daniel W. Drezner | The Anti-Bellum Romney 
Many people believe that Mitt Romney won the first debate because of Barack Obama's somnambulant performance. That overlooked Romney's deft pivot to the center, which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation. This is consistent with a truism in political science: in an election, candidates try to target the median voter. In presidential politics, candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party's ideological base - but in general elections, they target the moderates, because those are the voters decide the election.
Romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate. After a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric, the governor sounded different tonight. He argued that "we can't kill our way out of" the problems in the Middle East. He averred that "we want a peaceful planet." He explicitly stated he didn't want to get involved militarily in Syria. Romney said the sanctions in Iran were working. He praised the president on numerous fronts - Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular. He even talked about China as a partner before bashing its trade policies. To be fair, the governor has said some of this before, but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace, not brute force.
In doing all this, Romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas. Romney's sotto voce message was that he would be a hot-headed, trigger-happy cowboy - like the Last Republican President Who Shall Not Be Named. For undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars, this could be very soothing indeed.
Will it work? One difference between this debate and the one in Denver is that President Obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time. The president was ready, willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in Romney's previous statements and claims. He accused Romney of being "all over the map" on numerous issues. He also ridiculed Romney's proposed naval buildup, pointing out that foreign policy wasn't a game of Battleship. It seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments - as opposed to simply treading water on the economy.
For the past month, Mitt Romney had been chipping away at Obama's foreign policy record. Tonight he seemed to want to emulate it. His clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander-in-chief. That way, they can ignore Obama's critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years. We'll find out over the next few days if he succeeded.

12:21 a.m. Anne-Marie Slaughter | America's Narcissism 
The much-heralded foreign policy debate wasn't really a debate, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues. And it was barely about foreign policy, as education reform (we all love teachers), Detroit, nation-building at home, and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and China. 
Romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme: "America must promote principles of peace." Obama looked and sounded every inch the commander-in-chief. But the lasting impression of the debate, certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world, is just how narrowly Americans define foreign policy. Neither candidate mentioned NATO. Indeed, neither candidate mentioned the European Union or the Eurozone crisis, other than Mr. Romney's dire predictions that the United States will soon be Greece unless he is elected. 
Moving east, the candidates barely mentioned a single country in East Asia other than China. There was only the briefest reference to Japan (our closest ally in Asia) by the moderator and a single mention of North Korea (another very dangerous nuclear power). Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, didn't come up. For that matter, there was no reference to India (a mere billion people). This silence is all the more striking given Mr. Obama's reference at the end of the debate to his administration's purported "pivot to Asia," a pivot that was supposed to be away from the Middle East. Yet when Mr. Obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the United States he said terrorist networks; Mr. Romney said a nuclear Iran.
Beyond individual countries, consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world. Neither candidate ever uttered the word "climate." Or drug violence. Or poverty, disease, food, water, or even energy. 
This really wasn't a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio. From a real foreign policy perspective, a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems, we can only hope the rest of the world wasn't listening.

12:41 a.m. Hanin Ghaddar | The Winner: Bashar al-Assad 
Tonight's debate was expected to reveal the candidates' thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the American foreign policy. However, this debate offered very little. 
Syria is a case in point. Both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards Syria. They both want to make friends with the Syrian people, but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to Israel. 
Governor Mitt Romney was simply advocating President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, which is inaction. There are simply no meaningful differences. Both want to let the Syrian people "determine their own fate," which so far has been a very bloody and dark one. 
Power comes with responsibility, and the Syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world. On both Twitter and Facebook, Syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates. They saw America's power implemented in Libya and wanted the same treatment. However, it seems both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have washed their hands of the Syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat. 
The policy of inaction in Syria, which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins, has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented, and also to the rise of Islamists. Because of inaction in Syria, the United States is losing the opportunity to lead. America's inaction in Syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, and last but not least Lebanon, where a car bomb killed senior Lebanese security official Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country. More inaction will mean more sectarian violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the region. The United States and its allies surely do not wish to see that. 
For the Syrian people, intervention never meant boots on the ground. They have specifically asked for safe havens and anti-aircraft missiles, not more. That's all they need to defeat the Assad regime. Both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail. The Syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the United States to offer. Instead, all they heard was "we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won't use it against us." Without trust, there can be no friendship. 
The only difference between the two was that Romney seemed to see the Middle East as one big space of terror. He repeatedly referred to the developments in past two years in the region as chaos and tumult. This is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives, and still are, in order to topple their dictators. That's also a bad way to make friends. 
The Syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins, they are on their own, and that the big winner of this debate is Bashar al-Assad.

12:47 a.m. Danielle Pletka | Don't Diss Defense Workers 
If what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight, you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by Barack Obama's rather robotic insistence on "nation building here at home." If you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration (the plan that would likely cut $500 billion from the defense budget in January 2013), the President's blithe assertion that it won't happen - no proof, no policy, just "I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message" - may not have convinced you. 
On the other hand, Mitt Romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that, by the end of this decade, Americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt that they will on national security. 
Mr. Romney recycled the oft-used sentiment that the President's request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917. Mr. Obama quoted Mr. Romney's talking points back to him, citing the actual year - 1916 - and ridiculed Romney's failure to understand that the military doesn't fight with bayonets and horses anymore. But the reality is that Mr. Obama's request is for a Navy unseen since 1916. And for an Air Force little improved from the one our fathers knew. And for a tanker fleet so ancient, all operations are analog. And for a bomber fleet conceived during the Carter years. In that context, cute horse comments are a lame comeback.
If your aim is to win in Virginia, it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet (note to the Obama team). Defense workers in Ohio and Virginia are game for more investment. If you want to score points on national defense, it's probably best not to be snide (though hipsters love it). Truth be told, many who believe in America's national mission are comfortable with the "peace through strength" message Mr. Romney sought to convey. 
Fundamentally, the question is less about the score that Twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession. Rather, it's about who sends a message of American resolve, belief in American power, and commitment to American investment in defense. If that's what matters to you - be you American voter, adversary, or terrorist - then it's likely that Mr. Romney's message, on principle and politics, hit home a little harder than Mr. Obama's. And that, folks, is what the debates are all about.

12:52 a.m. Ross Douthat | Mitt's New Modesty 
When Mitt Romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the Islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of Mali - a reference obscure to almost every viewer, except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our Libyan intervention - I had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time: I thought, hey, he's talking to me. 
That sense persisted for much of the night. As a conservative who's grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn't turn up in Iraq, I've been critical of Romney throughout this campaign for trying to out-hawk President Obama at every turn, and for trying to sell a war-weary public on the largely implausible idea that Obama is a weak-kneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas. But tonight, given the chance to throw that argument in the president's face, the Republican nominee mostly soft-pedaled it, shying away from sharp contrasts, emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace.
Romney's turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on Afghanistan, where he basically endorsed the White House's plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats. But the same difference-blurring thread ran through almost all his answers. Yes, he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on Obama's supposed "apology tour" in the Middle East, but otherwise this debate felt like a 90-minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out: Strip away the "no apologies" rhetoric, and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest.
This isn't necessarily a good thing for the country, which probably deserves a more robust debate over American strategy than the one we just watched. And by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president's, Romney almost guaranteed that Obama would win the debate on points - which the president pretty clearly did, deploying the advantages of incumbency (not to mention the execution of a certain Al Qaeda leader) effectively in an arena where Americans are still inclined to trust him.
The question is what the audience was looking for. If they were looking for evidence that a Romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas, then they probably came away disappointed, and Obama's win will boost him in the polls. But if they were just looking (as I'll admit that I was looking) to be reassured that Romney is something other than a wild-eyed warmonger, then the Republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat.

1:09 a.m. Dalia Dassa Kaye | A Crucial Difference on Iran 
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama had some sharp rhetorical exchanges, but on substance there were few discernible differences. If Mr. Obama was expecting Mr. Romney to distinguish himself by supporting military policies that would be unpopular with Americans (whether in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Iran), he was likely disappointed. Mr. Romney went out of his way to argue that killing bad guys would not be enough to fight radical forces; economic development, education and civil society are key ingredients to future stability. Mr. Obama couldn't agree more.
Mr. Obama said his aim is to get Iran to stop its "nuclear program," while Romney spoke about preventing a "nuclear-capable" Iran. But neither candidate defined the point in Iran's nuclear enrichment that would trigger military action. Both agreed military action would be the last resort. And Mr. Romney even credited Mr. Obama for applying crippling sanctions, only criticizing him for not doing it earlier (which of course Mr. Obama denied) and suggesting he would find ways to strengthen them. 
But on the Iran file, a consequential distinction emerged. For Mr. Obama, the intent of crippling sanctions is to bring Iran to the negotiating table to agree to give up its nuclear program and abide by United Nations resolutions, arguing there's a "deal to be had." In contrast, Mr. Romney called for diplomatic isolation of Iran, arguing Iran's diplomats should be treated like pariahs around the world. Diplomatic pressure, as Mr. Romney advocates, is not the same as negotiations. The dilemma is how sanctions and pressure would dissuade Iran's leaders from pursuing their nuclear program (as Mr. Romney recommended) if a President Romney wouldn't agree to sit down and talk with them. 
Mr. Obama did not appear to pick up on this disconnect, most likely because he wanted to emphasize the "tough" aspects of his Iran policy and not the off-ramp strategy that will inevitably involve bilateral negotiations with Iran. But if a Romney administration were to pursue a policy shunning diplomacy, it is hard to see how the current sanctions policies, and more covert actions like sabotage, would lead to a resolution. The more likely scenario if diplomacy is rejected or fails is continued escalation--and potentially war.

1:35 a.m. Sheena Chestnut Greitens | Where Was Asia? 
Tonight both presidential candidates acknowledged the centrality of Asia to America's interests. The Obama administration offers its "Asia pivot" as a foreign policy success story. Mitt Romney wants a bigger Navy to keep America's commitments in the region credible and robust. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, 60 percent of the Navy's warships will be located in the Pacific by 2020. 
Not once tonight did anyone talk about what those ships are going to do when they get there. 
Tonight's foreign policy debate allotted less than 15 of its 90 minutes to Asia, a region with the world's fastest economic growth rates and over half of its population. The only country receiving more than a passing mention was China, and even China was discussed only in economic terms. 
How to handle the security relationship between the two countries with the world's largest military budgets went unmentioned, as did the United States' broader strategy in a region critical to American security interests, where the next president will have to make a series of tough choices and may well face multiple foreign policy crises. 
There was no discussion of American policy on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 American forces stand watch in a war that has not ended, and where our allies this weekend evacuated residents along the DMZ after North Korea threatened to retaliate against an activist group's balloon launch with artillery fire. 
There was no discussion of the recently announced plan to rotate more American planes, ships, and personnel through the Philippines, which in April sailed an American-made cutter into confrontation with China in disputed waters, and then suggested that America was obligated to assist in that confrontation under the terms of a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. 
There was no discussion of Taiwan, which asked the United States for over 60 new F-16 fighters and last year got a $5.8 billion upgrade to its old ones instead - a decision that the official Chinese press called "a despicable breach of faith" - or of the American "Air-Sea Battle" concept generally perceived to be a template for future conflict with China. 
There was no discussion of whether America's commitment to those who call for democracy and human rights - a commitment both candidates affirmed - can or should extend past Tunisia and Tahrir to Tibet, where over fifty people have set themselves on fire without producing the political change that a single self-immolation sparked in the Arab World. 
Today the world's attention is riveted on crises in the Middle East. Tomorrow's flashpoints lie in Asia. Unfortunately, tonight's debate did little to clarify how either candidate would handle a 3 a.m. phone call that comes not from Benghazi, but from Beijing.

1:48 a.m. Nathan Thrall | Not Enough Daylight on Israel 
Monday's debate in Boca Raton offered another venue for President Obama and Mitt Romney to compete over who can appear closer to Israel. Mr. Obama trumpeted his administration's "unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation" with Israel, while Mr. Romney advertised his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Mr. Obama contrasted Mr. Romney's decision to use his recent trip to Israel to "take donors" and "attend fundraisers" with the president's own visits to Israel's Holocaust memorial and the "town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas." Mr. Romney countered by asserting that the president had generated "turmoil" with Israel, noting that 38 Democratic senators had signed a letter urging him to repair the damage. 
Mr. Romney also repeated his earlier criticism of the president having reportedly stated that there should be daylight between the United States and Israel when negotiating a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet, by definition, some distance must exist between a mediator and the parties to a negotiation if that mediator is to live up to its claim of being an honest broker. 
If wishing to eliminate any daylight between America and one party to the conflict is Mr. Romney's desire, it is one at odds with his professed goal to help Israelis and Palestinians reach a peace agreement - a goal he did not seem to possess when at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida earlier this year he said the Palestinians have "no interest whatsoever in establishing peace," and "the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish." Romney went on:
You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem - and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.
Kicking the ball down the field while professing an interest in an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is precisely what President Obama has been doing for the last several years. The policy of the next administration, whether Mr. Romney's first or Mr. Obama's second, will be to uphold this status quo: supporting an unelected Palestinian prime minister and a Palestinian president whose term long ago expired; continuing to prevent the exercise of power by the victors in the last Palestinian national election; negotiating with a set of unelected P.L.O. leaders who cannot credibly claim to represent most Palestinians; prioritizing the funding of Palestinian security forces who arrest their political opponents and prevent peaceful protests against Israeli settlements and military installations; and meekly criticizing Israel's expanding settlement construction while exercising no leverage in order to thwart it. 
These policies will eventually backfire, as they have in other parts of the region where the United States stood against popular aspirations and supported authoritarian regimes. But on these issues, there is precious little daylight between the candidates.

2:09 a.m. Marisa Porges | Shopping List Foreign Policy 
At least Game 7 of the National League Championship Series was a blowout. But if you chose to watch tonight's debate instead of baseball - hoping, like many of us, for clarity on the next four years of American foreign policy - you were sorely disappointed.
What did we hear? Not a lot. Not a single mention of looming cyber threats, despite the fact that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently sounded an alarm about America's vulnerability to a possible "cyber Pearl Harbor." No mention of Yemen and the growing influence of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many consider the most significant terrorist threat in the world. Nor was there any discussion of Guantnamo or the future of American detention operations, leaving major questions unanswered about how the United States would handle captured terrorists in the future.
How would each candidate face the considerable challenges of the Afghanistan transition - like propping up the Afghan security forces, trying to negotiate a settlement with the Taliban, or forestalling a full-scale civil war after American and NATO forces depart? Apparently, it's not a concern. For Mr. Romney, it was simple as saying the Afghans "will be ready by the end of 2014." Full stop. While President Obama acknowledged in passing that the transition in Afghanistan "has to take place in a responsible fashion," he quickly changed course and began talking about veterans and jobs in America. Both are critical issues, to be sure. But neither is particularly helpful for those wondering if thousands of American lives lost and billions of dollars spent in Afghanistan will be wasted by a poorly executed transition.
Those concerned with the future of American engagement in the Middle East were likewise frustrated. Regarding the ongoing threat of extremism in the Arab World, Mr. Romney simply suggested a shopping list of grand objectives: economic development, better education, gender equality, and rule of law--a plan that sounds an awful lot like nation building. What remained entirely unclear is how Mr. Romney would actually make progress on any of these fronts, particularly in countries of critical concern. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama pointed out that we "cannot just meet these challenges militarily" and quickly mentioned religious minorities and women and encouraging economic development before neatly sidestepping to "nation building here at home."
Ultimately, tonight's debate didn't change many (any?) voters' opinions about either candidate. And it left national security wonks I know banging their heads against the table, still wondering how the election will affect America's foreign policies in the years ahead. But at least we're now certain the military has fewer bayonets than it did in 1916.

10:14 p.m. Lynn Vavreck | Why Won't They Stop Agreeing? 
If we ask people to assess President Obama's performance on foreign policy issues, we get judgments so closely tied to party identification they are hardly worth discussing. But when we take approval of the president out of the question and ask people about their own ideas on America's role in the world, there are some surprising areas of agreement - in fact, strong agreement it turns out.
Using data from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project on the appropriate use of military force, we find that we are not polarized over everything. Ensuring access to oil, destroying terrorist camps, intervening in a civil war, assisting the spread of democracy, and helping our allies are all actions on which most Americans agree - and sometimes profoundly so. The only worthy uses of our military forces, the respondents say, are destroying terror training camps and helping our allies; the rest are not.
Helping the United Nations uphold international law reveals the biggest difference between the parties - Democrats think it is appropriate and Republicans soundly disagree (I've presented the percentages separately on this line for Democrats and Republicans).
But, lest you think the nation isn't polarized on foreign policy, consider this: on some issues we see bigger differences between the attitudes of men and women than we see between the parties. On the question of whether it is appropriate to use our military forces to destroy a terrorist camp, 71 percent of men say yes while only half of women approve. On average, women's support for the use of force is less strong than men's, by about 10 points.
With women making up the larger share (60 percent) of undecided voters and both candidates fighting hard for their votes, it is not surprising that tonight we heard more agreement between the two candidates than disagreement. And although there is no gender divide on whether Romney "says what he believes," there is a gender difference on whether Obama is sincere. Women are 11 points more likely, on average, to think Obama says what he believes and 12 points more likely to say this about Obama relative to Romney.

11:22 p.m. Husain Haqqani | A Doomed Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan 
President Obama said, referring to Osama bin Laden's killing, "If we had asked Pakistan permission, we would not have gotten him." But if Pakistan can't be trusted, the president owes the American people an explanation of how he'd deal with a nuclear-armed impoverished country over the next four years. 
Mr. Romney seems committed to changing Pakistani behavior. And although he claims he wouldn't "divorce" Pakistan, Mr. Romney's answer showed that he would downgrade Pakistan's status as an American ally. Demanding policy changes from Pakistan in return for American support and friendship is a sound idea but neither candidate has spelled out what specific instruments of persuasion or coercion the United States might successfully deploy to that end.
The discussion over Afghanistan and Pakistan needs to be put in the context of the wider issue of containing Islamist extremism. Mr. Obama defines success against Al Qaeda very narrowly, glossing over how jihadist networks are already preparing to regroup in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region after the withdrawal of American combat forces in 2014. Mr. Obama has not articulated a plan to deal with that challenge. 
Killing bin Laden was a positive development but it alone will not make the United States and its allies safe from terrorists. Al Qaeda and its affiliates continue to recruit all over the Muslim world and their ability to organize and train in remote parts of Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan has not been completely disrupted. Little has been done to limit the influence of ideas or organizations that lead young Muslims into terrorist training camps. And the withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan has strengthened the jihadi narrative that America simply does not have the staying power and can be forced to withdraw from Muslim regions at very little cost.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban have neither been decisively defeated nor forced to the negotiating table. It is unrealistic to assume that a professional Afghan national army can be raised and fully assigned the task of securing the country within a short time frame. The Taliban's ability to infiltrate this hastily assembled army reveals the excessive optimism of this policy.
The United States could have withdrawn from Afghanistan far more successfully if it hadn't announced a deadline for its withdrawal. That deadline also took away any incentive for Pakistan's military to work with the United States against the Taliban, thinking that it could instead sit the Americans out and wait for the chance to maximize its influence in a post-American Afghanistan. The Obama administration didn't succeed in persuading or coercing Pakistan into acting against the Taliban and its unilateralism has only made it more difficult for the few pro-American elements in Pakistan to fight their own battle against jihadists. 
It's fine to say "We do not want or like war'' but wars against an ideologically motivated enemy, such as Al Qaeda and its affiliates, are wars of necessity. Such wars cannot be fought according to a neat timeline and without effective allies who share both the war's aims and its strategy.

11:37 p.m. Eric L. Lewis | Mitt's Romney's Egypt 
Pity poor Egypt. After suffering through thirty years of the Mubarak kleptocracy, the people of Egypt rose up, deposed the dictator and elected a new president, Mohammed Morsi. To be sure, the victory of Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood may not have been the first choice of American policy makers, but one cannot have a policy of commitment to democracy and then reject democratic outcomes.
The new Egyptian government will no doubt be less friendly than the Mubarak regime, which was reliable, but at the expense of human rights, economic development, transparency and hope for the Egyptian people. Yet Morsi promptly reaffirmed what President Obama called in tonight's debate a "red line," the peace treaty with Israel, which has permitted Israel to have predictability from the largest country in the region.
None of these developments appear to satisfy Mitt Romney, who characterized Egypt as part of the "chaos" and "extremism" of Syria and Mali. While hailing the progress in Libya as "wonderful," he warns that "next door" is Egypt, where the election of a "Muslim brotherhood President" constitutes a "reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region." Romney said he would not have supported retaining Mubarak, but he views the outcome of a free election - indeed a predictable outcome of an election held so soon after the revolution - as a failure of the Arab Spring.
It is way too early to declare Egypt a success. It is not easy to shake off a sclerotic and corrupt system that was in place for sixty years. It is a country of 80 million people, many of whom live in terrible poverty. It exports many of its most talented people because its economy cannot accommodate them. Its Coptic Christian minority is uneasy, to say the least. The business community has largely remained on the sidelines. And many in its new government have spent the last thirty years avoiding the brutal security apparatus of the Mubarak regime rather than readying themselves for the challenges of governing a modern state.
But Romney's suggestion that the election of a Muslim Brotherhood government constitutes a reversal for the region is indicative of a dangerous equation of Muslim ruling parties with "jihadists" and "terrorists." Syria and Iran were Baathist governments, nominally socialist secular states. The Assad clan and Saddam Hussein did not kill in the name of jihad. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey governs as a moderate Islamist, sharing some ideological roots with the Muslim Brotherhood. Rejected for membership in the European Union, Turkey under Erdogan has surged ahead of the peripheral European nations and assumed a leadership role in the region. To be sure, Hamas also has roots in the Muslim Brotherhood. Whether Egypt moves toward the Turkish model or the Hamas model will be determined in significant measure by the wisdom of American policy.
The Romney approach - lumping Egypt with Mali, Baathists with Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood with jihadists - retains the ahistorical arrogance of the Bush years. We need to understand the social and political dynamics of countries that we would purport to influence. And we need to have the humility to understand that our influence must be exercised with restraint and pragmatism. Mitt Romney's apparent belief in restructuring the world from the top down as we would wish it to be shows an obdurate refusal to learn from the tragic mistakes of the past.

11:48 p.m. Dennis Ross | Who's Prepared on Iran? 
Listening to tonight's debate, one would be hard-pressed to identify a clear difference between what President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney would do in dealing with Iran. Both made it clear that prevention, not containment, of a nuclear armed Iran is their objective. The President was particularly blunt, saying that as long as he is president, Iran will not become a nuclear-armed state. While Mr. Romney made it clear that America could not accept Iran becoming nuclear weapons capable, the president went further and said that we could not allow Iran to develop a "breakout capacity." By this he meant that America could not allow Iran to reach the point where its accumulated enriched uranium, the level of enrichment, and the numbers and quality of centrifuges would allow Iran to quickly create nuclear weapons before we could act militarily to prevent it. 
Their mutual emphasis on prevention does not mean that either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will forgo diplomacy and rush to war. Both were clear that the use of force is the last resort. Both cited their belief that increasing the pressure of crippling sanctions may yet alter Iranian behavior. The President took pride in having mobilized the world to impose crippling sanctions that are now wreaking havoc with the Iranian economy. Mr. Romney agreed on their effect, and the need to do more. We can certainly anticipate that both would seek to tighten the economic sanctions in 2013. To be sure, Mr. Romney went further in one respect: he is prepared to indict the President of Iran under the Genocide Convention and treat Iranian diplomats the way those of apartheid South Africa were treated.
Both also indicated that they would see if a diplomatic or negotiated outcome was possible. My expectation is that regardless of who is elected, there will be a diplomatic initiative or endgame proposal designed to test whether Iran is prepared to accept an outcome in which it has civil nuclear power but its nuclear program is restricted in a way that would largely deny it a breakout capability.
I say that because prevention as an objective necessarily will lead at some point to the use of force against the Iranian nuclear program if diplomacy fails. I don't see either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney resorting to force without being able to demonstrate that they sought to exhaust all other options first.
The bottom line: their basic approach to Iran seems very similar. But the president, having lived with and thought through the issue for the last four years, is more equipped to move more quickly on Iran than Mr. Romney. If elected, Mr. Romney would have to establish his administration and probably conduct a review of his options. President Obama has already done that.

12:01 a.m. Michael S. Doran | Romney's Strategy for Syria 
On Syria, Mitt Romney won - but only on points, certainly not with a knock-out blow. Mr. Romney addressed the question in a manner that showed a superior strategic vision. He framed the civil war in Syria as an opportunity, a chance to strike at Iran. "Syria," Mr. Romney said, "is Iran's only ally in the Arab world," stressing the role the regime of Bashar al-Assad plays as Iran's base for extending its influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. Toppling Mr. Assad, Mr. Romney correctly explained, would deal a blow to Hezbollah and roll back Iranian influence throughout the region.
By contrast, President Obama listed a number of actions that his administration has taken, but failed to place them in a wider context. He did not even mention Iran in the course of the discussion.
Syria represents a very rare thing in international politics: a crisis in which our strategic interests and values are in perfect alignment. At least 30,000 have died, and millions have been made refugees. As the greatest power in the Middle East, the United States is untrue to itself if it fails to take decisive action against a dictator who murders civilians with impunity. 
Yet, in fact, the Obama administration has been relatively passive, as Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey recently complained. "Right now," Mr. Erdogan said, "there are certain things being expected from the United States," but America has "not yet catered to those expectations." In the debate tonight Mr. Romney struck a similar note, stressing that America "should be playing the leadership role." 
But Mr. Romney did not define a clear path forward. The president claimed that Romney "doesn't have different ideas, and that's because we're doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate, Syrian leadership." There was truth in the statement.
At a moment when there is no appetite among Americans for a new foreign adventure, Mr. Romney was careful to stress that he did not support deploying the American military in Syria. He even rejected the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. Yet an American-implemented no-fly zone is precisely what is needed to turn the Romney strategic vision into a practical reality.
Mr. Romney displayed a much better grasp of the strategic stakes in Syria, but when it came to specifics, his policy differed little from the president's.

12:02 a.m. Daniel W. Drezner | The Anti-Bellum Romney 
Many people believe that Mitt Romney won the first debate because of Barack Obama's somnambulant performance. That overlooked Romney's deft pivot to the center, which he pulled off by doing things like praising government regulation. This is consistent with a truism in political science: in an election, candidates try to target the median voter. In presidential politics, candidates might win primaries by pleasing their party's ideological base - but in general elections, they target the moderates, because those are the voters decide the election.
Romney doubled down on that strategy in the foreign policy debate. After a year of very hot and bellicose rhetoric, the governor sounded different tonight. He argued that "we can't kill our way out of" the problems in the Middle East. He averred that "we want a peaceful planet." He explicitly stated he didn't want to get involved militarily in Syria. Romney said the sanctions in Iran were working. He praised the president on numerous fronts - Afghanistan and Pakistan in particular. He even talked about China as a partner before bashing its trade policies. To be fair, the governor has said some of this before, but tonight the emphasis was on diplomacy and peace, not brute force.
In doing all this, Romney was trying to allay the fears of undecided voters who are wary of expending more blood and treasure overseas. Romney's sotto voce message was that he would be a hot-headed, trigger-happy cowboy - like the Last Republican President Who Shall Not Be Named. For undecided voters who are clearly sick of foreign wars, this could be very soothing indeed.
Will it work? One difference between this debate and the one in Denver is that President Obama seemed prepared for the pivot this time. The president was ready, willing and able to highlight the inconsistencies in Romney's previous statements and claims. He accused Romney of being "all over the map" on numerous issues. He also ridiculed Romney's proposed naval buildup, pointing out that foreign policy wasn't a game of Battleship. It seems like the president was genuinely proud of his foreign policy accomplishments - as opposed to simply treading water on the economy.
For the past month, Mitt Romney had been chipping away at Obama's foreign policy record. Tonight he seemed to want to emulate it. His clear hope is that the performance was good enough for voters to be comfortable with him as a sober and prudent commander-in-chief. That way, they can ignore Obama's critique and happily forget about international relations for another four years. We'll find out over the next few days if he succeeded.

12:21 a.m. Anne-Marie Slaughter | America's Narcissism 
The much-heralded foreign policy debate wasn't really a debate, as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on 90 percent of the issues. And it was barely about foreign policy, as education reform (we all love teachers), Detroit, nation-building at home, and taxes got far more play than any part of the world other than the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and China. 
Romney trotted out a new rhetorical meme: "America must promote principles of peace." Obama looked and sounded every inch the commander-in-chief. But the lasting impression of the debate, certainly for anyone watching in the rest of the world, is just how narrowly Americans define foreign policy. Neither candidate mentioned NATO. Indeed, neither candidate mentioned the European Union or the Eurozone crisis, other than Mr. Romney's dire predictions that the United States will soon be Greece unless he is elected. 
Moving east, the candidates barely mentioned a single country in East Asia other than China. There was only the briefest reference to Japan (our closest ally in Asia) by the moderator and a single mention of North Korea (another very dangerous nuclear power). Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, didn't come up. For that matter, there was no reference to India (a mere billion people). This silence is all the more striking given Mr. Obama's reference at the end of the debate to his administration's purported "pivot to Asia," a pivot that was supposed to be away from the Middle East. Yet when Mr. Obama was asked to name the greatest threat to the United States he said terrorist networks; Mr. Romney said a nuclear Iran.
Beyond individual countries, consider the silence on the global issues that are vitally important to the rest of the world. Neither candidate ever uttered the word "climate." Or drug violence. Or poverty, disease, food, water, or even energy. 
This really wasn't a debate about foreign policy or world affairs. It was the projection of the American electoral map onto the globe. All discussion of Israel and Islam was targeted at Florida; all discussion of China was targeted at Ohio. From a real foreign policy perspective, a business in which we devote a great deal of time and effort to reassuring and mobilizing our friends and allies and trying to solve global problems, we can only hope the rest of the world wasn't listening.

12:41 a.m. Hanin Ghaddar | The Winner: Bashar al-Assad 
Tonight's debate was expected to reveal the candidates' thorough and detailed strategies when it comes to the American foreign policy. However, this debate offered very little. 
Syria is a case in point. Both candidates seem to have the same confused and paralyzed policy towards Syria. They both want to make friends with the Syrian people, but the real competition was instead on who can be a better friend to Israel. 
Governor Mitt Romney was simply advocating President Obama's foreign policy in Syria, which is inaction. There are simply no meaningful differences. Both want to let the Syrian people "determine their own fate," which so far has been a very bloody and dark one. 
Power comes with responsibility, and the Syrians expected a more responsible stance from what should be the most powerful state in the world. On both Twitter and Facebook, Syrians expressed disappointment with both candidates. They saw America's power implemented in Libya and wanted the same treatment. However, it seems both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama have washed their hands of the Syrian people and decided to stay in the viewing seat. 
The policy of inaction in Syria, which apparently will continue no matter which candidate wins, has led to the humanitarian crisis which both candidates lamented, and also to the rise of Islamists. Because of inaction in Syria, the United States is losing the opportunity to lead. America's inaction in Syria is causing chaos to spread to neighboring countries, such as Turkey, Jordan, and last but not least Lebanon, where a car bomb killed senior Lebanese security official Gen. Wissam al-Hassan and unleashed a wave of sectarian street violence across the country. More inaction will mean more sectarian violence, not only in Syria, but throughout the region. The United States and its allies surely do not wish to see that. 
For the Syrian people, intervention never meant boots on the ground. They have specifically asked for safe havens and anti-aircraft missiles, not more. That's all they need to defeat the Assad regime. Both candidates failed to discuss these options in detail. The Syrian people deserve to know why these two specific requests are so hard for the United States to offer. Instead, all they heard was "we are afraid to give you arms because we do not trust you won't use it against us." Without trust, there can be no friendship. 
The only difference between the two was that Romney seemed to see the Middle East as one big space of terror. He repeatedly referred to the developments in past two years in the region as chaos and tumult. This is an insult to the people who have sacrificed their lives, and still are, in order to topple their dictators. That's also a bad way to make friends. 
The Syrians understood tonight that no matter who wins, they are on their own, and that the big winner of this debate is Bashar al-Assad.

12:47 a.m. Danielle Pletka | Don't Diss Defense Workers 
If what you care about is foreign policy and you tuned in tonight, you may have been a tad disappointed by the focus on car tires and teachers and by Barack Obama's rather robotic insistence on "nation building here at home." If you care about national defense and are particularly worried about sequestration (the plan that would likely cut $500 billion from the defense budget in January 2013), the President's blithe assertion that it won't happen - no proof, no policy, just "I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message" - may not have convinced you. 
On the other hand, Mitt Romney did little more to convey the security costs of a rollback in defense that could mean that, by the end of this decade, Americans will be spending more annually to service their national debt that they will on national security. 
Mr. Romney recycled the oft-used sentiment that the President's request for naval ships will be the smallest since 1917. Mr. Obama quoted Mr. Romney's talking points back to him, citing the actual year - 1916 - and ridiculed Romney's failure to understand that the military doesn't fight with bayonets and horses anymore. But the reality is that Mr. Obama's request is for a Navy unseen since 1916. And for an Air Force little improved from the one our fathers knew. And for a tanker fleet so ancient, all operations are analog. And for a bomber fleet conceived during the Carter years. In that context, cute horse comments are a lame comeback.
If your aim is to win in Virginia, it is probably better not to make fun of the naval fleet (note to the Obama team). Defense workers in Ohio and Virginia are game for more investment. If you want to score points on national defense, it's probably best not to be snide (though hipsters love it). Truth be told, many who believe in America's national mission are comfortable with the "peace through strength" message Mr. Romney sought to convey. 
Fundamentally, the question is less about the score that Twitter and the spinners give to their favored obsession. Rather, it's about who sends a message of American resolve, belief in American power, and commitment to American investment in defense. If that's what matters to you - be you American voter, adversary, or terrorist - then it's likely that Mr. Romney's message, on principle and politics, hit home a little harder than Mr. Obama's. And that, folks, is what the debates are all about.

12:52 a.m. Ross Douthat | Mitt's New Modesty 
When Mitt Romney punctuated one of his early answers tonight with a reference to the Islamist forces gaining power in the collapsing state of Mali - a reference obscure to almost every viewer, except those who share my particular obsession with the ripple effects of our Libyan intervention - I had the sense that genuine swing voters must have almost all the time: I thought, hey, he's talking to me. 
That sense persisted for much of the night. As a conservative who's grown steadily more skeptical of military interventions ever since the weapons of mass destruction didn't turn up in Iraq, I've been critical of Romney throughout this campaign for trying to out-hawk President Obama at every turn, and for trying to sell a war-weary public on the largely implausible idea that Obama is a weak-kneed appeaser unwilling to show toughness overseas. But tonight, given the chance to throw that argument in the president's face, the Republican nominee mostly soft-pedaled it, shying away from sharp contrasts, emphasizing areas of agreement and repeatedly mentioning his own desire for peace.
Romney's turn toward pragmatism was most pronounced on Afghanistan, where he basically endorsed the White House's plan for a 2014 withdrawal without offering any of his usual hawkish criticisms and caveats. But the same difference-blurring thread ran through almost all his answers. Yes, he promised more military spending and tried to hit the president hard on Obama's supposed "apology tour" in the Middle East, but otherwise this debate felt like a 90-minute confirmation of what a lot of analysts have pointed out: Strip away the "no apologies" rhetoric, and the differences between the president and his rival on foreign policy look relatively modest.
This isn't necessarily a good thing for the country, which probably deserves a more robust debate over American strategy than the one we just watched. And by essentially acknowledging the overlap between his posture and the president's, Romney almost guaranteed that Obama would win the debate on points - which the president pretty clearly did, deploying the advantages of incumbency (not to mention the execution of a certain Al Qaeda leader) effectively in an arena where Americans are still inclined to trust him.
The question is what the audience was looking for. If they were looking for evidence that a Romney administration would deliver significantly better results overseas, then they probably came away disappointed, and Obama's win will boost him in the polls. But if they were just looking (as I'll admit that I was looking) to be reassured that Romney is something other than a wild-eyed warmonger, then the Republican nominee may have helped his cause tonight even in defeat.

1:09 a.m. Dalia Dassa Kaye | A Crucial Difference on Iran 
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama had some sharp rhetorical exchanges, but on substance there were few discernible differences. If Mr. Obama was expecting Mr. Romney to distinguish himself by supporting military policies that would be unpopular with Americans (whether in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan or Iran), he was likely disappointed. Mr. Romney went out of his way to argue that killing bad guys would not be enough to fight radical forces; economic development, education and civil society are key ingredients to future stability. Mr. Obama couldn't agree more.
Mr. Obama said his aim is to get Iran to stop its "nuclear program," while Romney spoke about preventing a "nuclear-capable" Iran. But neither candidate defined the point in Iran's nuclear enrichment that would trigger military action. Both agreed military action would be the last resort. And Mr. Romney even credited Mr. Obama for applying crippling sanctions, only criticizing him for not doing it earlier (which of course Mr. Obama denied) and suggesting he would find ways to strengthen them. 
But on the Iran file, a consequential distinction emerged. For Mr. Obama, the intent of crippling sanctions is to bring Iran to the negotiating table to agree to give up its nuclear program and abide by United Nations resolutions, arguing there's a "deal to be had." In contrast, Mr. Romney called for diplomatic isolation of Iran, arguing Iran's diplomats should be treated like pariahs around the world. Diplomatic pressure, as Mr. Romney advocates, is not the same as negotiations. The dilemma is how sanctions and pressure would dissuade Iran's leaders from pursuing their nuclear program (as Mr. Romney recommended) if a President Romney wouldn't agree to sit down and talk with them. 
Mr. Obama did not appear to pick up on this disconnect, most likely because he wanted to emphasize the "tough" aspects of his Iran policy and not the off-ramp strategy that will inevitably involve bilateral negotiations with Iran. But if a Romney administration were to pursue a policy shunning diplomacy, it is hard to see how the current sanctions policies, and more covert actions like sabotage, would lead to a resolution. The more likely scenario if diplomacy is rejected or fails is continued escalation--and potentially war.

1:35 a.m. Sheena Chestnut Greitens | Where Was Asia? 
Tonight both presidential candidates acknowledged the centrality of Asia to America's interests. The Obama administration offers its "Asia pivot" as a foreign policy success story. Mitt Romney wants a bigger Navy to keep America's commitments in the region credible and robust. According to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, 60 percent of the Navy's warships will be located in the Pacific by 2020. 
Not once tonight did anyone talk about what those ships are going to do when they get there. 
Tonight's foreign policy debate allotted less than 15 of its 90 minutes to Asia, a region with the world's fastest economic growth rates and over half of its population. The only country receiving more than a passing mention was China, and even China was discussed only in economic terms. 
How to handle the security relationship between the two countries with the world's largest military budgets went unmentioned, as did the United States' broader strategy in a region critical to American security interests, where the next president will have to make a series of tough choices and may well face multiple foreign policy crises. 
There was no discussion of American policy on the Korean peninsula, where 28,500 American forces stand watch in a war that has not ended, and where our allies this weekend evacuated residents along the DMZ after North Korea threatened to retaliate against an activist group's balloon launch with artillery fire. 
There was no discussion of the recently announced plan to rotate more American planes, ships, and personnel through the Philippines, which in April sailed an American-made cutter into confrontation with China in disputed waters, and then suggested that America was obligated to assist in that confrontation under the terms of a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. 
There was no discussion of Taiwan, which asked the United States for over 60 new F-16 fighters and last year got a $5.8 billion upgrade to its old ones instead - a decision that the official Chinese press called "a despicable breach of faith" - or of the American "Air-Sea Battle" concept generally perceived to be a template for future conflict with China. 
There was no discussion of whether America's commitment to those who call for democracy and human rights - a commitment both candidates affirmed - can or should extend past Tunisia and Tahrir to Tibet, where over fifty people have set themselves on fire without producing the political change that a single self-immolation sparked in the Arab World. 
Today the world's attention is riveted on crises in the Middle East. Tomorrow's flashpoints lie in Asia. Unfortunately, tonight's debate did little to clarify how either candidate would handle a 3 a.m. phone call that comes not from Benghazi, but from Beijing.

1:48 a.m. Nathan Thrall | Not Enough Daylight on Israel 
Monday's debate in Boca Raton offered another venue for President Obama and Mitt Romney to compete over who can appear closer to Israel. Mr. Obama trumpeted his administration's "unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation" with Israel, while Mr. Romney advertised his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Mr. Obama contrasted Mr. Romney's decision to use his recent trip to Israel to "take donors" and "attend fundraisers" with the president's own visits to Israel's Holocaust memorial and the "town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas." Mr. Romney countered by asserting that the president had generated "turmoil" with Israel, noting that 38 Democratic senators had signed a letter urging him to repair the damage. 
Mr. Romney also repeated his earlier criticism of the president having reportedly stated that there should be daylight between the United States and Israel when negotiating a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Yet, by definition, some distance must exist between a mediator and the parties to a negotiation if that mediator is to live up to its claim of being an honest broker. 
If wishing to eliminate any daylight between America and one party to the conflict is Mr. Romney's desire, it is one at odds with his professed goal to help Israelis and Palestinians reach a peace agreement - a goal he did not seem to possess when at a closed-door fundraiser in Florida earlier this year he said the Palestinians have "no interest whatsoever in establishing peace," and "the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish." Romney went on:
You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem - and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.
Kicking the ball down the field while professing an interest in an Israeli-Palestinian settlement is precisely what President Obama has been doing for the last several years. The policy of the next administration, whether Mr. Romney's first or Mr. Obama's second, will be to uphold this status quo: supporting an unelected Palestinian prime minister and a Palestinian president whose term long ago expired; continuing to prevent the exercise of power by the victors in the last Palestinian national election; negotiating with a set of unelected P.L.O. leaders who cannot credibly claim to represent most Palestinians; prioritizing the funding of Palestinian security forces who arrest their political opponents and prevent peaceful protests against Israeli settlements and military installations; and meekly criticizing Israel's expanding settlement construction while exercising no leverage in order to thwart it. 
These policies will eventually backfire, as they have in other parts of the region where the United States stood against popular aspirations and supported authoritarian regimes. But on these issues, there is precious little daylight between the candidates.

2:09 a.m. Marisa Porges | Shopping List Foreign Policy
At least Game 7 of the National League Championship Series was a blowout. But if you chose to watch tonight's debate instead of baseball - hoping, like many of us, for clarity on the next four years of American foreign policy - you were sorely disappointed.
What did we hear? Not a lot. Not a single mention of looming cyber threats, despite the fact that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently sounded an alarm about America's vulnerability to a possible "cyber Pearl Harbor." No mention of Yemen and the growing influence of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many consider the most significant terrorist threat in the world. Nor was there any discussion of Guantnamo or the future of American detention operations, leaving major questions unanswered about how the United States would handle captured terrorists in the future.
How would each candidate face the considerable challenges of the Afghanistan transition - like propping up the Afghan security forces, trying to negotiate a settlement with the Taliban, or forestalling a full-scale civil war after American and NATO forces depart? Apparently, it's not a concern. For Mr. Romney, it was simple as saying the Afghans "will be ready by the end of 2014." Full stop. While President Obama acknowledged in passing that the transition in Afghanistan "has to take place in a responsible fashion," he quickly changed course and began talking about veterans and jobs in America. Both are critical issues, to be sure. But neither is particularly helpful for those wondering if thousands of American lives lost and billions of dollars spent in Afghanistan will be wasted by a poorly executed transition.
Those concerned with the future of American engagement in the Middle East were likewise frustrated. Regarding the ongoing threat of extremism in the Arab World, Mr. Romney simply suggested a shopping list of grand objectives: economic development, better education, gender equality, and rule of law--a plan that sounds an awful lot like nation building. What remained entirely unclear is how Mr. Romney would actually make progress on any of these fronts, particularly in countries of critical concern. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama pointed out that we "cannot just meet these challenges militarily" and quickly mentioned religious minorities and women and encouraging economic development before neatly sidestepping to "nation building here at home."
Ultimately, tonight's debate didn't change many (any?) voters' opinions about either candidate. And it left national security wonks I know banging their heads against the table, still wondering how the election will affect America's foreign policies in the years ahead. But at least we're now certain the military has fewer bayonets than it did in 1916.

HEADLINE: Raoul De Keyser, Intuitive Abstract Painter, Dies at 82

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Raoul De Keyser, a Belgian painter whose evocative, seemingly awkward abstractions both celebrated and questioned his medium, died on Oct. 5 in Deinze, near Ghent. He was 82.
He died of natural causes, his family said.
Mr. De Keyser became one of the most respected painters of his time, but slowly. For much of his 50-year career he exhibited primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands, achieving international recognition only after his work was included in the 1992 Documenta exhibition in Kassel, Germany, by that year's commissioner, the Belgian museum director Jan Hoet.
Mr. De Keyser worked with a striking economy of means. His mature paintings often consist of a few sparse patches of paint laid over a monochrome field, suggesting scattered islands and eliciting frequent comparisons to Mondrian's early seascapes. They also evoke the remnants of a larger, more assertive painted shape that has been tenderly cut into irregular bits. 
Nearly all Mr. De Keyser's work teeters between abstraction and legibility. ''The things I see come back in one way or another,'' he once said. Indeed, a series of especially spare, seemingly abstract paintings of white lines and grids on mostly green backgrounds from the early 1970s were actually based on the chalk lines, goal posts and net of the soccer field near his home.
Mr. De Keyser was born in Deinze on Aug. 29, 1930, and lived there all his life. His father was a carpenter. He began to paint on his own as a teenager but soon veered into journalism, writing for daily newspapers.
Mr. De Keyser sought artistic training only in his early 30s, studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Deinze under the painter Roger Raveel. He joined with Mr. Raveel and two others painters to form a Pop Art-oriented group called New Vision and over the next several years produced flattened, thickly painted close-up views of corners of his living room, the handle of its sliding glass doors and bits of his garden, as well as schematic images of clouds and horizon lines outlined in black.
The paintings ignore the brand-oriented, photo-based direction of American Pop in favor of the more life-based efforts of British Pop artists like David Hockney and Patrick Caulfield, forming one of the less-studied chapters of Pop's history.
But Mr. De Keyser was always drawn to abstraction. In 1966, after being impressed by a big, bright abstract painting by the American Al Held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, he returned home and painted over the background of a 1964 image of his dog Baron with flat, vivid yellow, retitling the work ''Baron in Al Held Field.''
Mr. De Keyser's mature images often seemed to be based on something real, including the flat fields, tangled trees and riverbanks around Deinze, but they also maintained a mysterious ambiguity, refusing to be anything more than painted motifs. They avoided monumentality, however, as well as bravura brushwork and all notions of finish, masterly personality or evolutionary development.
His working method was intuitive and relatively permissive, largely free of restrictions or formula, which distinguished him from similarly skeptical painters like Robert Ryman, Blinky Palermo and Daniel Buren. But he also avoided the free-range approach of more antic figures like Sigmar Polke, who marshaled textiles, photographic techniques and unusual materials into his work.
Working directly on canvas with a brush and occasionally chalk using a light, even frugal touch, Mr. De Keyser -- who switched from acrylic to oil paint in the mid-1970s -- reviewed nearly every mode of abstraction from gestural to geometric, but always avoided extremes. His lines were never ruled, his edges never hard; his loose brushwork was devoid of angst.
Mr. De Keyser had his first museum survey at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 1970 and numerous surveys and retrospectives thereafter, most recently at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in 2004 and the Kunstmuseum Bonn in Germany in 2009. He had his first solo show in New York at the Brooke Alexander Gallery in SoHo 1995 and subsequently exhibited with the David Zwirner Gallery there.
Mr. De Keyser's wife, Dina Baudoncq, whom he married in 1952, died in 1984. He is survived by their three sons, Luc, Piet and Jan; six grandchildren; and his companion, Lia Schelkens.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Seems as if Sky Is the Limit On Land Prices Across Farm Belt

BYLINE: By RON NIXON and JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
EAGLE GROVE, Iowa -- After initially trickling in slower than the auctioneer's babble, the bids began picking up.
''Get your hands up,'' belted Marv Huntrods, the auctioneer, his baritone echoing from a raspy speaker in a plaid-carpeted Masonic lodge here last week. He chopped the air with one hand and drew out his vowels.
''Grains up overnight.'' ''It's only money.'' ''Just tell me, yes or yes.'' ''Last chance.''
After about 15 minutes and a starting bid of $6,000 per acre, Mr. Huntrods, an agent with Hertz Farm Management, ended up with more than he had expected. A former John Deere dealer bought the 80-acre farm plot at a stunning price of $10,600 per acre. Mr. Huntrods had thought it would fetch less than $9,500 per acre. 
Across the nation's Corn Belt, even as the worst drought in more than 50 years has destroyed what was expected to be a record corn crop and reduced yields to their lowest level in 17 years, farmland prices have continued to rise. From Nebraska to Illinois, farmers seeking more land to plant and outside investors looking for a better long-term investment than stocks and bonds continue to buy farmland, taking advantage of low interest rates.
And despite a few warnings from bankers, the farmland boom shows no signs of slowing. Almost every year since 2005, except during the start of the recession in 2008, agriculture land prices have posted double-digit gains. In the same period, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has had double-digit gains in only three of those years.
An August survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago showed a 15 percent increase in farmland prices since last year across a region that covers Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Michigan. Another survey released at the same time from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City showed even higher growth in the Great Plains states, where farmland prices have increased 26 percent since last year.
The two Fed surveys and sales data have raised concerns from bank regulators about a potential farmland bubble, similar to the housing frenzy that helped set off the financial crisis. A year ago, rising farmland prices prompted regulators to warn banks not to relax lending standards. In July, the Kansas City Fed held a symposium to discuss concerns about a bubble.
''Any time you have an asset that doubles in value over a decade, there is cause for concern about how sustainable that growth is,'' said Richard A. Brown, chief economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
For farmers in the land hunt, a potential bubble was barely a concern. Many said they needed to buy more land to expand their businesses so they can generate more income. And in this wobbly economy, they found safety in stashing their money in farmland.
''What's a C.D. at the bank? Half a percent,'' said Clark Wadle, who attended the auction. ''What's the stock market? Unstable. Whether land prices go up or they go down again, you still have the property.''
The winning bidder, Gaylord Jones of Eagle Grove, said that buying farmland was a way to invest on his own terms.
''I don't buy stocks,'' he said. ''This way, I make my own damn mistakes.''
The worst drought in decades this summer seemed a distant memory here as about two dozen farmers escaped the cold and rain for the coffee-and-cookie-infused air inside the lodge where the auction was held.
In some cases, the drought has benefited farmers seeking land. Brent Kuehnast, who bought 190 acres this summer to add to the roughly 1,200 his family owns, said the drought helped him negotiate a below-market price on the property near his home in Humboldt, Iowa.
But the drought also caused some anxiety over his purchase.
On a recent afternoon, as his pickup truck bobbed like a vessel in choppy water over the dirt of his new plot, Mr. Kuehnast, 44, smiled when asked how often he inspected his new land, which he will start farming next year.
''All the time,'' he said. ''I like to find out where it needs to be improved.''
No state has benefited more from the farmland boom than Iowa.
According to an agriculture land survey by Iowa State University, prices have risen 32 percent since 2010. Statewide, farmland prices averaged $6,700 an acre, the highest ever, even after adjusting for inflation. Four years ago, prices averaged $3,900 an acre.
Because of the strong demand for farmland, banking regulators fear that farmers could take on more debt to make purchases, a repeat of the 1970s and early 1980s, when overleveraged farmers used their farms as collateral to buy up more land. The resulting debt led to a slew of bankruptcies and plummeting land values.
Those days are fresh in the mind of John Kintzle, 68, who lives near Cedar Rapids and attended the auction here in north-central Iowa just to observe. Back then, he said, prices dropped from $3,000 an acre to $1,000 an acre in three years.
''I'm a little gun-shy,'' he said, though he added that he was open to purchasing. ''My wife thinks I'm nuts.''
Economists say that so far there are few signs of a repeat of those days.
Agriculture Department data show that net farm income is expected to increase to $122 billion this year from $117 billion in 2011, a 4 percent increase even with the effects of the drought. That's the highest income level since 1973 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Economists say farmland values are getting a boost from corn and soybean prices, which had reached records highs because of the drought.
Farmers are carrying less debt than they were 30 years ago, and low interest rates are also a factor because they make it less costly for farmers to borrow. The federal crop insurance program also plays a role in keeping farmland prices high, by covering a majority of losses in revenue or crop yields.
Regulators, however, say that despite the continued growth in farmland prices there are reasons to be cautious. Some lenders have reported that a number of farmers are taking out loans based on the current value of their land to take advantage of the farmland boom.
Fed officials and some real estate brokers said these buyers could be in trouble if interest rates rose and crop prices fell. This could cause farmland values to drop by a third to a half, putting farmers at risk of default. Another risk is that if the drought stretches into multiple years, it could interrupt the boom in farmland prices, officials said.
But that was not something to worry about, said Brian Wagner, who stopped his bidding at the auction because he thought values would eventually drop, allowing him to buy a better piece of land at a lower price.
''That would be like me asking you, 'When you get in your car or on the bus, do you think about getting into an accident?' '' he said. ''Accidents happen randomly. Droughts come and droughts go. They don't come very often.''

HEADLINE: 2 Women in Queens and Many Others Find a Sick Day Could Mean They're Fired

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
There is a brutal constancy to the workweeks of these two women: 72-hour weeks piled one atop another.
In Corona, Queens, Celina Alvarez chops chayote and avocados and chickens in a dank restaurant basement. And a few blocks away, Rocio Loyola makes juice drinks.
Now and then Ms. Loyola, 35, wears down and the chill of flu runs through her body, and she vomits in the employees' bathroom. And, she says, her boss shakes his head and warns: 
You go home, you're fired.
As for Ms. Alvarez, 48, some months ago her heart throbbed, her arms and chest heavy with ache. On her single day off she walked into a clinic, and a doctor listened through his stethoscope and told her: Your heart is in bad shape.
He checked her into the hospital. A few days later, she was discharged and walked 15 blocks to beg her employer for her job back. She said he was disgusted: You're old and you're sick. With that, she said, he sent her back to chop in a basement filled with two inches of gray water.
She is a proud woman with dark, piercing eyes set in a full face framed by high cheekbones. She said nothing to her boss. ''I couldn't stop thinking: How will I find money for food? For rent?'' she says. ''So I went to that basement.''
There is now a Dickensian feel to New York City. You walk below the El on Roosevelt Avenue in Corona and find so many hard-fought-for laws -- against overcrowded tenements, and wage violations and sanitary conditions -- winked at. In this Upstairs, Downstairs city, those at the bottom of the pile learn the virtues of silence.
Of late, however, a coalition of community groups has taken up the cudgel in support of paid sick days. This is a luxury denied to 700,000 to 1.2 million New Yorkers.
The City Council has talked of mandating that all employers with more than five employees provide five paid sick or flexible vacation days.
''Paid sick days should be on par with the minimum wage, the eight-hour day,'' says Bill Lipton, deputy director of the Working Families Party.
Perhaps, although in truth New York's reform pulse flutters weakly. Last year the City Council spent months debating a so-called living wage that in the end, sanded down by compromise, seemed to apply to approximately 14 workers.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg worries a lot about our health; he's banned smoking in bars and vat-size cups of soda. But suggest that a couple of women should be allowed to take off a day rather than cough bacteria into the chicken quesadillas, and his free-market spine stiffens.
Compromise is no option. When the leaders of Chambers of Commerce in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn sounded dangerously amenable to a deal, the mayor's top aides set straight these weak-kneed sorts.
When more than 100 owners of small businesses signed a petition urging the City Council to pass sick-days legislation, some sharp-eyed fellow working against the bill happened to notice that a few of these owners had city tax liens.
Voil! The New York Post published an article proclaiming: ''They want more government mandates but can't even pay their taxes.''
In theory, a sizable majority of the City Council supports sick days. In reality, few of this often emasculated body will buck the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, particularly as she has a case of the mayoral fevers and much desires the endorsement of Mr. Bloomberg.
Could it pass despite her opposition, I ask a councilman who favors the legislation. ''Totally free to vote their conscience, the vast majority would vote for sick days,'' he notes brightly.
Then he acknowledges that conscience does not rate so high on the scale of useful City Council attributes.
Ms. Quinn, unlike the mayor, takes pain to express her sympathy with those who say they'd like a day or two off if they or their children fall ill. A former tenant organizer, she recognizes that this city is defined as much by the crowded shift-bedrooms of Elmhurst as by the resale value of luxurious Chelsea co-ops.
''I really don't think this is a good idea for small businesses at this time,'' she says. ''But the economy has not yet turned the corner and we'll put them in harm's way.''
So someday, maybe.
Opponents have placed the cost of the sick-days bill as high as $800 million. But those mathematics are more than a bit dubious, relying on assumptions that every single employee would take the maximum number of sick days, and then some.
More to the point, you wonder if perhaps there are a few jobs that a 21st-century global capital perhaps should consider passing on.
Ms. Alvarez recently found a new job. Her pay is a touch better. Does she, I ask, have sick days? She shrugs.
''They haven't said anything,'' she says. ''I just pray to God each night I have good health.''

HEADLINE: Finding Zen in a Patch of Nature

BYLINE: By JAMES GORMAN

 BODY:
SEWANEE, Tenn. -- It is afternoon in a hardwood forest on the edge of the Cumberland Plateau, and the cicadas are singing.
David Haskell, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of the South, is taking me through part of the 13,000 acres owned by the university, to a small circle of forest floor a bit over a yard in diameter. He visited this randomly chosen forest ''mandala,'' as he calls it, many times over the course of a year and recorded his observations in ''The Forest Unseen: A Year's Watch in Nature.''
He is pointing out flowers, salamanders, insects, trees, as we follow a well-worn hiking path, and stops for a moment to listen. These are swamp cicadas, he says, not the kind that hatch all at once after years underground and hammer the ear mercilessly.
''Was it last year or the year before we had the 13-year cicadas?'' he says. ''I took my sound pressure meter down to a place where they were really loud, and it came to over 90 decibels. At 85 OSHA says you need hearing protection in your workplace. 
''Everybody else hates them.''
But to him, the noise is biological alchemy, sunlight into sound. ''These guys have been feeding on roots for 13 years. And so it's 13 years of combined Tennessee forest productivity being blasted out.''
It is this kind of perception, halfway between metaphor and field note, that makes his voice a welcome entry in the world of nature writers. He thinks like a biologist, writes like a poet, and gives the natural world the kind of open-minded attention one expects from a Zen monk rather than a hypothesis-driven scientist. He avoids terms like ''nature deficit disorder'' and refuses to scold the bug-fearing masses. His pitch is more old-fashioned, grounded in aesthetics as much as science.
''You can live a perfectly happy life never having heard of Shakespeare,'' he says, ''but your life is in some ways a little diminished, because there's such beauty there.
''And I think the same is true of nature. Much of it is useless to us, and that's O.K. It's not true that every species that goes extinct is like another rivet off the plane and the plane's going to crash. We lost the passenger pigeon and the U.S. economy did not tank. But we lost the passenger pigeon and we lost some of this remarkable music made out of atoms and DNA.''
Dr. Haskell wanted to tell the story of forest ecology and also to refresh himself with a kind of natural history meditation, as opposed to goal-directed scientific research. He has a daily practice of sitting and concentrating on his breathing (he doesn't use the word ''meditation'') of no specific religious bent. He does, however, set himself apart from crusading atheists, like Richard Dawkins, saying he harbors a ''deep suspicion that the world is more than atoms rearranging themselves.''
He did no experiments and no research at his forest circle. He sat, and watched, and listened.
''I had my hand lens and binoculars and a notebook,'' he said. ''And that was it. And of course my senses.''
He is not, however, averse to technology when it comes to reaching an audience. He blogs (davidhaskell.wordpress.com) and tweets (@dghaskell).
As we walk in the forest, he points out shagbark hickory, baneberry (''very poisonous'') and blue cohosh (''you wouldn't want to eat it''). The forest is rich in animal and plant diversity partly because it never suffered the onslaught of glaciers that scoured more northern forests in the last ice age. His small circle lies in an area that has been untouched for hundreds of years.
But this forest is no pristine wilderness, as is obvious from the occasional golf ball resting under the ground cover. The path we are on is well down the side of a rough hill, beyond the crest of which lies the golf course. ''They remind me of eggs,'' Dr. Haskell says. ''You hatch one of these things and you get a golfer.''
Dr. Haskell was born in England, raised in Paris and educated at Oxford and Cornell before he came to Tennessee, 16 years ago, with his wife, Sarah Vance. One result of his background is that his accent is so hard to pin down, he says, that wherever he goes, people say, ''You're not from around here.''
At Oxford he met two people who had great influence on his approach: the evolutionary biologist William Hamilton, with whom he studied, and Ms. Vance, a biologist, artist, goat keeper and soap maker. They live on less than an acre in Sewanee with a garden and dairy goats for Ms. Vance's Cudzoo Farm, along with ducks, rabbits, bees, a dog and several cats.
His wife, Dr. Haskell says, ''really taught me what it would be like to look at nature with a more empathetic eye. And a careful eye.''
Dr. Hamilton, whose work on the genetic basis for altruism inspired both Dr. Dawkins's book ''The Selfish Gene'' and E. O. Wilson's ''Sociobiology,'' taught him that ''the big ideas were not in conflict with the particularities of natural history.'' In the field, he said, Dr. Hamilton would ''be noticing little tiny wildflowers and telling me not to put my bike on them.''
We reach the circle where Dr. Haskell made his observations, a spot he picked, he writes, ''by walking haphazardly through the forest and stopping when I found a suitable rock on which to sit.'' The name ''mandala'' was inspired by the sand paintings made by Buddhist monks. In describing their making, he writes, ''The whole universe is seen through this small circle of sand.''
In the book, he asks, ''Can the whole forest be seen through a small contemplative window of leaves, rocks and water?''
But unlike a mandala, which calls the eye to it with its intricacy, this bit of nature has nothing that would catch the eye of a passer-by. He looks it over and says, ''The first thing I see is this big old stick that's fallen across here and that has fallen since I wrote the book. And there's a downy woodpecker that's been at it since it fell and has taken out one of the wood-boring beetles.''
''Usually, if you stay here for a while, something is going to happen,'' he says. As if on cue, a bird's cry pierces the cicadas' hum. ''There's a blue jay. There are the cicadas. There are the harvestmen crawling around.''
He spent as much time doing research for the book as he did at the mandala, and some of the beauty he captures is intellectual, not sensual, found in the balance of conflict and cooperation in the forest. Of the toxins in plants and the detoxifying biochemistry of some herbivores, he writes, ''The mandala is not a banquet waiting for guests to arrive but a devil's buffet of poisoned plates from which herbivores snatch the least deadly morsels.''
When he sees ichneumon wasps in a fleck of sunlight running about, searching, he harnesses language and his acuity of vision to describe the moment: ''Every minute or two the wasps flip onto their sides and shudder their legs together, cleaning away the silk that spiders have strewn over the mandala.''
Then he harnesses history and biology to note that the reproductive habits of the wasps -- they lay their eggs in caterpillars, which the larvae, when hatched, eat from the inside out -- posed the ''problem of evil'' for Darwin and led him to agnosticism.
Science did not, however, give him his most enduring insight, which came while he was watching squirrels on a sunny December day. They were not frantic as usual, he writes.
''I watch them for an hour,'' he writes, ''and mostly they loll in the sun, limbs sprawled.'' It is a scene that seems a warning against too narrow a reading of nature.
''Science,'' he writes, ''deepens our intimacy with the world. But there is a danger in an exclusively scientific way of thinking. The forest is turned into a diagram; animals become mere mechanisms; nature's workings become clever graphs.''
These loafing squirrels were something else. ''They are alive; they are our cousins,'' he writes. ''And they appear to enjoy the sun, a phenomenon that occurs nowhere in the curriculum of modern biology.'' Science is one story, he writes, true but not complete, and the world cannot be encompassed in one story.
Still, his inner scientist -- noting, recording, cataloging -- is never far from the surface. As we sit at the mandala, Dr. Haskell keeps on noticing one small thing after another, even as we are nearing time to head out of the forest.
''Look,'' he says, ''here's a big old cricket. Looks to me like one of the cave crickets with the huge long antennae. That's a species I have not seen in this circle before.''

HEADLINE: European Countries Slash Deficits in 2011, E.U. Data Show

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- European countries sharply reduced their deficits last year, official data showed Monday, even as their overall debt grew as governments pushed ahead with austerity measures in the face of the euro crisis. 
The deficit of the 17 euro zone governments fell to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 6.2 percent in 2010, Eurostat, the E.U. statistical agency, reported from Luxembourg. The euro zone's debt as a percentage of G.D.P. rose to 87.3 percent at the end of 2011 from 85.4 percent a year earlier.
For all 27 European Union nations, the deficit shrank to 4.4 percent in 2011 from 6.5 percent a year earlier, even as debt grew to 82.5 percent of G.D.P. from 80 percent.
The most dramatic decline occurred in Ireland, where the deficit shrank to 13.4 percent of G.D.P., from 30.9 percent in 2010. That reflected the sharp expansion of the deficit in 2010, owing to the cost of bailing out the Irish financial sector.
Germany's deficit slid to 0.8 percent of G.D.P. from 4.1 percent, as Chancellor Angela Merkel's government benefited from the strongest growth of any major euro zone economy.
Greece, the ailing country where the crisis was touched off three years ago, saw its deficit decline to 9.4 percent of G.D.P. from 10.7 percent in 2010.
With the European and world economies flagging, Greece and other embattled nations face an uphill struggle in reducing their deficits to 3 percent or less of G.D.P. as stipulated under euro zone rules.
In all, Eurostat said, 17 E.U. nations had deficits above 3 percent. Among them were Britain, not a euro member, at 7.8 percent of G.D.P., France, at 5.2 percent, and Italy, at 3.9 percent.
In comparison, the United States had a debt-to-G.D.P. ratio last year of more than 100 percent, and a budget deficit of about 8.6 percent of G.D.P.
The debt burden of European countries grew partly because recession shrinks the denominator of the debt-G.D.P. equation. That has led some economists argue that Europe would be better off focusing on growth.
But Jrg Krmer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said, ''The main reason why debt-to-G.D.P. ratios in these countries continue to increase is that their deficits are still too high. The deficit is nothing more than the change in the level of your debt.''
In the case of Greece, he noted that even after accounting for the fact that the economy shrank sharply in 2011, the deficit came down only to 9.4 percent of G.D.P. ''That means you still have a deficit that is far in excess of the 3 percent or so that is considered sustainable,'' he said.
Mr. Krmer said there was little prospect of Greece outgrowing its problems.
''If you want to make its debt burden sustainable,'' he said, ''there will have to be some kind of debt forgiveness and restructuring.''
But deficit cutting, combined with structural reform, is still the only solution for the euro zone, he added.

HEADLINE: Surviving the Infirmity of 2 Unions

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- When their day is done, empires shrink back on themselves, but the yearning for greatness never quite fades.
Imperial rule leaves its imprint on the overlord as much as the lorded over. Colonialism scars the colonized for decades, but, for their erstwhile masters, the itch to play once more on the big stage never quite goes away.
Or so it has seemed. 
Rising from the Ottoman ruins in 1923, modern Turkey now seeks to resurrect regional power in lands that once fell under the sway of the sultans. The Soviet empire dwindled as the Berlin Wall crumbled in 1989. But that has merely emboldened President Vladimir V. Putin to thrust his land to the fore, both globally and in Russia's ''near abroad'' -- witness Moscow's 2008 invasion of Georgia. (A nuclear arsenal and lots of oil and gas help, of course.)
As much as it may wish to disown memories of the Reich, Germany seems condemned to lead in Europe, if only by dint of its economic brawn. France has kindled its vaunted exceptionalism from the ashes of an empire that lingered in some West African lands long after formal independence. Italy still seeks a special place in the affairs of its former colony in Libya, while Rome is built on the ruins of a much grander empire. In the catalog of Europe's former imperial powers, only Austria's modesty, possibly tactical, offers an exception to prove the rule.
Yet, could it be that Britain, the arch-imperialist from Asia to Africa to the Americas, has finally accepted its post-colonial contraction? After decades seeking to overcome the economic and political debilitation of victory in World War II, has Britain come to terms with the notion that the Little Englanders have won the day, as they failed to do with their opposition to colonialism in the 19th and early 20th centuries?
Consider just two moments last week, when Prime Minister David Cameron signed a formal agreement on the terms of a referendum on Scottish independence in two years' time, and signaled more clearly than ever his desire for a ''new settlement'' with the other 26 members of the European Union.
Now take both developments to their potential conclusion. By late 2014 -- coincidentally the deadline for Britain to end its role in the most enduring projection of 21st-century power in Afghanistan -- Scotland will conceivably be on the way to dissolving 300 years of union with Britain. Then, to win euro-skeptic support in the scheduled 2015 national vote, Mr. Cameron may hold another plebiscite to seek Britons' consent to a new relationship with the European Union, foreshadowing the negation or dilution of Britain's bonds with its most important trading partner.
The cartography of erstwhile empire could well be supplanted by a rump state between the English Channel and a new Scottish frontier to the north. Britain's voice in European affairs would be silenced or diminished, its access to European markets and North Sea oil limited, and its base rights in Scotland for nuclear-armed submarines, the very totem of global reach, threatened by the newly empowered authorities in Edinburgh.
That scenario, some would say, is exaggerated. Indeed, it is hard to see why British politicians would take such risks, although the politics of introspection rarely function along lines of obvious logic.
Many questions remain to be thrashed out, including the depth of Mr. Cameron's commitment to Britain as what he called ''a very active and strong participant in the European Union.''
Many answers will emerge from Europe's handling of the euro crisis.
The 17 countries using the single currency, led by Germany but not including Britain, clearly confront a common challenge. But, while euro zone leaders promote ever-closer integration, British euro-skeptics associate such cozy talk with a loss of sovereignty to be resisted at all costs.
While Continental Europeans talk, publicly at least, of solidarity in adversity, Mr. Cameron has sounded a more solipsistic tone, saying Europe's turmoil yields ''fresh opportunities'' for Britain.
Above all, those on the right who want Britain to go it alone seem to calculate that, as earlier in its history, their land has the might to stand apart from, and above, its peers. They do not acknowledge that, from a Continental perspective, their ambivalence toward the common European endeavor is becoming tiresome.
At a recent gathering hosted by the International Herald Tribune in Paris, a panel of Europeans aired their concerns without once mentioning Britain. As Alex Stubb, the Finnish minister for European affairs, told Reuters, ''It's almost as if the boat is pulling away and one of our best friends is somehow saying 'bye-bye' and there's not really that much we can do about it.''
On both his Scottish and European fronts, Mr. Cameron insisted that Britain would survive with both unions intact. If he is wrong, then the Little Englanders might well discover just how small their post-imperial realm could be.

HEADLINE: Iowa Justice Who Ruled for Gay Marriage Faces Test That Three Peers Failed

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- On a nippy morning in a grassy square park here, a pointed cry punctured the peaceful air.
''No more Wiggins!'' a man shouted into a microphone, urging on a group of about 30.
They were calling on voters to oust Justice David S. Wiggins, who was a part of the unanimous Iowa Supreme Court that ruled same-sex marriage legal in 2009. 
''It has changed our culture,'' roared Bob Vander Plaats, a conservative activist and leading force behind the campaign, heaping criticism on the court's decision. ''It has changed our foundation. It has changed the structure of the family to make marriage mean absolutely nothing and to mean anything you want it to be.''
Two years ago, Mr. Vander Plaats's points met scant resistance. As a result, three of the justices in the 7-to-0 ruling did not receive enough votes to be retained and were booted from the court. It was the first time voters had ousted justices since Iowa instituted a merit-selection process half a century ago.
This year looks different.
Justice Wiggins is the only justice up for retention who took part in the marriage ruling, and a robust coalition has formed around him, urging Iowans to vote to keep him on the court.
A pro-Wiggins bus tour, organized by the state bar association, trailed the anti-Wiggins bus tour across the state and is spending tens of thousands of dollars to get its message out. Justice Not Politics, a coalition favoring retention, is reaching out to individual voters. One Iowa, the state's leading gay rights organization, has been promoting its belief that same-sex marriage has benefited families and the economy. The group has been mailing literature and calling voters.
In the 2010 election, ''folks danced around the central issue, which was marriage equality,'' said Donna Red Wing, the executive director of One Iowa. ''It's very different now.''
Ms. Red Wing said her group was ''asking our supporters and friends to talk about their lives and talk about their families, so that this is not just a political conversation, so that the narrative really becomes about real families, Iowans who wake up every day and live their lives here.''
The bigger threat to same-sex marriage in Iowa next month may be the battle for control of the State Senate, where Democrats hold a one-seat advantage. Republicans have suggested that they would try to get a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the ballot if they seized the majority. Supporters of same-sex marriage argue that the matter is one of equality and best decided by the courts; schools may have remained segregated and interracial marriages illegal if those issues had been left to popular votes, they say.
Iowa justices generally face retention every eight years and need a simple majority of votes to keep their seats. All three justices were ousted in 2010 with nearly 55 percent against them.
''The reality is that it was a wake-up call for all of us,'' said Cynthia C. Moser, the president of the Iowa State Bar Association.
Justice Wiggins has declined to campaign for his seat, other than writing in The Des Moines Register that he hoped Iowans would vote to keep him but that he would not politicize the courts.
David Baker, one of the justices ousted in 2010, said they might not have made it clear enough that their ruling dealt with the civil marriage contract and did not prevent churches from choosing how to define marriage.
Advocates on both sides of the debate are looking toward this vote as a measure of Iowans' attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Some polls suggest there has been a marked shift.
Fifty-six percent of Iowans said they would oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, while 38 percent said they would favor it, according to a Des Moines Register poll in February. The number who would oppose an amendment was a considerable increase from 40 percent in 2009, when 41 percent said they would favor it.
In a Register poll of likely voters last month, 49 percent said they would vote to retain Justice Wiggins, 41 percent to remove, and 9 percent were unsure. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
But Brian Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage, one of the loudest opponents of same-sex marriage, said: ''The furor hasn't died down. People are still very upset.''

HEADLINE: Leaflets Sent by Balloon to North Korea Despite Ban, Activists Say

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Activists said on Monday that they had succeeded in sending large balloons drifting into North Korea carrying tens of thousands of leaflets, despite South Korean police efforts to block the action and a threat from the North Korean government to retaliate with a military attack.
The threat of a military clash prompted the South Korean authorities to block the activists, mostly defectors from the North, from reaching Imjingak, a border village northwest of Seoul, where they had planned to release the balloons. Hundreds of South Korean farmers living in nearby villages were ordered to go to bomb shelters, and the alert level was raised all along the border. 
But the activists said later that they had eluded the police and released the balloons from an island west of Seoul instead.
It was not immediately clear whether the balloons successfully scattered the leaflets over the isolated North, where the government struggles to keep nearly total control on its impoverished populace and bristles at any intrusion of outside news or opinion. There was no immediate response from North Korea.
Activist leaflets typically discuss the vast gaps between the economies and living standards in the North and the South, include lurid accounts of the luxuries that the North Korean ruling family enjoys and contradict the North's official history books, which claim that the Korean War was started by the United States rather than by the North's invasion of the South in 1950. Some leaflets carry Christian messages.
''We could not delay our plans to send the leaflets, because they carry our promise and love for our North Korean brothers,'' the activists said in a statement posted on the Web site of Free North Korea Radio, a Seoul-based group that seeks to broadcast outside news into the North.
Kim Seong-min, the head of the radio group and a leader of the leaflet campaign, criticized the South Korean authorities for blocking the activists from releasing balloons in the border village. ''South Korea is retreating under a North Korean threat,'' he said. ''Once you retreat under this kind of blackmail, you will continue to be pushed back.''
The North Korean threat of retaliation, issued on Friday, was hardly unprecedented. In recent months, the North has threatened to attack the Seoul office of President Lee Myung-bak, whom it has called a rat, and vowed to bombard the offices of major newspapers and television stations in the South that criticize the North.
Still, South Korean police appeared to take the threat seriously, erecting roadblocks, banning tourists and journalists from the area, and scuffling briefly with activists who tried to barge through their cordon.
A rival group of activists rallied near the border village, carrying banners that accused the leaflet activists of trying to incite a war between the Koreas.
On Monday, Glyn Davies, the top American envoy on North Korean matters, told reporters in Beijing that it was grossly disproportionate for North Korea ''to have threatened to respond to balloons with bombs,'' The Associated Press reported.
China, the North's main ally, welcomed the South Korean government's efforts to check the balloon-flying and urged the Koreas to ''stay calm and restrained.''
During the cold war, both Koreas used balloons to send official propaganda leaflets across their heavily fortified frontier, a practice that ended after the first inter-Korean summit meeting in 2000. But in recent years, some defectors began sending propaganda balloons of their own into the North. The latest episode came at a politically delicate time in South Korea, where a presidential election is due in December and the political parties are highly attuned to how a surprise North Korean move might affect the outcome.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise Slightly As Uncertainty Prevails

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market struggled for direction on Monday, with the three main indexes closing barely higher, as investors were underwhelmed by the latest earnings reports.
The uncertainty about the outcome of the presidential election in two weeks also contributed to investors' caution, analysts said.
''They need to know the playing field before they get out there and play,'' said Jeff Savage, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. 
David Katz, principal and senior portfolio strategist at WeiserMazars Wealth Advisors, said it mattered more that the election is wrapped up than who is elected.
''One could say the markets will rally stronger if the Republican candidate becomes president,'' Mr. Katz said. ''But one way or another, the markets will have direction, and the markets like direction.''
The Dow Jones industrial average ended virtually flat on Monday, inching up 2.38 points, to close at 13,345.89. A late rise erased a 108-point deficit in the Dow.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was also almost unchanged, edging up 0.63 point, to 1,433.82. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.34 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,016.96.
The stock market is awaiting the government's report on Friday on third-quarter growth. But company reports have been signaling that consumers, the main drivers of economic growth, were still restrained.
Hasbro, the toy-maker behind brands like My Little Pony and Transformers, posted third-quarter earnings that showed sales for boys' products and preschool toys had weakened. The stock slipped 66 cents to $38.39.
The VF Corporation, whose brands include Timberland and Wrangler, reported financial results that missed analysts' revenue estimates. The stock slid $7.31, hitting $159.46.
SunTrust Banks also slipped. Its third-quarter earnings jumped, but that was largely because the bank sold shares it owned in Coca-Cola. The bank, based in Atlanta, wrestled with higher expenses as well as low interest rates, which crimps profit from lending. The stock lost 96 cents to $27.67.
Shares for Caterpillar, the world's largest construction and mining equipment company, gained $1.22 to $85.08 after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. But the company warned that it expected lower profit and revenue for the rest of the year.
Most companies are reporting better-than-expected profits. But investors want to know how companies are faring on revenue, which can provide a more accurate picture of how a company is performing because profits can vary widely on items like accounting charges and cost-cutting.
Mr. Katz described third-quarter revenue results as ''fair'' and said the American economy was ''slow and steady.''
''It is at a snail's pace,'' he said. ''But it's certainly better than what we had.''
Of the roughly 100 companies in the S.& P. 500 that had reported third-quarter results as of last week, 70 percent have beat analysts' estimates for profits, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. But only 42 percent have beaten estimates for revenue. That is the lowest since the first quarter of 2009, when the stock market hit lows during the recession.
Company profits this quarter are down 2.3 percent compared with a year earlier. Revenue is down by an average of 0.6 percent.
One stock that jumped was Ancestry.com, the genealogy Web site, which announced it would be bought by European private equity firms. The stock popped $2.26 to $31.44. The buyers had offered $32 a share.
Apple shares also jumped, rising $24.19 to $634.03. The company is expected to release a new, smaller iPad on Tuesday, to compete with Amazon.com's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7.
In the bond market, interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 98 10/32, while its yield rose to 1.82 percent, from 1.77 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Nuclear Reactor To Be Closed

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The owner of a small nuclear reactor in Wisconsin said Monday that it would close the Kewaunee Power Station early next year because it was unable to find a buyer and the plant was no longer economically viable.
The decision was viewed as an early sign that the wave of retirements of old generating stations across the Midwest is now stretching from the coal industry into nuclear power, driven by slack demand for energy and the low price of natural gas. 
After receiving a 20-year extension from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2011 to continue operating Kewaunee, Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., put the power station up for sale. At 556 megawatts, it is about half the size of the largest plants now operating and is the only reactor at the Carlton site, rendering costs higher per unit of power than sites with two reactors. Dominion had hoped to buy several reactors in the Midwest that could share some overhead expenses with Kewaunee, but did not succeed.
''This was an extremely difficult decision, especially in light of how well the station is running and the dedication of the employees,'' said Thomas F. Farrell II, Dominion's chairman, president and chief executive, in a statement. ''This decision was based purely on economics.''
He said nuclear power would be essential to the nation's energy future -- just in other places. The company owns six other reactors at three sites, and will take a one-time charge of $281 million for the closure, which it expects in the spring.
The industry's trade association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, tried to play down the significance of the Kewaunee closing, saying it was because of circumstances unique to Dominion. Marvin Fertel, the president and chief executive of the association, said that nuclear energy ''remains a reliable, cost-effective producer of electricity for America's homes and our economy.''
This did not explain, however, why no better-situated company came forward to buy the plant.
When Dominion bought the plant from local owners in 2005, it signed contracts to sell them the electricity, a common practice, but as those contracts expire, the plant faces selling electricity at the lower rates that now dominate the energy market.
Bruce Biewald, the founder and chief executive of Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm, said that low electricity prices were a severe problem for generators in places like the Midwest, where power is sold at auction. ''You're looking at margins that are declining in a really serious way,'' he said.
Counting Kewaunee, there are 104 power reactors licensed in the United States. Kewaunee, which received its 40-year operating license in December 1973, will be the first reactor to retire since Millstone 1, near New London, Conn., in July 1998.
Annual capital costs on a 1,000 megawatt nuclear reactor range from $60 million to $70 million, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute; average annual costs for operation and maintenance plus fuel are $140 million to $150 million. And when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is finished ordering improvements prompted by the Fukushima disaster of last year, some plants will face significant expenses. Perhaps more could decide that continuing to operate was not worth the investment given current revenues.
In some regions, the average selling price of a megawatt-hour today is less than $50 at times. But a survey of the industry by the Electric Utility Cost Group, an industry consortium, found that one quarter of nuclear plants with the highest costs were spending an average of $51.42 to produce a megawatt-hour from 2008 through 2010. And costs have gone up since then.
Other companies have also reported falling revenues, although they may not be on the verge of closing reactors because they are in regions where the market price of electricity is higher. Nearly all the operating reactors are approaching or have reached the end of their initial license periods, and have applied for extensions or received them. But the license may not indicate the lifetime of the reactor.
''No nuclear plant I know of has ever closed because it hit the end of its license,'' said Peter Bradford, who served on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1977 to 1982 and was later chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission. A nuclear plant needs a life expectancy of a few years for its owners to consider major new investments, he said in a telephone interview, but if low electricity prices persist, even that may not be enough.

HEADLINE: Midsize Markets Suffer Airline Neglect

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HOUSTON
''YOU can't get there from here'' is an old joke. But after my experience trying to get from Tucson to Houston on short notice over the weekend, I'm not laughing.
Last Wednesday, I learned that I had to be in Houston for business before 3 p.m. on Sunday. Hey, no problem, I thought as I went online to look for flights.
Big problem, as it turned out. I knew, in theory, that business travelers flying to and from medium-size markets like Tucson were regularly confronting the realities of today's domestic air travel system. Focusing more on big hubs and on ever-closer partnerships with international alliances, airlines have greatly reduced service at midsize and smaller regional airports. Those airports, on average, have lost about 25 percent of their seats in the last two years, according to Boyd Group International, the airline forecasting company. 
The main consequence is that, sometimes, you really can't get there from here -- at least not easily and on a reasonable schedule.
When I checked the flight schedules, round-trip coach fares to Houston from Tucson -- a flight of a little more than two hours -- were all in the $800 to $1,200 range. But even at that price, I couldn't find a flight that would get me to Houston on Sunday before 3 p.m. Several were sold out, and the single Southwest flight wouldn't work because it arrived too late at Hobby Airport in Houston, more than 30 miles from Bush Intercontinental Airport, where I had to meet someone.
My only option was to leave a day earlier and spend an extra night in a hotel. So I arrived in Houston a little after 11 p.m. on Saturday on a US Airways flight from Tucson that had required a mad dash to make the connection at Phoenix, after the airline abruptly switched gates from one terminal to another.
Incidentally, when I arrived at the Tucson airport at midafternoon on Saturday, I saw 10 flights on the departure board for that day -- nine westbound, to places like Los Angeles or San Diego, and not a single one, other than the flight I was on, heading east.
Midsize and smaller airports, which are after all local businesses at their core, have been scrambling to attract more air service, though many aviation experts contend it's a lost cause because the airlines have become so adept at reducing capacity to keep planes full.
The strategic decisions about air service, usually made in conjunction with the airline's global alliance partners, ''are all about matching costs to revenues that can be generated by any given route,'' said Michael Boyd, the president of Boyd Group. ''Airlines are no longer chasing passenger volume.''
A result is that the air travel system is contracting, and there are no signs that will change in at least the next few years. The airports that are sponsoring studies to attract new airlines or new nonstop routes are wasting their money, Mr. Boyd said ruefully. ''There are no airlines left'' that have a strong desire to add new regional capacity, he said, adding: ''The cavalry isn't coming. The cavalry doesn't even exist anymore.''
Tucson, a vibrant city of more than 500,000 in southern Arizona, is one good example. From 2004 to 2007, air service at the Tucson airport increased 27 percent, said Mary Davis, the airport's senior director of business development and marketing. Then, as airlines fundamentally shifted strategy and consolidated markets after the spike in fuel prices in 2008 and the economic effects of the recession, the airport ''lost about 30 percent of our service,'' she said.
''We're trying to re-engage a conversation with our airline partners and say, look, we understand you need to be profitable; we understand that you've had to change your business models; we even understand that airlines are now hub-centered; we understand that if you're going to have nonstop service, passengers are going to pay a premium for it,'' she said. ''But where does that leave the middle guy?''
As a middle-guy business traveler, I saw on Saturday that the very, very pleasant Tucson airport was very, very quiet, while the Phoenix airport, a big hub, was so crowded that people were sitting on the floor and gate agents were making desperate calls for volunteers to give up seats on overbooked flights
Meanwhile, at the Houston airport late that night, I waited for a hotel shuttle bus while listening to repetitions of that singularly irritating security announcement used at Houston. You know, the one in which the lady with a voice like Granny on ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' warns that ''inappropriate remarks or jokes concerning security may result in your arrest.''
Don't worry, I thought. There is absolutely nothing to joke about in any aspect of domestic air travel these days.

HEADLINE: Take a Cue From Venice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Self-Destruction of the 1 Percent,'' by Chrystia Freeland (Sunday Review, Oct. 14), draws a parallel between the rulers of the Venetian Republic and the increasingly privileged 1 percent in the United States. The article says, ''In the longer term, La Serrata'' (when the upper class locked in its privileges around 1315) ''was the beginning of the end'' for Venice's elite. 
In fact, the Venetian Republic was the most successful such political entity in history, lasting until 1797 -- a presumed ''self-destruction'' of almost 500 years. A like ''failure'' by the American Republic means that it would endure well into the 2200s.
Venetian success mainly resulted from its nobles living intimately amid the populace, exposed daily to economic hardships that the American elite, with its gated enclaves and private jets, is not.
Despite their legal exclusivity, Venetian nobles remained obsessively concerned with sustaining and placating those excluded from their ranks. If the 1 percent of the United States is not to self-destruct, it would do well to follow the example of the Venetian elite.
ROBERT FINLAY Fayetteville, Ark., Oct. 14, 2012
The writer, a professor of history at the University of Arkansas, is the author of ''Politics in Renaissance Venice.''
To the Editor:
In her otherwise insightful essay, Chrystia Freeland writes that the United States was ''one of the most egalitarian societies on the planet'' in the early 19th century. It should be obvious to even the most casual observer of history that our country's experience of slavery strongly negates that statement.

HEADLINE: A Tiny Pacific Island Nation That Does Not Smell Like Paradise

BYLINE: By MATT SIEGEL

 BODY:
FUNAFUTI, Tuvalu -- The sun is setting over the Pacific islet, casting the isolated lagoon in brilliant shades of red, orange and topaz. Towering palm trees sway slowly in the warm tropical breeze. Out in the distance, fishermen in a small boat slowly troll the coral atolls for reef fish, much as the people of Tuvalu have done for hundreds of years or more.
But none of these things are what hit you first about this setting, on the edge of the water. What hits you first is the smell. Household garbage mingles with wastes both human and animal in open pits that, when filled with seawater during high tide, turn into a fetid soup under the blistering sun. It is in one of the dozens of precariously balanced stilt houses over those pits that Kalalisa Uilese lives with her husband and three children.
''There's not enough land,'' Ms. Uilese, 47, said matter-of-factly inside her dark, makeshift living room. ''That's why we build our houses on them.'' 
Tuvalu, a tiny cluster of nine coral atolls and islands about halfway between Australia and Hawaii in the South Pacific, is one of the smallest countries on the planet, and many scientists say it is getting smaller. Its population of fewer than 12,000 people inhabits a landmass of 26 square kilometers, or 10 square miles, about a third the size of Manhattan. On Funafuti, the main atoll and Tuvalu's capital, the widest point between the lagoon around which the town spreads and the ocean beyond is just half a kilometer.
The lowest point is just above sea level, a spot from which you can be tricked into thinking that you are somehow standing below the vast Pacific, looking up rather than out into it.
Data from the National Research Council in the United States predict that global sea levels could rise by as much as 55 inches by 2100 as a result of climate change, which, when combined with damage to the coral roots of Tuvalu by rising acidity in seawater, could threaten the country's very existence. Then there is coastal erosion, a result of rising water and harsh weather but also human activities like excavation for construction and other development projects.
During World War II, as fighting between the United States and Japan raged across the Pacific, the British government granted the United States military the use of its colony on what is now Tuvalu but was then known as the Ellice Islands. Massive antiaircraft guns, the concrete base of at least one of which still stands a lonely vigil in the surf, were quickly erected. But for the islands to reach their full wartime potential, they needed an airstrip. Large quantities of coral were dug up and carted off to be crushed and mixed for the tarmac. The gaping pits that were left behind across Funafuti, called ''borrow pits,'' were never filled and eventually began to be used for refuse. Add to this the doubling of Tuvalu's population since 1980, and it is easy to understand why, as usable land dwindled, homes like Ms. Uilese's started to stretch across the pits.
For Betty Vuva, 49, the head teacher at Nauri Primary School, the borrow pits and their attendant health problems are a constant source of anxiety. As the changing tides have steadily encroached on the island from without, she says, the land around the pits has become more crowded.
''Well, so far no houses have collapsed,'' she said with a wry laugh.
The government of Tuvalu, which survives on a combination of foreign aid and dividends from the sale in 1998 of the .tv Internet domain name, has repeatedly asked the United States government for assistance in refilling the borrow pits. In 2003, the United States Army Corps of Engineers carried out a site assessment and cost study at the behest of the State Department. The 152-page report acknowledged the provenance of the pits and starkly identified their cost to the island.
''Solid waste disposal sites surrounding residential homes and animals have developed into a health hazard for nearby residents,'' the report said. ''An engineered solid waste landfill site and management plan needs to be implemented for the safety of the people and longevity of the island.''
Three options for refilling the pits were considered in the document, ranging in cost from $14,950 to $28.5 million, but the issue has gone no further. Tuvalu, which has an annual gross domestic product of about $35 million, says it is ill-equipped to act on the report by itself.
''The government has never had the financial resources needed to fill in the borrow pits,'' Prime Minister Willy Telavi said in an e-mailed response to questions. ''We just don't have the money. Not even close.''
He added: ''Over the years we have approached many donor countries, including the United States, about filling in the borrow pits but without success. If the U.S., which to us has always been the likely donor to fix the problem, was willing to revisit the issue of filling in the borrow pits we would welcome their efforts with open arms.''
That, however, seems unlikely, at least in the short term, according to a senior United States administration official who cited the costs of carrying out the project using environmentally sound methods.
''In order not to cause further environmental damage to the land or surrounding seas, material may have to be imported, which would increase the cost considerably,'' the official said in an e-mail on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to comment publicly. ''We continue to work on this with the government of Tuvalu and we look forward to finding a mutually acceptable, affordable and environmentally responsible solution.''
For James Conway, 53, an adviser on energy policy to the Ministry of Economic Planning and Foreign Affairs, that kind of solution has already been too long in coming. Mr. Conway, an American who moved to Tuvalu as a United States Peace Corps volunteer more than 20 years ago, is now married to a Tuvaluan woman with whom he has a teenage daughter, and he worries about the health effects of the borrow pits.
''People in greater numbers are starting to build next to them, over them and in them with houses on stilts,'' he said in an interview inside his sweltering office in the island's main government building. However, Mr. Conway dismissed the idea that Washington somehow owes it to Tuvalu to fill in the pits, pointing out that the runway has brought enormous economic benefits to the country.
The idea of the Americans ''filling in the borrow pits as some kind of war reparations is probably stretching it a little bit,'' he said. Still, he added, ''it is valuable land. If the borrow pits could be filled in, there would be economic value associated with it. It would dramatically improve public health by decreasing water-borne illnesses.''
For Ravina Falemi, 27, and her three small daughters, that would be a blessing. On a recent afternoon she stood holding her youngest daughter, Emma, as about a dozen half-naked children splashed around in the acrid water. One small boy stood on the narrow dirt path leading to the cluster of homes where Ms. Falemi lives, fishing in the muck with a homemade rod.
''The common sickness is diarrhea,'' she said. ''We always advise the children not to come here because of that, but sometimes small kids wash their hands in it and then come home and take a biscuit or something.''
Should the United States help with the pits? Yes, she said. But will anyone ever actually do anything about them?
''Who knows?'' she said. ''Maybe we'll just migrate for good.''

HEADLINE: Lincoln Alexander, 90, Canadian Trailblazer

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Lincoln Alexander, the son of a hotel maid and railway porter who became Canada&#x2019;s first black member of Parliament and first black cabinet minister, died on Friday in Hamilton, Ontario. He was 90.&#xa; 
&#xa;David C. Onley, the lieutenant governor of Ontario, announced the death.
Mr. Alexander was also Canada&#x2019;s first black lieutenant governor, but when he was elected to the House of Commons in 1968, he said he had tired of being called &#x201C;the first Negro&#x201D; anything. He sought to speak for all victims of injustice, he said. Blacks make up 2.5 percent of Canada&#x2019;s population.
With his election to Parliament, he was one of the few urban members of the Progressive Conservative Party to buck the landside vote for Pierre Trudeau&#x2019;s Liberals that year. In the Commons he became a leader in issues like immigration overhaul and urban renewal.
When the Conservatives gained power in 1979, he was named labor minister and promoted literacy education to enhance job preparation.
Mr. Alexander had a strong personality, bragging that nobody could beat him at &#x201C;working a room&#x201D; and roaring in Parliament that Liberals had &#x201C;bamboozled&#x201D; the public.
&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never really been in awe of anyone,&#x201D; he once said. &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds and good lookin&#x2019;, you know, you&#x2019;re not in awe of too many people.&#x201D;
Lincoln MacCauley Alexander was born in Toronto on Jan. 21, 1922. His parents had come from the Caribbean. He was the only black in his classrooms through high school, except during the two years he lived in the Bronx, from age 15 to age 17. His mother had taken him and his brother there in a time of marital discord, but she sent him back to his father in Toronto when Lincoln began hanging out on New York streets and carrying a switchblade.
After working as a machinist and being a wireless operator for the Royal Canadian Air Force, he studied history and economics at McMaster University in Hamilton, graduating in 1949. He earned a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School. He was a partner in one of Canada&#x2019;s first interracial law firms before winning election to Parliament.
After five terms, Mr. Alexander became chairman of Ontario&#x2019;s workmen&#x2019;s compensation board, Ontario&#x2019;s lieutenant governor, a largely ceremonial post, and chancellor of the University of Guelph in Ontario.
Mr. Alexander&#x2019;s wife of 51 years, the former Yvonne Harrison, died in 1999. In 2011 he married Marni Beale, who survives him. A son, Keith, and two granddaughters are also survivors.
Among the places named for Mr. Alexander is the Lincoln Alexander Parkway in Hamilton, although he never learned to drive and feared traffic. He always sat &#x201C;in the back, real low,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;so I can&#x2019;t see what&#x2019;s going on.&#x201D;

Mr. Alexander's wife of 51 years, the former Yvonne Harrison, died in 1999. In 2011 he married Marni Beale, who survives him. A son, Keith, and two granddaughters are also survivors.
Among the places named for Mr. Alexander is the Lincoln Alexander Parkway in Hamilton, although he never learned to drive and feared traffic. He always sat ''in the back, real low,'' he said, ''so I can't see what's going on.''

HEADLINE: Romney Shifts to Center; Obama Tries to Tie Him To Policies Under Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's task in Monday night's foreign policy debate was to demonstrate that he could be a credible commander in chief, prepared to execute American power with more muscle and less compromise than President Obama, but without veering into what Mr. Obama called the ''wrong and reckless'' policies of the last Republican in the Oval Office, George W. Bush.
But in a combative 90-minute debate that veered from whether the United States could control events in the fractious Middle East to which man has a better chance of forcing Iran's mullahs to surrender their nuclear program without resorting to war, Mr. Romney avoided the more bellicose tone he often struck during the Republican primaries.
While he sometimes pushed back at Mr. Obama, he explicitly said he would not intervene militarily in Syria, remain beyond 2014 in Afghanistan or rush into a confrontation with Iran. He ended up agreeing with the broad outlines of Mr. Obama's approach on the use of drones, and opposed a breach of relations with Pakistan, arguably America's most frustrating ally. 
Mr. Romney had a narrower political task on Monday night: to show he was conversant in the subject matter and to reassure a war-weary public that he would not plunge the country into new conflicts.
As he did in his previous two debates with Mr. Obama, he shifted to the middle, and at times he even sounded the nation-building theme the president talked about as a candidate in 2008 and abandoned after he was elected. ''We're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and killing bad guys,'' Mr. Romney argued several times, saying he would provide aid to build up democracies and discourage terrorism -- something he rarely stressed before. He frequently talked of bringing about a ''peaceful planet.''
Yet time and again, the president suggested that managing a world that at once craves and resents American power requires a lot more than martial-sounding declarations about calling in airstrikes or threatening to turn on and off American foreign aid.
And he relentlessly cast Mr. Romney as a man unwilling to recognize how perceptions of American strength have changed. When Mr. Romney complained that the Navy had shrunk to its smallest size since World War I, Mr. Obama dismissed the criticism. He noted that the capabilities of American ships are far beyond what they once were and added, ''Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.''
For Mr. Romney, this final debate before the election in two weeks was clearly his weakest. While he seemed familiar with a range of topics, speaking about rebellions in Mali and ticking off the insurgent groups in Pakistan, he also took every opportunity he could to turn back to economic issues at home, his campaign theme. Soon the two men were arguing about domestic job creation and support for education and teachers, until the moderator, Bob Schieffer of CBS News, said with some exasperation, ''We all love teachers.''
Even when the conversation turned to the intersection of international affairs and economics, Mr. Obama attacked his challenger, contending not only that Mr. Romney's prescription for America's automakers in 2009 would have put Americans out work, but also that it would have strengthened the Chinese.
''We'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China,'' Mr. Obama argued, before the two men engaged in a now-familiar argument over whether Mr. Romney's call for allowing General Motors to head into bankruptcy, without government investment, would have weakened Detroit.
On most of the specifics they argued about, Mr. Romney had a hard time explaining how he would act differently from Mr. Obama. He said he would not send the American military into Syria, or even attempt a no-fly zone over the county. Though he noted several times that 30,000 people had died in the Syrian uprising, he said: ''I don't want to have our military involved in Syria. I don't think there's a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.''
It was Mr. Obama, oddly enough, who made the case for the use of force, saying he had made the call to hunt down Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, and noting that Mr. Romney had called that ''mission creep'' and ''mission muddle.''
Mr. Romney's response was to argue that he was better suited to rein in the chaos in the Arab world, mostly by projecting American strength. But he was less than specific about how he would accomplish that task. For example, when Mr. Schieffer asked him whether he would have ''stuck with Mubarak,'' referring to Hosni Mubarak, the former president of Egypt and longtime American ally, Mr. Romney said that ''the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.'' What Mr. Obama lacked was ''a better vision of the future'' for the Middle East, he said.
It was on the confrontation that could well erupt in 2013, the nuclear face-off with Iran, that the friction between these two men, and their underlying agreement on tactics, became most evident.
Asked whether there was a deal to be had with Iran, Mr. Obama argued that the country was weaker than ever because he had invoked ''crippling sanctions'' as a result of ''painstaking'' work that began ''the day we got into office.'' But he was elusive about what exactly Iran would have to do to convince him that it had given up any plan to build a nuclear weapons capability, simply vowing, ''We're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence'' that the Iranians are backing down.
Mr. Romney returned to a main theme of his campaign: that the mullahs had moved ahead with their program because ''they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.'' One result, he said, is that ''now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium.''
It was an accurate statement, but it avoided any mention of the fact that the construction program was initially begun just before the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, in President Bush's first term. And Mr. Obama, in his response, was constrained by secrecy laws from talking about his most aggressive action against Iran: his decision to expand a cyberwarfare campaign against the country.
Inevitably, the two men descended into an argument over whether Mr. Obama had conducted an international ''apology tour,'' leading Mr. Obama to declare that ''this has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.'' Mr. Romney shot back that the president had said in his speeches in the Middle East that in the past ''America had dictated to other nations.''
''Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations,'' Mr. Romney said. ''We have freed other nations from dictators.''
In fact, America has done both, and the debate on Monday night underscored that whether Mr. Obama is re-elected or Mr. Romney moves into the Situation Room, the United States will still find itself making compromises between its values and its interests, because it usually has little other choice.

HEADLINE: 9 Justices Who Sit In the Eye Of Storms

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE OATH The Obama White House and the Supreme Court
By Jeffrey Toobin Illustrated. 325 pages. Doubleday. $28.95.
With its landmark 5-to-4 vote last June to uphold President Obama's health care reform law, the Supreme Court once again became the focus of a national debate that centered on its pivotal -- and political -- role in an increasingly partisan America, with public approval of the highest court in the land sinking to 41 percent in July. The court's evolving internal dynamics under the stewardship of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and its relationship with President Obama are the subjects of Jeffrey Toobin's useful new book, ''The Oath'': a follow-up to his 2007 best seller, ''The Nine,'' and a reminder that the presidential election in two weeks is likely to determine the ideological makeup of what has been a narrowly divided court in years to come. 
Mr. Toobin -- a staff writer at The New Yorker and senior legal analyst at CNN -- draws upon not-for-attribution interviews with the justices and more than 40 of their law clerks to serve up a lucid, if sometimes highly opinionated, assessment of the Roberts court. The book focuses at length on the health care ruling and the bitterly contested 5-to-4 Citizens United decision, which has contributed to the deregulation of the campaign finance landscape.
Readers will certainly not agree with all of Mr. Toobin's analysis, and there are some unfortunate slips into invective in this volume: at one point he goes so far as to describe Justice Antonin Scalia as becoming a ''right-wing crank.'' For the most part, however, Mr. Toobin makes reasoned cases for his interpretations of court rulings, their historical context and their possible social and political consequences. He puts today's conservative judicial activism in perspective with that of the liberal Warren Court of a half-century ago. And he looks at how the current makeup of the court reflects changes in the Republican Party at large, underscoring in particular the fallout created by the departure of the moderate Republican Sandra Day O'Connor.
(''What makes this harder,'' she reportedly told Justice David Souter as she was preparing to leave, ''is that it's my party that's destroying the country.'')
Mr. Toobin's analysis in these pages is helpful for readers looking for a one-stop overview of the court, but ''The Oath'' also relies, heavily at times, on the work of journalists from The New York Times, CBS, NPR, Politico and other news outlets, and many of Mr. Toobin's observations will be familiar to those who regularly follow Supreme Court coverage.
The freshest portions of ''The Oath'' tend to deal with interactions among the justices, and the ways temperament and past experiences inform their philosophies and decisions. In Mr. Toobin's tart opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy is given to a ''judge-centered, almost messianic, approach to the law''; Justice Scalia has become increasingly belligerent and contemptuous of Congress; and Justice Stephen Breyer has become increasingly upset at writing dissent after dissent. Mr. Toobin also notes that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Scalia are good friends, despite their very divergent politics, and that this odd couple often spend New Year's Eve together.
As for Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. Toobin describes him as towering ''above his colleagues, conservative and liberal alike, in savvy, intelligence and understanding of the place of the Supreme Court in American life.'' Explicating the similarities between Chief Justice Roberts and President Obama, he points out that both possess ''a powerful intellect and considerable charm''; both are Harvard Law School graduates and ''products of Chicago and its environs''; and both possess a certain literary flair. .
He also argues, however, that when it comes to an understanding of the Constitution and existing law, it is the chief justice, not the president, who is the ''apostle of change.'' In fact, Mr. Toobin says that President Obama has made lower-court nominations less of a political priority than his predecessors, having failed, he adds (as of the summer of 2012), even to submit nominations for 43 federal judgeships.
In Mr. Toobin's view, Mr. Obama ''did not believe the courts were the principal vehicle for social and political change,'' regarding ''elections, rather than lawsuits,'' as his ''battlefield of choice,'' and this ''diffidence about the role of the courts'' would shape both his own career and his presidency.
For that matter, Mr. Toobin argues, the president and Democrats in general have failed to engage on many legal issues: ''To the extent there is a contemporary liberal agenda, it consists roughly of a pallid embrace of the status quo: preserve Roe and affirmative action. (Support for the rights of gay people may turn out to be an exception to this pervasive timidity.)''
In contrast, this book contends, there is a clear Republican judicial agenda for change: ''expand executive power, end racial preferences intended to assist African-Americans, speed up executions, prohibit all forms of gun control, welcome religion into the public sphere, deregulate political campaigns and, above all, reverse Roe v. Wade and allow states to ban abortion.''
Mr. Toobin regards Justice Clarence Thomas as the court's ''conservative intellectual pathbreaker,'' arguing that ''his hostility to campaign finance regulation, and his First Amendment absolutism, anticipated Citizens United.'' In his opinion, Justice Thomas paid ''far less deference to prior rulings'' -- that is, to precedent -- ''than anyone else on the court.''
Mr. Toobin also declares that ''more than any other justice, perhaps more than any other public figure, Clarence Thomas helped inspire the Tea Party movement,'' observing that the justice's wife, Virginia, had done consulting work with Tea Party groups opposing the president's health care law.
In the case of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Toobin echoes what some other court observers have argued: that in joining with the court's four more liberal members and finding a way to uphold President Obama's heath care overhaul law, the chief justice was actually playing the long game on behalf of conservatives. It was, Mr. Toobin suggests, an act of ''strategic genius'': it ''took the Supreme Court off the Democratic agenda for at least the foreseeable future'' and ''bought enormous political space for himself for future rulings,'' refuting accusations (increasingly common in the wake of Bush v. Gore, and Citizens United) that the court had become a partisan body strictly split along ideological and Republican-Democrat lines.
Back in March when Solicitor General Donald Verrilli delivered oral arguments for upholding the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Toobin had gone on CNN and characterized his performance as a ''train wreck'' for the Obama administration. A Reuters news report said his ''assessment shaped early odds making of how the court would rule in a few months,'' and on the day the decision was handed down, it momentarily sounded as if Mr. Toobin's prediction had come to pass.
Racing to break the news first, CNN and Fox initially made the incorrect call that the individual mandate (the requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty) had been struck down by the court; minutes later, however, it became clear that while the court had rejected an expansive view of the Constitution's commerce clause (which the administration had argued gave Congress the power to make people buy health insurance), it had in fact upheld the health care law on grounds that the individual mandate fell under Congress's broad power to levy taxes.
Mr. Toobin's narrative in this volume concerning the court's deliberations on the Affordable Care Act -- and how Mr. Roberts apparently moved from an alliance with the conservatives to strike down the heart of the law, to his decision to uphold most of it -- is dramatic and absorbing. But it is also highly indebted to the work of other reporters like Jan Crawford of CBS News and Paul Campos of Salon. It is Mr. Toobin's opinion that even in voting with the majority on the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice Roberts ''laid down a marker on the scope of the commerce clause'' that may augur a ''return to the pre-1937 days when the Court invalidated economic regulations with regularity.'' And so what might have initially seemed like a loss for the conservative movement may well turn out to be ''a significant long-term gain.''

HEADLINE: Heated In Florida

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
So that's it? The last of the presidential debates? No, no, no. I'm already in mourning, can't quiet my hankering for more and am not being remotely sarcastic. In a political culture as stage-managed, focus-grouped and airbrushed as ours, these debates gave us rare moments of rawness, not to mention Big Bird.
Monday night's face-off in Boca Raton was no exception. Any worry that the designated focus on foreign policy would tilt this encounter in a cerebral rather than visceral direction was dispelled almost instantly. Within minutes the candidates were sharply talking over each other, and President Obama, banishing his debacle in Denver once and for all, issued a denunciation of Mitt Romney more sweeping than any from the previous two presidential debates. 
Turning to his rival, he said, ''You seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.''
Romney smiled a brittle smile: ''Attacking me is not an agenda.'' It was as good an answer as any, but he had an odd color and odder sheen, that of a man without Dramamine on a rickety boat in threatening seas.
Obama repeatedly reminded television viewers that he alone was familiar with the responsibilities of the commander in chief. He clearly wanted Romney's experience as a mere governor to sound, in comparison, like a job running a curbside lemonade stand.
And though Romney perspired and occasionally stammered, he wouldn't surrender. He insisted that Al Qaeda wasn't really ''on the run.'' He claimed -- yet again -- that Obama had begun his presidency with ''an apology tour,'' and faulted him for skipping Israel. It was a barb tailor-made for Florida's many Jewish voters.
Foreign policy is not at the top of voters' concerns, so both candidates demonstrated a comic eagerness to build an oratorical bridge from Tripoli to Toledo, Ohio, the debate becoming a contest of how frequently each candidate could beat a path from northern Africa and the Middle East back home.
Thus they sparred over education, food stamps, Obama's unbalanced budgets, Romney's unspecific tax plan and even Solyndra. We weren't in Libya anymore.
In aggregate these presidential debates gave us sublime drama, the first one scrambling the race's momentum, the second one flavored with enough disdain to fill a ''Real Housewives'' season, and Monday night's reprising that ill will without quite replicating it. Romney wasn't as truculent as he'd been, ceding the part of bully to Obama, who took it on too arrogantly at times.
His mantra of ''not true,'' ''not true'' from the prior debate was replaced by ''all over the map,'' ''all over the map,'' a dismissal of Romney's positions as undependable.
These debates did in fact give us truth. I don't mean that the candidates themselves spoke honestly. Hardly. In fact we should pause to note how sad it is that we've come to regard a post-debate fact-check -- a report card on who told the most and biggest whoppers -- as an inevitable and unremarkable part of the process. In campaigns these days, dishonesty is both an art form and a given.
But the debates revealed each candidate for who he really is: the good, the bad and the binders. Although the two men armed themselves with practiced soliloquies and prefabricated expressions, there was something about the physical proximity of an opponent that scrubbed off even the thickest varnish.
We saw Obama's aloofness and distaste for the more superficial aspects of politics. But we also saw his impressive resilience.
The debates enabled Romney, at long last, to show Americans his persuasiveness. But he also exhibited his prickliness -- ''Candy! Candy!'' -- when he doesn't get his way.
I not only reveled in all of this but also returned to it, fishing out transcripts and rereading bits, like Obama's let's-measure-our-pensions put-down. On YouTube I revisited the laugh factory that was Joe Biden, who went through all the existing facial expressions for disbelief and derision and then went on to invent another dozen.
And in my head I replayed my favorite post-debate analyses: Al Gore's wondering if the altitude in Denver had incapacitated Obama; one Republican strategist's description of that Obama performance and Biden's subsequent mania as a ''sleepy cop/crystal meth cop'' routine. The debates were the mothers of some highly inventive wordplay.
They were also a study in moderation, by which I refer to the disparate styles of Jim & Martha & Candy & Bob. I'm considering a come-as-your-favorite-moderator Halloween party, and while I thought Bob Schieffer did well Monday night, I'm leaning toward a Candy costume myself, in tribute to her moxie. Debate overlords intended to muffle the moderator's role in the town-hall format, and asked her to impersonate a potted plant.
So she did: a Venus flytrap. That's horticulture you can believe in.

HEADLINE: An Unseen Force Looms Large Over the Race

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
He does not speak on the stump or appear in television ads. Campaign audiences rarely hear his name.
But aside from President Obama and Mitt Romney, no one has shaped the 2012 election more than George W. Bush -- on the economy and on the foreign policy issues in the spotlight during the final presidential debate on Monday.
For Mr. Romney, the battered reputation of Mr. Bush represents a burden to minimize in a tight race for the White House. The two have not appeared together this year.
When an audience member asked about Mr. Bush in the debate last week, Mr. Romney separated himself from what he characterized as Mr. Bush's shortcomings on the budget deficit and on trade with China. 
For Mr. Obama, Mr. Bush's economic record offers a shield against voters' wrath over high unemployment and slow growth; majorities in polls describe the nation's economic woes as something the incumbent inherited rather than caused.
Mr. Obama benefits, too, from Americans' weariness with the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Mr. Bush initiated. By winding them down -- and by succeeding where Mr. Bush failed in hunting down Osama bin Laden -- Mr. Obama has lately won higher marks from voters on foreign policy than on his job performance over all.
Both the president and Mr. Romney tried to use Mr. Bush to their advantage in Monday night's debate. Mr. Obama said his opponent had ''praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who shows great wisdom and judgment.'' But it was their strategies, the president suggested, that ''got us into this mess.''
Mr. Romney, referring to the government's bailout of the auto industry, said Mr. Bush ''wrote the first checks.'' Mr. Romney said he disagreed with that and would have preferred a ''managed bankruptcy'' instead.
The whole situation has become an awkward one for Bush loyalists active in the Republican campaign this year, one they like to avoid.
''I have no interest in participating in this silly exercise,'' Karl Rove, a former Bush strategist who now leads Republican ''super PAC'' efforts to aid Mr. Romney, said in declining to be interviewed about Mr. Bush's influence on this election. He left it to Democrats to assess his former boss's impact, and they were more willing to speak.
''There's no question that George Bush tarnished the Republican brand nationally on both national security and the economy,'' said Mark Mellman, a pollster for many Democratic candidates, including John Kerry, Mr. Bush's opponent in 2004. ''Republicans are living with that problem.''
Less than four years after Mr. Bush left the White House, the problem is at once pervasive and inconspicuous -- as the former president has been since he left the White House. As he put it in a rare interview this summer, ''I crawled out of the swamp'' of Washington.
''He hardly ever comes up in focus groups,'' said a top campaign adviser for Mr. Bush who asked not to be named. When voters think about the Republican Party's identity today, they are more likely to point toward the Tea Party movement.
But because of Mr. Bush, the adviser added, voters give Mr. Obama ''a great deal of slack'' in assigning responsibility for the weak economy.
Democratic strategists echo the point.
''I just don't see how Obama could have survived these economic conditions without that history,'' said Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster and a former adviser to Bill Clinton.
Mr. Obama casts Mr. Romney's policies as like Mr. Bush's but as even further to the right, on taxes, regulation and a predilection for military confrontation with other countries. He generally does not mention Mr. Bush's name, to avoid the appearance of trying too hard to pass blame to his predecessor.
''The issue isn't to relitigate the Bush years,'' said David Axelrod, the president's political strategist. ''It's to make the case that we shouldn't relive them.''
Mr. Romney has the tricky task of trying to mobilize the same conservative Republicans who backed Mr. Bush while casting his policies as a departure. With Democrats charging that his economic plan is like Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 ''on steroids,'' Mr. Romney says his tax proposal is ''not like anything that's been tried before,'' because it couples rate reductions with the elimination of some deductions.
''President Bush and I are different people, and these are different times,'' Mr. Romney said in the debate last week. On trade, he said: ''I'll crack down on China. President Bush didn't.'' On the deficit, he said: ''I'm going to get us to a balanced budget. President Bush didn't.''
Separating himself from unpopular aspects of Mr. Bush's interventionist national security posture can prove complicated for Mr. Romney, who lacks foreign policy experience. Advised by some Bush administration veterans, Mr. Romney uses muscular language while depicting Mr. Obama as weak in projecting America's leadership.
Yet he embraces Mr. Obama's plan to end the war in Afghanistan by removing troops in 2014.
For now, at least, that stance reflects the Bush administration's legacy on American opinion.
''Whoever's elected is going to have to live with the reality of what you might call intervention fatigue,'' said Richard N. Haass, a State Department aide under Mr. Bush who now serves as the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''There's a real sense that our military interventions have not produced results that are in any way commensurate with their human and economic costs.''
Mr. Bush's former aides chafe at criticism of his record from fellow Republicans, as well as from Democrats. Tony Fratto, a spokesman in the Bush White House and the Treasury Department, rebutted both of Mr. Romney's barbs from the debate last week.
''There are good reasons why we didn't balance the budget,'' like the fight against terrorism, Mr. Fratto said. On trade, ''we were very effective with the Chinese'' in paving the way for a rise in the value of its currency, to the benefit of American businesses.
But like his former boss, who has offered only a cursory endorsement of Mr. Romney, he prefers not to say too much.
''I take my lead from President Bush,'' said Mr. Fratto, who is now a partner in the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies. ''He's not interested in making it more difficult for the Republican nominee to get elected.
''We'll work with the historians,'' he added, ''and let candidates be candidates.''

HEADLINE: A Tight Rope on China's Currency

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At the presidential debate on Monday night, Mitt Romney, the Republicans' nominee, repeated his promise to brand China a currency manipulator and to rebalance the trade relationship between the two countries.
''I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency,'' Mr. Romney said.
But formally citing Beijing as a currency manipulator may backfire, economic and foreign-policy experts have said. In the worst case, it could set off a trade war, leading to falling American exports to China and more expensive Chinese imports. 
''The economic credibility of that action would be pretty thin,'' said Arvind Subramanian of the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington. ''Moreover, it would be blatantly provocative at a time when the new leadership was getting in place in China, and the new administration as well.''
Asked about the possibility of a trade war at his debate with President Obama, Mr. Romney said one was already under way. ''It's a silent one, and they're winning,'' he said. ''We can't just surrender and lose jobs.''
American officials largely, if tacitly, agree that China manipulates the value of its currency to aid its economy.
In its most recent installment of a twice-yearly report to Congress on the exchange and economic policies of the United States' major trading partners, the Treasury Department said that China has ''resisted very strong market pressures'' for currency appreciation and that its ''real effective exchange rate exhibited persistent and substantial undervaluation.''
But since 1994, the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations have declined to formally designate China as a currency manipulator for a number of economic and strategic reasons.
For the Obama administration, one reason is that China has made significant progress in allowing its currency to appreciate against the dollar of late -- making Chinese imports relatively more expensive and American exports relatively more competitive. A dollar currently buys about 6.25 renminbi, down from about 6.8 when Mr. Obama took office.
Administration officials have urged China to do more in frequent behind-the-scenes negotiations: to allow further currency appreciation, to protect American companies' intellectual property, to reform its financial system, to even the playing field for companies that might want to invest in China and many other issues.
The administration has also filed new trade cases against China at the World Trade Organization, and set up a trade task force to ensure all countries are playing by the rules.
They have also praised the country for the progress it has made. ''I think the cumulative effect of what China has done on the exchange rate side is, and the external side, is very significant and very promising,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said this year.
Congress has pushed a more aggressive approach, repeatedly putting forward bipartisan bills to punish countries, like China, that manipulate their currencies.
''The jig is up, it's time to stop gaming the system or face severe consequences,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement last year, co-sponsoring a bill that focused on Beijing. ''China's history of half-truths and broken promises on currency makes passing this legislation an economic imperative.''
Second, economic and foreign-policy experts argue that taking more aggressive actions against China might not result in a stronger American economy -- instead pitting the two countries against each other.
''In the worst case, a Romney decision to go to the brink with Beijing on the value of its currency would result in a mutually damaging trade war that slowed economic growth and increased unemployment in both countries and caused inflation and higher interest rates in the United States,'' Richard C. Bush III of the Brookings Institution wrote in a recent analysis.
Labeling China a currency manipulator would not automatically put in place tariffs, sanctions or other trade actions. But the measure would signal the United States' intention to take such measures -- and China might take countervailing ones in turn. Beijing might stop granting contracts to American companies, like General Electric or Boeing, for instance. It might issue levies or tariffs itself.
Antagonizing China would threaten the trade relationship with one of the United States' fastest-growing export markets, economists note. Chinese investment in the United States has also been increasing.
''Today China is a minor U.S. employer compared to longtime foreign investors such as Germany or Japan, but the potential for Chinese investment-led job creation is tremendous,'' concluded a report released last month by the Rhodium Group, a research firm in New York. ''If investment from China remains on track, Chinese firms will employ 200,000 to 400,000 Americans by 2020,'' up from about 27,000 today.
More broadly, if the United States leveled sanctions or tariffs against China, other low-wage countries -- in many cases, countries that also engage in currency manipulation -- might fill its void, economists said.
''Smaller U.S. trade deficits with China, offset by larger bilateral deficits with other countries, cannot be expected to provide material job growth,'' concluded recent research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
On top of any economic concerns come pressing foreign-policy concerns. Designating China as a currency manipulator might cast a shadow on relations with the Asian power.
For months, Chinese officials have quietly telegraphed their displeasure at the idea that a new administration might brand them as a manipulator.
At the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings in Tokyo this month, Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, made a point of noting the country's progress -- the country's current account surplus has fallen to 2.1 percent of economic output from 10.1 percent in 2007, he said, for instance.
''This has been primarily driven by structural factors, including the substantial appreciation of the real exchange rate,'' Mr. Yi said. ''In the face of the uncertain global environment, the Chinese government will continue to take effective measures to maintain growth stability and accelerate the restructuring of the economy.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Bristle From Start Over Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- President Obama and Mitt Romney wrapped up a series of defining debates on Monday night with a bristling exchange over America's place in the world as each sought to portray the other as an unreliable commander in chief in a dangerous era.
Picking up where he left off in last week's debate, Mr. Obama went on offense from the start, lacerating his challenger for articulating a set of ''wrong and reckless'' policies that he called incoherent. While less aggressive, Mr. Romney pressed back, accusing the president of failing to assert American interests and values in the world to deal with a ''rising tide of chaos.''
''Governor, the problem is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map,'' Mr. Obama charged.
''I don't see our influence growing around the world,'' Mr. Romney countered. ''I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home.'' 
The debate here at Lynn University, moderated by Bob Schieffer of CBS News, was dedicated to foreign policy even though it veered occasionally into domestic issues, and it presented the last opportunity for the candidates to face each other before the Nov. 6 election. While international relations have often taken a back seat to the economy during the marathon campaign, whoever wins will inherit a world with increasingly complicated challenges, from the turmoil in the Middle East to a resurgent Russia to an emerging China, and Monday's debate highlighted the vexing issues ahead.
For all its fireworks, the debate broke little new ground and underscored that the differences between the two men on foreign policy rest more on tone, style and their sense of leadership than on particular policies. Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney seemed to align on matters like withdrawal from Afghanistan, the perils of intervening in Syria and the use of drones to battle terrorists.
While they varied in degree, the heart of their clash rested on who would pursue the same national goals more effectively and ensure America's enduring economic and security role overseas.
Chopping the air with his hand, Mr. Obama came armed with a host of zingers. He accused his opponent, sitting at a table next to him, of ''trying to airbrush history'' and of seeking to ''do the same things we do but say them louder.'' At times, Mr. Obama lectured and even mocked Mr. Romney on the details of certain policies, hoping to expose him as an uninformed pretender at the risk of coming across as condescending. Mr. Romney at times sat stiffly, his hands before him, back ramrod straight.
At one point, when Mr. Romney complained that the Navy ''is smaller now than any time since 1917,'' Mr. Obama pounced and noted that the comparison works only if aircraft carriers are equated with gunboats. ''We also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed,'' the president said.
Slowing his words, he added sarcastically: ''We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go under water, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we are counting ships.''
The enmity between the men surfaced again and again, and the president seemed to have studied each attack line that Mr. Romney had used in the past, like his oft-repeated criticism of Mr. Obama's supposed ''apology tour'' of the world. ''You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators.''
Mr. Obama hit back fast. ''If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken,'' he said before pausing dramatically, in a reference to Mr. Romney's foreign trip this summer, when he was widely derided for insulting Britain's ability to host the Olympic Games and for holding fund-raisers in London and in Israel. ''When I was a candidate for office, the first trip I took was to visit our troops,'' he continued. ''And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors. I didn't attend fund-raisers.''
Mr. Romney pinned the cascading crises around the world on Mr. Obama's shoulders, saying the president had failed to live up to his promises from his 2008 campaign and left the country in a weaker position.
''Look at the record,'' Mr. Romney said. ''You look at the record of the last four years and say: Is Iran closer to a bomb? Yes. Is the Middle East in tumult? Yes. Is Al Qaeda on the run, on its heels? No. Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement? No.''
He sought to use the words of the Iranian leader, a hard-line Islamist who considers the United States the ''Great Satan,'' to bolster his argument that the United States has become weak. When the president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, ''says our debt makes us not a strong country, that's a frightening thing,'' Mr. Romney said.
The subject of Iran's nuclear program came up repeatedly. Mr. Obama appeared to contradict himself at one point. He labeled ''not true'' a report in The New York Times that the United States and Iran have agreed in principle to direct nuclear talks after the elections. But he later suggested that Mr. Romney had agreed as well: ''I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago, you said that's something you'd never do.''
Both men talked tough on Iran, at one point seeming to compete to show how much each is in the corner of Israel, which considers a nuclear Iran a threat to its existence.
''As long as I'm president of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon,'' Mr. Obama said. He said international sanctions had brought the Iranian economy to its knees. Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama had allowed ''daylight'' to show between the United States and Israel and vowed to tighten sanctions and seek a war crimes indictment against Mr. Ahmadinejad for inciting genocide against Israel.
But at the end of the night, for all the sound and fury on Iran, there was little substantive difference between the candidates. Both are in favor of strong international sanctions, and both said they would use military power if necessary to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.
The candidates arrived here as foreign policy, which had been a political asset for Mr. Obama, has become more of a liability for him lately, particularly after the attack that killed the American ambassador to Libya last month. Mr. Obama's 10-point advantage in July on who would be a better commander in chief has shrunk to a 3-point edge in the latest NBC-Wall Street Journal poll.
For all the attention to Libya at the second debate, the two men seemed to have exhausted the topic this time. There was no chatter over whether Mr. Obama had called it an act of terror, and Mr. Romney made only a couple of perfunctory references.
Instead, he tried to broaden his critique, praising the president's counterterrorism efforts but quickly pivoting to call for a more comprehensive strategy to diminish radicalism in the Middle East. ''I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in Al Qaeda,'' Mr. Romney said, ''but we can't kill our way out of this mess.''
Mr. Obama countered sharply. Facing Mr. Romney directly, he said, ''I have to tell you that your strategy previously has been one which has been all over the map,'' a phrase he would use three times during the debate.
''My strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys,'' Mr. Romney replied. ''But my strategy is broader than that.'' It is important to get the Muslim world to reject extremism, he added. ''We don't want another Iraq. We don't want another Afghanistan.''
The two men also clashed over Syria, China and Russia. Mr. Obama ridiculed Mr. Romney for saying Vladimir V. Putin's Russia was America's No. 1 one geopolitical foe. ''The 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,'' the president said.
Mr. Romney distinguished a ''geopolitical'' rival from a more pressing national security threat like Iran, but said he would not be nave about Moscow. ''I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin,'' he said. Mr. Romney said Mr. Putin would not see more ''flexibility'' after the election, as the president was overheard telling another Russian leader. ''After the election, he'll get more backbone.''

HEADLINE: Dwindling Demand

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
As China's economy cools, American exporters are increasingly feeling the chill.
Cummins, the big Indiana engine maker, lowered its revenue forecast earlier this month and said it would eliminate 1,000 to 1,500 jobs by the end of the year, citing weak demand from China as a major reason. Schnitzer Steel Industries, a Portland, Ore., company that is one of the nation's biggest metal recyclers, is cutting 300 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force, as scrap exports to China plunge. And on Monday, Caterpillar reported lower sales in China and cut its global outlook for 2012.
Job reductions are hitting industries like mining, heavy machinery and scrap metal that prospered as China boomed, illustrating some of the risks to the broader American economy if growth continues to slow in what is now the world's second-largest economy. Last week the Chinese government announced that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the slowest pace in more than three years.
Even as the presidential candidates try to outdo each other in promising to get tough on Chinese exports to protect American jobs, experts say the more immediate threat to American workers may actually be the slowing of sales to China, which has bid up the price of much of what the United States sent overseas in recent years. 
In fact, in the presidential debate on Monday evening, President Obama noted that exports to China had doubled during his term, even as both he and Mitt Romney again vowed to crack down on Chinese trade abuses.
Over all, China's growth is expected to decelerate to 7.7 percent this year from last year's breakneck 9.3 percent pace, adding to fears of a global slowdown, especially with much of Europe in recession and the economic recovery in the United States stubbornly anemic.
Already, softening demand has clipped American exports.
''There's definitely been an effect from slowing exports to China on U.S. exports,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. According to his analysis, the drop in exports to China alone is responsible for shaving 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point off the growth rate for the American economy, which expanded at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter.
The recent slowdown in export growth has probably contributed to the loss of 38,000 jobs in the American manufacturing sector since July, while the overall job market has improved and unemployment has fallen. The decline has been striking because exports, along with manufacturing, have been relative bright spots since the recession's end.
Wall Street will be looking for further signals about Chinese demand Tuesday, as export-dependent giants like 3M and DuPont report results and discuss their business outlook. Earlier, Alcoa, the first such major company to report third-quarter earnings, slightly lowered its estimate for global growth in aluminum demand because of slowing sales in China for products like trucks, trailers and aluminum cans this month.
On Monday, Caterpillar became the latest company to confirm that after a long boom, business in China is down. ''I don't think there's any doubt that things got overheated in China,'' said Ed Rapp, Caterpillar's chief financial officer. ''Our long-term view is still positive but things have slowed considerably in China in 2012.''
The American outlook for growth and jobs will depend on many factors. A pickup in economic activity in Europe or the United States, for example, could help compensate for any weakness in China, the source of roughly 10 percent of the world's economic output in 2012. And the United States still brings in far more than it sends to China, importing nearly $4 in goods for every $1 it exports.
Nevertheless, the rapid growth rate there benefited many large American exporters and made China the third-largest buyer of American goods after Canada and Mexico. In 2011, China imported $103.9 billion in American products, or 7 percent of worldwide American exports.
What's more, Chinese demand growth has obviously been cooling. In the first half of 2012, exports to China rose 7 percent from the comparable period a year earlier, according to Commerce Department data, down from a 20 percent annual increase in 2011 and a 36 percent jump in 2010.
Five industries -- machinery, computers and electronics, chemicals, transportation equipment, and waste and scrap -- accounted for 62 percent of exports to China in August, according to Census Bureau data. But the impact is felt beyond those categories. That's because Chinese demand pumped up prices globally for commodities like coal, paper and many kinds of metal.
For example, Thompson Creek Metals does not sell directly to China, but the company was forced to lay off more than 100 miners at its molybdenum mine in central Idaho earlier this month. Weaker demand from China for the specialty metal has helped drive down prices by 30 percent from where they were a year ago, crimping profit margins at the mine.
China is the world's leading consumer of molybdenum, which is used to strengthen steel and prevent corrosion, said Kevin Loughrey, Thompson Creek's chief executive. ''China has fueled a lot of the growth in demand for natural resources over the last several years,'' he said. ''And it's a fungible market. It's like a balloon that you push in one place and it comes out somewhere else.''
For Cummins, the impact is more direct. China is its fifth-largest market, accounting for 8 percent of the company's $18 billion in revenues last year. And sales there have fallen significantly, dropping 29 percent in the first half of the year from the same period in 2011, on sinking demand for excavators and trucks. The job cuts will trim about 3 percent of Cummins's global work force of 45,000 but it is not clear how many of those cuts will fall in the United States.
With $3.5 billion in revenues last year, Schnitzer Steel Industries is far smaller than Cummins, but it, too, considers China a key market. Scrap metal gathered in the junkyards of Schnitzer and other recyclers across the United States provides the raw material for stainless steel consumer goods made in China, as well as for the iron and steel bars undergirding construction there.
Now, with local construction stalling, and demand for its consumer products weakening in Europe, China needs far less scrap. Exports of steel and iron scrap -- among the top products exported to China from the United States -- are down 53 percent this year from the comparable period in 2011, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade group.
Prices are down roughly 30 percent as a result, said Joel Denbo, chief at Tennessee Valley Recycling in Decatur, Ala. Mr. Denbo's family founded the company 105 years ago, and he's struggling to avoid layoffs among his work force of 175. He has already let 15 contractors go and eliminated overtime in a bid to keep the company profitable. ''People are asking me, 'Boss, what do we do?' '' he said. ''We don't want to lose a single man or woman.''
Exports of recycled paper from the United States -- which comes back from Asia in the form of cardboard boxes -- are also off sharply, putting pressure on local recycling and waste pickup companies, as prices for their products slip.
''China is such a large market for paper, particularly in North America, that you can't hide from that,'' said Joe Fusco, vice president of Casella Waste Systems in Rutland, Vt., which serves rural New England, upstate New York and part of Pennsylvania.
In August, Casella announced it would eliminate several dozen jobs as part of a broader cost-cutting effort. ''You're constantly looking for pennies, hoping it adds up to millions,'' he said. ''It's a lot different when you get $50 a ton than $100 a ton.''

HEADLINE: Looking Closely at Statements From Candidates on Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE, MICHAEL COOPER, MICHAEL R. GORDON, RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and SHARON LaFRANIERE

 BODY:
Who knew that fact-checking the sole foreign policy debate of the presidential campaign would include the ranking of Massachusetts schools and how best to administer Medicaid? Repeatedly, the two candidates swerved to the economic issues that have dominated the campaign.
Even the dispute over the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which was expected to be a centerpiece, got less attention than the now-familiar dispute over what kind of bankruptcy Mitt Romney had proposed for the ailing auto industry.
But when Bob Schieffer, the moderator, wrestled them back onto foreign policy, the two candidates offered starkly different views of the world. President Obama described a tough, realistic America engaged with allies in ''decimating'' Al Qaeda. Mr. Romney, even as he markedly moderated his tone and spoke repeatedly of ''peace'' as his goal, described a far scarier world in which Iran is four years closer to a nuclear weapon.
In many cases, the contrasting claims were a matter of perspective, and on several occasions Mr. Romney said explicitly that he agreed with the president. But both men also made statements that were misleading or exaggerated or that contradicted previous statements. 
Here are some of the highlights:
Change in Tone on Iran
Mr. Romney's remark that he wants to use ''peaceful and diplomatic means'' to persuade Iran not to pursue its nuclear program was a striking departure from the more hawkish tone he has used throughout the campaign.
He urged preparations for war against Iran last year in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal. ''Si vis pacem, para bellum,'' he wrote. ''That is a Latin phrase, but the ayatollahs will have no trouble understanding its meaning from a Romney administration: If you want peace, prepare for war.''
Mr. Romney also called for more muscle-flexing aimed at Iran in a speech on Oct. 8 at the Virginia Military Institute.
''For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions -- not just words -- that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated,'' he said.
Mr. Romney has long been dismissive of Mr. Obama's attempts to use diplomacy to persuade Iran to abandon its weapons programs. ''In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran,'' Mr. Romney said in his speech at the Republican National Convention in late August. ''We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.''
Last year, when asked in an interview what military action he would consider against Iran, Mr. Romney said, ''There's a lot more information I need to have to know what type of military strike would be appropriate and effective.''
''Would you be prepared to do it unilaterally if need be?'' Bret Baier of Fox News asked.
''Of course,'' Mr. Romney said. MICHAEL COOPER
Troops in Iraq
Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Romney was mistaken in seeking to keep 10,000 American troops in Iraq. But the Obama administration initially sought to do just that -- but never managed to negotiate an agreement allowing them to remain.
Mr. Obama sought to negotiate a Status of Forces Agreement that would have allowed United States troops to stay in Iraq after 2011. Initially, the Obama administration was prepared to keep up to 10,000 troops in Iraq. Later, the Obama administration lowered the number to about 5,000.
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki indicated that he might be willing. But the Iraqis did not agree to an American demand that such an agreement be submitted to their Parliament for approval, a step the Obama administration insisted on to ensure that any American troops that stayed would be immune from prosecution under Iraqi law.
Mr. Obama relied on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well as American officials in Iraq to negotiate the agreement. The president spoke to Mr. Maliki only twice during the negotiations. Also, the administration did not begin formal talks with the Iraqis until June 2, 2011, leaving little time for negotiation.
After the talks broke down, the Obama administration withdrew the remaining American troops in December 2011, the deadline set for withdrawing all American forces from Iraq under the Status of Forces Agreement.
Iran has taken advantage of the absence of American forces to fly hundreds of tons of military equipment through Iraqi airspace to Syria. MICHAEL R. GORDON
The Arab Spring
Mr. Obama spoke of the role the United States has played during the Arab Spring uprisings, saying, ''We have stood on the side of democracy.'' But that is not true across the board.
Consider Bahrain, where thousands of people rose up more than a year ago to demand political liberties, social equality and an end to corruption. Its Sunni monarchy, seen by the United States and Saudi Arabia as a strategic ally and a bulwark against Iran, was never left to face the rage on its own.

Afghan Withdrawal
Has Mr. Romney changed his view on an Afghan withdrawal and timeline? About an hour into the debate, Mr. Romney seemed to adjust his long-held position.
In the past, he has said that while he wanted to follow the same 2014 withdrawal timeline as the Obama administration and NATO allies, he would seek the advice of military commanders on the ground before making a decision. This prompted critics to suggest that Mr. Romney was giving himself wiggle room to keep regular combat brigades in Afghanistan past 2014. (Both the Obama administration and the Romney campaign have talked about keeping a small residual force, presumably of Special Operations forces and military trainers, after 2014 -- if the government of Afghanistan allows it.)
But on Monday night, Mr. Romney seemed to draw a much clearer line that he would take all regular combat troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, without the caveat of first asking military commanders whether they believed that was a good idea.
In response to a question about whether he would withdraw troops even if it were obvious that the Afghans were not able to handle their own security, Mr. Romney said, ''We're going to be finished by 2014, and when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.''
He made no mention of first getting input from military commanders, as he has in the past. ''We're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014, so our troops will come home at that point,'' Mr. Romney said. RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
'Apology Tour'
Mr. Obama responded to Mr. Romney's claim that he had undertaken a foreign ''apology tour'' as ''probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.''
Fact-checkers have repeatedly found the claim to be inaccurate. Mr. Obama has admitted American failings at times -- and like President George W. Bush has apologized for specific acts of American wrongdoing abroad -- but he has never explicitly apologized for American values or principles.
Republicans often refer to Mr. Obama's 2009 speech in France in which he said that ''there have been times where America has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive.''
But critics typically ignore what Mr. Obama said next: ''But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious. Instead of recognizing the good that America so often does in the world, there have been times where Europeans choose to blame America for much of what's bad.''
In other words, Mr. Obama was saying that the United States and Europe had at times each dealt unfairly with each other; he never said he was sorry for American values or diplomacy.
RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
China and Cheap Tires
President Obama said that China was flooding the United States with cheap tires and that he put a stop to it and saved jobs. In fact, many economists criticize the administration's action.
In 2009, the Obama administration unilaterally imposed a duty on imports of Chinese tires, a move sought by the United Steelworkers union. It was one of nine trade enforcement actions taken by the United States against China under Mr. Obama and, some economists argue, the most questionable. The tariff protected 1,200 American jobs at most, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
But the same study found that the tariff cost American consumers $1.1 billion last year alone in higher-priced tires, or about $900,000 per job. Moreover, China responded by slapping tariffs on imports of chicken parts that cost American poultry producers an estimated $1 billion in lost sales. Last month, the Obama administration let the tire tariff quietly expire. SHARON LaFRANIERE

HEADLINE: On Fed's Horizon, Nov. 6 Looms Large

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The next significant event for monetary policy is not the Federal Reserve's meeting Tuesday and Wednesday, which is likely to pass quietly, but the presidential election two weeks later.
Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, has said that he opposes the Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy as ineffective and inflationary. And as president, he has promised to appoint a new Fed chairman.
The term of the current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, runs through early 2014. But the impact could be immediate as investors revise their assumptions about the future. 
''I certainly would expect the markets to respond, that they will take this as the Fed being more hawkish and that will be reflected in rates,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, senior adviser at Macroeconomic Advisers and a former Fed governor.
Such a reversal would be welcomed by critics who argue that the Fed's efforts are undermining economic stability, and mourned by supporters who say more must be done to revive economic growth. But Mr. Meyer and others cautioned that the impact would not be fully felt until it becomes clear whom Mr. Romney intends to nominate as a successor to Mr. Bernanke.
A range of experts regard two of Mr. Romney's economic advisers as the most likely candidates: R. Glenn Hubbard, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, and N. Gregory Mankiw, who followed Mr. Hubbard in that role. John B. Taylor, a Stanford University economics professor and outspoken critic of Fed policy, also is mentioned frequently.
The choice of Professor Taylor -- or a like-minded critic -- would represent a dramatic step to change the course of monetary policy. By contrast, Professor Mankiw, an economist at Harvard University, and Professor Hubbard, dean of the Columbia University business school, both are seen as centrists.
Professor Mankiw co-wrote a 2011 paper endorsing policies like those the Fed has pursued as the best way for government to enliven the economy. Professor Hubbard told Reuters TV in August that Mr. Bernanke is ''a model technocrat'' who should get ''every consideration'' for another term.
''If people really do think it would be Taylor, I would think that would interfere'' with the Fed's ability to influence markets, said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former Fed economist. ''But if it's not Taylor, I don't think it would have such a large effect.''
The Fed announced its latest stimulus campaign in September. The central bank said that it would purchase mortgage securities at a rate of $40 billion a month until it concluded that the outlook for the labor market had improved ''substantially.'' It also said it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until mid-2015, extending its previous forecast from late 2014.
The intervening weeks have seen glimmers of improvement in the unemployment rate and the housing market, but Fed officials have barely mentioned those data in recent speeches, focusing instead on explaining the new policy. As a result, analysts expect no changes when the Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, convenes here beginning Tuesday.
A more consequential meeting looms in early December, when the Fed must decide whether to keep buying long-term Treasury securities. An ongoing program of purchases, Operation Twist, is scheduled to run through the end of the year.
The combination of $45 billion a month in Treasuries and $40 billion a month in mortgage securities puts the Fed's current efforts on a scale comparable to its earlier rounds of asset purchases. A decision to stop buying Treasuries, by contrast, would amount to a significant slowing in the pace of its stimulus campaign.
There is little reason to think the outcome of the presidential election will affect that December decision, even if Mr. Romney is victorious. Mr. Bernanke will still be in charge, and the Fed is protective of its independence.
But a Romney victory could begin to change the way investors respond to the Fed's efforts. The central bank seeks to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by convincing investors that short-term interest rates will remain near zero. The more distant the horizon, the larger the economic impact. Conversely, as the horizon appears to move closer, the impact dwindles.
In an August interview with Fox News, Mr. Romney promised to replace Mr. Bernanke with ''someone who shared my economic views,'' citing in particular the importance of maintaining a strong dollar.
But it could prove difficult for a Romney nominee like Mr. Taylor to win confirmation if Democrats retain a majority in the Senate. If confirmed, the new chairman also could face internal resistance from Fed officials who favor stimulus even more strongly than Mr. Bernanke, including vice chairwoman Janet L. Yellen and William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Fed chairmen historically have enjoyed considerable deference from their boards, but Mr. Gagnon said a sharp transition ''could be very messy.''
If President Obama wins a second term, there is no legal obstacle to a third term for Mr. Bernanke. His predecessor, Alan Greenspan, served 18 years. And the Fed is likely to persist in its efforts even if Mr. Bernanke does step down.
The Obama administration has not commented on its plans for the leadership of the Fed in 2014. Mr. Bernanke avoided a question about the future at a September news conference. ''I am very focused on my work,'' he said, ''and I don't have any decision or any information to give you on my personal plans.''

HEADLINE: Farallon Capital's Founder To Step Down This Year

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
9:19 p.m. | Updated
Another one of the world's biggest hedge funds is preparing for life beyond its founder.
Farallon Capital Management announced on Monday that its senior managing member, Thomas F. Steyer, would leave the firm at the end of the year.
Mr. Steyer, who managed a $20 billion investment firm, is part of a group of hedge fund executives who have started firms from scratch and built large-scale global operations with billions of dollars under management. They now wield influence over Wall Street and the global economy. As they have grown older - and ever richer - they are passing the baton to successors. 
Mr. Steyer, 55, made clear that his separation would be final. He will have no official role or responsibilities at Farallon, and his partners will buy out his interest in the share of the hedge fund's profits.
"The announcement is the natural next step, is accepted internally and won't change our mode of operation," Mr. Steyer wrote in a letter to his investors. "The playbook won't change when I leave."
Andrew J. M. Spokes, who has been running Farallon alongside Mr. Steyer, will take the reins.
Because hedge fund firms are so often closely identified with a particular individual, transitions can be rocky. Last year, for instance, Shumway Capital Partners was forced to close after its founder, Chris Shumway, left, even though he had put the fund in the hands of a lieutenant.
But at other big funds, transitions have been smooth. Bruce Kovner of Caxton Associates left the firm last year in the hands of his chief investment officer, Andrew E. Law. And David E. Shaw of D. E. Shaw & Company has passed on management responsibilities to a committee of executives.
Still others, like George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, have decided to leave the business of managing other people's money, closing their funds to outside investors but remaining active in the sector by managing their own fortunes.
Though well known on Wall Street trading floors, Mr. Steyer has mostly operated outside the spotlight. His low profile has been by design and is largely a function of Farallon's being based in San Francisco, known more as a technology hub than a financial center.
Mr. Steyer, a New York City native, graduated from Yale University, where he played varsity soccer, and from Stanford Business School. He joined Goldman Sachs and trained under Robert E. Rubin on the bank's storied risk arbitrage desk alongside other future hedge fund billionaires like Edward S. Lampert and Daniel S. Och.
He started his own firm in 1986, receiving the initial backing from F. Warren Hellman, a co-founder of the San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, who died last year.
Farallon takes its name from a group of islands off the coast of San Francisco.
The fund, which at its peak in 2008 had $37 billion in assets before being buffeted by the financial crisis, has returned about 13.4 percent over its history. Farallon is up about 9.5 percent this year.
In recent years Mr. Steyer has taken on a more public role, becoming a force in California Democratic politics. In 2010, he helped defeat a ballot initiative to repeal California's global warming law, and this year he has donated more than $20 million to support a measure that would close a corporate-tax loophole in the state.
He has also been a major fund-raiser for President Obama.
He and his wife, Kat Taylor, founded One PacificCoast Bank, a community lender based in Oakland that provides capital for small businesses. Mr. Steyer spoke this summer at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., delivering a six-minute speech on energy policy.
Such moves have fueled speculation of a political career for Mr. Steyer, perhaps even a bid for governor of California.
"I want my life to revolve around service in one form or another," Mr. Steyer wrote in his letter on Monday, "including continuing participation in our community bank, in encouraging the advanced energy economy and in specific policy initiatives here in California."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Despite Push for Austerity, European Debt Has Soared

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and DAVID JOLLY; Landon Thomas Jr. reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris. Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens.

 BODY:
LONDON -- As Greece and its international lenders continue tense talks on reducing the Greek budget deficit, new data from the European Union on Monday underscored the potentially Sisyphean nature of such efforts.
Some of the countries that have made the most progress in closing their budget gaps -- Greece, in particular -- have also had their overall debt loads actually get bigger as a percentage of the economy, according to data released by Eurostat, the European Union's data agency.
A recent report from the International Monetary Fund, one of Greece's international creditors, reached a similar conclusion. That helps explain why the I.M.F. has started adopting a less austere stance toward debtor countries, even as countries like Germany continue to take a hard fiscal line, insisting that Athens stick to a program of lower spending and higher taxes.
Critics of the euro zone's austerity push have argued it is counterproductive. But the new data provide perhaps the starkest, most objective picture yet of the mounting burdens shouldered by countries that have accepted bailouts, like Greece, Ireland and Portugal, as well as Spain, which may soon need to accept its own strings-attached European aid. 
The economies of all four countries have contracted sharply under the austerity measures -- Greece's by one-fourth since 2009. But the size of the debts relative to economic output has soared. That raises serious questions about their ability to repay those obligations over time.
''If you want to make its debt burden sustainable, there will have to be some kind of debt forgiveness and restructuring,'' Jrg Krmer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said of Greece.
For now, the Greek government apparently sees little choice but to continue working out a 13.5 billion euro ($17.6 billion) austerity package and changes to labor laws that its international creditors have demanded before releasing the next installment of bailout loans. Negotiations continued Monday in Athens with the creditors: the I.M.F., the European Central Bank and the European Commission.
The Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, told the economic affairs committee in Parliament on Monday that the new austerity package must be approved quickly so that Greece can secure crucial rescue funding. ''The cost of us not getting the tranche would be huge,'' he said. ''People would go hungry.''
Many analysts and economists, though, say the most diligent deficit reduction programs would do little to bring down debt levels as long as economies are not growing and the interest rates that these countries pay on their debt remain high.
''The theory that these countries will grow out of their debt problem has a strong aspirational element to it,'' said Lee C. Buchheit, a senior sovereign debt lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in New York. He worked on debt reduction deals from Latin America in the 1990s and was involved in the revamping of Greece's debt this year. ''There is not much doubt that this problem will require a more severe remedy,'' Mr. Buchheit said.
There have been varying causes for the debt spirals. Greece's ratio of debt to gross domestic product has hit a new high of 170 percent, and Portugal's has reached 120 percent. Both can blame high interest rates and deep recessions. But for Ireland, with a debt burden of 117 percent of G.D.P., and Spain, with a ratio of 90 percent, a big factor is heavy borrowing to bail out their failed banks.
The promise by the European Central Bank to buy troubled countries' bonds, if requested, has reduced some of the short-term borrowing costs of these countries. But they are still much higher than the interest rates paid by the most creditworthy euro zone nations, like Germany.
Debt experts like Mr. Buchheit, who recently published a paper on the subject, argue that debt relief is inevitable over the long term if these countries are to return to meaningful growth.
Even the I.M.F., which traditionally shuns debt write-offs, has said that for Greece -- whose debt mostly is held by other governments and the central bank -- some form of additional debt adjustment should be considered. Rich European countries have rejected the idea, fearing that to ask their taxpayers again to forgive some of Greece's debt could spell political doom.
It is a noteworthy philosophical shift for the I.M.F., according to long-term observers of the institution. And it suggests that the fund has learned from its experience in the late 1990s, when its austere budgetary demands backfired in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand, causing deep recessions in all three countries.
''The fund is responding to the German eat-your-peas argument that has become so powerful in Europe,'' said Paul Blustein, the author of ''The Chastening,'' a book on the fund's checkered experience during the Asian crisis that began in 1997.
''I think this is largely an exercise in intellectual honesty -- and it's a bit of a mea culpa, too,'' said Arvind Subramanian, a former research director at the I.M.F. who is now at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''But the more interesting question is, so what? Will this really make a difference in Spain and Greece?''
Martine Guerguil is the assistant director of the I.M.F.'s fiscal policy and surveillance division, where it is her job to keep track of the progress that countries are making in reducing their debt.
''You will need fiscal consolidation for quite some time to bring these debt ratios down,'' she said, speaking last week at a briefing session held at Chatham House, a research organization in London.
The Greek recession is in its fifth year. Since 2007, the Portuguese economy has shrunk every year except for 2010, with 2013 expected to be another down year. And Spain has now entered a low-growth cycle.
Given this outlook, Ms. Guerguil does not expect debt ratios in these countries to stabilize until sometime between 2014 and 2016.
A companion study to the I.M.F.'s recent report provided a cautionary case study: what happened in Britain from 1918 to 1933, when the country put in place spending cuts and tax increases as it grappled with debts it took on during World War I.
The result was 15 years in which the economy shrank an average 0.2 percent a year. Unemployment soared. And the British debt burden grew from 140 percent of G.D.P. in 1918 to 190 percent a decade and a half later.
Only in cutting the deficit was the policy a success: during this period Britain's budget surplus, excluding debt from interest payments, averaged 8.2 percent of G.D.P.
But, asked David Lloyd George, who was prime minister from 1916 to 1922, at what cost? He lamented later that the British economy had been ''sacrificed in large measure to the maintenance of integrity and good faith to all her creditors at home and abroad.''
The people of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland might feel now much as Mr. George did back then.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Suffers as China Ties Deteriorate

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japanese exports tumbled 10.3 percent in the year to September, data showed Monday, the sharpest decline since the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the Bank of Japan cut its outlook for the country's regional economies amid a dispute with China and weak global demand.
Manufacturers' sentiment in October hit its gloomiest point since early 2010, separate data showed, reinforcing concerns that Japan may slide back into recession as sales to China and Europe sag and rebuilding from the 2011 disasters loses momentum. 
The drop in exports was more than the 9.6 percent annual decline anticipated by economists. Exports have been down for four months in a row as shipments of cars, ships and electronics slumped, according to Finance Ministry data released Monday.
It matched the dip registered in May 2011 and marked the sharpest drop since that April, after the natural disasters devastated Japan's northeast.
Ties between China and Japan have deteriorated sharply since last month, when a disagreement over ownership of several islands led to violent anti-Japan protests across China and hurt trade as some Chinese consumers shunned Japanese cars and other products.
The weak figures piled pressure on the Bank of Japan to stimulate the economy, and it will probably cut its economic forecasts and consider easing monetary policy further at its meeting next Tuesday, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to speak to the news media.
''Exports will likely fall even further, and the trade deficit will grow in October as the impact from the boycotting of Japanese products will play out more clearly,'' said Naoki Iizuka, an economist at Citigroup Global Markets Japan in Tokyo, adding that the central bank would probably cut its estimate of export performance. ''The slowdown in exports to China will likely hit sectors such as automobiles, electronics and general machinery harder in the coming months, and that could further dampen Japanese firms' capital spending.''
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told his cabinet last week to prepare a fresh stimulus package by next month, but the plan's limited scope and lack of detail failed to impress markets.
Exports to China, which overtook the United States as Japan's top market in 2009, fell 14.1 percent in September from the same period a year earlier, the biggest decline since January. Shipments to the European Union fell 21.1 percent.
Japanese carmakers reported tumbling sales in China for September -- with Toyota Motor's slipping almost half -- confirming the effects of the territorial dispute.
The central bank cut its economic assessment for eight of nine regions in Japan, it said in a quarterly report, as growth paused because of the slowdown overseas.
That was the largest number of downgraded regions since January 2009, when the central bank cut its assessment for all nine regions for two straight quarters in the aftermath of the failure of Lehman Brothers.
''Global economic uncertainty remains high, and we must be vigilant to the effect of financial and currency moves on the economy and prices,'' the bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said in a speech at a quarterly meeting of the central bank's regional branch managers.
''The B.O.J. will continue to pursue easy monetary policy via steady purchases of assets,'' he added, referring to the Bank of Japan.
After loosening policy in September by bolstering its asset-buying program, the central bank has been under renewed pressure to do more at a policy review next week as a slowdown in China hits the export-reliant Japanese economy.
The Reuters Tankan, the manufacturers' sentiment index, derived by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic responses from optimistic ones, fell 12 points for October to minus 17, the lowest mark since January 2010.
Many companies cited anti-Japan sentiment in China as a factor. The manufacturing index is expected to improve only slightly, to minus 13, in January.

HEADLINE: As a Long Island Congressional Race Tightens, Its Pace Becomes More Harried

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
NESCONSET, N.Y. -- Randy Altschuler already had his Congressional ID in hand two years ago when he learned that a count of absentee ballots had erased his victory, sending his opponent to Congress with a mere 593-vote edge.
And so it is with added vim that Mr. Altschuler, a Republican businessman, has crisscrossed eastern Long Island in recent weeks, as he faces Representative Tim Bishop, the five-term Democrat, for a second time.
''I learned a lot of tactical things,'' Mr. Altschuler said, recalling his 2010 defeat in an interview here. ''Things like the absentee ballots -- he schooled us on it last time. There are a lot of things I didn't know that people do or can do, and we've just been much smarter about it.''
Analysts and pollsters suggest that the race is a tossup, and the two men are practically tripping over each other in a harried effort to visit diners, firehouses, nursing homes and other clusters of voters between Smithtown and Montauk. 
There are days when their paths cross twice or even three times at ''meet the candidates'' events across the district. And a flood of negative ads has fueled rancor on both sides.
The race is also one of several contentious Congressional contests in New York that could help decide control of the House next year. Republicans and sympathetic ''super PACs,'' including Crossroads GPS, of which Karl Rove was a founder, have showered Mr. Altschuler with attention and cash, so much so that Mr. Bishop has begun to describe himself as an underdog.
''We knew that we weren't going to win this race by outspending him,'' Mr. Bishop said in an interview. ''The way we're going to win this race is by outworking him and by having a greater, if you will, army of field volunteers and field staff.''
Of the pace of the campaign, he said: ''It's draining.''
While the First Congressional District may be known for the Hamptons, a playground for the well-to-do, it also has working-class areas and a significant population of Hispanic and other immigrants, some of them in the country illegally.
Manufacturing in Suffolk County has declined, leaving the area more dependent on public entities like Stony Brook University and the Brookhaven National Laboratory for jobs. In August, according to most recent figures available, unemployment in Suffolk County was 8.2 percent, up from 7.3 percent a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Both candidates are considered relatively moderate, and they have largely sparred over economic issues. Mr. Bishop has sought to link Mr. Altschuler to the fiscal policies of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential candidate. Mr. Altschuler has in turn accused Mr. Bishop and his Democratic allies of failing to come up with solutions to mend the hobbled economy.
The district does not have a strong bent toward either party, and Mr. Altschuler has tried to wield anger over gridlock in Washington as a weapon against Mr. Bishop, whom he often criticizes for voting almost exclusively with Democrats.
''There are no good guys right now in Washington,'' Mr. Altschuler said at a debate this month. ''You've got a problem with both parties. They've created the mess we've got right now. And that's why, frankly, I want to replace one of the people who's helped create that mess.''
Mr. Altschuler, 41, has also cast himself as a Washington outsider. He has spent most of his adult life in business, and he currently runs a company, CloudBlue, that recycles electronic equipment like computers and printers.
But Mr. Bishop has tried to make Mr. Altschuler's business background a liability. Mr. Altschuler once was an owner of OfficeTiger, a company that outsourced support service jobs for American corporations. Some of the jobs were moved to sites in the United States, though many moved abroad, mostly to India. The company was acquired by the printing company R. R. Donnelly in 2006.
Mr. Bishop's campaign, echoing one of the Obama campaign's attacks on Mitt Romney, has run advertisements accusing Mr. Altschuler of being an ''outsourcing pioneer.''
Interviews indicated that such criticism had a chance of resonating in Suffolk County.
Charles Giles, 26, who has been looking for work since graduating from college with a history degree last year, said Mr. Altschuler's outsourcing was the main reason he would be voting for Mr. Bishop, though he said he was not enthusiastic about either candidate.
''I feel like there's a difference between actively hurting the job market and just not helping,'' he said in an interview at a Starbucks in Nesconset.
Mr. Bishop, 62, a former provost at Southampton College, has tried to distance himself from Washington. He rarely invokes President Obama and has repeatedly criticized the House leadership, Republicans in particular, often noting that Congress has been in session for only eight days since August.
''We ought to be in Washington,'' he said in a recent debate. ''The fact that the leadership of the House of Representatives took us out of session when we could be there trying to help resolve these problems I think is deeply unfortunate.''
A poll published in mid-September by Siena College gave Mr. Bishop a 13-point lead over Mr. Altschuler, but most experts now say the race has narrowed significantly. Two Republican-leaning organizations released polls this month showing Mr. Altschuler ahead.
''This is likely to be a close election and a chance to pick up a seat,'' said Lawrence Levy, a political analyst at Hofstra University.
Mr. Bishop won more than 7,000 votes on the Independence Party line in 2010, but this year, the party has endorsed Mr. Altschuler.
The National Republican Congressional Committee and two super PACs affiliated with Republicans -- Prosperity First Inc. and Crossroads GPS -- have spent more than a million dollars in support of Mr. Altschuler.
One Crossroads GPS advertisement highlights Mr. Bishop's role in helping a local businessman, Eric Semler, obtain a fireworks permit for his son's bar mitzvah. Mr. Semler later gave the Bishop campaign a $5,000 donation; both he and Mr. Bishop have denied that a quid pro quo was involved.
Don Allen, 67, who has run an open-air produce market in the town of Yaphank for 32 years, said he was disturbed by the fireworks affair but was not too happy about Mr. Altschuler's connection with outsourcing, either.
''We need jobs -- we don't need them outsourced to India,'' he said. But he said, ''You've got a Congress that doesn't do a damn thing except fight.''
Standing amid pumpkins and gourds of myriad shapes and sizes, Mr. Allen proclaimed himself undecided and frustrated.
''I'm so fed up with politics,'' he said. ''I think a lot of people are just turned off.''

HEADLINE: Casting Dual Roles, At Treasury And the Fed

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
For the last couple of months, there has been a parlor game on Wall Street and in Washington about who will become the next Treasury secretary. After all, Timothy F. Geithner has made it clear he plans to be out of that office at the end of the year whether President Obama is re-elected or not.
But there is another wrinkle in the parlor game calculus: Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, is likely to need a successor, too. If Mitt Romney wins the presidency, he has already pledged he will replace Mr. Bernanke, whose term as chairman ends in January 2014, in just over 15 months. However, Mr. Bernanke has told close friends that even if Mr. Obama wins, he probably will not stand for re-election.
That would be a one-two punch, with two of the most important jobs in the nation up for grabs. And over the last couple of years, especially at the depth of the financial crisis, the relationship between the two people in those roles has been increasingly important. They are the equivalent of roles in a buddy movie. 
Lots of names are regularly bandied about for both positions. But they are not always thought about in tandem. So here is a field guide to handicapping the next Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman:
The top Democratic name that pops up when discussing the Treasury position is usually Erskine Bowles, the former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton who reinvented himself with his Simpson-Bowles bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. The business community, on both sides, appear to love the plan and say they love him.
About a year ago, when Mr. Geithner first told the president that he wanted to step down - before the president persuaded him to stick around for another year - Mr. Bowles was at, or near, the top of the list, according to people involved in the process. That may have changed, however: Mr. Bowles has privately criticized the president to business leaders as he has sought to gain support for his plan.
Some of that criticism has made its way back to the president, these people said, so it is unclear how strongly Mr. Obama would support him.
Another, perhaps more intriguing idea has made the rounds: Mr. Bowles as a Romney appointee. Several supporters of Mr. Romney have pitched him and his team on the idea. An appointment of Mr. Bowles under Mr. Romney would be a quick and clever way to show that he wants to reach across the aisle and find bipartisan ways to comprise.
Among the names on Wall Street that are thrown around, virtually none has a real shot, if for no other reason than, well, they work on Wall Street. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, once considered a contender, is off the list. He recently told Vanity Fair, "I intend to be here for many more years," adding, "and I will not run for office."
Laurence Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the asset management juggernaut, has been a big supporter of the president and has told friends he would love the job, but people close to the administration say it is unlikely he would get it, given his title and his firm's previous relationship as an adviser to the Treasury.
The same most likely can be said of Roger Altman, chairman of Evercore Partners and a former deputy Treasury secretary, who is well liked by the administration but may be unable to shed the "investment banker" baggage.
And then there is Kenneth Chenault, the chief executive of American Express. Consider him a dark horse candidate, but perhaps the only person connected to the world of finance who would have a shot. His name was put on a list last summer when Mr. Geithner was considering leaving, people briefed on the list said. Given his history - an African-American who made his way up the ranks at American Express starting in 1981 - he could be the perfect mix of finance background and market experience, but one step removed from Wall Street banker.
The chances of an executive from what people in Washington call a "real company" - as in, not a financial business - also do not appear good. The one name that is buzzed about most, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, is likely to be off the table after Facebook's problematic I.P.O.
Here's a wild card: Dan Doctoroff, chief executive of Bloomberg L.P. and a former deputy mayor of New York under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is hardly campaigning for the job, but his name was put on an internal list at the Treasury Department last summer, these people said, though it is unclear whether he would want the position.
So who is most likely to get the job under President Obama? Drum roll, please. Jacob Lew.
Huh? If you're a business person, you might be asking, Mr. Lew who? That is probably the biggest knock against him, which gives everyone else on the list a chance. Mr. Lew is Mr. Obama's chief of staff, which makes him very confirmable. A former lawyer and career technocrat, he does not have much of a business background - he was briefly chief operating officer of Citigroup's Alternative Investments unit, between the Clinton and Obama administrations - but the president is very comfortable with him, and that can go a long way.
Now, on to the role of Federal Reserve chairman under President Obama.
It is slim pickings. At the top of the list is Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under President Clinton and director of the National Economic Council for President Obama. He's a serious economist who knows his numbers and has a worldview that is similar to the president's. He would be expected to continue the loose money policy of Mr. Bernanke.
But one of the knocks against Mr. Summers is that he has a reputation for not playing well with others. He has had his own run-ins with the president. And if you consider the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman as a tag team, you would have to be confident that whomever you pick for Treasury secretary would get along well with Mr. Summers.
There are a couple of other names in the Democratic economist world, but virtually all of them would be long shots: Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. She would be the first woman to run the Federal Reserve and could provide some continuity. Alan Krueger, an economist who was briefly an assistant secretary of the Treasury for economic policy under President Obama, is less of a classic choice, but is considered highly by the president.
If you want to be really daring, let's add one more name to the list, perhaps the perfect candidate from the president's perspective: Mr. Geithner. He would have had a year to recover from his current position and may have tired of the speaking circuit. Given his former role as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the financial crisis, he would bring steadiness to the job with Mr. Bernanke's departure, and a level of comfort for the president.
Now, if Mr. Romney wins the presidency, the chessboard for possible appointments for Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman becomes a little more crowded.
Glenn Hubbard, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and is a top adviser to Mr. Romney, is often mentioned as a top candidate for the Federal Reserve job - and the Treasury secretary job. It is likely that he would get one of the two.
So the question is, who gets the other? If Mr. Hubbard takes the Treasury secretary job, the other candidates for Federal Reserve chairman are N. Gregory Mankiw, who also headed the Council of Economic Advisers, and John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist, though he is considered more of a long shot.
If Mr. Hubbard gets the Federal Reserve job, however, the Treasury role becomes wide open.
Robert B. Zoellick, former president of the World Bank, is said to be among the names in the hopper for the Treasury secretary job. (He was previously a managing director at Goldman Sachs, but his role at the World Bank may have cleansed him of his Wall Street association and Mr. Romney is less concerned about ties to finance given his own background.)
Also on the list is Rob Portman, the senator from Ohio, who has become very close to Mr. Romney and knows a spreadsheet: he was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Bush. Whether Mr. Romney would be willing to give up Mr. Portman's seat in the Senate is a question mark.
Finally, there is Mike Leavitt, the former governor of Utah, who is a close confidant and adviser to Mr. Romney. He is likely to get a big role in Mr. Romney's cabinet.
Oddly enough, given Wall Street's support for Mr. Romney, there are very few bankers or other business people on his short lists.
Whoever gets these two roles, let's hope this buddy movie isn't too much of a thriller.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Final Debate

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has nothing really coherent or substantive to say about domestic policy, but at least he can sound energetic and confident about it. On foreign policy, the subject of Monday night's final presidential debate, he had little coherent to say and often sounded completely lost. That's because he has no original ideas of substance on most world issues, including Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
During the debate, on issue after issue, Mr. Romney sounded as if he had read the boldfaced headings in a briefing book -- or a freshman global history textbook -- and had not gone much further than that. Twice during the first half-hour, he mentioned that Al Qaeda-affiliated groups were active in northern Mali. Was that in the morning's briefing book? 
At other times, he announced that he had a ''strategy'' for the Middle East, particularly Iran and Syria, and really for the whole world, but gave no clue what it would be -- much like his claim that he has a plan to create 12 million jobs and balance the budget while also cutting taxes, but will not say what it is. At his worst, Mr. Romney sounded like a beauty pageant contestant groping for an answer to the final question. ''We want a peaceful planet,'' he said. ''We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future and not be at war.''
He added that the United States ''didn't ask for'' the mantle of global leadership but was willing to wear it. We wondered what Ronald Reagan would have thought of that.
Mr. Romney's problem is that he does not actually have any real ideas on foreign policy beyond what President Obama has already done, or plans to do. He supports the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan -- and was quick to insist on Monday night that he would pull out by 2014. He thinks there should be economic sanctions on Iran, and he thinks the United States should be encouraging Syrian opposition forces that seem moderate. Mr. Romney said he would work with Saudi Arabia and Qatar on this, but those governments are funneling arms to the jihadist groups that he says he abhors.
The president kept up the attack at virtually every opportunity, showing no sign of the oddly disconnected Barack Obama who lost the first debate. When Mr. Romney called for spending more money on the military than the United States can afford or the military wants, Mr. Obama moved in: ''You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.'' Mr. Romney tried to revive the Republican claim that Mr. Obama conducted an ''apology tour'' at the start of his presidency, which Mr. Obama correctly called ''the biggest whopper'' of a campaign that has been filled with them. And he took a dig at Mr. Romney's recent world travels. ''When I went to Israel as a candidate,'' he said, ''I didn't take donors, I didn't attend fund-raisers.''
Mr. Romney tried to say that the president had ''wasted'' the last four years in trying to stop Iran's nuclear weapons program. But Mr. Obama said, ''We've been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided. Iran was resurgent. Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily.''
Mr. Romney tried to set himself apart from Mr. Obama on Iran, but ended up sounding particularly incoherent. At one point he said he would indict President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on genocide charges. He gave no clue how he would do that; like many of his comments, it was merely a sound bite.
Mr. Obama hit Mr. Romney hard on his ever-shifting positions on world affairs, including comments he made in 2008 disparaging the idea that killing Osama bin Laden should be a priority. ''You said we should ask Pakistan for permission,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten it.''
Mr. Romney's closing statement summed it all up. He said almost nothing about foreign policy. He moved back to his comfort zone: cheerfully delivered disinformation about domestic policy.

HEADLINE: The Promise of Renewable Energy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Brooks's Oct. 19 column, ''A Sad Green Story,'' unfairly brands clean technology subsidies as wasteful corporate welfare. He does not mention the numerous subsidies, in the form of research grants, sweetheart resource extraction contracts and costly foreign policy interventions, that have benefited fossil fuels for decades. The reluctance of both political parties to eliminate these subsidies puts clean technologies at a competitive disadvantage. 
We must recognize the importance of government subsidies in developing promising yet unproven carbon-reducing technologies, an area where the private sector historically underinvests. National climate change legislation would level the playing field between fossil fuels and new clean energy sources.
California's carbon cap-and-trade program can serve as a road map for developing aggressive, technology-neutral emission targets. By pioneering economywide carbon regulations, California is setting the foundation for a financially sustainable clean tech sector that will someday drive the California economy.
ADAM LANGTON Berkeley, Calif., Oct. 21, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks writes that the story of clean energy, including solar, is one of ''overreach, misjudgments and disappointment.'' Facts disprove these claims.
Today there is 12 times more solar installed in the United States than just five years ago. American solar jobs grew 10 times faster than the general economy last year. And growth will continue: McKinsey & Company projected that residential solar costs could decline another 67 percent to 83 percent by 2020.
Mr. Brooks states correctly that solar panel costs fell 75 percent in four years. This is not a ''disappointment'' but an indicator of success. The race to solar cost competitiveness benefits American consumers and the economy. Solar is a story of successful innovation, and no one should doubt America's ability to innovate.
The failure of a few companies should not be used as a blanket to cover up a thriving industry.
RANDY BISHOP LYNN JURICH DANNY KENNEDY Torrance, Calif., Oct. 22, 2012
Mr. Bishop is chief executive of Verengo Solar, Ms. Jurich is co-chief executive of SunRun, and Mr. Kennedy is president of Sungevity.
To the Editor:
David Brooks does indeed tell ''A Sad Green Story'' about the declining support he sees for alternative and renewable energy. But his blaming of former Vice President Al Gore is revealing: ''Gore mobilized liberals, but, once he became the global warming spokesman, no Republican could stand shoulder to shoulder with him and survive. Any slim chance of building a bipartisan national consensus was gone.''
If Mr. Gore's support for an issue is a justification for Republicans opposing it, Mr. Brooks has said more about the state of that party than any campaign ad ever could do.
MICHAEL GREEN Las Vegas, Oct. 19, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks calls our national investments in renewable energy technology ''a story of overreach, misjudgments and disappointment'' since some companies have failed and fossil fuels remain popular.
Of course we should learn from the failures. But every technological revolution, from the automobile to the Internet, has been full of stories of overreach, misjudgments and disappointment. That's how innovation happens.

HEADLINE: Federal Budget Limits Affect Scientific Conferences

BYLINE: By LAURA DATTARO

 BODY:
After General Services Administration workers were found splurging on hotels, food and catering for a regional conference near Las Vegas two years ago, the Obama administration imposed new guidelines that limit the amount of money that federal agencies can spend on such events. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the directive saved more than $600 million in the first two quarters of this fiscal year, compared with the same period in 2010.
But a number of science and technology organizations are now arguing that the federal belt-tightening is affecting the ability of the scientific community to share research and collaborate. 
The U.S. Public Policy Council of ACM, the Computing Research Association, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers have written to Congress and federal officials, asking for an exemption from the spending policy for ''recognized scientific, technical and educational meetings'' and ''meetings of national and international standards bodies.''
''Participation in scientific conferences is a critical opportunity for scientists and engineers to keep current in rapidly changing fields of science and technology,'' said the letter, dated Sept. 10 and sent to House and Senate leaders of both parties, as well as the federal Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. ''These conferences facilitate communication among scientists, engineers, practitioners and students. They provide an important venue for presenting cutting-edge research.''
Representatives from agencies like the Energy Department, NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Defense Department regularly attend conferences to exchange findings with private organizations. Participation in the events usually includes setting up booths where the federal researchers can demonstrate new technologies. Officials said the meetings emphasize collaboration, as well as education.
Last year, for instance, 564 people from the Energy Department attended the 2011 Supercomputing Conference to meet with private groups, speak and present new research. The department's 12 laboratories -- including Fermilab in Illinois, Brookhaven on Long Island, Los Alamos in New Mexico and Oak Ridge in Tennessee -- set up booths to exhibit their latest projects, allowing them to demonstrate their work in a hands-on setting that is vital to the scientific process, critics of the spending policy say.
But next month, when 11,000 hardware and software developers and vendors gather in Salt Lake City for the 2012 Supercomputing Conference, or SC12, none of the Energy Department's labs will have their own booths on the 125,000-square-foot exhibit floor, and there will be 172 fewer agency employees, organizers estimate, than in 2011.
The Energy Department is still sending nearly 400 employees to participate in the technical program, where scientists can discuss and present their research. But Vinton G. Cerf, president of the Association for Computing Machinery who has been described as one of the ''fathers of the Internet,'' said that is not enough.
''This is a problem not just for the computing research community, but for almost anyone who's involved in scientific work,'' Mr. Cerf said. ''The inability of the government researchers and program managers to participate in these conferences is actually very damaging.''
Mr. Cerf said he understood the government's interest in cutting costs, but thought the policy was ''a terrible penny-wise decision.''
''This is not a boondoggle,'' he said. ''This is hard work.''The government has also had a large presence at Siggraph, an annual international computer graphics and interactives conference, as well as smaller events that might feel the agencies' reduced presence even more keenly, Mr. Cerf said.
In October 2010, the General Services Administration spent $822,751 to prepare for and hold its Western region annual meeting. A review by the agency's inspector general concluded the spending was ''excessive, wasteful and in some cases impermissible.''
Obama administration officials issued a directive in September 2011 for a review of all conference attendance by all agencies to promote ''efficient spending.'' In May, Jeffrey D. Zients, acting director of the budget office, issued a memo calling for all agencies to decrease travel spending by 30 percent starting in the new federal fiscal year. It capped spending at a single conference at $100,000 for each agency, and said agencies could spend more than $500,000 on conferences only after review.
At SC12, a research booth costs $1,200 to $32,000, depending on size; individual registration ranges from $100 to $750, depending on an attendee's status (member, nonmember, student) and the date of registration. Agencies also pay for travel and accommodation for employees.
Moira Mack, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said the conference policy was meant to save taxpayers money. Officials estimated that the new rules would save nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013.
''As part of the president's Campaign to Cut Waste, we are aggressively managing travel and conference spending to ensure we are serving America's families as efficiently as possible without sacrificing vital missions,'' Ms. Mack said in a statement. ''At the same time as we root out the waste of taxpayer dollars, the Obama administration is continuing to deliver the critical services the American people depend on, including advancing research and maintaining our leadership in science and innovation.''
She said the agency had not received the letter from the scientific groups.
The Energy Department referred questions to Ms. Mack.
Besides limiting spending, the new policy has created confusion in federal agencies, critics say, because individuals do not know how many other agency employees are also attending, and have no idea whether the agency is close to its $100,000 spending limit.
Though the federal laboratories are not hosting booths on the SC12 exhibit floor, most are still expected to send representatives who will make technical presentations, said Ian MacConnell, a communications coordinator for SC12. Still, he said, the absence of Energy Department booths will reduce the opportunities to share information.
''So there will be a lot of 'aha' moments I think that are lost because they're not able to demonstrate their technologies,'' he said.
Thomas Schlagel, chief information officer at the Brookhaven lab on Long Island, said the conference would still provide a valuable experience. ''From year to year budgets come and go, and you do the best you can with the budget you're given,'' he said.
But Mr. Cerf said in an era of high unemployment and shifting markets, scientific collaboration was crucial, and limiting it with these kinds of policies ''can't be good for the United States.''

HEADLINE: Experian to Buy Rest of Brazilian Firm Serasa for $1.5 Billion

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The credit information company Experian has agreed to buy the remaining stake in the Brazilian credit data provider Serasa it does not already own. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Experian agreed on Tuesday to buy the remaining stake in the Brazilian credit data provider Serasa that it does not already own for $1.5 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, Experian, which provides credit checks for individuals and businesses, will buy a 29.6 percent stake in Serasa, taking its holding in the Brazilian company to almost 100 percent.
Experian will acquire the stake from a consortium of banks, including HSBC and Banco Santander.
In 2007, Experian bought 70 percent of Serasa, and is looking to benefit from consumers' fast-growing use of credit in Brazil.
As the financial crisis continues to weigh on developed markets in the United States and Europe, Experian is increasingly turning to emerging economies for growth.
"We see significant potential for future growth in Brazil," Experian's chief executive, Donald Robert, said in a statement. "We are delighted to have the opportunity to further invest in this exciting region."
Serasa has a roughly 60 percent market share in Brazil and reported a pretax profit of $312 million for the 12 months ended March 31, according to a company statement.
Experian said it would use existing cash reserves and bank loan facilities to finance the deal. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised Experian on the deal.

HEADLINE: My AdWords Debacle: A New Product

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: I had developed a new product, supported it with advertising, and now the calls were coming in. Success! Or so I thought. 

 BODY:
Although I didn't realize it at the time, the trouble I started to describe in Monday's post began at the end of 2011. That's when we got a call from a client for a low-cost, modular, folding table. This is a particular configuration of conference table that we weren't making at that time, mostly because the best solution to the problem involves using metal components that we cannot fabricate in my factory (which concentrates on woodworking.) But we had been getting a steady stream of calls for this type of table, and I decided that we should put some effort into developing our own version.
We found a manufacturer of table components, based in Michigan, who had a particular leg design that we could use with our own tops and base parts. This leg had a very nice folding mechanism. I ordered one to see whether it was as good in person as it seemed online, and we built a prototype. It worked well. We were even able to engineer a way to include power and data capabilities -- a tricky design problem, which is why most makers don't include them in folding tables. We showed the prototype to the client, closed the deal, and made the first batch. 
The manufacturing times were acceptable, so I put the new product up on our Web site, with pricing per table of $1,594. When I first posted the table, we had the price prominently displayed at the top of the page. If you read the body text, it was clear that we were talking about each table in what would most likely be a multiple table order, but a quick glance at the whole page, with the picture showing four tables, left the impression that you could get a set of four for under $2,000.
Now, there are lots of cheap tables that are in that price range, but we don't really cater to people with that small a budget. Given the costs of our design and selling process, I consider $5,000 a reasonable minimum order. Our average order is closer to $15,000. In my mind, I was happy to add a new product to our line that hit a low but acceptable price point (in the quantity that most people would need, four or more) and that would serve as a starting point on further developments of that type of table.
We had been making modular tables previously, but most of them were large and complicated. While we had a page of our sitedevoted to them, I was not targeting them specifically with their own keywords or ad group. I decided that, with my new economy model, I would take a fresh look at this. Using the Google Keyword Tool, I found that "modular tables" was a very high-traffic search string. Great! So I generated a new group of keywords around that concept, set them up with their own ad group and started driving traffic to our Modular Tables page. Greeting visitors at the top left of the page was our Folding Modular Table, with its low, low price of $1,594 (per table) prominently displayed. I did all of this on Jan. 5.
A few weeks later, I went back to see how the group was doing. Basic ad group maintenance requires checking how many e-mail inquiries we get, whether the click-through rates are comparable to the overall campaign, which keywords generate the most traffic, and whether the ads are being triggered by searches that are relevant. For instance, we have an ad group called "Big Table" that was aimed at people looking for really large tables but was also triggered by people searching for information on a particular type of barbecue called the Big Green Egg.
Apparently, the Big Green Egg is an awkward shape, and lots of people want a custom table to hold it. There is a lot of search traffic around this concept, and a significant number of people would click our ads. These clicks cost me money but do not result in any sales. Google's robots, however, see these clicks as perfectly successful, so they continued to serve our ads until I turned all Big Green Egg searches into negative keywords. Establishing effective negative keyword lists for each ad group can be done only after running them for a while and wasting a lot of money. Believe me, you can not predict the irrelevant search strings people will come up with.
After a month of running the Modular Table ad group, things were looking good. Not only were we seeing decent stats for the ads, we were also starting to get a significant number of calls about lower priced modular tables. Success! I had developed a new product, supported it with advertising, and now the calls were coming in. With a healthy inquiry pipeline, I turned my attention to our sales process.
Inquiries come to us in two forms: either via e-mail or as a phone call. In either case our response was the same. We have a list of 10 questions that allow us to make a recommendation for the client. The questions are designed to reveal the functional aspects of the problem -- that is, they concentrate on things like the desired size, the desired number of users, the size of the room. Functional stuff.
When we feel we have enough information, we prepare a proposal, a pdf document that contains images of the options we recommend and information on wood choices, power/data options and pricing. The proposal, I believe, is an impressive piece of work. I had come up with the format over years of interacting with clients and designed it so that it explained itself. My theory is that the document needs to be something that can be sent from person to person in an organization and understood regardless of whether I am there to explain it. I did it this way because many of our transactions are done through relatively low-level people who pass the information on to the decision makers. My other theory about selling was that this document needed to be produced quickly. We could turn one of these around in less than two hours if the job were simple and within 24 hours even if the job were complicated.
This system -- get a call, make a proposal, send it off and hope -- actually worked pretty well for many years. I created the basic format in 2007 and didn't change it even through the downturn or the recovery that we experienced in 2010. In 2011 we broke all of our previous sales records and made money to boot. As spring of 2012 approached, it looked as though we would repeat that success. Incoming inquiries were strong, and my two sales engineers were churning out proposals in response. The numbers looked fine, and I was confident that success was assured. But I was about to find out that a high level of sales activity doesn't necessarily guarantee results.

In a welcome break from fault-finding, here's my latest subjective sampling of sparkling prose from recent editions. Add your own favorites in the comments below.
Dining, 10/9:
Nibbled to Death
 A high-end anomaly a few years ago, three- or four-hour menus now look like the future of fine dining. Before corner delis begin parceling sandwiches into 18-course pastrami tastings, it's worth asking if this is the future we want. 
Just one of many sharp passages in Pete Wells's discussion of elaborate, high-end tasting menus.
Arts, 10/4:
Heathcliff and Cathy, With Lust and Mud
 Too often, great works of literature arrive on screen weighed down by their reputations, immobilized in a straitjacket of cultural prestige. Emily Bront's "Wuthering Heights" is a wild emanation of Victorian genius half-tamed by time and term papers, and Andrea Arnold's new film adaptation is an admirable, frustrating attempt to strip away the novel's inherited "classic" status and restore its raw and earthy passion. 
Not much of a challenge to find brilliant phrases in A.O. Scott's reviews; here's an irresistible observation on "Wuthering Heights," the novel.
Arts, 10/4:
In a State of Sweaty Agitation in Steamy Florida
 In the hands of Mr. Daniels - who directed "Precious Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire" and "Shadowboxer" - Mr. Dexter's complex tale pulsates with wayward desire and confused motivation. Not a few of the characters are driven to distraction by the swampy Florida heat and their own lust, and the movie itself seems to share their state of sweaty agitation. It is by turns lurid, humid, florid, languid and stupid, but it is pretty much all id all the time. 
And while I'm at it, here's another from A.O. Scott, in his review of "The Paperboy." Don't try this at home, though.
Sports, 10/4:
O'Neal Names Top Two Centers, and a Net Is One of Them
 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - There are only two types of centers in Shaquille O'Neal's world: those he respects and those he disdains. 
 In the first category: centers who play in the paint, score with post moves and look as manly as possible while doing it. 
 In the latter category: floppers, jump-shooters, Europeans and Dwight Howard. 
A nice line to punctuation this lead by Howard Beck.
Book Review, 10/1:
A New Breed of Hunter Shoots, Eats and Tells
 They no longer wish to have an anonymous hit man between themselves and supper. They want to thoughtfully stare their protein in the face, to take locavorism to blood-flecked new heights. 
One of many fine lines in Dwight Garner's look at a spate of books about hunters eager to meditate on the meaning of it all.
Politics, 9/28:
Before Debate, Tough Crowds at the Practice
 WASHINGTON - In a conference room at the Democratic headquarters, President Obama has been preparing for the debate next week, but the reviews of his staff are already in. Too long, they tell him. Cut that answer. Give crisper explanations. No one wants a professor; they want a president. 
 Hundreds of miles away in New England, Mitt Romney's team has been working to make sure he avoids coming off as a scold. His sparring partner, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, channeling Mr. Obama, has gone after him repeatedly, to the point of being nasty. The goal is to get Mr. Romney agitated and then teach him how to keep his composure, look presidential. 
With quick strokes and sharp details, Peter Baker and Ashley Parker brought readers into a story about presidential debate prep.
National, 9/27:
John Silber Dies at 86; Led Boston University
 A philosopher by training but a fighter by instinct, Dr. Silber believed in old-fashioned hard work and academic excellence. He arrived in Boston when protests against every value he cherished were sweeping campuses across the country. He waded in, and from 1971 to 1996 ruled B.U. with a tigerish ferocity that delighted admirers and enraged critics. There were plenty of both. 
A great summation by Robert D. McFadden, in his fascinating obit of John Silber.
Foreign, 9/27:
Not in Script for Kremlin: A Real Race for Governor
 RYAZAN, Russia - A funny thing happened during the elections this fall for governor in the Russian region of Ryazan: for a few weeks, no one knew who would win. 
The "funny thing" device can be overdone, but it was a clever and arresting way into this piece on Russian politics by Ellen Barry.
Business, 9/27:
United States Economy Still Weak, but More Feel Secure
 Both economists and the Romney campaign are puzzling over the same paradox: The recovery has flagged and yet the country's mood appears to be improving. 
A quick, accessible and engaging start to an interesting economic analysis by Annie Lowrey.
National, 10/13:
At the Corner of Hope and Worry
 A dozen years ago, Donna found a scrap of serendipity on the sidewalk: a notice that a local mom-and-pop restaurant was for sale. After cooking for her broken family as a child, after cooking for county inmates at one of her many jobs, she had come to see food as life's binding agent, and a diner as her calling. She maxed out her credit cards, cashed in her 401(k) and opened a business to call her own. 
 Donna's Diner. Donna's. 
 You know this place: It is Elyria's equivalent to that diner, that coffee shop, that McDonald's. From the vantage point of these booths and Formica countertops, the past improves with distance, the present keeps piling on, and a promising future is practically willed by the resilient patrons. 
Take your pick of memorable and poetic passages from any installment of Dan Barry's lovely portrait of Elyria, Ohio, and the diner on the corner.

This expression is illogical as well as colloquial. Make it "one of the few," or rephrase.
 Derek Jeter, the Yankees' captain and shortstop, dove to his left for a ground ball in the 12th inning of the first game of the American League Championship Series early Sunday morning against the Detroit Tigers.

 President Obama, above, addresses children's questions about gun control, jobs, illegal immigration, same-sex marriage, outsourcing, bullying and obesity in this election edition of "Nick News With Linda Ellerbee." The views of Mitt Romney, whom Nickelodeon executives said declined to participate in the show because of scheduling conflicts, are represented in video clips. 
Make it "who," the subject of "declined."
 By 3:15, the small platters of complementary desserts had been consumed.

 Follow along with this interactive replay of the vice-presidential debate, using fact checks and graphics to take a closer look at attacks and assertions by Mr. Biden and Mr. Ryan. 
Hyphenate this phrase: fact-check, fact-checking. Also, the plural variant here has a whiff of jargon and should be rephrased: "with fact-checking," perhaps.
 "Fashion people live to sound British, the same way they over-pronounce French and Italian words because of those country's fashion weeks," said Peter Davis, the American-born editor of Scene, a New York society magazine. 
Countries', not country's
 Despite never becoming the head coach at Cheshire, teachers and coaches recall that Pasqualoni changed the community's mind-set toward football, which became a rallying point for the town. 
Dangler. It is Pasqualoni, not "teachers and coaches," who never became the head coach at Cheshire.
 The hope is that by intervening early, the disease might be headed off. 
Another dangler. The disease isn't intervening, doctors are.
 WASHINGTON - The former chief security officer for the American Embassy in Libya on Wednesday told a House committee investigating the fatal attack last month on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi that his request to extend the deployment of an American military team were thwarted by the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. ... 
 The clashing perspectives of witnesses was echoed in the partisan sparring of lawmakers, with Republicans accusing the State Department of shortchanging security at the compound and Democrats countering that the vast majority of security requests from there had been met. 
Mirror-image mistakes. Make it "his request ... was thwarted" and "perspectives ... were echoed."
 The I.R.S. commissioner Douglas Shulman announced Wednesday that he will leave his post next month, ending a four-and-a-half year term during which he modernized some of the agency's infrastructure while cracking down on tax dodging by corporations and offshore tax evasion by individuals. 
The name should be set off with commas. (This is a "nonrestrictive" construction. Since there is only one I.R.S. commissioner, that phrase is fully specific; the name provides additional information but could be removed while leaving the sentence intact.)
 Unlike the Midwest, which concentrates (devastatingly) on corn and soybeans, more than 230 crops are grown in the valley, including those indigenous to South Asia, Southeast Asia and Mexico, some of which have no names in English.

HEADLINE: A World Series With a Venezuelan Accent

BYLINE: WILLIAM NEUMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Nine Venezuelan-born players will play in the World Series, five for the San Francisco Giants and four for the Detroit Tigers. 

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela - As Marco Scutaro stared into the falling rain and prepared to glove the pop-up that would be the last out of the National League Championship Series on Monday night, the television announcer here crowed, "It had to be a Venezuelan!"
When Scutaro was named the most valuable player of the N.L.C.S. a short time later, it was merely the latest milestone in what has been a banner year for Venezuelan-born ballplayers in the major leagues.
There are a total of nine Venezuelan-born players on the two teams in the World Series, the San Francisco Giants and the Detroit Tigers, which newspapers here said was a record number.
"It's going to be a very Venezuelan Series," said Francisco Suniaga, a novelist and Giants fan who lives in Caracas and who sometimes writes about baseball. He recalled the years of his childhood when Luis Aparicio, the White Sox shortstop, was his country's big star in the major leagues. "It was lucky if a Series would have one Venezuelan," he said. "Now there are nine."
Venezuelans make up the second largest group of foreign-born players in the big leagues, after players from the Dominican Republic, and this year some of the sport's biggest feats had a Venezuelan accent.
Miguel Cabrera, of the Tigers, became the first player in nearly half a century to win the triple crown, leading the American League in batting average, home runs and runs batted in.
Flix Hernndez became the first Venezuelan-born player to throw a perfect game, in August, for the Seattle Mariners.
Johan Santana became the first Mets pitcher and the fourth Venezuelan to throw a no-hitter.
And Omar Vizquel was a fixture in the sports pages here as he wound up his long career as one of the game's greatest shortstops.
Cabrera is joined on the Tigers by his fellow Venezuelans Anbal Snchez, Avisail Garca and Omar Infante. The Giants who come from Venezuela are Scutaro, Pablo Sandoval, Hctor Snchez, Jos Mijares and Gregor Blanco.
Two other Venezuelans were possible inclusions on the World Series rosters, one for each team.
This is a baseball-loving country and the sports pages here closely follow the Venezuelans playing in the major leagues, regularly printing their statistics and featuring their highlights.
Scutaro was on the cover of the country's two major sports dailies Tuesday, raising his M.V.P. trophy over his head in the rain. "Venezuela Becomes Giant," said the headline in Meridiano, the largest sports daily.
"I was saying on my radio show this morning that Venezuelan fans and journalists have to thank the gods for the great year our baseball players have had in the big leagues," said Humberto Acosta, who hosts a radio show and writes a newspaper column about baseball.
He said the success of Venezuelan ballplayers was not a matter of chance. "It's a product of the turn that the big-league organizations have made toward Latin America and Venezuela in particular, because this is a baseball country." 
Several major league teams have academies to develop young players in Venezuela, although the number of academies has been shrinking in recent years in response to the violence and unsettled economic climate in the country. 
Many major league players return here each fall to play in the Venezuelan league, whose season started this month. Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chvez, is an avid baseball fan, as is his mentor, Fidel Castro, the former president of Cuba.
Suniaga, the novelist, recalled listening to the World Series on the radio as a child. He remembered Willie Mays, the Giants star, coming to Venezuela to play in the Caribbean championship series in the late 1950s.
It felt like a very long time ago.

HEADLINE: Central Park Draws a Huge Gift From a Fan in High Finance

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Central Park has long been a favorite cause for the financial world. Now one of the most prominent names in high finance, John Paulson, has given New York City's largest park a record $100 million donation. 

 BODY:
Central Park has long been a favorite cause for the financial world. Now one of the most prominent names in high finance has given New York City's largest park a record gift.
John A. Paulson, the hedge fund magnate who reaped a windfall by betting against mortgages before the financial crisis, has given $100 million to the Central Park Conservancy, in what city officials say is the largest donation ever made to the group.
"This is a donation that will touch literally every acre of the city's park," Douglas Blonsky, chief executive of the conservancy and the Central Park administrator, said at a news conference on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Paulson's gift is certainly outsized: half of it will go toward the Central Park Conservancy's endowment, which currently stands at $144 million. But the billionaire investor, whose hedge fund has been having a rough time, is only one of many financiers to support the 843-acre park. 
A quick look at the Central Park Conservancy's board reveals over a dozen members who hail from the world of finance. They include not only Mr. Paulson but also:

        
Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
        
William B. Harrison Jr. , the former chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase
        
 Thomas L. Kempner, Jr., an executive managing member of Davidson Kempner Capital Management
        
 Michael A. Steinberg, the president of Steinberg Asset Management
        
 William M. Lewis Jr., a co-chairman of investment banking at Lazard
Central Park is a favorite haunt of another onetime power broker on Wall Street: Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Treasury secretary and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Virtually every profile of him mentions his affinity for bird-watching and his habit of getting up early to spot winged denizens of the park.
From The New Yorker last year:
It was a drizzly day, and Paulson showed up at the Boathouse wearing a baggy suit and carrying a London Fog rain jacket. In person, he seems less like the "Superman" villain Lex Luthor, whom his grandchildren thinks he resembles, or William Hurt, who played him in "Too Big to Fail," and more like a park ranger, full of jerky energy.
"My wife's jealous," Paulson said, of his walk in the Park. (His wife, Wendy, is a naturalist who led bird walks there when the couple lived nearby.) Spotting a logbook where visitors record bird sightings, he flipped through until he came to a good entry. "See, this is someone who knew what they were doing," he said and read off the species: "Everything from a house finch to a tufted titmouse and an Eastern towhee."
At the news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Blonsky described a long walk he took with John Paulson last fall through the park's North Woods. The hedge fund manager kept asking about the Cascades, the waterfall and staff efforts to improve the lands. 
"This was a guy who understands the park the way we do," Mr. Blonsky said.
For his part, Mr. Paulson said that after achieving what he modestly called "business success," he looked at various potential recipients for his largess.
What he decided upon was Central Park, where, as a New York City native, he hung out at Bethesda Terrace and roller skated around the grounds. The latter, he admitted, is something he's not quite as good at doing these days.
Speaking at the news conference, he said: "It kept coming back that Central Park, in my mind, is the most deserving of New York's cultural institutions."
New York's parks more generally have drawn attention from bankers and investors as well. The hedge fund manager Philip Falcone and his wife, Lisa, are well-known supporters of Manhattan's High Line.
And John A. Thain, chief executive of the CIT Group and a former head of Merrill Lynch, supported the restoration of a forest in the New York Botanical Garden last year. To repay that generosity, signs noting the "Thain Family Forest" were placed throughout the are, a fact that our colleague David W. Dunlap at City Room certainly noticed:
They turn up on prohibitory signs, too. "Please Stay on the Path: The Thain Family Forest is a fragile ecosystem."
Indeed, by the time you reach the sign beginning, "When a tree falls in the Thain Family Forest -," you may be tempted to finish the thought yourself, "- does it make a Thain Family Sound?"

HEADLINE: Using Crowdfunding to Start a Company With a Cause

BYLINE: MELINDA F. EMERSON


HIGHLIGHT: For Kara Gorski and Kristin Gembala, starting a company to manufacture bras for breast-cancer survivors was more than just business. 

 BODY:
Two sisters, Kara Gorski and Kristin Gembala, have developed a bra designed to help breast cancer survivors who have had mastectomies and reconstructive surgery. So far, the sisters, who invested $25,000 from their savings, have designed and patented two styles and built a Web site. Currently, they are trying to raise money to begin manufacturing through a new crowdfunding platform.
For Ms. Gorski, a Ph.D. in economics with two children who works for a consulting firm in the Washington area, and Ms. Gembala, a stay-at-home mother with four children, the business - known as braGGs -
is personal. Their mother died of breast cancer at age 39, when the sisters were just 7 and 12 years old. Twenty-eight years later, at age 35, Ms. Gorski discovered her own breast cancer. Soon, both sisters were found to carry the BRCA1 genetic mutation, which the National Institutes of Health says means an 87 percent chance of developing breast cancer and a 45 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer.
Both sisters elected to have surgery - Ms. Gembala prophylactically, since she had never been diagnosed with cancer. After hysterectomies and double mastectomies with reconstruction, the sisters expected to be able to wear regular bras. When they learned this was not possible, they set about designing and creating a reconstruction bra specifically for women like them. "So many women have told us about the serious problems with trying to find a functional and beautiful bra after such a difficult journey," Ms. Gorski said. 
Once they had prototypes, they needed capital to start manufacturing. They started out pitching themselves to Kickstarter for a crowdfunding campaign and were turned down. Determined not to give up, the sisters reached out to a niche crowdfunding site, MedStartr, that specializes in projects and start-ups that involve health care. It was started by Mike Pence, who helped develop Kickstarter, and Alex Fair, an entrepreneur and health care advocate.
Mr. Fair said MedStartr was trying to do crowdfunding differently. "Kickstarter and Indiegogo are self-service for great ideas looking for funding," he said. "Our customers need more help. They didn't go to business school or design school. They went to med school or graduate school. If they need marketing, we have P.R. people. If they need a video, we have video people. If they need help figuring out how their business model should work, we help them with that, too." For now, MedStartr takes 5 percent of what is raised and offers the mentoring and marketing support free of charge.
The site helped Ms. Gorski and Ms. Gembala with promotion and partnership aspects of their project. Mr. Fair took them to make a presentation at the Department of Health and Human Services and connected them with a breast cancer support group, TalkAboutHealth. Ms. Gorski and Ms. Gembala were also provided with assistance in drafting press releases and driving daily traffic to the site, which resulted in more than 7,000 people watching braGG's pitch video.
Before posting their pitch on MedStartr, Ms. Gorski and Ms. Gembala considered how much money they would need to begin manufacturing. "We struggled a lot actually in deciding how much to ask for, teetering between $5,000 and $10,000," Ms. Gorski said. "We did the math and knew financially we needed the $10,000 to get us through a first manufacturing round, so decided to go for it." Their goal was to raise $10,000 by Oct. 1, which they did, but MedStartr is allowing them to continue their campaign until the end of October because it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
For those interested in trying crowdfunding, Ms. Gorski and Ms. Gembala offered the following advice:
 Use social media: Get your audience involved and invested. Ms. Gorski explained how they got Facebook fans and Twitter followers involved: "BraGGs bras have hidden messages of inspiration inside to make women feel special and confident through their day - a little hug from us to them. When we were deciding on which messages to include, we put up four options on Facebook and Twitter and had everyone vote."
 Video is crucial: Explain what problem you are solving and how you will do it. Ms. Gorski said it is critical to explain how much you are asking for and how the money will be used.
 Tell a story: Being passionate about your story will make others passionate about it as well. "They will want to become invested in being a part of something great," Ms. Gorski said.

HEADLINE: Romney: Dreamer, or Warmonger?

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: At the foreign policy debate, he was both. 

 BODY:
Is Mitt Romney a neoconservative? Or an isolationist? Is he a hard-eyed realist? A democracy-spreading dreamer? Or a strutting warmonger? He has been all those things over the course of his campaign, and he followed a similar pattern at Monday night's debate.
His calculation, on purely political terms, seemed to be that it didn't matter. He was rather obviously treading water throughout the debate, though he avoided drowning. Knowing that foreign policy is not high on the list of swing-state concerns, he simply hoped to have a series of pleasant and gravity-free responses to President Obama's withering critique of his previous positions.

The problem is that it really does matter. A consistent and deeply held set of foreign policy principles is vital to the success of a presidency; other countries will exploit an erratic course like Mr. Romney's even if American voters don't pay attention.
On substance, it was Mr. Romney's worst performance of the three debates. He seemed constantly eager to change the subject, now agreeing with the president, now returning to the old crutch of wild charges, whatever it took to get back to his misery tour of how Mr. Obama has crushed the American economy and its spirit.
When it came to Islamic radicalism, he said he wants to spread American influence and foreign aid money to promote Western values, a throwback to the Bush years. (The proposal was particularly comical given how little aid will be left if the Paul Ryan budget succeeds in slashing it.) "We can't kill our way out of this mess," he said, in full moderate-sounding mode.
But he also demanded a military far bigger than the Pentagon itself thinks it needs, ludicrously comparing it in raw numbers to the Navy and Air Force of the first half of the 20th Century. That led to one of the president's best retorts of the campaign season:
"Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed," Mr. Obama said. "We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships."
Mr. Obama was nimble and sharp throughout the evening, consistently using a vastly superior knowledge of the world, gained through experience, to make Mr. Romney appear to be a low-information armchair critic. He even pinned Mr. Romney into a foolish defense of his inexcusable willingness to let the auto industry collapse, a fumble that could hurt him in the swing states of the upper Midwest.
Every time Mr. Romney shrugged and essentially conceded that the administration is already doing the right thing around the world - on Syria, on Iranian sanctions, on drones - Mr. Obama would sarcastically remind viewers that today's moderation was a far cry from the gun-toting positions Mr. Romney used to win the primaries.
"What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map," Mr. Obama said. "And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength or keeping America safe over the long term."
It is, unfortunately, a recipe for lulling voters into thinking Mr. Romney knows what he's talking about. And with the debates over and the race back to deceptive advertising and speechmaking, his campaign is counting on it.

HEADLINE: Pressing Issues in Asia Get Scant Attention in Debate

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Many of the implications of a rising China for the United States were barely addressed by President Obama and Mitt Romney in their debate Monday night. The heated tensions between China and three American allies in the Pacific - Japan, South Korea and the Philippines - went unmentioned. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Many of the implications of a rising China for the United States were barely addressed by President Obama and Mitt Romney in their debate Monday night, as both candidates swung foreign policy questions back to domestic issues like jobs and education. 
Neither man mentioned China in his closing statement. 
Heated tensions between China and three American allies in the Pacific - Japan, South Korea and the Philippines - went unmentioned during the debate. The worrisome standoffs and violent protests over various disputed islands did not come up.
The chronic and extant nuclear threat of North Korea received no mention at all from the president and just 10 words from Mr. Romney, who said "you see North Korea continuing to export their nuclear technology." Meanwhile, the atomic potentialities of Iran took up substantial debate time. 
A transcript of the debate is here.
Two weeks from now, the Chinese Communist Party will install a new group of leaders - the Standing Committee of the Politburo, with just nine members, or perhaps now seven - who will be making the major policy decisions for China over the next decade. The party congress and the leadership transition were not mentioned in the debate.
While @barackobama has refused to act, American workers have lost their jobs & China has become the world's top manufacturer.

The Romney-Ryan jobs plan could create 73,000 jobs-in China: twitpic.com/b382fr#RomneyWrong
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama) October 23, 2012
The China question was largely cast as a jobs and loss-of-maunfacturing issue, and it led to some testy exchanges, some of the most heated of the evening. 
"You know, if we had taken your advice, Governor Romney, about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China," Mr. Obama said.
In reply, Mr. Romney said, in part, "I'm a son of Detroit. I was born in Detroit. My dad was head of a car company. I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry. My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks."
What followed was a back-and-forth about the rescue of the U.S. auto industry that featured this exchange:
Mr. Obama: You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy. You said that they could get it in the private marketplace. That wasn't true. They would have gone through a - 
Mr. Romney: You're wrong. You're wrong, Mr. President. 
Mr. Obama: I, no, I am not wrong. 
Mr. Romney: You're wrong. 
Mr. Obama: I am not wrong. And - 
Mr. Romney: People can look it up. You're right. 
Mr. Obama: People will look it up. 
Mr. Romney: Good. 
Amid a discussion of cuts to the defense budget, Mr. Obama cited his administration's deployment of more U.S. military assets in the Asia-Pacific region, a move that the White House calls a "pivot" or a "rebalancing." 
He said the region is "going to be a massive growth area in the future. And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power, that we are going to have a presence there."
Mr. Romney, who favors an expansion of the military budget, said "our navy is smaller now than any time since 1917. The navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now down to 285."
Mr. Obama countered that "we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military's changed."
"We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them," he continued. "We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."
Mr. Romney brought up his intention to call out China for manipulating its currency, an issue explored at length here by my colleague Annie Lowrey. 
Mr. Romney repeated his criticism of China for "stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods. They have to understand, we want to trade with them, we want a world that's stable, we like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."
He brought up the example of an American company whose valves were being counterfeited in China, right down to the serial numbers and packaging. 
Mr. Obama said his administration has successfully brought a number of trade cases against China, including a recent victory at the World Trade Organization that was reported Monday on Rendezvous. That case will benefit two steelmakers, one in Ohio, the other in Pennsylvania - important swing states in the election. 
People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship newspaper, ran a commentary before the debate that suggested "China is neither the core topic nor ultimate target for the election this year, though it has been repeatedly mentioned." 
Whoever is elected, the piece said, "the United States may continue to adopt discriminatory and competitive economic policies toward China," including high tariffs and further cases at the W.T.O.
The commentary concluded that "China-U.S. relations will unlikely turn rosy soon after the presidential election. China should be prepared for this serious possibility."

HEADLINE: Obama Unlikely to Get Big Debate Bounce, but a Small One Could Matter

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Averaging the results of instant-reaction polls puts President Obama's margin of victory at 16 percentage points, which could give him a small but significant bump. 

 BODY:
Instant-reaction polls following Monday night's debate in Boca Raton, Fla., judged President Obama to be the winner.
A CBS News poll of undecided voters who watched the debate found 53 percent giving it to Mr. Obama, 23 percent to Mitt Romney and 24 percent declaring it a tie. 
Mr. Obama's margin of victory in the poll was slightly wider than Mr. Romney's following the first presidential debate in Denver, which a similar CBS News poll gave to Mr. Romney at 46 percent to 22 percent.
Other polls, conducted among a broader group of voters rather than just undecided ones, suggested a smaller margin for the president.
A Public Policy Polling survey of voters in 11 swing states who watched the debate found them giving it to Mr. Obama, 53 percent to 42 percent. 
A CNN poll of registered voters who watched the debate put Mr. Obama ahead, 48 percent to 40 percent. That was similar to Mr. Obama's 46-39 margin in a CNN poll of the second debate, and much smaller than Mr. Romney's 67-25 advantage in the first one.
An online poll by Google Consumer Surveys had Mr. Obama winning, 45.1 percent to 35.3 percent. His roughly 10-percentage-point margin in the poll is smaller than in a Google poll after the second debate, which gave it to Mr. Obama by 17 percentage points, or Mr. Romney's after the first, which he won by 22 points.
There is, obviously, some disagreement on the magnitude of Mr. Obama's advantage -- the polls surveyed different types of voters and applied different methods to do so. 
But averaging the results from the CBS News, CNN and Google polls, which conducted surveys after all three presidential debates along with the one between the vice-presidential candidates, puts Mr. Obama's margin at 16 percentage points.
That compares favorably to Mr. Obama's average 10-percentage-point margin after the second debate, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden's 6-point margin against Representative Paul Ryan, but is smaller than Mr. Romney's average 29-point win in Denver.
The first presidential debate produced roughly a 4-percentage-point bounce in head-to-head polls toward Mr. Romney, while the second presidential debate brought no appreciable bounce toward Mr. Obama. 
It is tempting to split the difference, and assume that Mr. Obama might get a 1- or 2-point bounce in the polls, but there are some mitigating factors. The pace of the debate was slow, and it was competing against professional baseball and football games, which may have kept viewership down. 
Voters have more information about the candidates than they did before the first debate, which means that their additional impressions of the candidates could make less difference at the margin. Historically, the bounces following the third presidential debate, in the years when one was held, were smaller than after the first two.
Finally, the subject of the debate, foreign policy, is not as important to most voters as economic policy, although some voters may have judged the candidates on style regardless of the substance of the conversation, which did end up including a fair amount of domestic policy as well.
Still, with the contest being so tight, any potential gain for Mr. Obama could matter. 
Mr. Obama was roughly a 70 percent Electoral College favorite in the FiveThirtyEight forecast in advance of the debate, largely because he has remained slightly ahead in polls of the most important swing states.
If Mr. Obama's head-to-head polling were 2 percentage points higher right now, he would be a considerably clearer favorite in the forecast, about 85 percent. A 1-point bounce would bring him to 80 percent, and even a half-point bounce would advance his position to being a 75 percent favorite in the forecast.
Still, Mr. Obama should not take even that for granted. There have been some past debates when the instant-reaction polls judged one candidate to be the winner, but the head-to-head polls eventually moved in the opposite direction.

HEADLINE: The Health Mandate Romney Still Supports

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The Republicans seem perfectly content to mandate emergency care by hospitals while opposing the individual health-care mandate of the Affordable Care Act, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Republicans have a dilemma on health policy. They are adamantly opposed to government paying for health care or a mandate requiring people to buy health insurance. At the same time, they recognize that they cannot say to the world that if a dying person shows up at an emergency room without insurance, that person will be left to die in the street. Thus they support a little-known mandate requiring hospitals to treat the uninsured, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act.
Often referred to as Emtala, the bill passed a Republican Senate and was signed into law by Ronald Reagan on April 7, 1986. It was enacted because, previously, people had in fact been left to die in the street when hospital emergency rooms would not admit them without insurance. This problem was highlighted in a "60 Minutes" broadcast on March 17, 1985 that spurred Congressional action.
Since then, Republicans have routinely cited Emtala as a key reason that the United States already has de facto national health insurance and does not need further government involvement in health care. As George W. Bush put it in a July 10, 2007, speech: "People have access to health care in America. After all, you just go to an emergency room."

During the 2008 campaign, one of John McCain's health advisers asserted that because of Emtala, there were, in fact, no uninsured in America. As the economist John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis told The Dallas Morning News in an article published on Aug. 27, 2008: "The next president of the United States should sign an executive order requiring the Census Bureau to cease and desist from describing any American - even illegal aliens - as uninsured. Instead, the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care. So there you have it. Voila! Problem solved." (This article is no longer available on the Dallas Morning News Web site, but the reaction it drew can be found in blog posts from that week.) 
This year, Mitt Romney is making the same assertion - that the Affordable Care Act and its hated individual mandate for health insurance is unnecessary because Emtala effectively constitutes a sufficient safety net for those needing health care but lacking insurance.
As Mr. Romney said on "60 Minutes" on Sept. 23, 2012, "We do provide care for people who don't have insurance, people - we - if someone has a heart attack, they don't sit in their apartment and die. We pick them up in an ambulance, and take them to the hospital and give them care."
Mr. Romney repeated this point in an interview with The Columbus Dispatch on Oct. 11, 2012. As the paper reported:
Romney minimized the harm for Americans left without health insurance.
"We don't have a setting across this country where if you don't have insurance, we just say to you, 'Tough luck, you're going to die when you have your heart attack,'" he said as he offered more hints as to what he would put in place of "Obamacare," which he has pledged to repeal.
"No, you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it's paid for, either by charity, the government or by the hospital. We don't have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don't have insurance."
He pointed out that federal law requires hospitals to treat those without health insurance - although hospital officials frequently say that drives up health-care costs.
In fact, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act isn't even remotely a substitute for health insurance or something that obviates the purpose of health reform. It does not demand that all hospitals care for whoever walks in, only those who require urgent care to avoid serious injury or life-threatening consequences. Only hospitals that both participate in Medicare and have emergency rooms are covered by the law
Moreover, someone admitted to an emergency room under Emtala is not held until cured, only stabilized until she can be sent home or to a public hospital or other facility willing to treat the patient without charge.
Needless to say, the questions of whether an uninsured person seeking care at an emergency room is indeed in an immediate, urgent situation and whether she or he is stable enough to be discharged are highly contentious. A new report in the journal Health Affairs found that hospitals continue to engage in a practice known as "patient dumping" - turning away uninsured patients from emergency rooms despite the law.
One reason they are able to do so is because in 2003 the George W. Bush administration eased the rules regarding Emtala. The official responsible for weakening the law was Thomas A. Scully, who served as president of the Federation of American Hospitals from 1995 to 2001 and is now a lobbyist for the health care industry.
It's worth remembering that once upon a time - in the 1990s - Republicans were in high dudgeon about "unfunded mandates." In their 1994 "Contract With America," they promised to fix this problem and in 1995 enacted the "Unfunded Mandates Reform Act."
The Republican argument on mandates was perfectly valid. To save money on-budget, the federal government often mandates that businesses or state and local governments undertake some activity. But of course, the cost doesn't disappear just because it doesn't involve federal taxes or spending; it just comes out of someone else's pocket.
Therefore, even if we accept the Republican contention that Emtala is sufficient to deal with the problem of the uninsured without mandating that people obtain health insurance, all that is happening is a shifting of the cost of caring for such people. To a large extent, they end up being paid by the insured through higher medical bills and insurance premiums. In New York, for example, a 9 percent surcharge on all hospital bills covers the cost of caring for indigents, though complaints abound of hospitals failing to comply with the law.
The purely partisan hatred by Republicans for the individual mandate - which used to be the foundation of their health policy - has ironically led them to embrace another mandate on hospitals. But it is a very inadequate and inefficient substitute for health insurance - something Mr. Romney used to acknowledge - and every bit as much a violation of Republican principles, which oppose unfunded mandates, as the individual mandate that they abhor.

HEADLINE: Casting Call in Washington

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Whoever wins in November will likely have to find replacements for both Timothy F. Geithner and Ben S. Bernanke. | Marissa Mayer is planning to take Yahoo shopping. | Jamie Dimon has an unexpected ally in Barney Frank. 

 BODY:
CASTING CALL IN WASHINGTON | Monday night's presidential debate was supposed to be about foreign policy, but the candidates could not help talking occasionally about the domestic economy. That's probably not a bad thing. Whoever wins in November will likely have to find replacements for both Timothy F. Geithner and Ben S. Bernanke, two economic leaders whose jobs have become even more important in the aftermath of the financial crisis, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. The Treasury secretary and the Federal Reserve chairman "are the equivalent of roles in a buddy movie," Mr. Sorkin says.
The speculation about possible successors to Mr. Geithner has centered on some well-known names, like Erskine Bowles and Jamie Dimon, and on some that are less known in business circles, like Jacob Lew, the president's chief of staff. When it comes to the Fed, the election could have an immediate impact on investors' assumptions, Binyamin Appelbaum writes in The New York Times. Mitt Romney, for instance, has pledged to replace the Fed chairman, and the Republican candidate's views would lead people to expect a shift in strategy at the central bank.
YAHOO'S FUTURE DEALS | 
Marissa Mayer is planning to take Yahoo shopping. But don't expect big purchases. Ms. Mayer said on her first earnings call as Yahoo's chief executive that she would seek out acquisitions in the range of "double-digit millions and low hundreds of millions." Deals above $1 billion are not likely, she said. "We're looking for smaller scale acquisitions that align well over all with our businesses." Yahoo's shares were up more than 3 percent in trading before the opening bell on Tuesday.
VOLCKER RULE'S VICTIMS | Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are already changing their businesses in anticipation of the Volcker Rule. But according to Standard & Poor's, those firms could still be hurt by a strict version of the rule, which limits proprietary trading. Certain big banks might even be downgraded. S.&P. analysts on Monday predicted a "one-in-three chance" that Goldman and Morgan would have their ratings cut.
In London, entrepreneurs are building an alternative to traditional banks, DealBook's Mark Scott writes. Some are drawing on their experience in finance or consulting to create payment companies and lenders. "Start-ups are taking advantage of London's position as a global financial center," Adam Valkin, a partner at the European venture capital firm Accel Partners, told DealBook. "They are innovating in ways that banks just can't do."
ON THE AGENDA | 
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, known as Sifma, has its annual meeting on Tuesday at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan; speakers include Gary Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Mary L. Schapiro of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman. Apple is expected announce a smaller version of the iPad at 1 p.m. Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m. Greg Smith, the former Goldman employee (and apparently financial commentator, with a new essay in Time magazine) is on CNBC at 4:40 p.m. Xerox reports earnings before the market opens, and Facebook reports after the closing bell. On Thursday, Procter & Gamble is to announce its quarterly results, with William A. Ackman pushing for changes.
 CERBERUS EYES SUPERVALU | 
Cerberus Capital Management has been lining up at least $4 billion in financing for a potential bid for Supervalu, the struggling supermarket company, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook. Supervalu's shares jumped nearly 45 percent after Cerberus's efforts were first reported.
FRANK DEFENDS JPMORGAN | 
Jamie Dimon wasn't too happy when the government recently sued his bank over Bear Stearns, which he said he took over as a "favor." Now, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive has an unexpected ally in Representative Barney Frank. The Massachusetts Democrat said on Monday: "The decision now to prosecute JPMorgan Chase because of activities undertaken by Bear Stearns before the takeover unfortunately fits the description of allowing no good deed to go unpunished."

HEADLINE: Completing Mitt's Makeover

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: A score sheet for last night's presidential debate on foreign policy. 

 BODY:
If you score last night's faceoff in Boca on debating points, Obama won. He should have. He's been navigating the complexities of foreign policy for nearly four years, and while even admirers of his presidency can list disappointments, on his watch we brought our troops home from Iraq, charted a route home from Afghanistan, mobilized strong international pressure against Iran's nuclear program, eroded the leadership of Al Qaeda and helped rid the world of Muammar Qaddafi. The president's best lines were obviously scripted, he was allowed to evade some important questions, but he projected confidence and seriousness of purpose.
If you look at last night as the final stage of Mitt Romney's metamorphosis from primary-season ideologue to cautious technocrat, then he was what he needed to be: good enough. His main job was not to knock down the president; he is overmatched on foreign policy, and in any case there is still something in Americans, some sense of decorum, that believes politics should end, or at least be tempered, at the water's edge. Romney had two overlapping objectives last night. One was to assure voters that he was not the fumbling amateur or the hyperactive hawk that Obama attack ads and the governor's own behavior have suggested. In other words, that he was a plausible, unfrightening steward of our security. The other was to neutralize foreign affairs as a fighting matter so he can return to the domestic economic issues where he has a chance of winning. In other words, to minimize the meaningful differences between himself and the president. He wobbled in the first half hour and sometimes sounded like a student who has crammed the whole course the night before the test. But I think he pretty much accomplished his aims.

Yesterday morning I offered Romney some advice on how to reassure the broad electorate that he could be trusted to manage our role in the world and convince those who pay close attention to foreign policy that he appreciates the dangerous complexity of that challenge. I don't kid myself that the Romney campaign takes its talking points from The Times Op-Ed page, but he exceeded my admittedly low expectations. In the process, I expect he sent the neocon wing of his campaign running for the smelling salts.
On Syria, he said he was opposed to intervening militarily "at this stage," even to impose a no-fly zone that some of his supporters advocate.
On Afghanistan, he promised to adhere to the 2014 withdrawal deadline that he had earlier mocked, and even endorsed Obama's (arguable) claim that we are on course to stand up a sturdy, self-sufficient Afghan army.
On Iran, he sheathed his sword, dropped his contempt for negotiations, and called for "peaceful and diplomatic means" to prevent the creation of a Persian nuclear arsenal. (As a strange pander to the Iran hawks, he proposed to indict Iran's president for "inciting genocide" and turn the country's diplomats into "pariahs." This prompted Slate's Fred Kaplan to wonder,"How do you pursue 'diplomatic means' without diplomats?")
On Libya, Romney left the questions about the attack on our Benghazi consulate to the moderator, the able Bob Schieffer: "Was it an intelligence failure? Was it a policy failure? Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened?" Obama sidestepped the questions last night, but they hover over his campaign, even without Romney pressing the point.
Compared to the president, Romney sounded last night like Mr. Give-Peace-a-Chance: no more Iraqs or Afghanistans, a foreign policy in the Muslim world built on economic aid, education, gender equality and the rule of law. I tried to imagine the reaction of John Bolton - President Bush's U.N.-hating U.N. ambassador and a Romney advisor - when Romney began citing the nation-building wisdom of Arab scholars "organized by the U.N." 
Romney ignored one piece of advice that I was particularly proud of. I suggested he apply his career expertise as a corporate streamliner to the Pentagon budget. But instead of promising to bring the military a dose of Bain rigor, he complained about the size of our Navy, and Obama was ready with the most tweet-worthy line of the night: "Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed."

HEADLINE: Invasive Grasses as Biofuel? Scientists Protest

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: Scientists ask the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a proposed rule allowing the grasses to qualify as feedstock for biofuels. 

 BODY:
More than 200 scientists from across the country have sent a letter to the Obama administration urging the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider a rule, in the final approval stages, that would allow two invasive grasses, Arundo donax and Pennisetum purpureum, to qualify as advanced biofuel feedstock under the nation's renewable fuel standard. 
"As scientists in the fields of ecology, wildlife biology, forestry and natural resources, we are writing to bring your attention to the importance of working proactively to prevent potential ecological and economic damages associated with the potential spread of invasive bioenergy feedstocks," the scientists write. 
"While we appreciate the steps that federal agencies have made to identify and promote renewable energy sources and to invest in second- and third-generation sources of bioenergy, we strongly encourage you to consider the invasive potential of all novel feedstock species, cultivars, and hybrids before providing incentives leading to their cultivation."
Invasive species currently cost the nation $120 billion each year. Many of these invasive species were intentionally introduced by government-financed programs. Kudzu, or "the vine that ate the South," for example, spread uncontrollably in the 1930s after farmers were paid to cultivate it in an attempt to curb erosion.

The scientists signing the letter fear that the kudzu story will be repeated if the E.P.A. rule goes into effect. 
Pennisetum purpureum, known as napiergrass or elephant grass, is of African origin but has been introduced to many tropical areas around the world, where it multiplies rapidly. Arundo donax, or giant reed, is native to India and is considered particularly fearsome: it ranks as one of the world's 100 worst invasive species. 
Giant reed has shown promise as a biofuel source because it grows quickly and tolerates a variety of habitats, characteristics that simultaneously make it extremely threatening as an invasive species. 
In Oregon, Florida and North Carolina, giant reed is already being cultivated for biofuel production, while in Texas, California, Colorado and Nevada it is classified as a noxious weed. When it invades an area, it chokes out nearly all other species, increasing wildfire risk and endangering birds, insects and other animals that depend on the native vegetation for their habitat and food. In California, it has been estimated that eradication of giant reed from a single acre of land can cost $5,000 to $25,000. 
This month, 100 local and national groups including the California Invasive Plant Council and Tennessee Riverkeeper also sent the E.P.A. a letter (PDF) warning of the potential "serious unintended ecological and economic impacts" of the proposed rule.

HEADLINE: Obama's Remark Aside, No Imminent Deal on 'Fiscal Cliff'

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: No one should conclude a secret deal to resolve the looming problem of sequestration is imminent. It isn't. 

 BODY:
President Obama set heads spinning on Capitol Hill when he declared on Monday night during the final presidential debate that sequestration - $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts over the next decade - "will not happen."
But no one should conclude that a secret deal to resolve the problem is imminent. It is not.
Administration officials confirmed on Tuesday that the president was repeating conventional wisdom in Washington: a deal will be struck to head off cuts that would slice about 9.4 percent from most military programs and 8.2 percent from domestic programs, beginning Jan. 2. But nothing will happen until after the election. 
Administration officials have been expressing that confidence for weeks, even as they say no real negotiations are happening. Congressional Republicans reacted to the president's pronouncement as if he had jabbed them with a hot poker.
The staff of the House speaker, John A. Boehner, posted a missive on his Web page to drive home two points: that the across-the-board cuts were the president's fault, and that only the House had actually done anything to prevent them.
"Neither have Senate Democrats. They won't even debate and vote on the House-passed bill," said Don Seymour, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. "Instead, Democrats have threatened to drive the country off the 'fiscal cliff' - which includes these devastating defense cuts - in their quest for a tax hike on small businesses. They're pushing for tax hikes that will destroy more than 700,000 jobs but have taken no action at all to stop the sequester."
Those points are debatable. The speaker's office pointed to a passage in Bob Woodward's new book on Washington's budget morass, "The Price of Politics," that said that Jacob J. Lew, the White House budget director at the time and now the White House chief of staff, came up with the idea of automatic across-the-board cuts to help force a bipartisan Congressional committee to find at least $1 trillion in deficit reduction. 
But the "supercommittee" was empaneled as a way to avoid an economic crisis with a default on federal debt only because House Republicans were refusing to raise the nation's statutory borrowing limit, or debt ceiling. The legislation that created both the supercommittee and the sequestration hammer was written on Capitol Hill and passed with the full support of the Republican leadership.
And it was that supercommittee -- not the White House - that failed to reach a deal, thus prompting the sequester.
House Republicans did indeed take the tough vote to shut off the automatic cuts to defense, by shifting those cuts to domestic spending on top of the automatic cuts still scheduled to hit those programs. Democrats would not accept any such deal. It is also not true that Mr. Obama has failed to propose a solution to the pending cuts. His budget for the 2013 fiscal year, proposed in February, would have shut off the sequester and replaced it with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.
It was a solution no more acceptable to Republicans than the House solution was to Democrats.

HEADLINE: The Issue That Dare Not Speak Its Name

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: Silence reigned on the issue of climate change in all three presidential debates. Frustration is palpable among environmental groups and on college campuses. 

 BODY:
A mountain of scientific evidence points to climate change as a serious risk for the human future. The Pentagon sees it as a threat to national security. Arctic sea ice hit a record low this summer. In some low-lying countries threatened by sea level rise, evacuation planning has already begun.
Yet the presidential debates are now over, and not once did climate change surface explicitly as an issue. This campaign is the first time that has happened since 1988, and environmental groups - and environmentally minded voters - are aghast.
"By ignoring climate change, both President Obama and Governor Romney are telling the rest of the world that they do not take it seriously, and that America cannot be expected to act with the intensity and urgency needed to avert catastrophe," Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth Action, said in a statement. "Their silence prepares a future for our children and grandchildren in which we will face deeper droughts, fiercer forest fires and killer storms, messier spills and dirtier air. America deserves better."
Well before Monday's final campaign debate, environmental groups dubbed the situation "climate silence" and even set up a Web site in an effort to force the issue into the campaign. It was all for naught, however. To my knowledge, Jim Lehrer and Bob Schieffer, the moderators of the first and third debates, have not explained their thinking in declining to bring up the issue, except to say that time pressure prevented them from asking about many important subjects.

In the second debate, the candidates spent more than 10 minutes talking about energy policy, yet the "c" word never came up. Candy Crowley of CNN, who moderated that debate, explained on the air afterward that while she knew that "you climate change people" wanted the subject raised, she felt that most voters preferred that the debate stay focused on the economy.
Throughout the campaign, the candidates have talked a great deal about energy, but it has essentially been a competition in who could heap the most praise on fossil fuels. They tended to avoid any explicit linkage between their energy proposals and climate risk.
Frustration on that front is palpable in many places, especially on college campuses.
"Young voters want an economic recovery, but we don't see the economy and the climate as separate issues," David Snydacker, a Northwestern University graduate student working on clean-energy technologies, said in an e-mail. "Today's young scientists and engineers are preparing to build modern energy systems to sustain 10 billion people. We see enormous potential in solar and wind energy, and we accept that fossil fuels will become increasingly expensive. Watching the candidates clamor to claim the title of 'Mr. Coal Guy' is disappointing, to say the least."
Mitt Romney has focused a great deal on coal, oil and natural gas production and criticized President Obama's push on green energy. He called for ending a tax credit that supports wind energy, angering even some Republican lawmakers from states like Iowa where wind production has become an important source of rural income. 
Perhaps the closest Mr. Romney came to trying to win over environmental voters was his campaign promise to "eliminate any barriers that might prevent new energy technologies from succeeding on their own merits."
Since many environmental voters are in the Obama camp, the president's failure to bring up climate change in the debates may well have been a bigger disappointment to them than Mr. Romney's stance. 
Mr. Obama used phrases like "the energy of the future" several times in the debates, and he explicitly mentioned climate change as a threat in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in September, later reprising that line in some of his stump speeches. Perhaps sensitive to the perception that Mr. Obama has ignored the issue, his campaign has been e-mailing environmental groups to call attention to these statements.
But Mr. Obama has mainly seemed concerned about protecting his right flank from Mr. Romney's criticisms. The president, of course, has faced a political storm over his environmental agenda the last two years amid the rise of the Tea Party and the Republican takeover of the House. Even so, he has continued to pursue policies designed to lower carbon dioxide emissions, including tougher mileage standards for cars and regulation of emissions from power plants. 
Some environmental groups, recognizing that a second Obama term would probably be better for their issues than a Romney presidency, have declined to publicly attack the president.
Many political observers are not especially surprised that climate change has gotten short shrift in this campaign. In general, environmental concerns tend to rise in the public mind in times of prosperity and sink in hard times. And polling suggests that, while most voters believe climate change is real, they see it as a long-term threat and therefore put it far down their list of priorities for action.
"No candidate has been able to portray climate change policy as a win-win," Eugene M. Trisko, a lawyer and consultant for the United Mine Workers of America, said on Tuesday. "That's because they understand that the root of climate change mitigation strategy is higher energy costs. It's an energy tax, and that's something you don't want to talk about in a debate."

HEADLINE: With Election Nearing, Wall Street Ponders a Romney Presidency

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Some speakers at the annual meeting of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's chief lobbying group, were eager to feed hopes that Mitt Romney would win the election. 

 BODY:
With the presidential election drawing near, and the Republican candidate Mitt Romney surging in some polls, Wall Street may be cheering on the sidelines.
And at the annual meeting of Wall Street's chief lobbying group on Tuesday, some political advisers were eager to fan those hopes.
"Romney is in very good shape to win the election," Charles K. Black, an outside adviser to the Republican candidate's campaign told the conference of Wall Street executives, hosted by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Mr. Black pegged President Obama's odds of winning re-election at "a one-in-three chance."
While most blue-state New Yorkers would scowl at the suggestion that Mr. Obama's tenure was in jeopardy, this is Wall Street. The audience was packed with bankers, a group that helped bankroll Mr. Obama's first presidential run before the romance crumbled as the White House struck a harsher tone. 
Mr. Obama has derided some bankers as "fat cats." The president also ushered in a wave of new regulatory oversight for Wall Street in the aftermath of the financial crisis, irking many firms that prefer the light regulatory touch that often comes with Republican administrations. 
Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a longtime private equity executive, has vowed to "repeal and replace" the regulatory crackdown known as the Dodd-Frank Act. That promise alone is likely to turn out the vote on Wall Street. 
"The governor thinks Dodd-Frank is way too regulatory and overreaching," Mr. Black said on a panel.
He conceded, however, that Mr. Romney "hasn't gotten real specific about what the replacement will be." 
For the lonely Obama supporters in the crowd, the Democratic strategist Karen Finney offered some cause for cautious optimism. 
With the economy showing some small signs of life, and the unemployment rate slowly ticking downward, "people are feeling more positive," she said on the panel. She further noted that polls fail to account for Latino, black and young voters, groups that are likely to come out in droves to support Mr. Obama. 
Some Senate races could also turn in favor of Democrats. One campaign in particular - the face-off in Massachusetts between Scott Brown, a Republican, and Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat -- has riveted the financial sector. Ms. Warren made her name in Washington as a loud critic of Wall Street and the chief architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new regulatory agency that examines big banks. 
When panelists noted that Ms. Warren has opened up a lead in that race, Mr. Black cautioned against committing a major faux pas by "mentioning that name in this crowd."

HEADLINE: How the Presidential Campaign Is Being Viewed Around the World

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Times correspondents report on how the election in the United States is seen in a half-dozen countries. 

 BODY:
As our Moscow correspondent Ellen Barry reports, the way news organizations in other countries portray the United States' presidential campaign "reveals as much about how they see themselves as it does about the American political process."
The same can be said for much of the global conversation on social media platforms during Monday night's final presidential debate on foreign policy. Some noted on Twitter that their countries were not visible at all, as neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney discussed the debt crisis in Europe; India; South Africa; or the thousands of people killed in the drug war in Mexico. 
In the Middle East and North Africa, others, including this blogger from Beirut, commented that both candidates bestowed much attention on Israel without discussing Palestinians. 
Okay if I am an Israeli u convinced me to elect u as a president (both of u), if I am an #Arab do u even care abt my opinion? #debate
- Beirutiyat (@Beirutiyat)23 Oct 12
Elsewhere around the world, our correspondents shared these reports about how the campaign is being viewed in Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Poland and South Korea.
 The View From Brazil 
The main newspapers in So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro feature daily coverage of the race, analyzing every shift in the polls and sending correspondents to interview voters in states including Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire.
Shock emerged in Brazil and other countries, for instance, over Mr. Romney's assertion in the Oct. 3 debate that he would end the subsidy for PBS, as previously reportedon The Lede. The claim by Mr. Romney focused attention not only on the issue of government assistance for public broadcasting, an idea that enjoys broad support in Brazil, but also the deep cultural ties between the United States and Brazil. After all, a Brazilian version of "Sesame Street," called "Vila Ssamo," was first broadcast in the 1970s, including a character in the prominent role of Garibaldo, or Big Bird.
Reflecting a broad current of support in Brazil for President Obama, Brazilian news media appeared to be relieved when the Obama campaign released ads attacking Mr. Romney for suggesting that PBS could lose its funding.
Yet while American campaigns still provoke interest in Brazil, other issues are gaining prominence. This week's issue of Veja, Brazil's most influential news magazine, offered an example of this shift in its cover article. It had nothing to do with Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney; instead, it discussed the ushering in of new political leadership in China, which has surpassed the United States as Brazil's largest trading partner. -SIMON ROMERO 
 The View From China 
The timing of the American presidential vote - just two days before the opening of the 18th Communist Party Congress - has meant that despite the campaign's anti-China themes, it has attracted little attention in China. But there is no doubt that the government is monitoring the election, and officials in top financial institutions are well informed, and concerned, about the combat against China in the campaign, experts say.
After the debate last week when the candidates vied for anti-China barbs, the Chinese Foreign Ministry chided the candidates, suggesting that they raise the level of their discourse. "We hope the U.S. Republican and Democratic candidates will get rid of the impact of election politics and do more things conducive to China-U.S. mutual trust and cooperation," saida Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei.
Until the first debate between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, when the president fared poorly, the Chinese took it almost for granted that Mr. Obama would be re-elected. But political experts say that China would find a way to work with Mr. Romney, whose business background is considered a plus by some. Though his threat to name China a currency manipulator for keeping the renminbi at an artificially low level is not appreciated, analysts say he would find it difficult to follow through on his pledge because the value of China's currency against the dollar has risen substantially in recent years. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama's record on China has been viewed with increasing skepticism.
"There has been a downturn in the relationship in the last two years because he and Hillary Clinton announced the rebalancing," a plan to deploy more military assets to Asia, said Sun Zhe, director of the Center for U.S.-China Relations at Tsinghua University in Beijing. -JANE PERLEZ 
 The View From Germany
A lot has changed since Mr. Obama's race to the White House electrified the world, overturning expectations about race at home and abroad and bringing "Yes, we can," into the political lexicon around the world.
At the start of the presidential primary season in December 2007, Christoph von Marschall, Washington bureau chief for Germany's daily Tagesspiegel newspaper, published a book titled "Barack Obama - The Black Kennedy." When primary season rolled around this year, Mr. Marschall brought out a book with a very different name and a very different feel.
"What's Wrong With the Amis," the book was called, using the German nickname for Americans, with the subtitle "Why They Hate What We Love About Barack Obama." When he returns home for reading tours and other public events, the two most frequent questions he receives illustrate the gap between Germans and Americans on the president, Mr. Marschall says: Why didn't Mr. Obama close Guantnamo Bay, and what do Americans have against health care?
Christoph von Marschall being interviewed by Manouchehr Shamsrizi, a blogger working for a Bertelsmann Foundation project, at the America Center in Hamburg.
Andreas Etges, an expert on American history at Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, said the 2008 campaign broke precedents in the German news media, with front-page articles in daily newspapers about state primary victories by Hillary Rodham Clinton or Mr. Obama. This year, Mr. Etges said, despite the disillusionment factor, the coverage started early again, with German news media keeping people abreast of every fluctuation in the race for the Republican nomination.
"It's definitely way more than Germans report on any other elections internationally, even on our neighbors," Mr. Etges said. In Berlin, many Germans pride themselves on their fluency in the nuts and bolts of the horse race - the breaking polls in the swing states, the intricacies of the Electoral College. "In spite of all the talk about American influence going down, the interest Germans have shown still illustrates what importance they think the American elections will have," Mr. Etges said. -NICHOLAS KULISH 
 The View From Japan 
Interest in American presidential elections is always high in Japan, which relies on the United States to be both its military protector and an important market for exports.
As in past elections, the major newspapers and television news programs have run daily reports on the campaign that can rival those of American news media in their level of analysis and detail.
However, political and media analysts say the interest is much lower this time than in the 2008 election, which mirrored events in Japan at the time. In 2009, Japan held a historic election of its own, when an opposition party took power, ending almost six decades of virtually uninterrupted one-party rule by the Liberal Democrats.
Analysts said that as Japan gropes toward a stronger multiparty system, interest is high in how the United States' system works, and particularly in party primaries. Parties in Japan choose their leaders by an internal party vote, and although internal votes have become more public and transparent in recent years, Japanese voters still feel they want a bigger voice in the process.
"In Japan, the election of party heads is still not open to the people," said Takeshi Suzuki, a communications professor at Meiji University in Tokyo. "There is intense attention here in how America, our senior colleague in democracy, chooses its presidents."
Mr. Suzuki said this was particularly apparent in one way that coverage this time has been different than in the past: Japanese reporters are spending more time on the campaign trail, particularly in closely fought states like Ohio. In the past, reports often dealt with abstract polling data and general observations, he said. This time, Mr. Suzuki said, reporters have done more on-the-ground coverage of whether the candidates have succeeded in wooing women or minorities, and the prospects for states' going red or blue.
Analysts said interest was also keen in economic policy, largely because growth in the Japanese economy still relies heavily on whether American consumers buy its cars and electronics. This has led to close attention of the candidates' economic agendas, and particularly on issues important to Japan like whether the United States will prop up the dollar, which is near historic lows against the yen.
"The only chance in the short term for the yen to go down is for the United States economy to pick up," said Tatsuhiko Yoshizaki, chief economist at the Sojitz Research Institute. "The expectations are high, so people in the market are watching this one very closely."
Initial reaction in Japan to the final debate, on foreign policy, was dominated by unease at the focus on the Middle East.
"Too many topics went ignored, including the euro crisis, the Guantnamo base, immigration, nuclear nonproliferation, global warning. And of course, relations with Japan and the U.S. troops in Okinawa," Daisuke Nakai, a New York-based staff writer for the daily Asahi Shimbun, wrote on Twitter. Okinawans have long been upset at what they see as their disproportionate burden in hosting more than half of the American troops in Japan; their grievances spiked recently with reports that a woman was raped there by two American sailors. 
"Mr. Obama reiterated that the United States is a Pacific nation, but at least judging from this debate, I don't get the sense that the region is a priority," Mr. Nakai said.
Japan has become increasingly concerned about China's growing power in the region, including its claims to an island chain controlled by Japan.

 The View From Poland 
In Poland, one of Mr. Romney's stops on his overseas tour this past summer, all the major newspapers, magazines, online platforms and television stations are giving the election considerable air time, although there too the intensity of the coverage has dipped since the frenzy of attention after the last campaign. That has not stopped leading outlets from throwing manpower at the race.
On Twitter, Mr. Romney's criticism about the decision to remove missile systems in Poland prompted discussion in both Poland and the United States, with a commentator saying the move was intended to win Polish-American votes.
Romney: pulling our missile systems out of #Poland was unfortunate #debate

The state-run television network TVP will send five additional correspondents to the United States for Election Day and will operate with six film crews. The evening news will be broadcast from Washington on Nov. 6 and 7. The biggest commercial television station, TVN, is sending three additional correspondents to help its usual correspondent cover Election Day.
In spite of the serious repercussions that Mr. Romney's tough stance on Russia could have for Poland, many people there are more focused on enjoying the gaffes and the jokes. Less earnest news outlets are running items about light subjects like cookies with the candidates' faces on them or a poll of which candidates' wives looked better when they both wore pink to the debate. -HANNA KOZLOWSKA 
 The View From South Korea 
After the second presidential debate, some newspapers in South Korea dedicated a full page or two to the subject, displaying photos and graphics and charts and describing how President Obama turned more aggressive. The daily Chosun Ilbo reported that "China," as well as "jobs" and "economy," were key words in presidential debates, and that that seemed to reflect American unease over China rising as a "superpower" and what it called a populist political need to "blame the American economic crisis on China."
Still, South Koreans are preoccupied with their own presidential election in December, and they see little difference between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney on North Korea - the one issue in the American election that really interests many South Koreans.
"In the past, people here believed that there was a clear difference between the Republican and Democratic Parties on North Korea," said Koh Yu-hwan, a political scientist and North Korea expert in Dongguk University in Seoul. "But after Obama came into office, such a difference was gone and in South Korean eyes, Obama was not that different from Bush when it comes to North Korea."
Mr. Koh said the outcome of the election could affect Korea's vote, because "liberals and conservatives here will argue that their candidate can work better with the new U.S. president. People here don't like a discord between Washington and Seoul on their North Korea policies." -CHOE SANG-HUN 
For some, the debate raised more questions than answers. 
Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, posted on Twitter:
Unbelievable. An entire fopo debate with NO mention of Europe, Eurozone, Africa, anywhere in Asia other than China.

HEADLINE: A Photographic Road Trip Through a Familiar Superpower

BYLINE: MATT MCCANN


HIGHLIGHT: The English photographer Robert Leslie, inspired by the inauguration of our 44th president, rented a car and drove across America. His multimedia project, "Stormbelt," was a result of two trips. 

 BODY:
 Correction appended Oct. 23. 
Recall the electric 2008 presidential election - it seems so long ago - when the prevailing message that carried Barack Obama into the White House was of hope and change. The celebratory inauguration was a blink of optimism in the face of a terrifying and complex global financial meltdown. That crisis, plus two wars and a host of other problems, makes one wonder why some folks want the job so badly.
The London-based photographer Robert Leslie saw a live projection of the inauguration in Miami. The fervor of the audience and its diverse crowd was a sight to behold, he said. He had photographed the modern versions of some of the world's ancient empires - China and India among them - and was struck by the thought that he hadn't seriously addressed the world's current superpower, the United States.
He had a sister in Los Angeles and some time to kill. American gas prices, to him, were a steal. He rented a car.
The ensuing road trip took him across the Sun Belt, west from Florida till he reached the Pacific Ocean. Taking off with an open mind, Mr. Leslie was eager to see how the narrative would unfurl before him. As he drove through the wasteland of foreclosures of Florida, however, or as he pushed along the impoverished Gulf of Mexico, razed by Hurricane Katrina, it became clear that the trip was a sort of tour of America's woes.
"I didn't go out to make this ironic look of America," said Mr. Leslie, 50. "But it was pretty disheartening to find these things."
Mr. Leslie eventually completed two trips, the one that began on inauguration day and another last year - after the Deepwater Horizon disaster could be added to the list of calamities - that together provided the material for his project, "Stormbelt." Its book form, available from Blurb, includes essays by the photographer Edward Burtynsky and the TED speaker Cameron Sinclair. (Mr. Leslie himself has been a TED.com collaborator and photographer since 2005.) It is also available on Blurb and on iTunes, as an enhanced multimedia e-book produced with editorial direction from Chris Boot of the Aperture Foundation. Mr. Leslie, originally a musician and sound engineer, incorporates audio from the people he encountered, and one of the videos features a stand-off with a cow. (A different preview, without the cow, is viewable on Vimeo.)
Mr. Leslie was partly spurred by nostalgia - though he was born English and currently living in England, he spent much of his childhood in Ottawa and had vacationed in the United States as a boy. For this project, however, his outsider's perspective informed his vision. Like many non-Americans, Mr. Leslie was intensely fascinated by many aspects of the United States' conduct - politically, economically, environmentally, internationally - during the first decade of the new millennium. How was it that this chest-puffing world power could now barely support the people of its vulnerable underbelly? Ironies frequently presented themselves to him, and Mr. Leslie, who has an eye for the wry, rarely missed them.
In Texas, for instance, he found a shop that sold mostly George W. Bush memorabilia. "They had a banner that said, 'Evil prevails when good men do nothing,' " Mr. Leslie recalled. "It was this phrase that was proudly put up with all these symbols of Texas on the crossroads of Crawford. And when I went back last November or December, the banner was still there, but it was only being held up by one nail. It was blowing in the wind."
In Arizona, a snowstorm ambushed an extravagant plan Mr. Leslie had to drive to the Grand Canyon. The detour to the interstate, which Mr. Leslie knew would be plowed, put him along a river that he learned the Navajo had signed over decades ago to developers. Mined coal was sailed upriver to be transformed into electricity to power Las Vegas and Los Angeles. "At the end of it, the water's just dumped out, it's disposed of," Mr. Leslie said. "The total irony of this is that they only got electricity on their reservation in 2005."
Drainage from the mine had turned the river red. It was a ripe moment for a photograph - there was fresh snow, and although it was mostly overcast, some sky poked through. Red, white and blue.
 Correction: In an earlier version of the slideshow, Slide 7 incorrectly placed the town of Waveland in Louisiana. Waveland is in Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Questions Linger on Battery Prices Electric Cars

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAMERON

 BODY:
THE battery maker A123, a producer of lithium-ion cells for hybrid cars made by General Motors and Fisker Automotive that was founded in 2001 by MIT scientists, filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 16. ReVolt Technology, a maker of zinc-air batteries with a North American headquarters in Portland, Ore., called it quits last week. Another battery company, Ener1, went bankrupt in January.
Companies fail all the time, of course, for various reasons, and the incidence is bound to be high among start-ups in fledgling industries. But bankruptcies of companies that have received millions of dollars in government grants and loan guarantees -- in the cause of promoting electric vehicles and independence from foreign oil -- are another matter, especially in the cauldron of an election year. 
Beyond the inevitable birthing of new targets for political point-scoring, the failures contribute to the doubts that have arisen from lethargic sales of plug-in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt, which recently took a four-week vacation from manufacturing because of excess inventory, and electrics like the Nissan Leaf. In an avalanche of new hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery-only models -- 21 fresh models by the end of 2015 from Toyota alone -- industry executives have been faced with questions over whether there will be sufficient production capacity to meet the demand. China has shut down some battery makers who have violated environmental standards, and popular consumer electronics like the iPad and latest iPhones corner a lot of battery production.
''We do not see any supply difficulty,'' said Anand Sankaran, executive technology leader for energy storage and high-voltage systems at Ford Motor. ''There is no shortage of raw materials but there is a time frame to capacity,'' he added, referring to the time lag in achieving production capacity.
More critical in the long term is the question of whether the crucial lithium ion cells will become cheap enough, at a fast enough pace, to make pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars economically practical. After a rapid rate of price declines in the 1990s, the rate has slowed.
''Our view is that battery costs are coming down,'' Mr. Sankaran said, adding that there is consensus that by 2020 battery prices will have reached an economically practical level -- in the range of $200 to $250 a kilowatt-hour. That is a significant decline from the $1,000-a-kilowatt-hour cost that was the auto industry's rule of thumb until recently.
To understand the effect that price drop would have on the window sticker of a new electric car, keep in mind that the Ford Focus EV has a 23-kilowatt-hour battery. Tesla's new all-electric Model S sedan is offered with battery packs as big as 85 kilowatt-hours, which gives the car a range of 265 miles according to its official rating by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Battery prices are not a one-size-fits-all matter, Mr. Sankaran explained, but vary according to vehicle type and intended use. He made a distinction between so-called power batteries that can be discharged rapidly to give great acceleration, as might be used in sports cars, and energy batteries, which would be better suited vehicles whose priority was frugal operation and long driving range. This specialization affects the cost of lithium-ion batteries, because the differences require tailoring the production process to each type.
Battery experts caution against the oversimplification of battery price into dollars-per-kilowatt-hour of storage capacity because there are additional necessities, including the assembly of individual cells into a single large battery pack and the cooling and heating provisions. The more densely batteries are packaged to minimize how much space they take up in the vehicle, the more they need a method of extracting the heat they generate while in use.
The electronic control systems that regulate the motors can also be a costly part of vehicle electrification. Batteries deliver direct current electricity -- the familiar positive and negative connections of flashlights are a good example -- but efficient drive motors need alternating current, the kind that household appliances use. Power supplies convert the one into the other using large transistors, while delivering power according to the driver's demand.
For the moment, Mr. Sankaran said, the highest volume of batteries will go into hybrids. Plug-in hybrids, because they are driven greater distances on battery power alone, typically require three times the battery mass (and cost) of a hybrid. Electrics must carry much more.
As a result, Mr. Sankaran said, ''Ford's approach is what we call power of choice. People have different needs.
''We are not dictating one solution over another,'' he said. ''Hybrids will be more appealing to most customers.''
In other words, Ford will let the market decide.
Mr. Sankaran noted that a prime source of sales resistance to hybrid or electric cars has been an impression that performance or amenities must be sacrificed in exchange for the new green technologies.
In an effort to counter this, Mr. Sankaran said, ''We try to give a complete package, with no sacrifice.''

HEADLINE: In Oil-Rich Iran, Natural Gas Turns Wheels

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN
HOW'S this for a paradox? Iran, an oil power seeking to become a nuclear power, has instead become a natural gas power.
According to the latest figures from the Natural Gas Vehicle Knowledge Base, Iran, with the world's second-largest natural gas reserves after Russia, in 2011 became the world leader in natural gas vehicles with some 2.9 million on the road, narrowly edging Pakistan, which is trailed by Argentina, Brazil and India, respectively. (The United States, which does not subsidize and promote the fuel like other countries do, ranks 16th.)
Iran's reliance on its cleaner fossil fuel seems unlikely to diminish as international sanctions continue to bear down on its nuclear program, which in turn have curbed imports of gasoline; though Iran has large oil reserves, its ability to refine its own gasoline falls well short of its needs. 
But for ordinary Iranian motorists, natural gas is less a geopolitical or environmental issue than a pocketbook concern. ''This sort of fuel is cheap, and it gets me home every day -- that's what I care about,'' said Sasan Ahmadi, a 42-year-old office assistant filling up his Iranian-made Kia Pride at a natural-gas station for his hour commute home.
The government began promoting natural gas about a decade ago, and not just in response to American-led sanctions. A big initial reason was the increasingly thick yellow blankets of smog that often engulf greater Tehran and its 12 million inhabitants. That was a result of rising auto sales by domestic carmakers like Iran Khodro and Saipa, which took off as oil revenue began rising sharply around 15 years ago, enriching tens of millions of Iranians.
While rising car ownership fit nicely into the government's narrative of life as ever-improving after the 1979 Islamic revolution, clouds of smog from increased traffic congestion did not. To deal with the pollution, Iranian government planners found an answer in natural gas and its infrastructure, which was already serving the heating and cooking needs of consumers.
''We already had a network of gas pipes in place all over the country,'' said Reza Hajj Hosseini, a spokesman for the Iranian Fuel Distribution and Refinery Company, a subsidiary of the state oil company. ''It was relatively inexpensive for us to start offering alternative fuel.''
As a means to counter outside economic pressure, natural gas's usefulness is clear. Because of its inadequate investment in oil refineries, Iran has long been forced to refine a portion of its own crude at refineries in Europe to satisfy rising domestic demand for gasoline. So when the European Union in July barred gasoline sales to the country, natural gas helped to blunt the blow.
Despite the sanctions against Iran, motorists like Mr. Ahmadi can make their commute for the equivalent of less than a penny a mile using the alternative fuel at subsidized prices. Gasoline is more expensive, especially because government subsidies have been reduced, but it is still incredibly cheap by Western standards: less than $1 a gallon.
Iran's gradual natural gas conversion has focused heavily on installing natural gas canisters in cars and altering engines for dual gas and gasoline use, although Iran Khodro, Iran's largest carmaker, and Saipa both produce natural gas vehicles. About 40 percent of the nation's vehicle fleet is now natural gas capable. Still, long-range planning has been uneven, especially as regards filling stations.
A long line of yellow taxis waited in front of the Azadi natural gas station the other day. Peddlers were selling hot lunches, ice cream and nuts to those in line, with a waiting time of two hours minimum.
''Sure it's cheap,'' said Amir Mousavi, 32, who drove a domestically built Peugeot 405. ''But the waiting really puts me off. I usually buy gasoline because its more convenient.''
In a way, the government program is a victim of its own success, Mr. Hajj Hosseini said. ''When the fuel prices rose, many more people started converting their cars, much more than we had foreseen,'' he said. ''Now we have too few natural gas stations in Iran.''
Iran has 1,262 vehicles per refueling station compared with 856 vehicles per refueling station in Pakistan, the No. 2 country in natural gas vehicles, according to a report in The Economist in July, which cited the Gas Vehicle Report, an industry resource.
''The long waits are a real problem for those using natural gas,'' said Reza Zandi, a prominent oil and gas specialist. He faulted poor planning throughout the country's natural gas supply chain.
''It starts with our huge gas projects in the south of Iran -- they are behind schedule,'' he said. ''The building of natural gas stations is behind schedule. And we also lack the know-how to build more efficient engines for our domestically built cars. The situation is relatively good, but should be much better.''
In January, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad conceded that while it was possible to convert many more cars to natural gas, the infrastructure to fuel them was lagging. ''We have to work on a larger scale,'' he said in a speech. ''We need to be ready to serve millions and millions of cars.''
On Tehran's main Enghelab boulevard, which cuts crosstown through the capital, natural gas-powered buses have become common, but perhaps not common enough.
''There still is a lot of pollution,'' said Hamid-Reza Samadian, an information technology student. Cars stood at a near standstill in the afternoon rush hour, pumping out exhaust fumes. ''I guess if we wouldn't have natural gas, the pollution would be much worse,'' he said. ''At least we are coping now.''

HEADLINE: Aging and Expensive, Reactors Face Mothballs

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
THE conventional wisdom about nuclear reactors is that they are expensive to build but cheap to run.
But electricity on the wholesale market is so inexpensive, its price depressed by cheap natural gas, that some reactors may not have enough revenue to justify needed capital expenditures. Experts say that as a result, the nuclear industry may be nearing its first round of retirements since the mid-1990s.
On Monday, Dominion, which is based in Richmond, Va., announced it would close its plant in Kewaunee, Wis., which it had been trying, unsuccessfully, to sell for about a year. It had intended to buy more units in the Midwest and gain efficiencies by operating a fleet there, but found it could not do so. 
When Dominion bought the plant, in 2005, it signed agreements to sell the plant's output at rates reflecting a strong market for electricity. As those agreements expire, with a projection for continued lower prices, it is ''uneconomic for Kewaunee to continue operations,'' the company said.
That could be a harbinger of more closings, but it is not the only trouble sign for the industry.
Some plants, like Indian Point in New York and Vermont Yankee, face determined political challenges to their continued operation. But plain old economics could affect a lot more plants, including Crystal River, north of Tampa on Florida's Gulf Coast, which has not run since September 2009, when it shut down for replacement of major components. The installation job may have damaged the containment building, which may not be worth the $1.3 billion or so it would take to fix.
In New Jersey, Exelon agreed in late 2010 to shut down the Oyster Creek reactor, the nation's oldest operating commercial plant, by 2019 rather than rebuild its cooling system to meet environmental rules. In California, the San Onofre reactors closed in 2012 after apparently flawed new heat exchangers developed leaks.
Even plants with no pressing repair problems are feeling the pinch, especially in places where wholesale prices are set in competitive markets. According to an internal industry document from the Electric Utility Cost Group, for the period 2008 to 2010, maintenance and fuel costs for the one-fourth of the reactor fleet with the highest costs averaged $51.42 per megawatt hour.
That is perilously close to wholesale electricity costs these days.
Bruce E. Biewald, the chief executive of Synapse Energy Economics, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., compared the nuclear plants to old coal plants now facing big capital expenses. The cost of new pollution control equipment has coal companies ''writing off hundreds of millions of dollars right and left,'' he said. Much the same is now true for nuclear plants. ''An asset that might have been worth a couple of billion dollars is now basically worthless,'' he said. And with average costs approximating average revenue, some reactors face higher-than-average costs.
Christopher Crane, the chief executive of Exelon, the nation's largest nuclear operator, said his company's reactors sometimes found themselves selling electricity at hours when the market price was negative, driven below zero by a surplus of wind energy late at night during periods of low demand. In other words, they have to pay when they produce power, instead of being paid. And even during hours of higher demand, prices on the open market are low because of the low price of natural gas. The price of natural gas has to recover for his older nuclear plants to avoid being ''challenged,'' he said.
All but one of the 104 operable reactors in the United States date from the 1980s or earlier, and utilities have broken ground on only four new units in the last few years, two each in Georgia and South Carolina. Investing in an upgrade for an old plant to become more competitive is like replacing the transmission in an old car. The owner has to decide whether there are likely to be enough miles left in the clunker for the investment to be sensible.
And reactor owners are seldom sentimental.
''It's a business,'' said Marvin S. Fertel, president and chief executive of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's main trade association. ''People are going to make good business decisions.''
The hardest plants to operate profitably are the smaller ones that stand alone -- as opposed to those at two- or three-reactor sites -- and are run by an operator with no other assets in the vicinity, according to experts.
The stress comes after a decade of remarkable stability for the nuclear fleet, which, contrary to the expectations of some of its opponents, has shown some signs of prosperous maturity. According to industry statistics, 71 reactors have received permission to operate up to 20 years beyond their initial 40-year operating licenses and the applications of 15 more are under review. Another 17 have announced their intention to seek renewal, leaving only one with unannounced intentions.
In addition, engineers have reanalyzed existing reactors, made some minor adjustments and coaxed another 6,200 megawatts of capacity out of them, equal the output of another six or so reactors. Another 2,700 megawatts of ''uprates'' to increase the maximum power level at which some plants may operate are in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval pipeline. But Mr. Crane said electricity prices were now so low that his company was re-evaluating whether it was still worthwhile to invest more in uprates.
Like high school classmates gathering for a 40th anniversary reunion, the reactor operators can see that they have lost some colleagues along the way, although none lately. Millstone 1, near New London, Conn., was the last reactor to close, in July 1998.
The industry's renewed glimpse of its mortality comes as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is working on the question of whether the existing plants can get a second 20-year extension, to age 80. But license extension may not be the problem. Wider economic circumstances may be instead.

HEADLINE: 6 Are Seeking Council Seat One Man Held for a Decade

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
For better or worse, Larry B. Seabrook was their city councilman for a decade, until he was removed from office after being convicted of fraud in July.
Now, like singles returning to the dating scene, residents of a middle-class swath of the northeast Bronx, which includes Co-op City, are being courted by six candidates vying to fill Mr. Seabrook's seat in a special election.
The candidates include a union organizer, a criminal defense lawyer, a bus company owner, an economic-policy adviser, an Anglican minister and a community center director. 
And though the specter of scandal hangs over the race for the seat, only one of the candidates has criticized Mr. Seabrook.
The Rev. Joseph Nwachukwu, 54, an Anglican minister and city social worker, recently moved to the district and has pledged to bring more transparency to how city money is spent. ''After the Larry Seabrook debacle, people are looking at us as if we don't have integrity,'' he said. ''I will set an example and lead by example.''
However, Andy King Jr., a former community organizer for 1199 SEIU, the health care workers' union, who is seen by some as the front-runner, chose to note Mr. Seabrook's contributions to the district in the past. ''I pray for him and his family now,'' Mr. King said.
The relative silence on Mr. Seabrook's missteps may be as much a reflection of his deep ties to the community as of the political realities in a state where scandal-plagued politicians not only live to run again but in some notable cases have also been returned to office by voters who continued to stand by them.
''I think we're human, and we all make mistakes,'' said Mary W. Taylor, 72, an Eastchester resident who has voted for Mr. Seabrook.
The voting will be on Nov. 6, Election Day. It is a special election because it will fill an unexpired term.
The campaign comes as the Bronx, the city's poorest borough, struggles with crime, unemployment, failing schools and obesity-related illnesses. The district's 171,000 residents -- two-thirds of whom are black -- earn a median household income of $46,229, compared with $34,264 for all of the Bronx, and $50,285 in New York City, according to an analysis by Queens College.
About 35 percent of the district's residents are foreign born. About 30 percent have college or advanced degrees. The district is home to Co-op City, an apartment tower complex with a large concentration of elderly residents that is an important voting base.
JoAnn Best, 61, a mother of four, said residents needed a strong advocate more than ever to deliver jobs and money for education to their corner of the borough. ''I'd like to see a better system for people in need,'' she said.
Many of the Bronx's Democratic leaders, including Assemblyman Carl E. Heastie and Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr., have backed Mr. King, giving him an organizational advantage in the race. Mr. King has also received endorsements from the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, and many labor unions.
Mr. King, 49, ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Seabrook in 2009 and had been planning to run for the seat again. ''Our community needs a great deal of help and leadership,'' said Mr. King, who spent his weekends for years volunteering with a community basketball league and started a mentoring program that seeks to empower local teenagers.
Another candidate, Neville O. Mitchell, an outspoken critic of the Police Department's stop-and-frisk tactics, recently moved back to the district, in which he grew up, to run for office. Mr. Mitchell, 48, a criminal defense lawyer and graduate of the Bronx High School of Science, said he preferred to talk about his record instead of Mr. Seabrook's.
''We should be mindful not to build our political careers by trampling on the demise of someone who did very good things for many people in District 12,'' he said.
There is also Cheryl S. Oliver, 62, a Co-op City resident, who advises Representative Jose E. Serrano on economic development and education and has spent years preparing for her run.
Another candidate, Garth Marchant, 58, owns a bus company and was an assistant commissioner of the city's Department of Youth and Community Development in the late 1990s and is a former trustee of the City University of New York. Pamela A. Johnson, 48, executive director of the Eastchester Heights Community Center, has brought free computer training to poor residents and immigrants and served on community and education boards.
Mr. Seabrook was a mainstay of Bronx politics for nearly three decades, serving in both houses of the State Legislature before he was elected to the City Council in 2001. A federal jury convicted him of a scheme to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in city money to his girlfriend, relatives and friends through a network of nonprofit organizations that he controlled.
''Despite his legal problems, he was popular in the district,'' said George Arzt, a political consultant. He said many voters would be ''surprised that Seabrook's name is not on the ballot, because they're so used to seeing it.''

HEADLINE: Simple but Local, Queens Slots Are Hurting Gambling Meccas

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A casino that opened a year ago at the fading Aqueduct horse racing track in Queens has emerged as the country's highest-grossing slot parlor, helping to reshape the gambling landscape in the Northeast as patrons chose less opulent, more local casinos instead of traditional gambling meccas in Atlantic City and Connecticut.
The casino, Resorts World Casino New York City, generated nearly $630 million in revenue over the last 12 months from electronic slot machines, more than the slots at any of the 12 casinos in Atlantic City or at Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun in Connecticut. The average income from an electronic slot machine is more than $370 a day, compared with $169 for slots on the Strip in Las Vegas.
The success of the casino, the only one in the five boroughs of New York, suggests that no matter how luxurious the accommodations or exciting the entertainment, nothing appeals more to gamblers than a casino that is nearby. More than 5.6 million people live within 10 miles -- a short subway ride or car trip -- of the casino, which expects to see its 10 millionth customer by the end of October. At the same time, the runaway success of the casino is also expected to affect how the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moves ahead with plans to approve more, larger casinos around the state. 
''Convenience and location are the driving factors today,'' said William R. Eadington, director of the University of Nevada's Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming. ''If you put a casino in a high-density population like Queens, you'll do well.''
And others will not. Casino revenues in Atlantic City have dropped 36 percent, from a high of $5.2 billion in 2006 to $3.3 billion last year. Revenues are also down at Connecticut casinos. Last month, Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Conn., the world's largest casino, announced it would lay off another 328 workers, blaming the casino at Aqueduct and a weak economy.
''I used to go to Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods on the fast ferry,'' said Ralph Barbaro, 77, a retired salesman, as he played a slot machine at Resorts World. ''This is very convenient. It takes me 20, 25 minutes to get here from my home on Long Island.''
Genting New York, a subsidiary of the largest gambling company in England and Southeast Asia, opened the casino last fall, with 4,525 electronic slot machines and 475 electronic table games. Genting transformed the aging grandstand at Aqueduct, where racing seldom drew a crowd, into a palace packed with clanging machines, restaurants and gamblers. There are now nine racetrack slot parlors and five tribal casinos in New York.
New York's slot parlors currently pay the highest tax rate in the nation, a total of 60 percent or more, compared with less than 10 percent in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. By law, the bulk of the money, 44 percent or $3.3 billion since 2006, goes to education.
There are similar success stories in other states. Gamblers no longer have to get on a plane or endure a three-hour bus ride to play slot machines and blackjack now that casinos and slot parlors have proliferated across Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. More casinos are on their way in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Maine. ''This trend is really tough on traditional hotel-casinos with 1,000-room hotels,'' Mr. Eadington said. ''They have trouble filling the rooms.''
With the proliferation of casinos and slot parlors, the Connecticut and Atlantic City establishments are not the only ones feeling the pinch of competition. Empire City Casino in Yonkers, until recently the most profitable of New York slot parlors, says it has seen a 15 percent drop in business since Resorts World opened.
The success of Resorts World comes amid a continuing debate about expanding gambling in New York State with larger, more varied casinos than Aqueduct's.
Resorts World's record-setting numbers raise this fundamental question: Will the state take in more or less money from gambling if Governor Cuomo is successful in authorizing as many as seven full-scale casinos -- poker, live table games and entertainment, not just slot machines -- around the state?
Earlier this year, the State Legislature began the process of amending the State Constitution to permit gambling beyond slot machines, which are considered part of the lottery.
State officials and gambling executives say they believe that major resort-casinos, especially one in Manhattan, would be an enormous boon to the economy. Casino proponents say that operators would pay as much as $1 billion for a license in New York City. And some experts contend that resort-casinos employ seven workers for every $1 million gambled, while slot parlors average only three jobs for the same sum.
But the proliferation of local slot parlors and casinos could also be used as an argument against additional casinos, because each one appears to be stealing customers from the others in order to succeed. A full-scale casino in New York City or on Long Island would attract huge crowds, experts say, and almost certainly put a big dent in profits at Yonkers and Aqueduct. ''You may be successful with a commercial casino in New York City, but there's going to be collateral damage,'' said Alan Woinski, president of Gaming USA, which publishes analyses of the gambling industry. ''Everybody thinks casinos print money. Those days are over. The market is becoming saturated.''
State officials contend, however, that gambling is still growing in New York, where revenues jumped to $1.4 billion in the last fiscal year from $875.2 million in 2007. The Aqueduct and Yonkers casinos together generated more than $1.1 billion in revenue in the past year, more than double what Empire City did a year earlier. Officials say they want to balance economic development and tax revenue while avoiding pitfalls of increased competition and tax rate changes.
But Genting, MGM Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and the other gambling companies that want to build full-scale casinos in New York also say they want the tax rate slashed substantially in order to justify building a $2 billion resort-casino.
With a drop in revenue in some slot parlors and a lower tax rate at the full casino, the state could well see a decline in direct revenues to education from the nearly $1 billion a year it currently gets from the slot parlors.
Karim Camara, a state assemblyman from Brooklyn who leads the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic and Asian legislative caucus, said he had ''serious reservations'' about any plan that would reduce education money.
Clyde W. Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, said that the expansion question pitted tax revenue against jobs and economic development. ''Most states have had to choose one or the other,'' he said. ''The states that adopted the resort model have lower tax rates.''
Mr. Woinski, the industry analyst, says that New York may be better off with the status quo.
''They've got the best thing going right now in New York,'' he said, ''with racetracks willing to give up almost 70 percent of revenues.''
