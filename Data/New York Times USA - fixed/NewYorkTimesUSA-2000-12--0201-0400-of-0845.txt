HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
O Little Town Of . . . You Know

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, Pa.

 BODY:
The Central Moravian Church and its lamplit, bowler-capped belfry is a venerated local landmark in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, and never more so than at Christmas.
But when you love a thing too much, you can get careless, and this is where David Griffiths comes in. Mr. Griffiths, 73, a member of the congregation for five years, is also its safety director, a more modest version of the corporate positions he held before he retired. His challenge now is making sure that on Christmas Eve the 200-year-old sanctuary will not be consumed by the flames of 1,000 beeswax candles in the hands of holiday-loving amateurs -- his fellow congregants. 
 Still, he was eager to be hospitable.
"Got some time? I'll show you around."
Mr. Griffiths's brand of easy affability is on display in nearly every store, restaurant and museum here. Bethlehem (pronounced BETH-lum by many natives of the area) has 72,000 citizens, and a couple of days in town could easily persuade you that they all know and even like one another. If that's true, it's because they share the same story, and it's not about steel.
It is Christmastime in Christmas City USA, and for all the economic turmoil this Bethlehem has endured over the years, it is, thankfully, half a world away from its West Bank namesake, a city where tourist buses are scarce, and a careless candle flame is the least of its problems.
Christmas in Bethlehem, Pa., is, believe it or not, still mostly about Christmas. It is Bethlehem's annual birthday party for itself, as well as a celebration of Jesus' birth in a city named expressly to commemorate his historical birthplace.
Yes, you can shop here for Christmas gifts: an enormous seasonal tent village called Christkindlmart sells every imaginable kind of holiday decoration and craft. But it turns out that Bethlehem, 90 miles southeast of Manhattan, is primarily intent on sharing its music, joy and light. Fifth Avenue it's not. The mall it's not. Corny it's not.
From Thanksgiving through the New Year, this city keeps to a nonstop schedule of choral and instrumental concerts, sightseeing tours and ethnic holiday celebrations.
Bethlehem is compact, as cities go, and one whose colonial pride and religious inheritance survived the rise and fall of the giant steel company that for a century appropriated not only its host's name but also, some say, its soul. And while it's true that the Christmas City designation was a Chamber of Commerce promotion that dates from 1937, the designation seems organic, not synthetic.
And so Bethlehem has learned to glow at Christmas in a way it never did when it was a steel town.
 
A Steel Foundation
In its heyday, the Bethlehem Steel plant, stretching five miles along the south bank of the Lehigh River, lighted the sky with the furious flames from its blast furnaces, which drew on the river to help cool the machinery that fabricated guns for battleships and beams for the nation's tallest skyscrapers. It was the second largest steel maker, after United States Steel, and as many as 30,000 men once worked here in hellish heat and deafening clamor. Downsizing began in 1985; the plant closed forever in 1998. Now the 850 employees who remain do their work in ordinary office buildings.
In wintry dusk, the stacks and sheds and rail spurs built by Charles M. Schwab are black hulks along an invisible river, silhouetted by starlight and by the twinkling skeins of lights on bridges, roof lines, trees and in nearly every window in town.
The brightest single light source is atop South Mountain, just above the Lehigh University campus, where the Star of Bethlehem -- 81 feet tall, 53 feet across -- shines year-round, a modern symbol of a modest religious enclave of Moravians, a Protestant denomination from Germany that settled here in 1740.
If there is anyone in the city who doesn't know the story of Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf, the Lutheran nobleman who sheltered and encouraged the Moravians on his estate in Saxony, it's not because it's a secret. Zinzendorf's influence -- not to mention his portrait -- is everywhere to be found, particularly on the city's north bank, where the original settlers encamped and built the homes, the grist mills, the tanneries and the church that sustained them.
It was Zinzendorf, tradition holds, who named the city on Christmas Eve 1741, at the first candlelight communion service in the settlement's first house, now the site of the Hotel Bethlehem, on Main Street.
Choosing the hymn "Jesus, Call Thou Me," Zinzendorf emphasized its second verse:
Not Jerusalem -- lowly Bethlehem
'Twas that gave us Christ to save us,
Not Jerusalem.
The early Moravians of Pennsylvania and those of prior settlements in Georgia and North Carolina were latter-day disciples of the martyr Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake for heresy in 1415. Hus had invited Rome's displeasure after he was ordained to preach at Bethlehem Chapel in Prague and began conducting Mass in Czech instead of Latin.
 
A Refuge From Violence
In the 17th century, the religious and territorial upheavals of the Thirty Years' War pushed the Moravians further underground. By the early 18th century, they resurfaced under the protection and patronage of the wealthy and devout Zinzendorf. The denomination's original name, Unitas Fratrum, or Unity of Brethren, gave way to the more familiar Moravian, named for the province to which many had fled as refugees from sectarian violence.
The Moravians, hard-working pacifists who cherished music and education, came to Pennsylvania to bring Christianity to unaffiliated Germans as well as to indigenous Indians. They also sent missions to the West Indies and later to Africa. Of the 700,000 Moravians worldwide today, 60 percent live in Tanzania and South Africa. Only 60,000 are in the United States.
Behind the cluster of the settlement's original buildings off Church Street is an open tract of land called God's Acre, a burial ground with stones laid flat in neat rows. Side by side, names like Johann Sperbach (1716-1803) and Catharine Justina Pietsch (1785-1833) share ground with baptized Indians such as "Joseph, a Mohican, dep. July 21, 1746." Interred here, too, is another Mohican, named Tshoop, who is believed to be the model for Uncas in James Fenimore Cooper's "Last of the Mohicans."
The city's oldest structure, known as the Gemeinhaus, is one of the Moravians' first, a five-story log house built in 1741 and now covered in clapboard. Its second-floor meeting room served as the first sanctuary.
Today the building is the Moravian Museum of Bethlehem and is open for guided tours. A half-dozen other historic structures, the Sun Inn, the Kemmerer Museum of Decorative Arts and the John S. Goundie House (he was a brewer and early mayor) provide vivid snapshots of the city's younger days.
For those pressed for time, the evening bus tour makes the most sense. A full-size charter bus leaves the Visitors Center on West Broad Street on the hour from 5 to 9 p.m. For $6 you get a complete sense of a colonial village that became a steel city in the late 19th century and lived to tell the tale.
The night I went, the guide was Chris Holub, an insurance man by day, a 19th-century Moravian tour guide by night. Wearing a simple brown-cotton tunic and knee pants, Mr. Holub followed a script carefully timed to juggle traffic, architecture and history, but there was genuine enthusiasm besides.
"One of my ancestors was a man named Solomon Jennings," he said. "He did three important things. Two were good and one was really bad."
Among the good things Jennings did was to carve a trail from Philadelphia to Bethlehem and later operate a rope ferry across the Lehigh River. His ethical downfall, however, proceeded from a swindle known as the walking purchase.
In a property dispute with local Indians, Jennings and his buddies insisted that a long-dead chief had deeded an enormous tract to the settlers based on the distance a man could walk in a day and a half. Unprepared to contest the claim outright, the Indians agreed to a walk-off.
Unknown to them, however, Jennings had hired professional walkers to blaze the trail ahead of time. On the big day, one of the walkers, a professional athlete named Marshall, walked all the way to the Poconos, to a town now called Marshall's Creek.
 
Lighting the Lights
The bus tour meanders through narrow lanes, past the mansions of the steel and railway tycoons, across the river and up the mountain to the Star of Bethlehem. But the lights that count are down below, and not just on the historic north side of the river.
As in most old industrial cities, people arranged themselves by class, and such traditions, bound by economics, die hard. In Bethlehem, particularly during the decades of big steel, the plant workers and those of lesser means lived in South Bethlehem, a separate municipality until the city consolidated in 1918. Southside, as it's now called, was the neighborhood that became home to generations of Irish, Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, Italians and Puerto Ricans who gave their lives to steel so their children might move up to the Northside or out of town entirely.
Although Mexicans, Dominicans and other Latin American immigrants have begun to move in, Southside retains the sense of a spirited, if densely packed, community of strivers. There are 130 churches in Bethlehem, and scores of them are in Southside, every few blocks within walking distance of the old mill: Our Lady of Pompeii, St. Stanislaus, Holy Infancy. And here and there, a small corner saloon. Bethelehem Steel's executives had the Saucon Valley Country Club and its championship golf course; the working man had his own retreat, the Happy Tap, just off Third Street, near the river.
But Southside or Northside, the lights are just as bright. By the 1960's, competing lighting motifs grew particularly garish. Since then, by general municipal agreement, the south strings multicolored lights, a tribute to its diversity, and the north strings white lights.
 
The Single Candle
Still, Bethlehem's most distinctive light is the single candle in each window, in homage to Zinzendorf, for whom a residence -- Lichtenburg, or castle of light -- was built in Germany centuries ago. It is said that during Advent, each of Lichtenburg's windows was lighted to welcome the baby Jesus. The tradition was revived here in the late 1920's by the president of the Moravian Seminary and College for Women, according to "Christmas in Bethlehem," by Vangie Roby Sweitzer, an illustrated history published this year by the Central Moravian Church.
This quiet, centuries-old symbol endures, as does this close-knit Pennsylvania community.
Its mayor, Donald T. Cunningham Jr., 34, became the youngest mayor in the state when he was was elected three years ago. His roots here go back five generations; his father, a grandfather and two great-grandfathers worked at Bethlehem Steel.
"We were luckier than some of the western towns," he said, naming Pittsburgh, Johnstown and McKeesport. "They announced closings in the early 80's, and by the mid-80's they were gone. We had 15 years."
Still, he said, it was hard to balance what is now a $40 million annual budget on a constantly eroding tax base. The slide seems to have ended. Industrial parks dot the landscape. And the old steel mill, which occupies a sixth of Bethlehem's 20 square miles, is in line for renewal as a retail center and satellite museum of the Smithsonian Institution.
"Every community has to have a reason to be proud of itself," Mr. Cunningham said. "For many years it was Bethlehem Steel. But Bethlehem has always managed to be more than just steel. Christmas traditions give our community an identity. After all, I guess Christmas predates Bethlehem Steel."

HEADLINE: U.S. Academic Research

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Dec. 2 letter, commenting on the right of graduate students to unionize at universities, criticized the quality of American academic research. If American research universities produce low-quality research and have minimal economic impact, why are they the envy of the world?
By any measure of success, research universities have significantly increased the knowledge base in science and engineering and the material well-being of our society. What's more, technological advances spawned by our universities -- from the Internet to medical scanners to computer chips -- have fueled the growth of the economy. 
 We acknowledge that conditions for graduate students must be improved. Reasonable people may disagree on whether unionizing will achieve this. But we all should agree on this much: The American system of research universities is without peer.

HEADLINE: Israel's Economic Engine

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Palestinian Economy in Ruins, U.N. Says" (news article, Dec. 6):
Although eventual economic cooperation will lead to a stronger economy for both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Israel's economy remains on an upward trajectory and faces less of an impact from recent events than your article implies. Palestinian workers make up approximately 1 percent of Israel's labor force and work primarily in agriculture and construction. 
 High technology remains the engine of Israel's economic growth, and now accounts for 18 percent of the gross domestic product. (Tourism accounts for only 3 percent.)
High-tech businesses continue to operate at full capacity, and American companies continue to invest in Israel. Most recently, Broadcom announced that it would acquire VisionTech, an Israeli chip manufacturer, for $770 million, and Bear, Stearns just opened its first Israeli investment banking branch in Tel Aviv. These companies understand the long-term value of investing in Israel.

HEADLINE: If It's Funny, You Laugh, But Why?

BYLINE: By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
Plato wanted it tightly regulated in his Republic. Socrates thought it should be used sparingly -- like salt. Pythagoras swore off it entirely and forbid his followers to indulge.
For the ancient Greeks, laughter was serious stuff. Some, like Plato, thought it could incite violence and disrupt the social order. Others, like Aristotle, thought it was what distinguished men from beasts. Such notions may sound, well, laughable to modern ears. But the Greeks' guiding assumption -- there is nothing funny about laughter -- turns out to be thoroughly up to date. 
 History is littered with the sober efforts of learned men to make sense of giggles and guffaws. The question of whether Jesus had ever laughed so consumed medieval Christian scholars that the University of Paris devoted an entire conference to it in the 13th century. (The evidence was apparently inconclusive. On the advice of his religious consultants, Louis IX, who was later canonized, hedged his bets by never chuckling on Fridays.)
The Renaissance brought Hobbes's superiority theory (laughter marks the sudden attainment of power over someone else), which gave way first to Kant's incongruity theory (laughter occurs when perceptions don't conform to logical expectations), and, finally, to Freud's relief theory (laughter releases pent-up nervous energy.)
But the theorizing did not stop there. Today, laughter is a thriving, if not notably jolly, field of study whose members are scattered across the academic spectrum, from literature and history to linguistics and neuroscience.
One prominent venue for specialists is Humor, the academic journal of the International Society for Humor Studies, founded in 1976. A glance at a current issue is sufficient to get a feel for its contributors' general disposition toward their subject matter. Flow charts and regression analysis figure prominently in an article quantifying humorous responses to television ads, while an essay on ethnic humor in the Netherlands features tables quantifying jokes about Turks and Surinamese by unflattering stereotype.
"Humor is hard to study because it's extremely complicated and has so many different manifestations," explained Lawrence Mintz, the journal's editor and a professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland at College Park. "We are not in the business of being funny."
Humor contributors may not be playing for laughs, but most want to understand why certain jokes or situations tend to elicit them. Other laughter scholars, however, aren't really interested in laughter at all. Instead, they look at expressions of humor as a way of understanding broad, high-minded issues like politics, economics and individual identity.
For his new book, "Peals of Laughter: The Culture of Laughers in the 18th Century" (Calmann-Levy), for example, the French historian Antoine de Baecque pored over the minutes of the sessions of the French Constitutional Assembly for the years 1789 to 1791 -- three particularly volatile years of the Revolution. Even though laughter was explicitly forbidden by the Assembly's internal code of conduct, which called for serene and democratic deliberations, de Baecque found 408 recorded incidents of laughter, an average of nearly one every other day. What began in early sessions as collective titters at inept speakers soon gave way to outbursts that cut sharply along partisan lines.
For de Baecque, this was clear evidence that political divisions between the revolutionaries and the royalists were crystallizing. Laughter, he writes, "had become a political weapon among others in the arsenal, an effective weapon that individual parties utilized to distinguish themselves, to attack one another within the assembly."
Politics also plays a role in "The Senses of Humor, Self and Laughter in Modern America" (Cornell University Press), by Daniel Wickberg, a professor at University of Texas at Dallas. In the 1930's, Mr. Wickberg argues, laughter became a trait that distinguished democracies from dictatorships. "How long is it since a laugh has been heard on a public platform in Germany or Soviet Russia?" asked a New York Times editorial in 1939, while the comedian Bob Hope championed humor as a potent weapon for American G.I.s': "Where Hitlerism and fascism and Tojoism have set in, they take with them . . . their sense of humor, and its ready infection is being spread through countries and people they visit."
Joke analyses and cultural histories of humor may tell us any number of things, says Robert Provine, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, but they may not get us any closer to understanding laughter. For that, he argues, only science will do. In his new book "Laughter: A Scientific Investigation" (Viking), Mr. Provine disputes the idea that laughter has much to do with humor -- or with cultural and political fluctuations, for that matter.
After analyzing 1,200 randomly recorded "laughter episodes," Mr. Provine concluded that most laughter is produced by speakers, not listeners, and that it is typically not triggered by witticisms. (Mr. Provine's list of laugh-producing lines wouldn't pass muster with kindergartners.) Moreover, he discovered a gender disparity in laugh rates, with women far surpassing men: the only situation in which a speaker laughed less often than his audience occurred when a man was talking to a woman.
Mr. Provine believes laughter responses may be innate. Women may laugh in the presence of a dominant male, for example. But whatever the explanation, Mr. Provine is convinced that laughter is not under conscious control.
"The key insights into laughter cannot come simply from thinking about it," he said. "Some of the most brilliant people in the history of our species from Plato on have tried to explain it. But laughter is not accessible to reason alone."
On that point, Mr. Provine concurs with Jonathan Swift, the Irish satirist who, 300 years ago, remarked:
What Humor is, not all the Tribe
Of Logick-mongers can describe.

HEADLINE: Polyphony of Howls and Screams

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
To see them arriving in their suits and ties, you might think the 30 men who make up the Mieskuoro Huutajat men's choir are just another polite, stodgy group of yodelers. Then, all of the sudden, they start screaming at you.
Mieskuoro Huutajat (pronounced HOO-tah-yaht), you see, is Finnish for "men's choir shouters," and that's exactly what this group of singers do when they perform: shout traditional songs and national anthems at the top their lungs. 
 And while that might sound as appealing as an evening with the primal scream theorist Arthur Janov, the group has developed a devoted cult in Europe, releasing four albums and touring Germany, France and England. Tomorrow, the group will bring its high-decibel repertory to the United States, with a performance at 7 P.M. at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Bang on a Can marathon.
What's the appeal? Well, while shouting may sound simple -- and grating -- the group's sound is surprisingly textured: howls, whistles, moans and sighs are all part of it, as are a varied set of uptempo rhythms. Add to that the fact that very few of the Huutajat's songs last longer than two minutes, and you have a quirky, if slightly surreal, phenomenon.
The group was formed in 1987 by Petri Sirvio and Antti Penttila, two would-be punk rock stars from the northern Finnish city of Oulu, a city of some 100,000 people 400 miles north of Helsinki. A former pulp-and-paper industrial city, Oulu is best known for its high-tech labs owned by Nokia, the Helsinki-based conglomerate that is the world's biggest manufacturer of cellular phones.
Mr. Sirvio, 38, the group's full-time composer, said the idea for Huutajat came out of combination of boredom and barroom joshing.
"It was half joking, half serious," he said. "We were just making jokes, but these jokes wouldn't leave our mind."
"In Iceland, they say its very traditional to shout against the wind," he continued. "But in our area, the only traditional art form for the voice is the tradition of being quiet."
At first, Mr. Sirvio said, the group was only 18 members strong, a motley collection of lapsed classical musicians, unemployed punk rockers and many with no musical background at all.
"We were talking it up in some popular bars," he said. "They didn't come from church."
After several rehearsals, the group made its debut on Dec. 6, 1987 at a student center at the University of Oulu. In a nod to propriety, they donned black ties -- made of rubber cut from tires -- and wore cheap black suits because "we could afford them." (Nokia was an early sponsor, Mr. Sirvio said, because they "made the tires.")
But it was their choice of material -- anthems and patriotic songs -- that was risky, especially since it was Finland's Independence Day.
"I expected some people will get mad and fight," Mr. Sirvio said. "But the biggest surprise was that everybody liked us."
Since then, the group's popularity has swelled its size, with more than 100 different members cycling through over the last decade. Typical of the group's singers, who rehearse weekly year round and are paid only a small stipend when touring, is Marko Pyhahuhta.
Mr. Pyhahuhta, 30, is a graduate student who said he joined Huutajat in 1995 as "a type of therapy."
"I have," he said quietly, "a lot of excess energy."
The group now has more than 40 songs in its repertory. Mr. Sirvio usually cuts an anthem's text down to a few phrases, which are then chanted, screamed and yelled.
The group's version of "The Star-Spangled Banner," for instance, consists of a repeated chorus of "Say can you see, oh! Say can you see, oh!" punctuated by the sound of falling bombs and a sung coda of "Our flag was still there."
A live recording of this song ends, as many of Huutajat's do, with the sound of applause and a laughing audience.
Indeed, said Mr. Sirvio, the original idea of Huutajat -- as a serious lark -- is still there.
"It's really just a bunch of guys with the same attitude and same sense of humor," he said. "And I have the privilege once a week to have 30 guys scream at me."

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobs Report Is Another Indication of a Slowing Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
American businesses continued to increase their work forces last month, but at a slower rate than in the first half of the year, offering another sign that the United States economy has cooled yet is not approaching a recession.
The unemployment rate remained roughly flat in November, rising to 4 percent from 3.9 percent in October, according to the government's monthly jobs report. The rate has now remained between 3.9 percent and 4.1 percent for 14 consecutive months, reflecting the tightest labor market since 1970. 
 The report -- which also showed workweeks becoming shorter -- comes on top of recent declines in the stock market, consumer confidence and the growth of business investment. Together, the data portray an economy that has moved into a new stage of its decade-long expansion, buffeted by a weak manufacturing sector but sustained by resilient service industries.
"The economy is softening, but there is nothing in this report that suggests it is collapsing," said William C. Dudley, the chief domestic economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The employment numbers added to a sense among economists and investors that the Federal Reserve would probably cut interest rates, in an effort to encourage spending, sometime in the coming months. The major stock indexes all rose yesterday, with technology stocks leading the way and helping the Nasdaq composite index to jump 164.77 points, or 6 percent, to close at 2,917.43.
Still, the employment report provided clear evidence that economic growth has slowed, and analysts -- from Wall Street economists to Fed governors -- say the speed of the change has caught them by surprise.
The number of workers who wanted full-time work but settled for a part-time job rose sharply in November. Almost 3.5 million workers -- 280,000 more than in October -- either had their hours curtailed or accepted a part-time job because they could not find a full-time one, according to the government's survey of households. Since July, that measure has risen 13 percent.
Over all, the average workweek for nonsupervisory employees in the private sector fell slightly, to 34.3 hours from 34.4 hours in October. It has now been below 35.5 for five consecutive months, after spending all of 1998 and 1999 at or above that level.
Nearly all of the decline has occurred in the industrial sector of the economy. In November, the average workweeks in the construction and manufacturing industries dropped to their lowest levels since 1997.
"Manufacturers are still cutting back employment to boost productivity in the face of enormous global competition," said Edward Yardeni, the chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
With the nation's labor markets remaining tight, many companies are reacting to the slowdown by reducing employees' hours, rather than laying off workers who might be difficult to rehire later, economists say.
But manufacturing and construction companies are not adding workers, either. Employment in those sectors also remained flat for the second consecutive month in November. By contrast, service businesses, many of which are immune to foreign competition, continued to add people to their staffs. Retail payrolls grew by 46,000 in November, hospitals added 15,000 jobs and restaurants added 17,000.
In total, 131.9 million Americans held jobs last month, an increase of 94,000 from October, according to the government's survey of businesses. Federal and local governments dragged the number down, as schools and the United States Postal Service both hired fewer people than had been expected.
Private employment -- seen as a more reliable gauge of the economy -- rose by 148,000, which was above its average of 122,000 since July. But the average remains much lower than it was during the prior 18 months, when businesses added almost 200,000 jobs a month.
The hiring binge has kept the unemployment rate low even as many new people have entered the work force. Wages, in turn, have risen, growing 0.4 percent last month, a faster rate than earlier in the year.
That increase often translates into a robust raise for workers -- and causes executives to worry about inflation -- but the decline in working hours helped keep paychecks nearly the same as they had been in October. In November, average weekly earnings for nonsupervisory employees increased 0.1 percent, to $478.
The continuing decline in the price of imports has also helped assuage executives' concerns about inflation, said Lakshman Achuthan, the managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a research group in New York. As a result, most analysts expect the Fed to lower interest rates soon, despite the low unemployment.
Economists also note that the government's monthly jobs report measures where the economy has been, rather than predicting where it is going. Many forward-looking indicators are drawing a more pessimistic picture of economic activity.
The University of Michigan said yesterday that its consumer confidence index, compiled from surveys, had fallen 9 percent between November and mid-December. On Thursday, a Gallup poll showed that for the first time since 1996 more people think the economy is worsening than believe it is improving.
If meteorologists are correct, and this winter is colder than recent ones have been, the current moderate level of pessimism could grow worse, Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs said. During harsh winters, heating bills rise, while new construction projects and discretionary shopping trips fall off.

HEADLINE: Cuba Threatens to Cut Off Phone Service to the States

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
In a season when Cubans traditionally reach out to one other across the Florida Straits, the Cuban government announced today that it would cut off phone service with the United States next week unless American phone companies paid a new 10 percent tax.
President Fidel Castro of Cuba first announced the surcharge in October after Congress approved antiterrorism legislation that would use frozen Cuban assets in the United States to compensate relatives of anti-Castro exiles killed in 1996. The men were killed in a Cuban attack on two planes flown by exiles into Cuban airspace. 
 Cuba today set a deadline of Dec. 15, saying the tax bills were coming due.
The Clinton administration has forbidden American carriers from paying the surcharge, which would add 24 cents a minute to rates that experts say are already among the highest in the world.
Such a unilateral increase is not allowed under a seven-year-old deal between the countries that renewed direct phone links and set terms for splitting the profits from calls, administration officials argue.
"It is unfortunate that while the world continues to open up to the people of Cuba, the Cuban government is threatening to deny Cuban citizens the ability to talk with family members," said Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman.
Cutting off phone service would have personal and political implications. For hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles, mostly based in South Florida, direct phone links in recent years have helped restore family ties that were severed by the cold war. Telephone service, moreover, has been a cornerstone of the administration's efforts to build bridges among ordinary citizens, beyond the reach of Cuban government control.
Exile groups said Mr. Castro's ultimatum amounted to extortion.
"Just as we are entering this holiday season, he is prepared to summarily cut what has become a vital emotional link between Cuban families to avoid facing up to his culpability in the death of U.S. citizens," said Dennis Hays, executive vice president of the Cuban American National Foundation, the leading exile lobby.
Cuban officials countered that they were merely seeking to recoup money that rightfully belong to the Cuban state. The antiterrorism law, which offered relief to Americans with claims against such nations as Iran and Libya, authorized using Cuban money held in escrow by the Treasury Department -- valued at more than $120 million -- to pay damages to relatives of the exile pilots killed four years ago.
The families are to receive at least $50 million plus interest, and possibly as much as $37 million more, depending on final court rulings.
Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, said the airmen, members of the Miami exile group Brothers to the Rescue, were provocateurs and were shot down by Cuban fighters after flying into Cuban airspace. The new American law rewards acts of terrorism, he contended.
"It's going to encourage people to do more of that kind of thing, because they know they will be supported by the U.S. government," Mr. Fernandez said.
Cuba will rescind the new phone tax once it has offset the money lost from its escrow account, he said.
"As soon as we recover all these funds to compensate the families," Mr. Fernandez said, "the tax will disappear."
Callers across the Florida Straits racked up 135 million minutes on the phone in 1998, according to the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a office based in New York that advises American businesses about Cuba. Although 90 percent of the calls originated in the United States, the profits were split evenly, between American carriers and the Cuban phone company, known by the acronym Etecsa.
Etecsa received $86 million that year from the American companies.
The American phone carriers are caught in the middle. The half-dozen firms that provide service to Cuba have been barred by the administration from paying the tax. And Cuba has said it will not allow the companies to route calls through third countries and pay the tax from abroad.
A spokesman for AT&T, one of the main carriers to Cuba, said his company had not paid the tax and was waiting for further guidance from the administration.
Enrique Lopez, a telecommunications consultant with AKL Group International in Miami, said Cuba's tax, if paid, would provide Havana an additional $42 million a year. Even without the surcharge, phone calls to Cuba -- with rates up to $1.20 a minute -- are among the most expensive in the world, he said.
"That's pretty aggressive stuff," said Mr. Lopez, who made clear that he did not think the Castro government was bluffing. "They will definitely pull the cord and make it very difficult and frustrating."

HEADLINE: John Liscio, 51, Bond Newsletter Publisher

 BODY:
John Liscio, who wrote and published The Liscio Report, a financial newsletter, died on Nov. 29 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 51 and lived in Upper Montclair, N.J.
The cause was liver and kidney failure related to hepatitis C, said his wife, Frances. 
 Mr. Liscio, whose motto was "To trust is good, not to trust is better," founded his influential bond market newsletter in 1992 after working briefly as a senior editor of U.S. News & World Report. In the late 1980's and early 90's, he was on the staff of the financial weekly Barron's.
In October, Barron's said that Mr. Liscio had made a success of himself on his own, writing for the last eight years The Liscio Report, "an astute and irreverent look at the credit markets and economy."
Mr. Liscio told Barron's at that time: "I don't try to forecast. I don't think forecasting is something within the realm of human possibility." But he had made a reputation for himself by forecasting the recession in the early 1990's.
He was born in Manhattan, graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx and received a bachelor's degree from Fordham University.
After serving in the Marine Corps, he began working as a financial writer and analyst in the late 1970's.
Surviving are his wife of 14 years, Frances Pelzman Liscio, who is a humor writer; a daughter, Laura, 11; a son, Gregory, 9; his parents, Armand and Josephine Liscio of Delray Beach, Fla.; and a sister, Jeanette Kamciyan of Boca Raton, Fla.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Shares Rally as Intel Rises, Before Latest Electoral Twist

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Technology stocks shot higher yesterday after investors witnessed a surprising performance in Intel and received some good news on the economy, and Wall Street, for a time, seemed confident that the presidential election stalemate might soon be over.
But just as the stock market closed, investors began bracing for even more uncertainty about the election's outcome. 
 Vice President Al Gore won a major victory when the Florida Supreme Court ruled 4 to 3 that thousands of disputed ballots should be counted by hand. If that decision stands, Mr. Gore could win Florida and the election. But the Florida Legislature is expected to step in to appoint presidential electors who support Gov. George W. Bush.
Faced with a renewal of the protracted election battle, the initial reaction of investors was negative. In after-hours trading, the futures contract on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plunged 47 points, or 3.4 percent.
Earlier, the actual S.& P. 500 ended trading up 26.34 points, or 2 percent, to 1,369.89. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,712.91. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was by far the biggest winner, jumping 164.77 points, or 6 percent, to 2,917.43.
Technology stocks were led higher in part by Intel, the world's largest chip maker, which buoyed spirits early by rallying despite its warning late Thursday that its fourth-quarter sales would be lower than expected. Intel gained $1.69, to close at $34.
Intel's rebound against its own warning could be a sign that investors have already discounted most of the bad news from the technology sector. But it could also be a result of the fact that analysts had already warned of a sales shortfall ahead of Intel's announcement after the close of the market Thursday.
"The bad news is in the stock, and the rest of the market is getting a boost from that," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. "I think it is saying that these stocks have reached a fundamental value."
Other technology stocks joined the surge, including Cisco Systems, up $2.44, to $52.38; JDS Uniphase, up $6.50, to $73.50; and Oracle, up $1.75, to $30.06. Even Microsoft, which declined Thursday after its earnings prospects were downgraded by Goldman, Sachs, managed to climb, rising $1.31, to $54.44.
The government, meanwhile, reported that job growth moderated in November but did not slow to a pace that indicated the economy was abruptly decelerating.
The Labor Department said 94,000 new nonfarm jobs were created. While that was less than the 140,000 expected, much of the difference was because of a drop in government employment. Private-sector jobs rose by 148,000. The unemployment rate edged up to 4 percent from 3.9 percent in October.
"These are soft-landing numbers thus far," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset Management. "These numbers are not pointing to a recession."
In the bond market, yields rose and prices, which move in the opposite direction, fell until 4 p.m. as some investors put their money in stocks and others may have taken profits after a sharp three-day rally.
But after the Florida Supreme Court issued its decision just after 4 p.m., the bond market reversed itself, wiping out most of its losses. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 5.30 percent as the price inched up 1/32, to 102 13/32. The yield had been up to 5.34 percent before the court announcement. The yield on the 30-year bond inched up to only 5.51 percent from 5.50 percent.
In the background yesterday, the stock market benefited from two other positives. One was the signal on Tuesday from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who indicated that the central bank was ready to reduce short-term interest rates if the economy slowed drastically. For many investors, this means the economy is more likely to experience a soft landing rather than a recession.
The second, until the Florida Supreme Court decision, was that the uncertainty about the presidential election appeared to be near its end. Shortly after 2:15 p.m., it was announced that Democrats had lost their challenge to absentee ballots in two Florida counties. If the Democrats had won and these ballots were invalidated, the election could have swung in favor of Mr. Gore.
And technology stocks may be reaching a bottom. Mr. Cripps said Motorola was a good example of how much some of those issues have been beaten down. Motorola announced before the market opened Thursday that its fourth-quarter revenue and earnings would fall short of forecasts. The indication of its opening stock price was $16, the lowest price for Motorola relative to its sales and earnings since the recession of 1990-1991, Mr. Cripps said.
Motorola rebounded some yesterday, wiping out its losses of the last week, by climbing $1.06, to $18.75.
Mr. Cripps said the driving force behind stocks was changing from momentum investing to value investing. But he warned that investors were becoming risk averse, and that "is not good for technology stocks."

HEADLINE: After Summer of Power Woes, California Is Hurting Again

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 8

 BODY:
It was not supposed to be like this.
Families asked to turn off their Christmas lights. Businesses required to shut down for hours for days on end. Utility executives demanding relief from the governor, warning that the state's electrical system is on the verge of collapse. 
 After California's summer electricity troubles passed with the hot weather, most executives and state officials thought they had bought a year's time to find a solution to the energy problems. But despite a mild winter here so far, the state is again in the midst of a crisis so severe it was forced to take unprecedented measures on Thursday to avoid running out of power. And if this week's electricity shortage continues, Californians soon could be asked to darken their homes if rolling hourlong blackouts are instituted across the state as a last resort.
For most energy experts it is an unheard of situation given that air conditioners, a culprit last summer, are largely idle in the winter.
"People are in a heap of trouble," said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which owns its own power generation operations and is not likely to be affected like other large cities. "This shouldn't happen this time of year."
But an unusually large number of the state's power generators were shut down for maintenance or to comply with air quality standards. On some days, as much as one-third of the electricity the state needed during the peak wintertime hours of 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. was not available, energy officials said. As such, the California Independent System Operator, which manages the electricity system for 75 percent of the state, had to pay as much as four times more to import it than what it might have paid a California producer.
To make matters worse, wholesale natural gas prices are up as much as 10-fold over this time last year. With a cold front expected across the West this weekend, that means consumers not only run the risk of seeing their lights dimmed, but also sticker shock when they see their gas bills.
"I fear what will happen when these bills start to arrive," said Stephen L. Baum, chairman of energy services company Sempra Energy.
Mr. Baum said customers, including those served by Sempra's subsidiary, San Diego Gas and Electric, are likely to see rates double.
Of course, no one foresaw such a predicament four years ago, when California, the world's seventh-largest economy, decided to deregulate its electric industry. Then electricity reserves in the state were running as high as 30 percent, industry executives estimate. Most people believed that competition would lower prices for consumers and businesses alike. But now reserves are running dangerously low -- as little as 1.5 percent daily -- causing concern for utilities and politicians alike.
State officials, for their part, are trying to get to the bottom of why so many power plants are idled now. Air quality regulators today eased up on restrictions for some power plants to help provide much-needed electricity. But late Tuesday evening, representatives from the Public Utilities Commission showed up unannounced at several shut-down power plants, spanning the state from Oxnard, near Santa Barbara, to Shasta County in the north. There, said Loretta Lynch, president of the commission, they interviewed executives, examined machinery and reviewed maintenance logs to verify that indeed the plants were shut down for the reasons they gave.
Not everyone has welcomed the commission. Some power generators refused to let them in, Ms. Lynch said, although now they have all complied with the commission's requests. A report on the commission's finding could come next week, she added. But consumer advocates wonder if the commission visits will really yield any useful information.
"What are they looking for?" asked Douglas Heller, of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "Seeing if they have an oil can out?"
The electricity mess in California has become a public relations nightmare for Gov. Gray Davis. On Tuesday, for instance, hours before he was set to flip the switch on the lights for the state's Christmas tree, industry executives said the Independent System Operator was scrambling to find more than 1,000 megawatts of electricity it was short that day. One megawatt is enough to serve about 1,000 homes. The system operator squeaked by at the last minute, the energy executives said, paying more than $1,000 per megawatt for electricity imported from the Pacific Northwest. By contrast, the price cap for electricity bought in California is usually $250 per megawatt. As such, Mr. Davis gave a brief speech, flipped the switch, then turned the lights off after 25 minutes.
Ms. Lynch insisted in an interview on Thursday that there was no emergency. She was seated in a dark San Francisco office then, she said, the only light glowing from a computer screen, because the state had required employees to turn off their lights to conserve energy.
"We have the power," Ms. Lynch said, noting that the state's power generators can generate 44,000 megawatts of electricity. But she agreed that something must be done to understand why one-quarter of that amount -- about 11,000 megawatts -- is unable to be tapped because the generators are not up and running. "From my perspective, people want a magic pill and they aren't going to get it," she added.
The federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to announce on Wednesday what steps it is willing to take to help California.
Despite Ms. Lynch's assurances, nerves are frayed. "I'm getting tired of people saying we have plenty of energy when we don't have it," said Terry Winter, chief executive of the independent operator.
Take Thursday night, when the operator was forced to announce a final-stage emergency that gave the state the authority to call for statewide rolling blackouts, the first time in California's history. At 3 p.m. a power generator went off-line for difficulties resulting in the loss of 500 megawatts of electricity.
That caused the emergency, Mr. Winter said. "That is how close we are to the margin."

HEADLINE: Pataki Signs Law Enabling City to Finance Tower for Stock Exchange

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation yesterday enabling the city to finance a long-stalled plan to build a major 50-story trading complex and office tower for the New York Stock Exchange in the city's financial district.
And two years after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans for the heavily subsidized project, city officials once again said that they were close to signing a nonbinding agreement with the New York Exchange for the trading complex across the street from its historic home on Wall Street. The 10-story trading complex, with the 1.3-million-square-foot office tower on top of it, would be on a block bounded by Wall, Broad and William Streets and Exchange Place. 
 Despite the sudden flurry of activity, the project still faces mounting costs and doubts about its viability. Unable to find a developer willing to build the tower without a major office tenant, the Giuliani administration is hoping that it can develop some momentum over the next year by buying the property and demolishing the existing office buildings on the site. That, they said, should make the project more tangible and help lure a tenant, whose rent is intended to offset the costs.
But real estate executives said that it may be harder to find a tenant as more office space becomes available downtown and the rent required for the proposed tower soars. At the same time, the estimated cost of buying the land and building the trading complex has jumped to about $960 million, from $700 million two years ago. The city would provide $905 million in tax breaks, and the state $160 million.
Real estate executives and some urban planners are now saying the project has become too costly and may be unnecessary given the advent of electronic trading, although the stock exchange maintains that it has outgrown its space and needs a new trading complex to remain the capital of world finance.
"A lot of very smart people have spent a lot of time on this project," said Douglas Durst, a developer whose family owns seven million square feet of office space in Manhattan. "But I'm afraid that it's no longer a case of build it and they will come, but build it and you'll lose it."
Michael Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, did not return calls requesting comment.
According to people involved in the project, the city had hoped that the stock exchange would finally sign a letter of intent at its board meeting on Thursday and that the Empire State Development Corporation would approve the environmental impact statement for the project at its Dec. 13 board meeting. But it was not to be, although, they added, there were no major issues separating the two sides.
Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, would say only, "We're continuing to work on it." But the continual delays have cast a cloud over the project.
"There's no buzz anywhere that this is a viable project," said one person who has worked on the proposal from the the beginning.
The legislation signed by the governor, however, would allow the city to issue bonds for the project and permit the state to condemn the development site. "The state is honoring its commitment to keep the exchange downtown," said Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "It's now up to the stock exchange to decide when it wants to move forward."
Alice Meaker, director of Good Jobs New York, an advocacy group supported by private foundations and unions, said, "This is the costliest deal in state history, and it may also be the most dubious.
"It's the most lucrative industry in New York. If corporate welfare were means-tested the same way family welfare is, Wall Street wouldn't qualify for subsidies."
Two years ago, Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the New York Exchange, threatened to move to New Jersey if the city could not help it expand outside its 97-year-old home on Wall Street. Fearing the dissolution of the financial district, Mr. Giuliani announced a tentative agreement in December 1998 to build a $400 million complex and provide $160 million in tax breaks. The stock exchange, in turn, would pay $10 million a year in rent and invest $350 million in new equipment and technology.
But negotiations with the stock exchange have gone slowly ever since, as the project has grown more expensive. The estimated cost of the land is now as high as $450 million. The cost of the trading complex is now set at $535 million, with $225 million coming from the state, $255 million from the city and $55 million from the stock exchange. But instead of two 50,000-square-foot trading floors, there are now plans for only one, with some expansion space.
"It's smaller than what we talked about on Day 1," Mr. Pellecchia said, "but it's still very significant."
Three weeks ago, the stock exchange opened a new computerized 8,000-square-foot trading floor at 30 Broad Street that handles about 15 percent of its trading volume.
In any event, the city has had little luck in luring tenants like Goldman, Sachs and the American International Group to the tower. Last summer, the city asked four major developers if they would be interested in building the project and owning the office tower. But no one was willing to meet the stock exchange's prime condition: to finish it by 2005, with or without a tenant.
Many brokers said that corporations might find the security measures and street closings imposed by the stock exchange unappealing and the rents prohibitive.
Three real estate executives who have talked with city officials say that the tower itself would cost over $500 million, requiring rents of about $65 a square foot -- Midtown prices at a downtown location. (Downtown rents on average are $20 a square foot less.)
And while there was little vacant space a year ago, the proposed tower would be competing with some large blocks of space coming on the market at 55 Water Street, 60 Wall Street and elsewhere. In addition, the city is selling a development site at Greenwich and Warren Streets, and early next year, the state plans to sell a large site at Battery Park City.
"The original rationale for the project has been gradually eroded," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "There has been a resurgence of real estate in Lower Manhattan. And the exchange has already deployed new technology by opening a satellite facility."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a new law that lets New York City finance a trading complex and office tower for the New York Stock Exchange misstated the proposed subsidies. The $905 million figure was for cash from city and state (not city tax breaks) and the $160 million was for tax breaks from city and state (not just the state).

 THE THIRD REICH
 A New History.
 By Michael Burleigh.
 Illustrated. 965 pp. New York:
 Hill & Wang. $40. 
 Forty years ago the American journalist William S. Shirer published "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich." The book became an instant best seller -- notwithstanding its emphasis on foreign policy and military conquest -- and an entire generation of college students plowed through at least some of its 1,400 pages.
Since then there have been any number of Hitler biographies and histories of the Third Reich. Now, with "The Third Reich: A New History," Michael Burleigh successfully adds another interpretation, one that, as he puts it, tells a "very 20th-century story" about the "almost total, moral collapse of an advanced industrial society at the heart of Europe" and about "sections of the German elites and masses of ordinary people" who "chose to abdicate their individual critical faculties in favor of a politics based on faith, hope, hatred and sentimental collective self-regard for their own race and nation."
The subtitle's promise of "a new history" is no mere sales ploy. Burleigh, who is currently the William R. Kenan visiting professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia, is well regarded as a scholar, the author of several studies on Nazi racism and mass murder. Here he makes good use of an important advantage he holds over such major biographers of Hitler as Joachim Fest and Ian Kershaw. Whereas they took the life of an individual as their point of departure and constant return, Burleigh is freer to pick and choose his central arguments.
Still, this is not a comprehensive history of the Third Reich, a synthesis of all that we have learned about the Nazi dictatorship since Shirer. There are significant aspects of National Socialism that go unmentioned -- for instance, the Nazi economy and the daily life of ordinary Germans. Burleigh believes that if we are to understand this period of German history, the focus must be on police terror, racism, forced sterilization, euthanasia and industrialized mass murder. Why examine Nazi kultur, if this was in essence a barbaric unkultur?
Burleigh's choice of themes is determined by his overall understanding of Nazism. He sees it as both a totalitarian system and a political religion. With his emphasis on the concept of totalitarianism, he places himself in a long line of scholars, which includes Hannah Arendt and Jacob Talmon, who have studied European fascism, and Nazism as its most radical version, within an explicitly comparative framework. In their view, Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany were modern terroristic dictatorships that were basically (though not entirely) alike, and in any case quite different from Mussolini's Italy or Franco's Spain.
The drawback to this approach is that Burleigh is under pressure to remind the reader at regular intervals of the similarities between Nazism and Communism, but his comparisons amount to no more than very brief references to the Soviet Union. The benefit of his adherence to a theory that sees affinities between the two totalitarian systems is that it enables him to counter a widespread view in the English-speaking world that all Germans were enthusiastic Nazis. In the Third Reich, as he makes clear in a chapter entitled " 'Miss Becker, Your Head Is at Stake, Your Head Is Wobbling,' "Nazi terror from above and the demise of the rule of law started just a few days after Hitler's assumption of power in January 1933. Thenceforth the penalties of opposition became higher and higher. In the first nine months alone, at least 100,000 people, most of them leftist Germans, were thrown into hastily erected concentration camps. Others ended up in ordinary prisons and many died. Countless more were roughed up by rampaging brownshirts in broad daylight or taken into police custody on trumped-up political charges. By 1936, a brutal police state had penetrated virtually all spheres of life.
Among the victims of the first hours of Nazi rule were Germany's Jews. But again, in his quest to draw a nuanced picture, Burleigh shies away from broad generalizations about "the Germans." He stresses that contemporary reports tell many different stories about the level of German anti-Semitism. Above all, his descriptions of the regime's early criminality provide him with the setting for the violence that makes up the central chapters of this book.
Burleigh's analysis is divided into accounts of Nazi barbarism against the domestic population in peacetime and against both foreign and domestic populations during the war. He offers the most comprehensive account to date of how tens of thousands of men and women were forcibly sterilized before the war, how further tens of thousands became victims of a program designed to murder the mentally and physically handicapped, the infirm and the "asocials" (a vague category into which all those who did not conform to Nazi social norms could be fitted). Burleigh is also very good at describing the progressively deteriorating position of Jews and other minorities.
His story gets ever more unsettling as he moves into the war period and examines the mass murder of Jews and Polish elites, and the crazed plans for the resettlement of millions of people. Drawing on the latest research on the genesis of the Holocaust, he offers an illuminating analysis of highly dynamic decision-making processes at the top and at the level of provincial administrators and SS leaders. Here the book challenges Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, who explained the "final solution" in terms of what he called an "eliminationist anti-Semitism" of ordinary Germans. Time and again Burleigh presents other voices and urges us to listen to them, even if they were those of a minority -- islands of humanity in a sea of bloodshed and indifference.
Perhaps the greatest value of this book lies in how it brings together the many jigsaw pieces that produced the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities. While the murder of Europe's Jews outside the Soviet Union proceeded at specially built camps with methods first tested on the handicapped before the war, the SS Einsatzgruppen and their auxiliaries shot Soviet Jews individually in "Jew hunts," searching for them in the smallest hut and hamlet. At the same time, some four million Soviet Army P.O.W.'s were either executed at the point of capture or deliberately left to die in makeshift open-air camps. Further millions of civilians fell victim to antipartisan swoops and reprisal killings. The reader will put this "new history" down feeling mentally exhausted, emotionally drained and depressed at realizing what human beings are capable of doing to totally innocent fellow human beings.
In trying to explain these unnerving events Burleigh argues that Nazism was a "political religion," a "Hitler cult" that by promising a biologically fixed utopia drove its followers to horrific extremes. The pseudoreligious fanaticism with which Hitler, Himmler and the other perpetrators pursued their enormous crimes to the bitter end is certainly staggering. Nor can there be any doubt that Nazism appealed to millions of Germans because it promised not merely prosperity but greatness, even salvation.
At the same time this study contains plenty of evidence of outright cynicism, "intentional chaos," technocratic rationality, opportunism and crudely calculating manipulation that partly undermines the author's cult hypothesis. What may have looked like utter confusion was in fact a cunningly orchestrated program, one that was able to mobilize such groups as Germany's elites, who were not simply delirious with religious hope and hatred. Other more specialized works, like Frank Bajohr's study of the city of Hamburg, have shown that the amount of nepotism and cold-blooded corruption under the Third Reich was just incredible.
But throughout, Burleigh demonstrates a subtle feel for the particulars, those gray zones of life where wrenching human dilemmas confronted those who cheered and served Hitler as well as those who resisted him. By explicitly shifting away from a focus on anonymous structures, by examining individual action and responsibility so powerfully, Burleigh leaves a reader wondering if it was really necessary for him to put so much emphasis on his totalitarianism and religious cult theories. The cumulative effect of the stories he tells over 900 pages is in itself overwhelming enough.

 PERPETUATING POWER
 How Mexican Presidents Were Chosen.
 By Jorge G. Castaneda.
 Translated by Padraic Arthur Smithies.
 248 pp. New York:
 The New Press. $26. 
 Jorge G. Casta--eda, who has been named Mexico's foreign minister by President Vicente Fox Quesada, was a familiar figure to those Americans who follow Mexico even before his recent appointment. Because he is both quick of wit and bilingual, he is often sought by American journalists, especially television correspondents, for a pithy phrase to elucidate the latest crisis. For some years now, through his columns in Newsweek and several newspapers, and through the courses he teaches at New York University, Castaneda has been a leading interpreter of Mexico's politics to confounded observers beyond its borders.
"Perpetuating Power," however, makes it clear that Castaneda is more than a master of the Mexican sound bite. With this unusually revealing explication of the inner workings of three decades of presidential succession, Castaneda establishes himself as one of the most insightful Mexican intellectuals of his generation.
Several years ago, Castaneda set out to write a systematic anthropology of the pivotal ritual of Mexican politics -- the handover of power from one omnipotent president to the next -- based on personal accounts from those best prepared to provide the raw data: the four living ex-presidents, Luis Echeverria, Jose Lopez Portillo, Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
In itself the idea was a breakthrough. Theater, ruse and mystery were always key components of el sistema, as Mexicans called the all-embracing single-party state that began its domination in the 1920's. To cite the most obvious example, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, staged elaborate presidential elections every six years, even though the next president had already been chosen by the incumbent. That choice (known as the dedazo, the finger tap) took place in hushed tones behind closed palace doors, in a rite that was always portrayed as too sacred and subtle to be exposed to scrutiny by the common citizen.
Castaneda has pierced through that scrim, and even though he has been a sassy opponent of the PRI regime, he got the interviews he needed. The book consists of essays analyzing each succession since 1970, followed by transcribed talks with the former presidents.
Castaneda's timing is part of the brilliance of his book. It was published in Mexico before the presidential election last July 2, when, after years of popular ferment, Mexicans were finally allowed an open and clean vote. They chose Vicente Fox, an opposition leader, ousting the PRI regime after 71 years in power. The dedazo will never be employed again. Castaneda took his group portrait in the final twilight, when the PRI system was still full of its old arrogance.
Twentieth-century Mexico has long been a conundrum. On the one hand, the PRI was the most stable regime in Latin America, providing continuity and economic growth while other countries struggled with revolution or dictatorship. But the PRI also subjected Mexicans to spectacularly venal, arbitrary and sometimes violent government. How, then, did it keep itself in power?
Castaneda helps resolve the puzzle. The "nearly magical clockwork" by which each president settled on the one to follow him was fully understood only by a handful of top PRI politicians trained in years of service in the temples of government. The game held together because it was limited to a small core of competitors who accepted the rules since the prize -- the right to rule like a king -- was so alluring.
At the same time, Castaneda shows how the selection process was based increasingly on the personal idiosyncrasies, ambitions, fears and tactical skills of the incumbent and the candidates to be his candidate -- based, in short, on anything but a consideration of the best policy path for Mexico. In 1970, Luis Echeverria perceived that President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz would instinctively reject any official who attempted a dialogue with the opposition, then severely weakened by the 1968 massacre of student protesters in Tlatelolco Plaza. Echeverria, the highest cabinet official, conspicuously avoided any talks, winning the tap for himself and leaving Mexico with scars that have not healed to this day.
Similarly, at least twice the favor of the sitting president was won by contenders who concealed crucial information about the decline of the economy. Castaneda tells how Carlos Salinas annihilated an opponent who made the mistake of being candid with President de la Madrid about looming economic perils, which did in fact materialize after Salinas became the candidate.
The selection process had myriad unwritten codes, some curious, many perverse. Most dangerous, betrayal was integral to the drama. The president, who needed to conserve his own power by keeping the competition alive as long as possible, had to deceive with false encouragement the two or three contenders he did not intend to tap.
Castaneda draws a distinction between those successions in which the president acted by choice and others where he had no choice he liked and acted instead by elimination. But either way, the dedazo generated jealousies and bitterness that built up within the system.
Knowing that the intermingling of personal and political was important in the closed PRI regime, Castaneda offers rich stories of romantic dalliance and political swordplay. While each presidential interview provides new material, the most expansive is with Lopez Portillo, who acknowledges that the greatest of political decisions was often made by factors with "the weight of a hair."
When it was first released in Mexico, Castaneda's book caused a sensation as Mexicans scrambled to get a look inside the inner sanctum of power. In Padraic Arthur Smithies's translation, "Perpetuating Power" is shorter by about half than the original. To make it more accessible to non-Mexicans, the entire manuscript was pruned and the explanatory essays were placed before the interviews. Still, even the translated version is not for beginners. It relies on countless references to Mexican events and politicians with no introductory detail.
Castaneda was an early supporter of Vicente Fox from the left. Now the president and his foreign minister must face the challenge laid out in this book. They must prove that electoral democracy can control and channel the "furor and delirium" of Mexican politics, as Castaneda puts it, more effectively than the PRI.

 Eastward to Tartary
 Travels in the Balkans,
 the Middle East, and the Caucasus.
 By Robert D. Kaplan.
 364 pp. New York:
 Random House. $26.95. 
 Robert D. Kaplan would like to show you the world -- from Plovdiv, Bulgaria, to Tbilisi, Georgia, and beyond. He will shuttle you across the Caspian Sea, from Baku to Turkmenbashi, on a squalid freighter where beautiful women in old nightgowns carry "shopping bags full of evil-smelling food." There is just about no place Kaplan, a prolific travel writer and political journalist, hasn't visited. Erudite and intrepid, with a pantheon of elite contacts all over the world, he is a deft guide to wherever he chooses to lead you.
But "Eastward to Tartary" is not only an account of Kaplan's travels in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus. It is also a revealing study of what Kaplan frequently calls the "new Silk Roads" now winding through formerly closed lands. Caspian oil, Kaplan predicts, and the pipelines that will funnel it to the West, are about to wreak enormous changes in this part of the world, already shattered by the fall of the Soviet Union. "What the Balkans were to the 1990's," Kaplan writes, "the Caspian region might be to the first decade of the new century: an explosive region that draws in the Great Powers."
But be forewarned: Kaplan is not a disinterested guide. He is a realist, on the model of Henry Kissinger. Self-interest and power politics govern affairs of state, Kaplan admonishes, and it's for the best that they do: "Self-interest at its healthiest implicitly recognizes the self-interest of others, and therein lies the possibility of compromise. A rigid moral position admits few compromises." Consistent with this view is Kaplan's contention that authoritarian regimes are often preferable to weak democracies. In the countries he visits, Kaplan claims, "civil society will likely be introduced only by force and Machiavellian tactics." If we want to see Western ideals, not to mention vital American interests, protected in these regions, he maintains, we must be prepared to exercise a strong economic and military hand.
Inevitably, this outlook raises disturbing moral questions: How can competing self-interests in, say, the Middle East be reconciled without considerations of principle and justice? Why recommend for others a form of government we would find unacceptable for ourselves? And Kaplan never explains what would compel authoritarian governments to undermine themselves by building democratic institutions. The hard-nosed realism with which he regards fledgling democracies seems to soften when he considers the motives of dictators or the negotiability of power, blood, lust and greed. Elections, he rightly notes, have brought nationalist demagogues to power in places like Bosnia. But so have military coups, civil wars, foreign interventions and other nondemocratic means. True, democracies abroad could produce leaders, and politics, we dislike. But this is perhaps the single worst reason to oppose them.
Despite Kaplan's avowed commitment to realist precepts, "Eastward to Tartary" often seems animated by a more troubling view of the world. Something Kaplan calls "national character" plays a significant role in his analysis. The notion of collective national identity is, he recognizes, unpopular among intellectuals. "However, a viewpoint is not necessarily inaccurate because it happens to be morally risky and pessimistic," he says, "especially if it helps explain phenomena that are otherwise unexplainable."
But national identity turns out to be an exceedingly weak explanatory tool. Kaplan relays in all seriousness the following comment from one of his contacts: "In Georgia, a civil war was necessary because of the kind of people we are. The real cause of the war is our medievalness."
His depiction of Stalin as an "Oriental" despot "from the Caucasus mountains, where Russia ends and the Near East begins," is equally fatuous: "To say that the Oriental influence was merely incidental to his character is to ignore its essentials. The monumental use of terror, the very grandeur of his personality cult and the use of prison labor for gigantic public works projects echo the ancient Assyrian and Mesopotamian tyrannies."
Soviet totalitarianism did not originate with Stalin's Oriental character. Nor were its means unique to the East -- Kaplan's description applies equally to that very Western tyrant Adolf Hitler. To be sure, in "Balkan Ghosts," an earlier work from 1993, Kaplan blamed Yugoslavia for Hitler: "Nazism, for instance, can claim Balkan origins. Among the flophouses of Vienna, a breeding ground of ethnic resentments close to the southern Slavic world, Hitler learned how to hate so infectiously."
"Eastward to Tartary" is in part a sequel to "Balkan Ghosts." With its acknowledged debt to Rebecca West, "Balkan Ghosts" was a prime example of the genre that scholars of the region call "Balkanism": the Western traveler ventures across the frontier of what he or she considers civilization, and finds in the Balkans a land of animal passions, mysticism, violence and sensuality. "The Balkans" is a name not for a peninsula in southeast Europe but for Enlightened Europe's id unleashed -- primitive, repellent, titillating. "This was a time-capsule world: a dim stage upon which people raged, spilled blood, experienced visions and ecstasies," Kaplan wrote in 1993.
"Eastward to Tartary" is a more sophisticated work than "Balkan Ghosts." Kaplan has matured as a stylist and as a political analyst, but he can still describe Turkish political parties as "chieftaincies" and rhapsodize about the "pagan mystery" and "dusky sensuality" underlying Eastern Orthodoxy. East and West are not compass directions for him but categories freighted with imaginative significance. Thus, downtown Budapest is in the West, but its impoverished outskirts lie in the East; Georgia is largely in the East, but its oil terminal and capital city are outposts of the West; rural Azerbaijan is in the East, but its capital, Baku, is "a little piece of Europe"; and Armenia, despite its geographical location, is in the Balkans. The result is a frustratingly fragmented picture, with a West that cannot have produced Hitler and an East that cannot include rationality or cosmopolitanism.
Such suprageographical divisions recall the work of Samuel P. Huntington, the Harvard political theorist who published a famous article, "The Clash of Civilizations?," in Foreign Affairs in 1993, and turned that article into the book "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order" a few years later. Both Huntington and Kaplan see in the map of the ancient world a set of tectonic plates that move beneath the current one, causing its quakes and upheavals and ultimately determining its fate. For Kaplan, this perspective leads to the impression that history moves backward. As he tells one contact in Lebanon, "Middle East politics are like those of the ancient world -- a Greek or a Roman could understand them better than an American." Envisioning the collapse of Syria and Georgia, new alliances formed along commerce routes, the end of the bipolar Arab-Israeli conflict and the birth of "more complex systems of strife," Kaplan characteristically remarks, "It would be like ancient times."
There is a romantic appeal to this picture of history unfurling in reverse, but it unduly minimizes the significance of recent events. The 20th century has, after all, produced more than its own share of bloodshed and conquest. Even in the Balkans, so famously obsessed with ancient history, it is the living memory of World War II that has been recapitulated and manipulated to most malign effect. The rise and fall of empires, the eddies that carry cultural influences across the globe and back again, the contemporary distribution of power and resources among nations, the changing world order outside of Europe, the rise of United States power -- all these things make for a world not cleaved along archaic frontiers but shaped by infinitely complex and layered relationships.
Kaplan's parsing and splitting between the East and the West, as well as his heavy-handed invocation of the distant past, do a disservice to his considerable knowledge of ancient history and his acute observations of the troubles ahead. For he tends to boil away much of the world's subtlety and complexity -- its capacity to be at once sensual and sophisticated, vicious and civilized, shaped by the distant and the recent past, by history but also by politics, by self-interest but also by principle. To integrate all of this into a coherent whole is the great challenge. Should Kaplan attempt it, he might show us a more realistic world than "Eastward to Tartary," for all its discernment, evokes.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 12-10-00: Economics of: Fuel-Cell Cars;
Ulterior Motors

BYLINE: By Alec Appelbaum 

 BODY:

The collapse of the climate talks in the Netherlands last month isn't likely to impede the development of easy-on-the-environment cars in this country. California is still requiring that 10 percent of the cars sold there be emission free by 2003, and Massachusetts and New York are adopting similar laws. All the big automakers are promising to sell so-called fuel-cell cars by 2004, but should we have to wait even that long? After all, fuel-cell technology -- which harnesses the energy released when hydrogen is combined with oxygen from the air (water instead of carbon dioxide is the byproduct) -- has been around for more than 150 years. Last month, both Ford and DaimlerChrysler showed off prototype cars powered by environment-friendly hydrogen. We could use those now: Americans are responsible for the release of more than two tons of vehicle-produced greenhouse gases a year per person. Bringing cleaner cars to the marketplace, however, has been fraught with obstacles.
 
THE CELL
Department of Energy studies indicate fuel cells today would cost $141 per kilowatt. (A kilowatt will boil a quart of cool water in six minutes; a 75-kilowatt car engine is roughly the equal of a 100-horsepower engine.) But the car industry believes fuel-cell engines won't compete with conventional ones until they cost less than $50 a kilowatt; Directed Technologies, a consulting company, expects that fuel-cell systems will eventually cost $37 a kilowatt. Paul Lancaster, vice president for finance for the Canadian fuel-cell maker Ballard Power Systems, says his company could compete economically with conventional engines at that price if it sold enough fuel cells yearly to power the equivalent of 300,000 cars. 

THE FUEL
Ford says it can mass-produce hydrogen cars once 10,000 natural-gas-reforming pumps -- at $250,000 to $1.5 million each -- are installed at filling stations around the country. (The National Renewable Energy Laboratory is testing ways to extract hydrogen from algae, but natural gas is more viable for now.) Gasoline can be converted to hydrogen fuel inside individual cars, but this means costly additions to the fuel-cell system (and carbon emissions). An Energy Department study has concluded that producing hydrogen for fuel-cell use today would cost the equivalent of $1.92 per gallon.
 
THE CHICKEN (CELL) AND THE EGG (FUEL)
Which must come first? Inspiration may, in fact, come from an extravehicular source. International Fuel Cells says around 35 fuel-cell systems a year are sold to power buildings (200 total so far); those generating electricity for the Conde Nast building in Times Square and the First National Bank of Omaha's data center are the most visible. According to Jae Edmonds, an economist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, "piping around hydrogen becomes much more plausible" as more big buildings deploy the technology. Another way to speed up the merger of fuel cells and cars: make the cars use less fuel. Amory Lovins, a physicist and designer, founded Hypercar Inc. to build light cars from carbon fiber, which he says would yield fuel efficiency many times greater than that of steel cars; Zoltek, one of two big American suppliers, aims to sell carbon fiber for $5 per pound next year, which could make it competitive with steel. Many admire Lovins's ingenuity, if not his business instincts: picture the lawyers after the first accident. -- Alec Appelbaum

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Holmdel, N.J.;
Grazing Cattle and a Growing Population

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
BEEF cattle graze in a pasture across Crawfords Corner Road from the Holmdel, N.J., municipal complex, just a quarter mile from sprawling million-dollar custom homes. About one-third open space, including 2,000 acres of farmland, this 17.9-square-mile Monmouth County community has excellent schools and easy access to New York City via the Garden State Parkway.
It also is home to one of the most prestigious performing arts centers in the state, the PNC Bank Arts Center, formerly the Garden State Arts Center, and to Lucent Technologies, the former Bell Laboratories. 
 "The problem is that everyone wants to move here," Mayor Gary D. Aumiller said. "If we are not careful, development will take over our open space that people move here for."
Mayor Aumiller, like many other Holmdel residents, is concerned about the rapid growth in population, from 11,000 in 1990 to about 15,500 today. Nowhere is that growth felt more than in the 3,400-student Holmdel public school system, which completed a $19.5 million expansion in 1998 and is already overcrowded again, compared to other areas of the state. Class size from prekindergarten to sixth grade averages 23, and in grades 7 to 12 the average is 25, compared with a state average of 21.
"We are still growing by 4 percent per year," said Dr. Leigh S. Byron, the superintendent of schools. "We have appointed a committee of politicians, school officials, parents and senior citizens to help us decide how to meet the challenge of growth. We will have to either expand the schools again or build another school."
Mayor Aumiller defines his administration's mission as "controlled growth" after the 1990's, which saw the development of 900 town houses and hundreds of new homes on half-acre lots in the northern section, near the Hazlet line. The town council has opposed efforts by developers to have the sewer system, which serves only the northern third of the township, extended south.
This has allowed the township to enforce 2 1/2-acre zoning for the construction of new housing in the southern part and has complicated the already rigorous review processes for new subdivision applications. The net result is that approvals for new construction projects often take two years or more.
"There's not a year when we are not sued by developers," the mayor said. "If we allowed sewers in the south, we would be unable to defend our zoning, and the developers would force us to open large tracts to much more housing."
At the same time as it tries to restrict development, the township is raising money for the purchase of open space through a special property tax of 2.5 cents per $100 of assessed valuation.
At the end of November, 70 single-family homes were listed for sale on the Multiple Listing Service. Prices ranged from $161,900 for a small three-bedroom, one-bath colonial on Bethany Road in the northern section, to $1,750,000 for a five-bedroom, six-bath contemporary with a four-car garage on Arbor Lane in the southern section. "Priced correctly, a house here will sell within three weeks," said Claude Ranieri, broker-owner of Re/Max American Reality Associates.
Typically, 1,500-square-foot, three-bedroom split-levels, bilevels and ranches on a half acre or less on streets like Crescent Road or Miller Avenue in the northern section sell for from $230,000 to $325,000, Mr. Ranieri said. Fifteen-year-old four-bedroom colonials on half- to one-acre lots in the northern section start at about $380,000 and go as high as $840,000.
Among the more prestigious streets is Takolusa Drive, in the northeastern section. Built in the 1980's in a variety of custom styles, some of the homes were originally sold with new Mercedes automobiles in their garages. Four homes are currently listed for sale on Takolusa, ranging from $799,000 to $1.3 million.
THERE are five town-house developments, all in the sewered northern section. The largest is the Orchard, a 347-unit community built in the early 1990's off Laurel Avenue and Route 35. Two-bedroom units in the Orchards recently sold for from $205,000 to $225,000, with three-bedrooms going for about $15,000 more.
The few rental units in town are mainly town houses. Typically, two-bedrooms rent for between $1,800 and $2,000 a month, with three-bedrooms going for about $250 more.
Among the newer residents are Frank P. Covino, his wife, Jean M. Covino, and their two children, Adam, 8, and Chelsea, 2. The Covinos, who own a chain of college bookstores, moved to Holmdel two years ago for the school system, Mr. Covino said. They bought a 16-year-old four-bedroom colonial on one acre on Red Coach Lane in the northern section.
"Although we are very happy with the community and the way families are involved in their children's sporting events," Mr. Covino said, "we had no idea that the school population would explode so quickly. Had we known that, we might have reconsidered our choice."
Just down the road from the Covinos is an example of the town's growth. Ground has just been broken on a new development called Highgate, which has approval for 117 homes. "Since these won't be small homes, figure three children per household and you see the problem," Mr. Covino said.
Despite Holmdel's current growth, it was actually a late bloomer. The first European settlers arrived in the late 17th century, according to Linda Madge, president of the Holmdel Historical Society. The brothers Obadiah and Jonathan Holmes, who were sons of a famous Connecticut Baptist minister, also named Obadiah Holmes, began farming in the area.
Other early settlers included an Englishman, Richard Stout, and a Dutch captain, John Bowne, an ancestor of President Abraham Lincoln. Originally called Baptistown, it adopted the name Holmdel in 1857 to open a post office. Baptistown was already the name of a municipality in northern New Jersey.
Holmdel remained a sleepy farming community until the early 1960's, when the American Telephone & Telegraph Company acquired a 400-acre tract and started building its Bell Labs research facility on the site. That complex, off Crawfords Corner Road, was spun off from AT&T as Lucent Technologies and now includes about two million square feet of floor space and employs nearly 5,000 people.
"Bell Labs started our population growth and established the character of the town," said Mayor Aumiller, who moved to Holmdel as a Bell Labs scientist. "Until the 1980's, scientists were the predominant population group. But now we also have many Wall Street people and professionals -- doctors and lawyers."
Holmdel's commercial activity is mainly on New Jersey Route 35, which has a series of strip malls, and in the Holmdel Town Center, which has approximately 30 stores, including the township's only supermarket and four restaurants. Among the best-known stores on the highway is Dearborn Farms, situated in an old red barn. It sells fruits, vegetables and plants.
Holmdel has four public schools -- Village (kindergarten through second grade), Indian Hill (third through sixth grade), William R. Satz (seventh and eighth grade) and Holmdel High School. The main beneficiary of the recent expansion was Indian Hill, which added a wing that included a gymnasium, science laboratories and 34 rooms.
Dr. Byron, the schools superintendent, said that despite the overcrowding the school system provides "quality education that mirrors the best private schools." The high school's College Board scores, a combined mathematics and verbal average of 1,176, are 160 points above the state average. Last year, 97 percent of Holmdel High School's 210-student graduating class went on to higher education. The high school offers 11 advanced placement courses in the sciences, English, economics, computers, history and government.
The school system emphasizes technology, with computers introduced in prekindergarten classes. Much of the technology is provided by local organizations, which infuse about a quarter million dollars a year into the system for extras not included in the school budget. The largest of these organizations, the Holmdel Foundation for Economic Excellence, has raised $100,000 in each of the last three years for computers and science equipment, and mini-grants of up to $1,500 each for special projects.
HOLMDEL has two Roman Catholic schools, both coeducational -- St. John Vianney High School for ninth through 12th grades, and St. Benedict School for kindergarten through eighth grade.
Holmdel has six municipal parks, the largest of which is the 30-acre Crossfarms Park off Longstreet Road. It has three baseball diamonds, two soccer fields and one football field. Also in the township is Holmdel Park, a 343-acre Monmouth County park, Holmdel Park, which includes playgrounds, a sledding hill, nature trails, fishing and skating ponds, an arboretum and Longstreet Farm, a working 1890's farm.
Perhaps the most outstanding recreational facility in Holmdel is the PNC Bank Arts Center, which was built by the Garden State Parkway Authority and is at Exit 114 of the parkway. A world-class concert and entertainment center, the facility is now holding its Holiday Light Spectacular, which includes 130 displays and more than a million lights spread over a two-mile driving trail.
The center also has the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the Vietnam Era Educational Center. The memorial consists of 366 granite slabs, one for each day, including Feb. 29, arranged in a 200-foot circle. It lists the 1,553 state residents killed or missing in action in Vietnam.

The two shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics for helping validate the Big Bang creation theory. The horn antenna is still standing on Lucent property and is now a national historic landmark.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Sills's Queens At Last Reclaim Their Thrones

BYLINE: By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH 

 BODY:
IN the office of the chairman of Lincoln Center hangs a whimsical yet imposing memento of its occupant's former life. A queen-size quilt, three panels wide by five panels high, hand-stitched by the women of the San Diego Opera Guild (their own names sewn into the back), it depicts highlights from the career of Beverly Sills, America's most scintillating diva of the last half-century. The faces of the characters she played are bisque china. The dresses are cut from snippets of her own original costumes. And at the center of the assembly -- circled by the likes of Handel's Cleopatra, Bellini's Norma, Massenet's Manon, Lehar's Merry Widow and Douglas Moore's Baby Doe -- stand Donizetti's three Tudor queens.
On top, Gloriana herself: Elizabeth as aging icon, from "Roberto Devereux." Next down, Elizabeth's mother, the hapless Anne Boleyn, or Anna Bolena. And at the bottom, Elizabeth's seditious Mary, Queen of Scots, or Mary Stuart, best known to those who learn their history at the opera house as Maria Stuarda. A quarter-century ago, they ruled across the plaza at the New York City Opera. Right now, in a boxed CD reissue by Deutsche Grammophon (289 465 967-2; seven CD's), they rule the Billboard charts and bask in a straight five-star approval rating from the customer-reviewers of Amazon.com. 
 Informally, the works in which the three queens appear -- "Anna Bolena" (1830), "Maria Stuarda" (1835) and "Roberto Devereux" (1837) -- have come to be known as Donizetti's "Tudor trilogy," a coinage that gained currency three decades ago, as Ms. Sills took them on, in reverse chronological order, at the City Opera. In fact, the composer conceived them independently, to librettos by different authors, and introduced them in three different theaters, in Milan and Naples.
Elizabeth, the prima donna of "Roberto Devereux," is the seconda donna of "Maria Stuarda," so the "trilogy" required different sopranos in that part, defying conventional continuity. And truth to tell, the operas' structural similarities (collapsing emotional triangles, a backdrop of courtiers hanging around for fatal decisions being made offstage) make them less than optimal companion pieces.
Never mind. As everyone recognized from the start of the project, Ms. Sills was making history in her own right. Her Elizabeth -- chalked visage a masterpiece of maquillage, gown 55 pounds of artfully draped and ornamented upholstery velvet -- made the cover of Time.
The notion of linking the three operas had been as much an economy measure as an artistic statement, allowing big corners to be cut on decor and wardrobe. The productions, in tautly theatrical period style, were "devised and directed" by Tito Capobianco with crucial assistance from his wife, Gigi Capobianco. The sets were Ming Cho Lee's, the costumes (perhaps a mite overdressy and literal to current tastes) by Jose Va rona. Julius Rudel, then the general director of the City Opera, conducted "Devereux" and "Bolena," passing the baton to Charles Wilson for "Stuarda."
On both sides of the footlights, the air was electric. In the first "Devereux," Ms. Sills slapped Placido Domingo so hard, his mustache came unstuck and reattached itself under his eye. (Luckily, his back was to the audience.) At the end of one "Stuarda," as Mary's head lay on the block under the raised ax of the executioner, a woman's voice from the house pierced the tense silence with a cry, "No, no!" As the climax to the whole affair, Ms. Sills tackled all three operas not only within a single season (a schedule devised to boost subscription sales) but also within a single week.
Not surprisingly, the excitement created demand for recordings, and the triptych was duly taped in London, beginning with "Devereux" in 1969. The others followed at two-year intervals. This was deep in the LP era -- and unfortunately, for any who hoped for the Sills queens' timely reappearance at the advent of the CD, the label was Audio Treasury, a minor subsidiary of ABC that was subsequently absorbed into other corporations indifferent to the concerns of the classical market. Sprung from limbo, the recordings now take their place of honor alongside BMG's reissue of Ms. Sills's classic RCA Victor "Julius Caesar," EMI's studio versions of her "Traviata" and "Manon" from the 70's (still in the CD catalog after a dozen years), and, from VAI, a live "Tales of Hoffmann" from New Orleans, a souvenir of the diva's glory years of the late 60's, with Ms. Sills singing the four heroines in one night.
"I'll never be one of those women who goes home and plays her records," she said recently at her desk at Lincoln Center. "Some of them, I haven't even heard. I finally listened to 'Manon,' which I like. I haven't listened to these three ladies. But I'm glad they're there. In the end, that's all that's left of a career."
By her own account, Ms. Sills at first felt no great itch to play Elizabeth. Only a nine-page letter from her coach Roland Gagnon -- which she kept for years in her "Deve reux" score (one of the few she has not given away) -- persuaded her to take another look. And what captured her imagination when she did was not the music but a couple of lines of text: "Pria d'offender chi nascea del tremendo ottavo Enrico,/ Scender vivo nel sepolcro tu dovevi, o traditor" ("Before insulting the scion of the awe-striking Henry VIII,/ Better, o traitor, you had descended living to the tomb").
"I couldn't wait to turn around and deliver that line," she says. "It's like shooting off a cannon."
That her slender, silvery, chimelike voice in no way resembled a cannon did not trouble her. "The voice didn't matter," she says. "What mattered was what Elizabeth was saying." This from an artist who always regretted her limited possibilities in Verdi: "It isn't that I couldn't have sung the notes. But to hear the 'Miserere' in 'Il Trovatore' in my voice would have disappointed me, so what would the point have been in that?"
And here lies the crux of the spellbinding threefold achievement documented in the long-awaited reissue. From the point of view of vocal stereotype -- a point of view surely not altogether irrelevant to the composer's intentions -- Ms. Sills was strange casting for the "Devereux" Elizabeth. The aged monarch's proud, fierce yet vulnerable personality seems at crucial points to imply a bitter, smoldering timbre, more complex than the shimmering, clear-water purity Ms. Sills displayed on the heights. That her soprano lacked force in the middle and lower registers, turning gray and approaching speech, might also have given her pause.
Who knows? Had she heard, for instance, the coruscating Turkish diva and Donizetti champion Leyla Gencer in the part -- as an interested listener can do today in Gala's budget recording live from Naples in 1964 -- she might have backed off completely. But for all intents and purposes, Ms. Sills was inscribing a blank page. The flurry of interest in neglected Donizetti that began sweeping Europe in the late 50's (the "Anna Bolena" of Maria Callas at La Scala in 1957 is also germane) took place beyond her ken and that of her audiences.
"My sound did not disappoint me in the part," Ms. Sills now says of Elizabeth. "I didn't have an enormous, heavy orchestra to ride over. It didn't occur to me that the music required a voice different from mine, and I don't think that it did."
Encountering (or re-encountering) Ms. Sills's three queens on disc feels like meeting them for the first time, and the diva is right: the voice, as such, did not matter. She could weight lines by sheer phrasing, rather than by tone, investing descending lines with the inexorable pull of gravity itself. The passage that first attracted her makes the perfect test case, lying as it does in the heart of the diva's parched midregister. But as noted, the orchestra is on good behavior, underpinning the vocal line first with plucked chords and then with long legato lines that hum with drama but present the singer with no significant competition.
Ms. Gencer's reading here, delivered with the pulsing, full-blooded heft of the Verdian she was, has a mournful pathos. Ms. Sills, by contrast, lands each word -- and Donizetti has her repeat the most frightening of them over and over -- like a deliberate plunge of a dagger, twisting it again in every wound. Toward the end her cold fury spends itself in fleeting grief. The last word -- "traditor" ("traitor") -- comes forth in a gulping tone that sounds exhausted and destroyed.
Ms. Sills has said that she always resisted "normal," "standard" interpretations of her characters. Her social-climbing chambermaid Adele, in "Die Fledermaus," a role she assumed late in her career, drank a little: a Carol Burnett-worthy choice dictated by Ms. Sill's stature, figure, years and personality, none of them compatible with the simperings of the conventional soubrette.
But deep down, she was never an artist who played her roles as extensions of herself (as many of today's most exciting artists do), nor one who went prowling for "angles." With every resource at her disposal -- pose, gesture and costume no less than words, notes and phrases -- she probed for the palpable reality of the women she played. She steeped herself in the history of the Tudor queens. Though she was scarcely above showing off her brilliant technique, her musical embellishments had to stand the test of dramatic expressivity. Trills -- and hers were perfection -- might be comic or tragic, bedazzled or bereft. An interpolated high D in the final act of "Deve reux" -- omitted in the recording at the insistence of the conductor, Charles Mackerras -- was never, in Ms. Sills's mind, a high note for the sake of a high note.
"At this point, Elizabeth is a frail, dying woman," she says. "Toward the end of her life, she was afraid to lie down, because she thought she would die if she did. So she sat up until she dropped. As long as I could sing the high D piano and not belt it out, it was right to do it. I didn't want audiences to say, 'Look, she's singing a high D.' That was not the point. It had to be a plaintive wail." The note is heard on VAI's video of a performance at Wolf Trap in 1975, by which time the heights had become effortful, but the dramatic integrity of the choice is not in doubt.
The three-queens set is full of such epiphanies. No doubt the most tremendous occurs in Mary's great confrontation with Elizabeth, from whom Mary hopes to gain a royal pardon. But Elizabeth's taunts sting Mary's pride, and she responds in kind, throwing Elizabeth's questionable legitimacy in her face, luxuriating in suicidal satisfaction. As Anna Bolena, Ms. Sills twists, sometimes piteously, sometimes hysterically, on a hook of the deceitful character's own contriving, and if the overall effort falls short of the other two, the fault lies with the ramshackle construction of the drama.
Much remains to say of the recordings, but we must be brief. Of the City Opera casts, not one other principal survived. Mr. Domingo, contractually unavailable for "Deve reux," was very honorably replaced by Robert Ilosfalvy, a Hungarian whose mature and manly sound makes a telling contrast to the honeyed lyricism of the Welshman Stuart Burrows in the (lesser) tenor leads of the other operas.
In "Devereux," Beverly Wolff, taking over as Sara, Duchess of Nottingham, from Susan Marsee, painted a poignant figure in rich and golden tones. Spelling Pauline Tinsley, the Elizabeth of the "Stuarda" recording is none other than Eileen Farrell, whose only other major recording of a complete opera was as Marie in "Wozzeck," and while her doubling of Italian consonants is strictly hit or miss, the authority of the voice and the presence are like a force of nature. Anna Bolena's reluctant nemesis, Giovanna (Jane) Seymour -- another of Ms. Marsee's City Opera roles -- fell to Shirley Verrett, blending impulsive passion with her characteristic aristocratic finesse.
THE principal male role as yet unmentioned is the distant, disenchanted Henry VIII of "Anna Bolena," originally Robert Hale but in the recording Paul Plishka, his hauteur seldom tempered by any audible stirring of the heart.
As noted, "Devereux" was recorded in 1969, a year in advance of the City Opera production. Ms. Sills notes that for dramatic veracity, the stage version stripped away much of the bel canto embellishment heard on disc. The orchestra was the Royal Philharmonic. "Stuarda," with the London Philharmonic, was led by Aldo Ceccato (1971). Mr. Rudel, leading the London Symphony, finally got his chance with "Bolena" (1973). Each opera involved a different London chorus.
A final note. When Ms. Sills segued (literally overnight) from City Opera house diva to general manager, she did her best to keep the three queens in the active repertory. In 1980, she cast Olivia Stapp as Anna Bolena; in 1981, Ashley Putnam appeared as Maria Stuarda: valiant attempts that failed to establish an accepted line of succession. Then, in 1985, came the devastating fire at the costume warehouse that threatened to put the City Opera out of business. Replacing the costly Tudor wardrobe was out of the question.
"If it hadn't been for the fire," Ms. Sills says today, "I probably would have brought 'Devereux' back." As luck would have it, her three costumes for the opera were out on a tour -- "in Romania somewhere," she says -- and so survived. But really, who was at hand to wear them? No hand-me-downs for Lauren Flanigan when, several administrations later, the City Opera at last gave "Devereux" a second chance with the new production that opened the current season. Even so, the new Elizabeth could not escape Ms. Sills's long shadow.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Arranging to Capture Ambiguous Moments

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
SOME people are resigned to the way things are and some are not. Some artists are resigned to the limitations of their craft, some even delight in them; some do not. Many photographers do not. Resignation does not fit well in their pockets.
All of them know that their medium is irrevocably tied to the here and now: the here of material existence before the lens, and the now of the discrete moment when the shutter opens. Cameras are obviously ill equipped to handle matters of pure intellect, philosophy or conjecture, the past, the future or extended time. Some photographers simply consider these facts a challenge. 
 Graciela Iturbide, the Mexican photographer, is like that. Sometimes she uses her camera to register the discrete moment when the world sends a message that interests her; at other times, she rearranges the world to great advantage. "Images of the Spirit: Photographs by Graciela Iturbide," a fine exhibition of more than 100 black-and-white photographs at the Parrish Art Museum here, makes clear her preference for elusive circumstances that are hard to extract from life in a fraction of a second.
She finds ways to photograph transitions, ambiguities and inferences, as in images of transvestites who present themselves as women and seem so for a moment. She works with states of becoming and of vanishing, such as a woman playing a piano in a cemetery while totally veiled in mist as if she were a ghost, or a man whose upper body has turned to a mere swipe of gray, as if a region of shadows were progressively taking him over. Ms. Iturbide also puts a high value on events and enterprises that read as metaphor and symbol, like a commercial slaughter of a goat that she captions "Lamb of God."
The show, which is on view through Jan. 7, was organized by the Alfred Stieglitz Center at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and is accompanied by a book of 81 images published by Aperture. It will travel to Santa Fe, N.M., and Austin, Tex., next year.
Ms. Iturbide, born in 1942, was already married and the mother of three children when she decided to be a film director. She switched to still photography after a course with Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Mexico's first modernist master, and she worked as his assistant for a year and a half. His influence is palpable in her lighting, in occasional compositions and in a general tenor of sweet, melancholy poetry, but she is far more committed to staged tableaus and symbolic gesture than he, and her voice is her own.
She depicts (and sometimes enlarges on) a country in constant transition, where old and new exist side by side and reformulate themselves as they go. Sometimes these shifts are simply generational (and probably inexorable). In "Matron," a woman sits in some splendor, wearing a traditional dress embroidered with flowers, a pleated flounce at the hem of her long skirt, while two women behind her arrange her hair. At the side of the picture, a boy in a Spider-Man T-shirt and paper party hat casually aims a toy pistol.
Such apparently incompatible elements frequently keep company in these photographs. Indian and folk traditions share space with contemporary pop while the mythic goes head to head with the commonplace and life with death. As for death, reverent or mocking or frightening or angry or resigned or cynical or admonitory reminders of it recur all over Mexico and turn up again and again in Ms. Iturbide's work. She quotes Jean Cocteau: "The only way to conquer death is through photography." (How fitting that Cocteau, master of Surrealism, should locate the solution to the insoluble problem of being human in a flat copy of life, a representation for those who can still draw breath to contemplate while waiting to die themselves.) Ms. Iturbide trains the instrument that kills death on the celebrations of its existence.
A procession where the women are masked as young beauties and the men as gruesome, smiling skeletons and dagger-toothed devils looks like an Ensor painting transferred to the street. The European tale of Death and the Maiden, compelling to artists from Hans Baldung Grien in the 16th century to Edvard Munch in the 19th -- gripping to Schubert, too -- evidently made its way to Mexico.
A photograph called "Death Bride" compresses the two figures into one, the fiction come to photographic life. A woman in a bridal gown, one arm extended to the side as if to offer shelter under her long veil, stares blackly at us through the socket holes of a death's head. In "House of Death," people on the street pass by a mural of a skeleton in bridal gown and veil. In "First Communion," a girl in a long, lacy communion dress sports a sad skull mask over her face. Behind her, people wearing ordinary clothes and ordinary faces smile with the pleasure of it all.
Mexico, of course, makes a holiday of the Day of the Dead, when bakeries turn out sugar skulls for those who would devour death. The only country that honors death more regularly is the country of photography. Photography cannot help memorializing a living instant, but that instant dies even as it is recorded. Photographic portraits outlast and supposedly immortalize both their subjects and their makers, as Cocteau noted. (So do paintings and sculpture, ars being longa and vita brevis.) Yet many photographic portraits are as anonymous as skeletons; though they continue to exist and may even fascinate, they cannot be said to have cheated death out of much that is worthwhile.
Octavio Paz, the Nobel Prize-winning author, observed that Mexicans do not find anything on this side of death worth the effort of trying to cheat the Grim Reaper: "The Mexican's indifference toward death is fostered by his indifference toward life." At any rate, Ms. Iturbide takes note of death attending the living in their off hours. (She herself had a child who died at a very young age.) A woman nursing a drink and a cigarette in a bar sits before a mural of a skull with a hotel bedroom in one of its empty eye sockets -- a site for a tryst? for the beginning of life? In the other socket, two people lie in hospital beds, and a tombstone looms in the hollow that was once a nose.
Ms. Iturbide grew up in what she has called a "bourgeois, conservative, deeply Catholic" environment that emphasized the Hispanic rather than the Indian culture of Mexico, but since at least the 1920's many Mexicans have argued that the pre-Columbian cultures represent the bedrock of the country. Ms. Iturbide is clearly fascinated by persistent Indian ways of life, but she is equally interested in accommodations to the present.
"Angel Woman" is a picture of a woman in a long skirt and veil working her way to the top of a high cliff leading to the route across the desert. In one hand she carries a boom box. The wall text says she belongs to a group of Indians who sell their crafts to Americans, earning enough to buy themselves music that blooms in the desert silence. Many traditional ways continue largely because of rampant poverty, which is a great preserver of what people of means consider charming, but a changing world exerts its pressure.
All societies are in flux, but Mexico has long been a land of dramatic differences, unexpected adaptations, and a sense of self-identity that is a mix of indigenous, ancient and contemporary Western ways. It has never been a univalent culture. The Spanish conquest irrevocably altered the Mesoamerican societies when it did not destroy them, combining races, religions and customs, and recent events in economics and politics have continued to readjust the mix.
This makes the land rich in opportunities to observe things that are not at all what they seem. Mexicans take a widespread delight in open pretense, with costumes and masks making almost anyone, at least provisionally, into something other than what they are. Fiestas are celebrated on any pretext whatever -- Paz once wrote that Mexican poverty "can be measured by the frequency and luxuriousness of our holidays," wealthy countries having neither the time nor need for them. Fiestas give adults license to play dress-up, whether in wish fulfillment or to defend against the evil Other by mocking it and assuming its power for a day.
Enthralled by such unscripted popular dramas, Ms. Iturbide produces a theatrical art, sometimes finding, sometimes inventing the theatrics. The show at the Parrish includes a display of Mexican masks from the Museo del Barrio in Manhattan, solid evidence of the hold that fantasy and magic and the assumption of other selves have on the Mexican spirit.
The photographer also sees, or sets up, contrasts, disruptions, displacements and mysteries everywhere. Religion is omnipresent and not entirely reliable. In "Our Lady of the Iguanas," a woman wears a mad crown of live lizards boldly thrusting this way and that above her everyday print dress. A child holding a statue of the Virgin Mary stands before a painted angel who has vampire teeth and a skull decorating her robe. A man garbed as Jesus, with a crown of thorns and blood running down his chest, is partially obscured by large white-feathered wings on either side of him -- angels upstaging their Savior.
Secular life is equally mysterious and evocative. A woman faces us squarely but her vision, and ours of her, is blocked by a mask over her eyes; a puzzled toddler studies her for clues. Another woman carries sticks through a cemetery, making her way through a flurry of dragonflies so vast it might be a gathering of all the souls ever buried there. An old man in white shirt and trousers and dark sneakers is enthroned on a great chair with fierce jaguar heads and claws -- in the middle of a deserted dirt road.
Ms. Iturbide finds visual moments that, cut off from the circumstances that produced them, acquire a metaphorical charge. She devises tableaus that pay homage to ambiguity and owe a debt to poetry. These are not pictures to be deciphered (unless, perhaps, you are Mexican) but to be savored for their mournful pungency and whispering allusions. They write a personal fable of a country that seems to be continually in process, continually negotiating its way between one kind of existence and another, where people who are not resigned to the way things are opt for transformation instead.

Admiring Itself in A Thousand Mirrors

 BODY:
THERE was another murder on my block one morning recently -- not a real one, another one for television. When I stepped into the courtyard of my apartment building, there were dozens of "police officers" securing the crime scene against my neighbors, who, late to work, were trying to push past the cast, the crew and the tons of camera equipment.
"Nice neighborhood," a detective was saying sarcastically to a newspaper columnist, played by Oliver Platt, as the camera rolled. "Last month we had a murder-suicide here. A rape of a cleaning lady over there." 
 I don't recall too many real murder-suicides lately on my block, which is a quiet one in Greenwich Village, but it may well be famous for violence throughout the country. This particular scene for a new television series called "Deadline" was never broadcast because the show was canceled after just a few episodes. But a couple of years ago "Law and Order" staged a mob hit across the street, in front of a venerable Off-Broadway theater. Before that, two thugs beat up Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the back alley of that theater, which had become a jazz club for Mr. Lee's film "Mo' Better Blues." For as long as I can remember, there has been shooting on the street, though shooting through the lens of a camera.
What's most striking is not how incongruous these images of this particular block are but how hungry television producers, filmmakers, photographers, painters, curators and just about everybody else connected to art or entertainment seem to be for images of it, of the neighborhood, of all of New York City.
This is nothing new. On the same street as these simulated crimes is the building where Berenice Abbott lived for decades, on a corner she photographed frequently. In 1929 she moved back to New York from Paris seized by a "fantastic passion" to do for New York what the photographer Eugene Atget had done for the City of Lights. For the next decade, she methodically catalogued the city in pictures, a project that she named "Changing New York."
Before that, at the start of the 20th century, a nearby corner was the subject of paintings by George Luks and John Sloan, two of the six original Ashcan artists, who were the first group of respected painters to make the street life of New York their primary subject. And even before that, street scenes of New York were popular in prints, in maps, even on vases and dinner bowls and wallpaper.
But if this ever-changing (yet somehow always familiar) city has generated a never-ending supply of pictures, the truth is, there may never have been a time before now when so many of these images of New York, both old and new, have been on display.
"There's a time for everything; this is in the air now," said Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is currently presenting "Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861." Among the exhibition's 310 objects (which include period furniture and costumes, portraits, sculpture and silverware) are scenes of the city as depicted in architectural drawings, watercolors, prints, maps, oil paintings, the oldest surviving daguerreotypes and, yes, vases and bowls and wallpaper. Mr. de Montebello believes it is the first time in the Metropolitan's 130-year history that the museum has had an exhibition on this scale about the city in which it resides.
"It is interesting how it has all come together at the same time," said Betsy Gotbaum, the director of the New-York Historical Society, where the Henry Luce 3rd Center for the Study of American Culture opened last month. This has enabled the Society, for one of the few times since its founding in 1804, to put on permanent display most of its collection -- some 40,000 objects and images, almost all of which have some connection with New York.
"Why is this happening right now? I think people across the country are in awe of us," said Robert Macdonald, the director of the Museum of the City of New York. One of the museum's current exhibitions is entitled "Painting the Town, Cityscapes of New York," offering two centuries' worth of views in oil. Mr. Macdonald said that next year the museum would also begin construction on a $50 million project to double its size, the highlight of which will be the building of a New York City History Learning Center.
Some have explained this surge as part of a momentum begun two years ago with the celebration of the Centennial of Consolidation, the joining together in 1898 of the five boroughs into the City of Greater New York. Others say it has something to do with the millennium, a natural time to look at the one place in the world most habitually razed and resurrected. Still others believe it is because the city has come back to a glory it long held, with the economy up, crime down and subway trains no longer covered in graffiti.
Those with a grasp of the city's history, though, might understand that in these new displays New York is resuming a tradition that has been with it nearly from the beginning. Like the ticker-tape parades that have been given along the "canyon of heroes" for the past 114 years, the celebration of the images of New York is something akin to a business strategy by the world's richest, most energetic and most diverse Chamber of Commerce. New Yorkers, by their active self-mythologizing, are once again marketing their city to outsiders -- and trying as well to reassure themselves.
The images being "marketed" are not just old ones, of course. There are many painters and photographers who continue to make the city their subject. There are also about a dozen prime-time television series being shot entirely on location in New York, according to the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, possibly more than ever before, the office says, and certainly the most since the 1950's. About half the series are new this season, including "100 Centre Street" (created by Sidney Lumet for the A & E channel) and "Welcome to New York" on CBS. Last year, there were 209 feature films shot in the city, three times as many as 15 years ago. These television shows and films spent an incredible 22,000 shooting days last year on location somewhere in the streets of New York.
If the statistics are unprecedented, they do not even take into account the many more movies and television shows that are supposed to take place here, even though they are actually shot in Vancouver or Toronto or on a set in Los Angeles. Popular "New York" shows like "NYPD Blue," "Friends" and "Will and Grace" are produced elsewhere (as is "Spin City" starting this season, now that Michael J. Fox has left it). This season, many of the new shows are explicitly set but not shot in New York City, including "The Geena Davis Show."
"Most of these shows create a kind of mythic, hip young New York," said James Sanders, who is writing a book titled "Celluloid Skyline" about the image of New York in film and television. "They've restored the city to a place it had held for 60 years, from the turn of the century, an impossibly romantic and exciting place that exists nowhere else. Even 'Sex and the City,' which is very specifically unwholesome, with a dark edge, is a return to New York as a glamorous place."
Mr. Sanders is also the co-creator, with Ric Burns, of "New York: A Documentary Film," the first 10 hours of which were broadcast on PBS last year. Like many people who make New York their subject, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Burns can't seem to get enough; they are now completing two more two-hour episodes, bringing the saga up to the present day, and plan to show them later this season.
Along with the television series, they have written (with Lisa Ades) a companion book, the 575-page "New York: An Illustrated History." Only in New York could the sheer number of titles on the subject of the city almost drown out this and three other mammoth projects that anywhere else would surely stand out, if not stand alone: the new 636-page catalog of the Met show, edited by the curators Catherine Hoover Voorsanger and John Howat; the 1,350-page "Encyclopedia of the City of New York," edited by Kenneth Jackson, which was published in 1995; and the 1,382-page "Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898," by Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace, winner of a Pulitzer Prize last year.
"There is a cottage industry of people who work on nothing but books about New York City," said Mr. Howat. Indeed, New York seems to have been a subject for nearly every major American writer since Washington Irving. It took an extra century for major American artists to depict the city, and plenty have stayed away from it as a subject. Still, measured by quantity alone, all the words about the city are but the arch in Washington Square Park when put beside the World Trade Center of images.
"When you think of Paris, you think of the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower," Mr. Burns said. "You say New York, and the imagination bristles with images: Wall Street, Fifth Avenue, Greenwich Village, the Statue of Liberty." He mentioned a half-dozen more. "There is no other American place, with the exception of the American West as a whole, that has so captured the imagination of the world."
When Mr. Burns began gathering the material for his series a decade ago, he said, he found it "startling" how many images of the city existed, some going as far back as the 17th century.
"We've always been self-regarding," explained John Howat, the chairman of the Met's Departments of American Art, who came up with the idea for "Art and the Empire City" some six years ago.
The reason may be not just cultural or psychological but practical, a form of marketing. Unlike the other early American cities, whose settlers had sought religious or political freedom, New York was always a place where people came to make a buck.
It is no coincidence that Wall Street was one of the first places to be depicted in New York. Amid an entire wall of cityscapes at the Luce Center is an oil painting by Francis Guy from around 1800 picturing Wall Street. It is focused on (and titled) the "Tontine Coffee House." Just a few years earlier, a group of stockbrokers had built the coffeehouse not only as a place to eat and hear the latest news but also as an early marketplace for commodities like ships, real estate and slaves.
Whatever the formal quality of Guy's painting, it is rich in information, showing the new American flag flying from the roof, the brokers conversing on the balcony, the many masts in the busy harbor just down the street, the plentiful supplies being unloaded. All this was Guy's obvious effort to establish Wall Street as the center of a busy, prosperous American city.
New Yorkers were proud that Wall Street was a place where news happened, even when the news was bad. Both "Painting the Town" and "Art and the Empire City" include versions of Nicolino Calyo's gouache on paper, published as a newspaper illustration, of the Great Fire of 1835. Viewed from the top of the Bank of America, the painting focuses on the flames engulfing the Merchant's Exchange. Also in the Met exhibition is an 1858 oil painting by James H. Cafferty and Charles G. Rosenberg, titled "Wall Street, Half Past 2 O'Clock, October 13, 1857," which shows brokers crowding Wall Street in the midst of a panic.
That Wall Street has long been as much a symbol of finance as an actual place is evident from William Holbrook Beard's 1879 allegory, "The Bulls and Bears in the Market," on display at the New-York Historical Society. The animals fill the street beneath the clearly marked New York Stock Exchange, attacking one another.
The arrival of the 20th century only increased artists' interest in Wall Street as a subject, appealing especially to the American Impressionists like Childe Hassam and Colin Campbell Cooper, who suffused it with an air of romance. Photographers were also captivated. Paul Strand's most famous photograph is surely the one he took in 1915 of people on their way to work dwarfed by the ominously looming Morgan Bank. One of Berenice Abbott's most frequently reproduced images is her 1938 aerial view "Wall Street District." Whether in art, photography, television, the 1987 Oliver Stone movie (or the 1996 Whoopi Goldberg movie "The Associate"), Wall Street remains one of the most depicted places in New York, and in the world.
"As New York was the mercantile center of the country and eventually the world, it was more self-consciously thinking of its image," said Margaret Heilbrun, the director of the library at the New-York Historical Society. One way to enhance its image was to mount a collective effort to make New York not just the business but the cultural capital of the nation; this helps explain the existence of the Society itself, as well as the founding of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1870 and the Metropolitan Opera in 1883.
But there was a more literal way to heighten the image of New York. Ms. Heilbrun is also the curator of "Inventing the Skyline," a current exhibition at the Society about Cass Gilbert, the architect of the Woolworth Building and other early skyscrapers. Chicago was the city where skyscrapers were in a sense invented, but it was New York that saw both the business opportunities in more office space to rent out and the marketing value of having a unique, immediately identifiable and awe-inspiring skyline.
One revelation of the city scenes in the three museums is how long New Yorkers had anticipated the skyline. Watercolors and prints going back as far as the 18th century, but especially those in the 19th, offer sweeping views of the New York Harbor and bird's-eye views of the broad streets, particularly Broadway, taken from skyscraper-high vantage points situated either in imaginary heavens or man-made ones.
"Church spires were the skyscrapers of the time," Ms. Heilbrun explained. An unsigned oil painting, believed to be from 1761, at the Luce Center shows the East River waterfront with a proud fleet of ships. At the Met exhibition, there is a hand-colored aquatint engraved by Henry Papprill around 1848 showing the city from the steeple of Saint Paul's Church. At the Museum of the City of New York is Anthony Imbert's painting "The Erie Canal Celebration, New York, 1825," a scene of the harbor that looks like an early version of Op Sail, the ships' masts competing with the spires of an unmistakable early skyline.
After the canal was completed, New York became the undisputed business capital of the country. It was the center of manufacturing, and this included the manufacturing of images. New York was where the artists lived and where the publishing companies flourished, attracting photographers from all over. "By the late 1850's, we had more photographers working here than in Paris and London combined," said Ms. Voorsanger of the Met. New York was also the first home of the movie industry and of television production.
It was just natural that the image manufacturers would look for subjects close at hand. But this did not happen immediately. In the era covered by "Art and the Empire City," the most respected painters of the day, Thomas Cole and the rest of the Hudson River School, lived in New York City but never painted a scene here. They traveled to the Catskills, or even to the Andes.
New York was the place where they sold their art; the nation's first art gallery, Luman Reed's, was in New York. The city was also where they socialized and taught and were admired; the most influential art institutions in the nation were here; the National Academy of Design, for example, which was founded the same year the Erie Canal was completed, 1825.
For actual scenes of the city, New Yorkers of the era relied mostly on the new technology of lithography and on such novelty items as blue Staffordshire dinnerware. One platter on display at the Met depicts the arrival of the Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution, at Castle Garden in 1824, with cannons blasting in salute. This was obviously popular: the Luce Center features an entire dinner set with the same scene.
The gun blasts for the Marquis seem of a very different caliber from those simulated on my block. But shows like "Deadline" -- out of step with the "Seinfeld" descendants that fill most of this season's television lineup -- are rooted in a different New York tradition, one that has existed at least since the Ashcan artists: it is intent on capturing the city in all its gritty reality, even if it has to add a bit of grit.
It should not be so surprising to learn, then, that the executive producer of "Deadline," Robert Palm, found inspiration for the particular episode shot on my block from "Stag at Sharkey's," the famous painting from 1909 by the Ashcan artist George Bellows depicting two boxers pummeling each other. The connection with the episode is that the murder victim, a former movie star now a mobster's moll (is this a likely neighbor?), hung out at a boxing club.
It was up to Tom Ross, the location manager, to find a boxing club that looked like the one in Bellows's painting. "In L.A., if I had said I wanted a boxing club like the one in 'Stag at Sharkey's,' they would have said, 'Huh?' " Mr. Palm said.
But it was all in a week's work for Mr. Ross, just one of more than a dozen locations he had to find for that particular episode, about seven of them exterior shots. He estimates that he is one of some 50 full-time location managers in New York, all of them looking for a steady supply of the "real" New York. "It's becoming harder and harder," Mr. Ross said. The real estate market is tight; New Yorkers have become more savvy, so they charge more; competition from the other shows is fierce.
And there is one other problem. Oliver Platt pointed it out as he sat in the set of "Deadline," the actual old newsroom of The New York Post on South Street, with the Brooklyn Bridge in clear view out the window. He looked nonplused. "People are going to say: 'Oh, for God's sake, the Brooklyn Bridge. Couldn't they be a little more original?' " he complained. "But it's not a backdrop. We're actually here."

Taking Stock of a Mammoth Entertainment Center

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
FOURTEEN months after opening the $190 million New Roc City, a major mall devoted to entertainment and sports outlets, its developer, Louis Cappelli, professes to be pleased with the project.
New Roc City is a beige stone complex covering a full block in downtown New Rochelle that replaced a retail mall anchored by Macy's. It includes a 18-screen movie theater and an Imax theater; an arcade with bumper cars, video games, pinball and a simulated roller coaster among others diversions; twin ice-skating rinks; a supermarket; three restaurants; a hotel; and a fitness club. On the roof above the four-story complex, there is the Space Shot, an amusement park ride whose soaring tower is modeled after the Eiffel Tower, which sends an intrepid dozen people at a time 235 feet in the air and then drops them in a free fall. 
 Despite these attractions, however, the mall's attendance has fallen far short of expectations -- it had 3.1 million visitors in its first 12 months, compared with projections for 5.5 million -- and, until recently, more than 72,000 square feet of its 500,000 square feet of retail space were vacant.
Meanwhile, at City Hall, elected officials have compared the tax dollars generated with the costs of patrolling and otherwise maintaining municipal services, including a police substation, at the facility -- not to mention their $24 million investment in the center's parking garage. Mayor Timothy C. Idoni reported that costs exceeded revenues by about $400,000 during the first year.
In addition, two major tenants have made filings that indicate they are in financial difficulty. Family Golf Centers, the parent company of Sports Plus Skate Nation, which rents 138,000 square feet of space here, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May. When asked how the financial concerns of the parent firm might affect Sports Plus, which runs two ice rinks and a video arcade at New Roc City, William Reitzig, a spokesman for Family Golf Centers, said, "No comment."
Regal Cinemas, based in Knoxville, Tenn., which owns 18 screens of movies and the Imax theater at the complex, said in a regulatory filing last month that it was considering bankruptcy or a financial restructuring.
So why is Mr. Cappelli calling New Roc City a "heck of a success story," especially as the economy shows signs of slowing?
One answer, of course, is that he wants to promote his huge investment, but in addition, he says, economic forecasts show that entertainment centers are good investments and that people will reach into their pockets to pay for this kind of fun no matter how poorly the rest of the economy fares.
CLEARLY, the developer is also optimistic because of people like Sonya Foster and her wide-eyed granddaughter Shalya, 2, who strolled happily along the futuristic corridors of the mammoth center on a recent weekday morning, and Elizabeth Gonzalez and Carmen Gonzalez, cousins who attend high school in New Rochelle and who were skimming the ice on one of Sports Plus's rinks.
Mr. Cappelli called his family entertainment center resilient and "recession proof," and some economists think he is correct.
"If you're a guy and you have a girl, well, you have to take her out ice skating or to the game rooms," the developer said. As for parents, "what are you going to do if times are bad -- tell your kids you can't afford to go to the movies?"
"Of course not!" he said.
"No matter how good or bad times are, you always want to see 'The Grinch,' " Mr. Cappelli added, referring to Regal Cinemas' offerings. "If the stock market drops, it could even drive you to movies for consolation," he said.
Despite the parent company's recent financial problems, Regal Cinemas at New Roc City is consistently among the company's three best performers nationwide, according to Richard Westerling, senior vice president of marketing. Among all movie theaters in the country, it is in the top 100.
Thomas J. Spitznas, an economist in Mount Vernon, agreed that while parents may do without things for themselves during a downturn, "they never like to deny their kids."
"They may hold back on the big-ticket items like a car," Mr. Spitznas said, "or wait until next year for a new dishwasher, but the service industry, movies especially, are not so recession-sensitive."
While absorption of space and attendance rates did not meet expectations the first year, there were other positive indicators. For one, a 124-unit Residence Inn by Marriott at New Roc City, which is part of the complex, is often filled to capacity.
Also, Jeffrey J. Castaldo, executive director of real estate for the complex, said he had recently secured four new leases for New Roc City for 52,000 square of mall space. This would fill the complex above 95 percent of capacity.
The new tenants are a bowling alley, a baseball training center, a sports memorabilia shop and locker rooms for college ice hockey teams.
In what is billed as "an extreme bowling center," the newly opened 17-lane New Roc 'N Bowl features black lights and glow-in-the-dark balls and pins.
A nationally franchised Frozen Ropes Baseball Training Center, featuring baseball and softball clinics and camps, one-on-one instruction, batting cages and video analysis, is also bound for New Roc City, along with Steiner Sports Marketing, a maker and retailer of signed collectibles and other sports memorabilia.
In addition, the men's and women's hockey teams of Manhattanville College have rented locker-room space, joining students from Iona College, who also play on the large rink against other teams from the Division I Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.
Spectators can watch games while dining in Reunions, a sports bar and pool hall next to the rink. Kelly Bararuk, a player from Iona, said last week as he raced for practice that games were now drawing big crowds in the rink, which has seats for 500.
The new tenants join other businesses like Bally Total Fitness, Modell's sporting goods and Applebee's.
Also, even though Mr. Cappelli jettisoned plans for a planned office complex at New Roc City, he has decided to put 100 luxury apartments in its place. In part, he opted for the apartments because the entrance to the building is from the parking lot, and it lacks what he calls "a street presence" desirable for offices.
"Of course, that's good from an apartment dweller's point of view, especially for security reasons," Mr. Cappelli added. The developer said 50 percent of the apartments were already rented, mainly to young professionals and empty-nesters. A one-bedroom apartment with a den at New Roc City is renting for $2,500 a month.
IN June, when the apartment complex is ready to be occupied, the developer will begin construction on a 320,000-square-foot office, hotel and condominium project on Huguenot Street across from the parking lot at New Roc City.
Dollars, attendance figures, vacancy rates and other hard data aside, the bottom line for many is that at the very least New Roc City has injected new life and energy into what was until recently a flagging downtown area.
"New Rochelle was a tired metropolitan area," Mr. Castaldo said. "It's not that anymore."
Mayor Idoni agreed. He said that on a recent weekend evening, he could barely find a parking space at the mall and lines were long at the movies. As for the balance sheet at City Hall, he predicted that "revenues will sort themselves out in the next year."
Meanwhile, New Roc City is being watched carefully by other municipalities. Mr. Cappelli said Glen Cove and Albany had inspected the site and were making inquiries about building similar entertainment complexes in their areas.
He also said he "would love to go" to White Plains, where the developer Tishman Speyer has bowed out of a plan to build a multiplex theater, retail and entertainment center in the downtown.

HEADLINE: A LA CARTE;
For the Thrifty, a Room With a View

BYLINE: By RICHARD JAY SCHOLEM 

 BODY:
CRYSTAL clear or wild and stormy, in moonlight or sunlight, P. W.'s Chowder House, at Brewer's Capri Marina in Port Washington, has a striking waterfront view of Manhasset Bay. At night, lights twinkle in the distance; at dusk the fading rays of the sun shimmer on mirror-smooth water. In warm weather, diners sit on an outdoor deck under umbrellas to take in the sailboat-seagull scene.
When the weather turns brisk, they retreat under the roof to the deck's heated section and inside to the more formal Corinthian dining room and the bar room with its windows, wood and water views. 
 Restaurants with sensational settings are rarely affordable for budget conscious diners. But P. W.'s Chowder house, the newest member of the Hudson River Waterfront Group, at 45 Orchard Beach Boulevard (516-767-7924), is an exception.
The restaurant, as it battened down the hatches for its first winter, introduced a number of low-priced options in an effort to entice diners during the cold weather months. Yet, it still takes timing, planning and strategy to eat economically at a restaurant where most starters are priced at $7.50 or more and all but one entree costs at least $18.95. (Lower-priced alternatives are the eight sandwich platters that cost from $7.50 to $12.95 and the five entree-size salads in the $8.95 to $11.95 range.)
The three days to consider are Mondays, when the elderly receive a 20 percent discount; Tuesdays, when three pastas are available for $13.95 each; and Thursdays, when the prime rib goes for $14.95. There's also a $17.95 Sunday brunch.
Thrifty patrons at P. W.'s must carefully pick and choose, not only the right day, but the right dish as well because the kitchen is as uneven as the harbor's surface in a hurricane. Most of the food here will neither do a tap dance on a gourmet's heart nor drive anyone out the door muttering. But is somewhere in between, about evenly divided.
Chowder, the restaurant's namesake dish, is a perfect example. There are three (all $5.50) on the menu: a New England, heavy with clams, potatoes and vegetables in a thin though tasty broth; a corn and crab entry that will appeal to those who like creamed corn with but a few threads of crab; and a Manhattan that's a rather routine vegetable soup with a scattering of clams rather than the expected spicy seafood brew.
Two of the three special nights are in that same up and down pattern. The plate-covering piece of crusty, charred, on-the-bone prime rib, perched on a scramble of sweet potatoes, onions and peppers I devoured on a Thursday night, was a genuine bargain at $14.95 (it's $23.95 on the a la carte menu) but two of those $12.95 Tuesday night pastas were, at best, routine renditions. Penne primavera, with chicken, contained stringy, chewy meat, just a scant hint of julienned vegetables and a watery, pallid sauce. Spaghetti with salmon in a basil-flecked cream sauce was somewhat better but both benefited from substantial infusions of salt and cheese.
Plus-side starters to consider are a large load of feathery, tender calamari ($8.95); three small, nicely seasoned meat-filled crab cakes ($8.95); a creamy Caesar salad ($6.95) of crisp romaine and crunchy croutons covered by a cheesy, tasty homemade dressing; and a heap of tiny, delicate (though lukewarm) steamers ($8.95). Forget the oysters Rockefeller ($9.50) -- the spinach leaves slathered over gritty oysters bore little resemblance to the creamy, chopped spinach, bread crumbs, butter, vividly seasoned classic.
Sandwiches, though served with slightly soggy French fries, are recommended. The husky half-pound burger ($7.50), laced with lively seasonings, is a solid choice, and the lobster B.L.T. ($12.95) is an inspired blending of a club sandwich with fresh Maine lobster.
Entrees worth remembering are the pan-seared eight-ounce filet mignon ($21.95) wrapped in smoky bacon and presented with a mellow bordelaise sauce, and a baby roasted chicken ($14.95) alive with juices. A diminutive, rather bland chunk of halibut with some dabs of saffron sauce didn't justify its $21.95 tab, but a generous portion of grilled pineapple-glazed tuna on grilled pineapple rings with a pyramid of vegetables did. Most entrees are accompanied by baby carrots, good green and yellow beans and too-stiff mashed potatoes.
The breadbasket here contains unfortunate rolls that are in the commercial fodder category, while standard sweets from an off-premises bakery are unexciting. The genial young wait staff aims to please but needs more training. Dishes were cleared while some diners at the table were still eating and although we were the only people in the dining room on a slow Monday, our servers still didn't know who ordered which dish.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon to Hollywood: a Mixed-Use Building

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
DEVELOPERS plan to start construction next spring on the Hollywood Marketplace, a project which seems almost a microcosm of the Hollywood district here -- a single building that combines apartments, retail space, historic preservation and even advertising billboards.
The $80 million project, which is being developed by a partnership of Regent Properties, a local developer, and P&A Erie of Chicago, is also notable for providing the first new market-rate housing to be built during the current wave of Hollywood redevelopment, as well as the first major residential mixed-use project in the district. 
 Last spring, the Los Angeles City Council approved construction of the 326,000-square-foot project, a six-story building that is expected to cover a full city block at the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street. The ground level is entirely devoted to retail space, with commitments already signed from Borders Books, Bed Bath and Beyond and Cost Plus Imports.
Upper levels of the building will contain 300 market-rate apartments, most of which are studios and one- and two-bedroom units, reflecting the target market of single young professionals who work in entertainment companies or in technology-related fields.
The project will also incorporate a portion of the historic facade on Vine Street of the TAV Celebrity Theater, built originally in 1937 as a broadcast studio for the American Broadcasting Company.
Market-rate housing is a "healthy sign" for Hollywood, which has attracted plentiful retail activity and movie theaters, but virtually no upscale apartments to date, said Jeffrey Skorneck, manager for special designated projects for the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Area.
"If this housing can work at Sunset and Vine," he added, "there will be more viability for market-rate residential elsewhere in the district."
While the final rents have not been set, Douglas Brown, a partner at Regent Properties, said he expected rents to be slightly higher than $2 per square foot monthly. This is comparable to those found in nearby neighborhoods, like Los Feliz or Beechwood Canyon, which are popular with midlevel professionals in the entertainment industry.
Vine Street, the setting of the project, is an incongruous mix of brick buildings from the 1930's and 40's with undistinguished commercial buildings from the 1960's and 70's, which now look faded and downmarket.
Sunset and Vine is "the SoHo of 25 years ago," Mr. Brown said. "It's cool, funky, fun and edgy."
Currently, the intersection is a major node of Hollywood redevelopment, with three of the four corners devoted to large-scale projects. To the east, the developer Tom Gilmore of Los Angeles is rehabbing an older office building. Across Sunset Boulevard from the Hollywood Marketplace project, Pacific Theaters Realty Group plans to add 4,000 theater seats and retail space to a site surrounding the Cinerama Dome, a landmark geodesic theater built in 1963.
THE developers of the Hollywood Market, in fact, originally planned a project similar to the Cinerama Dome that combined a multiplex theater and shopping.
A 1998 lawsuit over parking brought by a rival developer, however, delayed development for a year. During that time, one major tenant, the Good Guys, a national appliance retailer, pulled out of the project, while the prospective theater operator, Mann Theaters of Los Angeles, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
"With other major theater operators facing bankruptcy or expected to announce bankruptcy shortly, we decided against the multiplex," Mr. Brown said.
After Regent settled the lawsuit last year, the company reformulated the project as a combination of retail operations at street level with apartments above.
While residential mixed-use development is common in the Bay Area and on the East Coast, hybrid projects remain unusual in Los Angeles and untested in Hollywood. The developers, Mr. Skorneck said, are "rolling the dice to some extent, based on what they have seen in other cities, such as San Francisco, and saying, 'Why not in Hollywood?' "
Mr. Brown of Regent Properties acknowledged the high-density project was unusual for Los Angeles. "It's as urban and dense as you can get in Southern California," the developer said.
He seemed confident, however, that the Hollywood housing market would support the project. "From a real estate developer perspective, the project has a good foundation: a huge local population, a huge shortage of housing and people who want to live in Hollywood," Mr. Brown said. He characterized his target market as "hip, but not necessarily urban pioneers."
The adjacency of major employers -- including Capitol Records; Universal Pictures; the Klasky-Csupo animated cartoon company, the producers of the "Rugrats" films; and other creative and high-tech businesses -- suggest that the apartment complex will have a large pool of potential renters among people who work in Hollywood and want to avoid long commutes on the increasingly congested roads and freeways of Los Angeles, according to Mr. Skorneck.
THE "heart of Hollywood" location, in addition, may be attractive to many young professionals who work in those companies, he added. "They have a very urban lifestyle, with lots of clubbing and partying," Mr. Skorneck said.
The urban profile of the project is exemplified in one of its most unusual design features: the integration of advertising billboards into the design of the facade.
While the combination of architecture and advertising might offend some purists, "signage was one of the things that we're excited about," said the project designer, William Roschen, principal of Roschen Van Cleve of Los Angeles. The firm is designing the project in association with Thomas Cox & Associates of Irvine, Calif., and MCG Architects of Pasadena, Calif. Sussman Prejza, an environmental design firm in Culver City, Calif., is designing the advertising apparatus for the building.
Not only does Mr. Roschen embrace the concept of signs, but he also thinks a building that incorporates signs into its facade is better off then being "colonized" by an insensitively sited billboard built nearby by somebody else. The billboards on the facade have historic roots on Vine Street, where the modernist Richard Neutra designed an office building in 1933 for the film executive Carl Laemmle of Universal Studios that included billboards trumpeting his latest film releases. (The building survives in a much altered form at Hollywood and Vine, without the signs.)
The architects also plan to mark the corner of Sunset and Vine with what Mr. Roschen called a "corner icon," or a columnlike structure that will incorporate both an electronic display and advertising.
The signs are part of the complexity that a project in present-day Hollywood needs, according to the architect.
"We think that kind of urbanity is something that is appropriate for that type of housing," Mr. Roschen said. "If housing is going to happen on Vine Street, it should have that kind of urban energy."
"We are thrilled to death," he added, "to see all these things coming together in one project."

HEADLINE: College Hopefuls Face Stronger Competition

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
FRIDAY is a big day for Brad Glick. Dec. 15 is the date when he and thousands more Long Island high school seniors expect a letter telling them whether they were accepted to the colleges of their choice under the "early decision" plan.
It's not that Brad, a Syosset High School senior, will lose all hope of going to Cornell if the university turns down his early-decision application. Instead, he believes it will give him an advantage in Cornell's general-admissions sweepstakes, which will run into next summer. 
 "I hope that my decision to apply early will give me an edge over other students who might be equally qualified candidates for admission," Brad said. "This year, so many kids are applying to Cornell that it makes the competition even worse."
Early decision is a high-stakes gamble in which a student picks one school and if accepted, is pledged to go there even if a better school says yes later. It is one of many tactics employed by college-bound students nationwide who are struggling with a situation in which the number of applicants is rising faster than the number of slots in next year's freshman class.
But for students on Long Island and elsewhere in the New York suburbs, the problem is worse than a national supply-and-demand imbalance. The better students seeking the better schools are the core of the competition, and in it, New York suburban students' academic strength is, paradoxically, their greatest disadvantage.
Long Island's many fine high schools are good at turning out high-achieving students. But the Island produces so many well-qualified graduates that they compete against one another to get into colleges where geographic and socioeconomic diversity is prized.
These are not the merely good students. Thousands of high school seniors throughout Long Island who have A-plus averages in honors courses, near-perfect SAT scores, served as presidents of clubs and captains of teams and volunteered hours every week for community service are worrying that they will not be accepted by the colleges and universities of their choice.
"Sure, I'm nervous," said Logan Rich, a classmate of Brad's who sent an early-decision application to the University of Pennsylvania. "The admission standards have gotten harder since my older sister applied to college a few years ago. Because there are too many qualified kids in the applicant pool, many of us won't get into the colleges of our first choice."
A high grade average and great SAT scores are no longer enough, said Nicole Liebman, also from Syosset High. She is hoping to go to George Washington University.
"During high school I got involved in different community service projects, and I probably wouldn't have done the majority of it if it wasn't for college," Nicole said. "As the same kids are applying to the same colleges, schools that we thought were our safety schools are no longer safe."
College officials will not publicly acknowledge that the problem exists. Doris Davis, the associate provost for admissions and enrollment at Cornell, insisted that Long Island students were not at a disadvantage.
"Universities have never used a system that pits students within a school or a region against one another," she said. "The process is individual, and there are no quotas for the number of individuals from any one school or area."
Many Long Island students, guidance counselors and parents remain skeptical. "They tell us that there are no quotas, but no one really believes that," said Alaina Gurwitz, a senior at Jericho High School and an early-decision applicant at New York University. "Particularly coming from a small school like Jericho, it's doubtful that N.Y.U. will take more than one student early decision. I may be qualified, but there's another student in my class who also applied early, and he has better credentials. I'm afraid we won't both get in."
Jan Goldstein, the guidance director for the Herricks school district, said: "I don't believe there are quotas per se. But when colleges finish reviewing all of their applications and look at the final numbers, if they find that out of the 300 kids they set aside for acceptance, 75 are from the Northeast and 55 from Long Island, they may look again at those applications in an attempt to attain a diverse student population."
Dr. Lee Weitzman is a parent of a senior at Hewlett High School. "Coming from Long Island, my daughter is at a disadvantage," said Dr. Weitzman, whose daughter Jessica applied early to Emory University. "There are so many well-qualified students in our community who have worked extremely hard throughout high school, performed at a level that demonstrates their competency, shown leadership qualities and a commitment to community activities that sets them apart from other students. Yet they now feel as if they are competing against one another and have to worry about getting into colleges in which they definitely deserve admission."
The geographic factor is not the only one making competition tougher for the Island's high school seniors. The raw numbers are not in their favor.
"Last year's graduates, born in 1982, made up the largest high school graduating class nationwide in two generations," said Thomas Ganes, the chairman of the guidance department at Great Neck South High School. "As the numbers of students applying to college increases, the pressure felt by high school seniors gets even greater."
A study by the National Association for College Admissions Counselors found that 74 percent of the colleges surveyed reported an increase in the number of freshman applications for fall 2000 admission.
Finally, a strong economy has allowed more families to afford private colleges, and the Internet has helped many students from across the country to become more aware of colleges they might never have considered.
"More strong students from the middle of Iowa are now thinking that they don't have to stay in Iowa for college but can come to Princeton or Penn," Ms. Goldstein said.
This trend makes it more difficult for Long Island students, Dr. Ganes said. "Take the University of Maryland, for example," he said. "Before last year, Long Island students were often accepted with an 87-88 average. This year, it's written right on the application that you need a 90 average to apply. The kids hear this, and they become more cautious about the whole admissions process because there are no longer any guarantees."
Barbara Lubel of Roslyn, whose eldest son is now a sophomore at Penn, has noticed a significant difference in admissions standards in the last two years. This week, her second son will hear if he was accepted to Yale.
"It seems that there is more pressure on the kids than ever before," Ms. Lubel said. "There are so many similarly qualified students today who are all applying to the same schools and competing against one another."
Joyce Bisso, the principal of Hewlett High, cited "a tremendous level of stress among our students."
"While the acceptances are still very credible," she added, "we're hearing about rejections from places that a few years earlier would never have rejected a student with this kind of academic profile."
There is a sense among students that applications for early decision carry more weight for admissions counselors, Ms. Bisso said. But early-decision applications are just part of a complex process that for many students often starts several years before they are seniors and includes private SAT tutors, hired college advisers and long-term strategies designed to make students more attractive to college admissions officers.
The best colleges may well be searching for what sets a student apart from everyone else.
"During high school I took Japanese, and in college I'll continue to play basketball," said Erin Connolly, a Syosset senior. "I think I've done a lot of things because in the back of my head I thought they might look good for college."
Enrollment numbers are up for the SAT classes run by Test Takers, a tutoring company with four Long Island locations. Its president, Frank Pomilla, said that enrollment was particularly high this year for preparatory classes for the College Board subject tests, not always required by colleges but usually taken by those seeking the more selective schools.
Shawn Pappas, a Syosset senior, said: "It's like a game. You have to try to sell yourself, and to show a college why it needs you."
The college frenzy is largely limited to the more affluent communities, in which parents are often highly educated and have high aspirations for their children. In blue-collar communities, smaller percentages of students are applying to colleges, particularly the Ivy League schools.
"Our kids don't have the economic advantages to be able to pay for private tutors and college consultants," said Les Black, the school superintendent in Brentwood. "I guess the good news is that they don't feel the intense pressure from the competition that kids in some of the other communities do."

HEADLINE: A Job Worth Having And Many Who May Want It

BYLINE: By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY

 BODY:
WHEN Nassau County leaders sidestepped the train wreck that would have been a state takeover of the county's finances, they also preserved the county executive's post as something of value. Ever since, the big question here has not been whether the race for county executive has begun. It has been how big a political free-for-all county voters can expect in the 11 months till Election Day 2001.
On Nov. 28, the day he sealed an agreement for a financial rescue plan, Thomas S. Gulotta, the longtime county executive, was noncommittal about his political plans. "We'll deal with that next year," was all he would say on the topic. 
 Should he run, Mr. Gulotta, 56, would be seeking his fourth four-year term. Could he win, even in a likely fight within his own Republican Party, is another question. The county Republican organization has disowned him, and two Democrats -- Thomas P. DiNapoli, a state assemblyman and the county Democratic chairman, and Thomas R. Suozzi, the mayor of Glen Cove -- have not officially entered the race but are behaving like candidates for Mr. Gulotta's job.
"It's incredible -- you've got the potential for a war in both parties," said Howard A. Scarrow, a professor of political science at the State University at Stony Brook. "Both parties are potentially split by two people who may want to run. It could be a very bloody year."
Mr. Gulotta has an imposing $2.5 million campaign fund but has suffered grave damage over his handling of county finances, with the prospect of further pitfalls as he executes a 2001 budget under the scrutiny of a hostile county Legislature and a skeptical state watchdog, the Nassau Interim Finance Agency.
A NIFA takeover has been averted, for the time being. But there are serious questions about whether the plan will work. Some say the revenue estimates were too optimistic. And there are doubts about whether Mr. Gulotta can stay within budget.
As Republicans watch and wait, some familiar names from the ranks of their renowned political machine have surfaced as possible challengers to Mr. Gulotta.
Those include Denis Dillon, the county district attorney; Michael Balboni and Charles Fuschillo Jr., both state senators; Richard Guardino, the top official in the Town of Hempstead; Peter King, the congressman; Donna Ferrara, the state assemblywoman, and Fred Parola, the county comptroller. And there was talk about an as-yet-undiscovered candidate from the private sector: a successful business person in the mold of a Jon Corzine, the senator-elect from New Jersey.
"My opinion is that we should look at our current bullpen of elected officials and go beyond that and look at prominent businesswomen and businessmen who have administrative skills, potential financial wherewithal and electability," said Bruce Blakeman, the Republican former presiding officer of the county Legislature. "I think there are quite a few people who would be attractive." He wouldn't say who he had in mind.
Not since 1977 have Nassau Republicans held a primary for the county executive nomination. That year, the incumbent, Ralph Caso, lost to Francis Purcell, the party-backed candidate and eventual winner in a three-way primary.
"I wasn't the most popular guy because they thought I was an outsider, but then I was the best vote-getter," Mr. Purcell, 82, said from his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Asked for his thoughts about a potential repeat of 1977 next year, Mr. Purcell said: "I don't even know if Mr. Gulotta is going to run again. But do I think he can win? No, I don't. I don't think he has the backing."
Democrats, also pointing to history, say this may be their best chance to capture the office since the days of Eugene H. Nickerson, who served from 1962 to 1970. But, as Professor Scarrow said, neither Mr. DiNapoli nor Mr. Suozzi may be willing to sit on the sidelines.
Mr. Suozzi held a $250-a-plate fund-raising dinner at a restaurant in Carle Place on Nov. 30. The next day, Mr. DiNapoli was publicly speaking about plans to start his own local fund-raising committee.
On the Republican side, last month's election and the averting of the state takeover gave cause to celebrate. The county's five Republican incumbents in the state Senate were re-elected and the party reduced Democratic inroads in the Town Board in Hempstead, considered the foundation of the Republicans' once-ironclad control of county politics. And Mr. Gulotta was able to win back some political high ground by securing approval of a 2001 county budget that carried only a 7.9 percent tax increase, not the 15.4 percent proposed by the Democratic legislative majority.
"Tom Gulotta was the person most fighting for cutting the tax increases and for spending cuts," said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political consultant and adviser to Mr. Gulotta. "And that, I think, will be important for the voters of Nassau County if he chooses to run."
Democrats counter that they won six of eight Supreme Court judgeships. Still, a collective cheer could be heard from Westbury, where the county's Republican Party chairman, Joseph N. Mondello, staunched the historic county legislative losses of 1999 by spending about $2 million on town board races. Mr. Mondello has also been trying to line up a ticket for the 2001 races, including for county executive.
As early as the beginning of this year, Mr. Mondello approached Mr. Dillon, 66, the longtime county district attorney, and asked him to consider running for county executive in 2001.
"I told Mr. Mondello that I am not running," Mr. Dillon said recently. "I am running for district attorney next year, if I run for anything."
Mr. Dillon said he could point to "a wealth of candidates" whom Mr. Mondello could choose from for county executive. But Mr. Dillon and others said Mr. Mondello planned to do some political polling on a host of potential candidates before making any firm decisions.
Mr. Parola, the county comptroller, said those polls would show what the electorate thinks of Mr. Gulotta and whether other Republican politicians are linked with what he said was Mr. Gulotta's mismanagement of the county finances.
"If, in fact, he has tainted all the incumbents, then you may well have to go with a whole slate of outsiders," said Mr. Parola, 54. "Joe wants to do what is best, and I think he is going to talk to Tom and look at the polls. I think if Tom is viable, then he will run Tom. If Tom is not viable, I think he will ask Tom to step aside for the good of the party and the good of Tom himself."
But Professor Scarrow said the voters still seemed angry over the condition of the county under Mr. Gulotta's leadership. "I don't see why you need the polls," he said. "The fact that people put the Democrats in charge of the Legislature last year, I think that is all the polling you need."
Some local Republicans say a presidential victory by George W. Bush might create a job opening for Mr. Gulotta outside of Nassau, perhaps in a move orchestrated by Governor Pataki, a Bush ally who is facing re-election in 2002 and needs a strong organization in Nassau, which has the largest Republican enrollment of any county in the state.
"Whatever we are talking about now, the whole thing could change in eight months," said Bruce Nyman, the city manager in Long Beach and former Democratic leader in the county Legislature. "Gulotta could be the ambassador to Belize or something."
Mr. King said Mr. Mondello was "very concerned" about the county executive race. He agreed that after the polling, Mr. Mondello would probably seek an alternative candidate and then hope he could persuade Mr. Gulotta to step aside. But that may not be so easy.
"He told me he feels he is in good shape," Mr. King said, referring to Mr. Gulotta. "I would say the odds are against him, but I would never count Gulotta out."
Mr. King, 56, ruled out running. "Quite a few people have mentioned it to me," he said, "but I told them no, I really don't want to be county executive."
Mr. Guardino, 50, is up for re-election as Hempstead town supervisor next year and, as one aide put it, it is critical to have someone strong at the top of the town ticket. Ms. Ferrara, 41, did not return calls to her Westbury office seeking comment. Mr. Balboni, 41, fresh from re-election to the state Senate, said no one had approached him about any future elective office.
"I have had no discussions and no interest in any office other than the state Senate," he said.
Whoever wins -- Republican or Democrat -- Mr. Mondello said the tough fiscal decisions that lie ahead will probably be carried out more effectively by someone who sees the job lasting just one term.
"I feel strongly about that," Mr. Mondello said. "This county executive is going to have to know the word no."
On the Democratic side, Mr. Suozzi, 38, appears ready for a costly battle. In an interview, he said he had a war chest of nearly $700,000. At this rate, Mr. Suozzi said he could expect to raise $1.5 million to $2 million. Every cent of it may be needed should a fight with Mr. Gulotta be necessary. But he may need another $1 million to wage a primary, should Mr. DiNapoli seek the party nomination, said Jay Jacobs, who is Mr. Suozzi's campaign chairman.
It would be a shame, those close to Mr. Suozzi said, if he was forced to empty his campaign coffers in a primary battle with Mr. DiNapoli.
"That would diminish our ability to help those legislators in those tough seats," Mr. Jacobs said. "I don't want to have this phrased as a blame-game statement. I am just giving the realities."
After his landslide re-election to the state Assembly this year, Mr. DiNapoli said he had about $100,000 left in his campaign fund, a significant portion of which he said he could transfer to a county executive race. But money is a minor concern, he said.
"I don't doubt that I can compete with any of the other Toms that are out there in that department," said Mr. DiNapoli, 46. "But money is not what this campaign is about. This is not going to be about the glitzy TV commercials. It is going to be about the candidates' past performance and future ability. And money can't buy all of that."
Both Mr. Suozzi and Mr. DiNapoli blame the years of one-party Republican rule in Nassau County for its ongoing fiscal woes. Both claim to have just the right mix of experience to lift the county from its depths of near-bankruptcy and restore its reputation as a vibrant suburb.
Mr. Nyman, who insisted he would not run for county executive himself, said: "I like both of them. I like either one of them. I mean, I like any Democrat. We have got two wonderful candidates right now."
Mr. DiNapoli was tapped in 1999 to rebuild the county's troubled Democratic Party and orchestrated the first Democratic takeover of the county Legislature in nearly 100 years.
Mr. DiNapoli said he had "gotten a great deal of encouragement" by those in and out of his party to run for county executive. Should he lose, he would not face re-election in the Assembly until 2002.
Some Democrats say that after 14 years in the state Assembly, where he co-sponsored many pieces of legislation with Republicans -- including the law to help bail out Nassau County -- Mr. DiNapoli would be a welcome conciliator in the often fractious atmosphere of county government.
"He looks for the positive, rather than separating and conquering," said Larry Aaronson, the first vice chairman of the county Democratic committee. "He is tremendously suited for that."
But the party chairmanship, which is by nature partisan and combative, is ill-suited for a conciliatory role, and Mr. DiNapoli suggested that he would not keep the chairman's post while running for county executive.
Mr. DiNapoli called himself "the accidental assemblyman" and said the chance to run in Nassau County would be "a real opportunity to help the people."
"The county is in need of real leadership," he added, "and that kind of a challenge is very appealing to me."
Mr. Suozzi said it was his experience as the mayor of Glen Cove that made him particularly suited for running the county government. When he was first elected seven years ago, Glen Cove had a multimillion-dollar deficit and a bond rating that hovered just above junk status, a situation like the county's today. Mr. Suozzi raised taxes, balanced the budget, cut the workforce and began cleaning up the city's downtown and waterfront in the process.
"I am a problem-solver," said Mr. Suozzi, whose current term ends at the end of 2001. "Glen Cove now has the highest bond rating since the 1970's. There is also a new sense of pride and optimism in our city."
Mr. Suozzi said he wanted to restore pride in the county as well. With its fine beaches and "strong communities," he said, Nassau is one of the finest places to live.
But Mr. Suozzi said a vision for the county's future could be articulated until the current crisis was solved. "Nassau County should be the best county in the country, instead of the laughingstock all the way from the boardrooms of Wall Street to the corridors of power in Albany," he said. "I've got the fire in my belly."
So far, there are no other Democratic hopefuls on the horizon. Not even Ben Zwirn, who nearly unseated Mr. Gulotta in 1993, is currently considering another run. But he has lots of ideas about taxes, patronage, essential county services and the economy.
"I'd love to raise these issues on a countywide scale, but I don't see myself being a candidate," he said. "But I have learned in life that you can't rule anything out."

Edgewater Mixed-Use Project Has Traditional Look

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: EDGEWATER

 BODY:
PILES will soon be driven deep into a patch of former industrial land along the Hudson River here for a mixed-use enclave called the Promenade that is being designed as a throwback to an old-fashioned downtown Main Street replete with residences above shops.
When completed by 2002, the development, which is to cost more than $75 million, will include 160,000 square feet of stores as well as five restaurants topped by 325 one- to three-bedroom rental apartments. There will also be two hotels with a total of 360 rooms, 20,000 square feet of space for professional offices, a public riverfront walkway and 1,500 parking spaces on the 15-acre site. It is just north of Gorge and River Roads in this Bergen County community at the base of the Palisades' cliffs, not far from the George Washington Bridge. 
 The mix of uses will be in two rows of interconnecting brick buildings each with varying elevations of three to six stories. Three mainly interconnected structures on each side will face a central landscaped boulevard extending from River Road eastward to the river.
The parking garage will be mostly below grade and accessible to the street-level commercial activity by escalator or to the residences by elevator. There is also limited street-level parking.
The Promenade project is being designed by Barrett Ginsberg of Denville, N.J., and developed by Starwood Heller Properties, a joint venture between Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn., and G. Heller Enterprises of Edgewater. Already in place are 162 modularly constructed rental and condominium apartments that the developers put up in the last 20 months on a pier jutting 800 feet into the water. Most of those units have been sold or leased.
In addition, National Amusements of Dedham, Mass., recently completed a 16-screen movie theater on 15 adjacent acres it purchased earlier from Starwood Heller. The theater is to open next Thursday.
The project is the latest addition to the resurgent mile-long waterfront of this former factory town. In the last several years numerous new rental and condominium buildings have been built or are being constructed with a total of up to 1,600 residences. The borough's population has increased in the last decade to 6,300, from 5,001 in 1990.
This activity has caused some worries in the community, intensified by a fire this summer that destroyed an unfinished apartment complex, nine houses and 12 cars and left 45 people homeless. (The fire, which was declared an accident, began on the block of an incomplete 408-unit rental project, which was rising at the site of the former Alcoa factory. The developer, AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., with offices in Princeton, is rebuilding.)
ONE significant concern is that the growth will overwhelm this pencil-shaped community, despite a widening of River Road, the main street that snakes through it. In response a group of residents, the Independent Coalition for a Better Edgewater, is campaigning for the borough to acquire the last developable waterfront parcels and preserve them as open space.
Mayor Bryan Christiansen said Edgewater has problems, particularly traffic. But he said this would be the case even if there were no development in Edgewater, given the growth in residential construction in neighboring riverfront towns.
While the activity seems to be happening all at once, he added, approvals for most of the buildings under way were in place for years and waited for a strong economy to move ahead. In addition, most of the activity is turning land that once held abandoned factories or crumbling piers into taxpaying properties, he said, adding that after years of financial struggle the borough will soon "see a big bump up in its ratable base and its coffers fill."
The entire 32-acre Promenade parcel, including the pier, was formerly occupied by the Celotex Corporation, which manufactured wallboard. Four years ago Starwood Heller purchased the site for more than $15 million from the Manhattan developer Leonard Litwin and since then has razed the old plant and cleaned the land of contaminants.
Explaining the purchase, Gene Heller, Starwood's chief executive, said, "The real reason Edgewater developed is the rebuilding of River Road, and with that any properties along the road were going to become more valuable."
Mr. Heller is no stranger to the Edgewater waterfront. In 1996 his company built Edgewater Commons, a 390,000-square-foot retail center along River Road just north of the Promenade site, which eventually was sold. Farther north on River Road he is completing 64 rentals above 74,000 square feet of retail space.
At the Promenade site, Mr. Heller said, the first steps were to develop the pier as housing to capitalize on the location and to sell 15 of the upland acres to National Amusements for the movie theater. These actions, he said, would offset land costs and "bring activity and people to the site."
As for the rest of the upland acres, he said the initial idea was "to put up a few big box retail stores and call it a day." But, Mr. Heller said, borough officials wanted something more than a retail area centered on a big discount, home-improvement or office-supply chain and something different from Edgewater Commons, which is a big open-air retail center. This eventually led to the current mixed-use concept. He added, " This will offer an unmall-like area and set us apart from our competition."
Mayor Christiansen said the mix of uses "is appropriate for the land, given its location, and will draw people to shop and live" at the development.
Retail professionals said consumers and retailers these days are looking to downtowns as an option to suburban malls. That does not mean malls are a thing of the past, said Malachy Kavanagh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan. But, he said, there are fewer of them being built nationally, and those that are constructed are huge and include entertainment components to broaden their reach.
IN turn, neighborhood shopping centers are appealing to time-pressed consumers, who see them as easier to get in and out of than malls, especially for small errands. Mr. Kavanagh added that some retailers, especially large chains that are not dependent on other stores to draw consumers, like them instead of malls because they provide street visibility for their stores and nearby parking for their customers. By adding residences and office space, Mr. Kavanagh said, developers provide "a built-in audience for the retail space."
Faith Hope Consolo of Garrick-Aug Associates, a retail leasing firm in Manhattan, added that the audience for riverfront retail space is expanding as "the migration from Manhattan these days" by employers "has been to the Jersey waterfront, not Westchester or Brooklyn." Ms. Consolo said that even though "the retail market has cooled a little" in the region, Manhattan retailers continue to expand to Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester County.
Retailers have responded to the Promenade. Seventy-five percent of the 160,000 square feet in about 40 shops has been preleased, said Tod Heller, Starwood Heller's vice president of marketing and leasing, and Gene Heller's son. Tenants include the Gap, the Limited, Pier 1 Imports, Ann Taylor and Eddie Bauer. Annual rents range from $26 to $35 a square foot. Negotiations with operators for the hotels -- one with 220 rooms, the other with 140 -- are also under way.
"The people moving to or already living at the riverfront are fairly affluent," Tod Heller said. "The Promenade will give them a shopping experience that doesn't exist along the riverfront."
And what of the market for waterfront residential rentals? "It's slowing," said Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a real estate services firm in Jersey City.
Because of the stock market's swings. people have become cautious, Mr. Antonicello said, adding, however, that there still "is demand for quality well-priced units." Average rents have remained stable in the last year at $26 to $28 a square foot, he said.
At the Promenade, where planned amenities include a swimming pool, the apartments will have 850 to 1,400 square feet and are expected to rent for an average of $25 to $26 a square foot. That means a two-bedroom, 1,250 square foot unit would rent for about $2,600 or $2,700 a month.
"The financing for the project is based on today's rents or less," Gene Heller said, "so we're not looking for continued inflation for it to work."

HEADLINE: The Soul of the Ultimate Machine

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: LA JOLLA, Calif.

 BODY:
THE Silicon Valley crowd that assembled last week in a San Francisco airport hotel had come to hear about mobile electronic commerce, a most immediate concern for people who spend many of their waking hours thinking about whether their latest e-business solution will merit venture capital dollars.
They learned about something very different. 
 Instead of talking about buying Barbies online, the astrophysicist Larry Smarr came to tell them about what he calls "the emerging planetary supercomputer." The Internet, he explained, is evolving into a single vast computer fashioned out of billions of interconnected processors. Then he went another step: "The real question, from a software point of view, is: Will it become self-aware?"
To Dr. Smarr, the idea of a thinking machine that might emerge spontaneously from billions of interconnected large and small computers isn't harebrained at all. He said he was simply extrapolating a series of significant trends that, to him, are remarkably obvious. And when it comes to extrapolating trends and forecasting technological revolutions, Dr. Smarr is worth listening to.
Fifteen years ago -- prehistory in Internet terms -- Dr. Smarr persuaded the federal government to establish supercomputer centers for civilian research. That bit of brass led to the birth of technologies like the Web browser and advanced computer-graphics programs that allow scientists to see how hurricanes work and let moviegoers stare dinosaurs in the eye. Along the way, he also helped expand a network of computers that were owned by military contractors, corporations and universities into what is now called the Internet.
Now Dr. Smarr has persuaded Gov. Gray Davis of California to put him in charge of the California Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technology, a new state-financed research academy in this seaside San Diego suburb, with the goal of envisioning the future -- and making it happen. Governor Davis announced his decision to authorize Dr. Smarr's institute and two others on Thursday.
And what Dr. Smarr sees is this: the rapid emergence of a much more extensive cyberspace that will essentially mirror the physical world. He imagines bridges that are covered with a fabric of computerized sensors that will automatically tell engineers where earthquake damage has occurred. Or a world in which intelligent buildings whisper directions to visitors on the way to their destinations.
"The emerging information grid is going to be far more pervasive than the electric power grid is today," he said.
STILL, the idea that the Internet may transform itself into a global computational grid with a mind of its own has generally been considered far-out stuff from the pages of science fiction novels.
The idea of a thinking machine may sound outrageous, but Dr. Smarr's record has made him one of the world's most respected computer technologists. He created the research center that contributed to the development of the Internet and then invented the graphical browser -- marketed as the Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer -- that opened the Net to the masses.
As director of the computer research institute announced on Thursday, he is now in the position to test even his most far-out ideas. The institute will be established with more than $300 million in state and private funds over four years.
Based jointly at the University of California campuses at San Diego and Irvine, it will focus on engineering new types of sensors, creating an advanced digital wireless Internet and designing a new class of distributed-computing machines, which break a problem into separate pieces to speed calculations. It will also work on applying those technologies to problems in the environment and transportation, as well as to genomic medicine and new-media arts.
Several times in the past, Dr. Smarr had equally radical ideas about where computing was headed, and each time he correctly spotted the Next Big Thing.
He founded the National Center for Supercomputer Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1985, and helped to develop a network that linked it to the nation's other four supercomputer centers.
His center also did pioneering work in scientific visualization, and one of its brightest scientists, Stefen Fangmeier, went on to become a leading graphics animator in Hollywood. There, he helped to create special effects for movies like "Jurassic Park" and "The Perfect Storm."
Yet those advances pale beside the fact that seven years ago, a small group of student and faculty researchers working at Dr. Smarr's center created the first graphical Web browser, Mosaic, igniting the World Wide Web and the electronic-commerce explosion.
The center's advances flowed directly from Dr. Smarr's passion over the last three decades: to use powerful computers to improve the quality of science. His goal in developing the supercomputer centers was to give tools to scientists that had once been available only to bomb designers and code breakers.
The Internet and the World Wide Web grew in part from his drive to build better computer tools to permit scientists to collaborate and share information.
"He fostered the kind of environment that I had always associated with Xerox Palo Alto Research Center or Bell Labs," said Marc Andreessen, the Netscape cofounder, referring to two widely admired information technology laboratories. "People were free to follow their instincts. He tends to attract really, really smart people and gives them the latitude to pursue their ideas."
But Mr. Andreessen added that while he was there, the University of Illinois shared at least one weakness with the Xerox lab in Silicon Valley: It had a hard time bringing innovations to the marketplace. Mr. Andreessen was able to start Netscape by licensing the institute's Mosaic technology, but only after overcoming the university's resistance, he said.
"What they never got at N.C.S.A., what they never had, was a culture of entrepreneurial spinoffs," said Mr. Andreessen, adding that the culture had since changed. "If he can add that at the new institute, a culture that permits people to go off and start companies, then I think he will really have something."
OVER one and a half decades at the Illinois supercomputer center, Dr. Smarr built a reputation as a scientist who helped to develop the use of computers by both elite scientists and millions of nontechnical Web surfers.
"Larry has had a huge impact," said Robert R. Borchers, director of the division of advanced scientific computing at the National Science Foundation. "He's a legitimate scientist, and he's usually one step or two ahead of the trend on technology."
Dr. Smarr's new institute will draw together more than 200 faculty members at the San Diego and Irvine campuses to re-invent the Internet using technologies like optical fiber cables, digital wireless networks and micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS.
Since the end of the cold war, this part of Southern California has changed from a stronghold of the military and aerospace industries into a center for wireless, optical, semiconductor and biotechnology companies.
Dr. Smarr settled on this area -- 400 miles south of Silicon Valley -- because it was both a center for high technology and a fertile ground for what he calls "I.P.O. capitalism."
"Based on the electronic-commerce boom that followed the development of the Mosaic Web browser, I realized that a new model of growth was emerging," he said. "I knew I had to get to a place where there was an explosive private sector."
Among the companies that have already committed themselves to investing $140 million in Dr. Smarr's new institute, dubbed Cal-(IT)2 , are I.B.M., Sun Microsystems, Qualcomm, Boeing, Broadcom, Ericsson, Microsoft, Intersil, ST Microelectronics and Sony.
Dr. Smarr's plan is to use the institute to attack a few very difficult problems with what he calls "mega-computers" -- thousands or even millions of separate computers lashed together with optical fibers via the Internet.
The most dramatic challenge for the institute, considering its location in automobile-choked Southern California, is to build a prototype for an "intelligent transportation infrastructure." It would use the Internet to wirelessly link sensor arrays under freeways with computers in cars. Dr. Smarr believes that it will be possible to build a giant computing grid that can control traffic more effectively.
"When your computer knows where each car is planning to go, it is a problem you can solve," he said.
The challenge is that a computer that large has never been built, much less programmed. Such a machine would have what Dr. Smarr calls an "effervescent" architecture. It would comprise millions of parts -- processors, communications links and storage units -- that come and go unpredictably.
"Larry's plan is to take the Web into the physical world," said Ramesh Rao, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of California at San Diego.
Many people in the computer industry believe that if such a machine is to be built, Dr. Smarr is the ideal person to lead the quest.
"He has long years of experience in the hardest part of this whole business," said Richard Shaffer, president of Technological Partners, a computer industry consulting firm. "That's getting software to work together across lots and lots of processors."
Dr. Smarr's obsessive search for more computing speed derived from his theoretical work as a student in the 1970's. Then, as a first-year graduate student at Stanford, he was trying to apply Einstein's general theory of relativity to the collision of two black holes.
At the time, the only way to get access to enough computer power to start the experiments needed to test his theories was to turn to the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories.
Dr. Smarr had gone to Stanford to study with Leonard Schiff, one of the world's leading experts in relativity theory. But Dr. Schiff died unexpectedly during Dr. Smarr's first year in graduate school. After moving to the University of Texas at Austin, Dr. Smarr linked up with another group of relativity experts. He eventually received a Ph.D.
AT Texas, his adviser told him bluntly to get top-secret nuclear weapons clearance so he could go to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and "learn from the great ones."
For Dr. Smarr, contact with the weapons labs was what he now describes as a Promethean experience. Early on, he found that a problem that would take eight hours to run on a Digital Equipment VAX computer at the University of Texas would require just two minutes on one of the weapons laboratories' supercomputers.
Several years later, as a post-doctoral researcher at Harvard, he was a regular visitor at weapons labs, flying in for a few days at a time and cadging time on supercomputers to run simulations of thermonuclear forces far more awesome than the hydrogen-bomb makers had imagined.
"It was what I called 'interstitial' living," he said. "I would show up on Friday afternoons and ask, 'Hey, are you guys going to be running your bomb codes this weekend?' "
The experience transformed him. The lab visits were like ventures into an advanced civilization with powerful tools beyond the grasp of mere mortals.
"I remember going back to Harvard and feeling like being an alien landing on a primitive planet," he said.
In 1983, as a junior faculty member at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Dr. Smarr did something unprecedented. He sent an unsolicited, $50 million proposal to the director of the National Science Foundation, George Keyworth. In it, he called for the creation of a supercomputer center at the university to give civilian scientists the same access to powerful computers that was enjoyed at the nation's weapons labs.
At about the same time, Sid Karin, a scientist at General Atomics, a contractor at the University of California at San Diego, sent a similar proposal to the government. Two years later, the National Science Foundation acted, setting up a nationwide network of five centers dedicated to broadening scientific access to supercomputers.
Dr. Smarr still frets over how little the nation supports both the direct and indirect benefits of the centers. "What our society doesn't understand is how critical investment in basic science and technology is to advances in society," he said.
California is counting on such a spinoff effect from its three new research institutes.
Dr. Smarr draws parallels to the nation's land-grant universities of more than 100 years ago. "This is really just back to the future," he said. "Why did the citizens of the Midwest allow their tax dollars to be spent on agricultural research? Because it led directly to more economic productivity."
And what America's agrarian economy of the 19th century found in basic scientific research, Dr. Smarr sees in the proliferation of networked microprocessors in the next decade. Not only is the power of individual computer processors growing at an exponential rate, but the number of interconnected computers and computing devices is exploding.
On Monday, at the San Francisco conference, Dr. Smarr described a networked world in which the number of personal computers would soon double, to one billion. Moreover, there will soon be three billion Internet-connected cell phones -- and, more important, as many as 16 billion Internet-connected computers embedded in everything from automobiles to toasters.
It is a world, he said, in which a world of Net-connected computers and electronic sensors "overlay" the real world in such a way that computer power enhances every human action. For example, he sees a time when supercomputers let scientists see hurricane damage as it occurs, as spy satellites work for the military today.
"We're talking about something very radical," he said. "This is the world we're coming to. It's an enchanted world where everything has processors in it linked by the Internet."
HE defends his vision of the future of cyberspace with the certainty of a physicist. Computer processing power is advancing so rapidly, he said, that society is likely to soon go through a revolution as dramatic as the "phase change" when water changes into ice.
For that reason, Dr. Smarr said he plans to hold regular conferences at Cal-(IT)2 about the consequences of scientific and technological change.
Dr. Smarr is not the only computer researcher grappling with the social consequences of wildly accelerating computer power. William Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, recently wrote an article in Wired magazine warning about the potential perils of intelligent machines. Two well-known computer researchers, Hans Moravec and Raymond Kurzweil, have also written books this year about the likelihood of the emergence of intelligent machines.
Mr. Joy's article has touched off a debate among computer scientists about the consequences of their work. Dr. Smarr said he believes that computer scientists may need to grapple with the challenges, perhaps meeting in the same way as biologists did in 1975 at the Asilomar Conference to face the ethical challenges of biotechnology.
In Dr. Smarr's Brave New Cyberspace, the answer shouldn't be long in coming.

Some highlights in Larry Smarr's career promoting the Internet.
 
Fall 1983 -- Dr. Smarr writes a proposal to the National Science Foundation, requesting a supercomputer for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Ralph Simmons, then head of the physics department, travels with Dr. Smarr to deliver the unsolicited proposal, addressed simply to Director, N.S.F.
 
March 1985 -- The National Center for Supercomputer Applications is established under a five-year foundation grant.
 
April 1987 -- An advanced scientific graphics program begins at the supercomputer center.
 
Fall 1987 -- NCSA Telnet, the center's first major software release, makes its debut. By 1991 it has more than 100,000 users.
 
October 1988 -- A Cray-2 supercomputer is installed. It has four processors and can perform about 1.7 billion calculations a second.
 
April 1993 -- NCSA Mosaic, the first user-friendly Web browser, is released. At the time, there are about 200 World Wide Web servers in the world.
 
1994 -- Mosaic has several million users and has effectively given birth to the dot-com industry, which is projected to be worth $1 trillion by 2001.
 
February 1997 -- Dr. Smarr is appointed to the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee.
 
October 1997 -- The National Computational Science Alliance becomes a reality. A partnership of some 50 institutions across the country, it is charged with making a prototype of the National Technology Grid. This is an unprecedented effort in which the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts, Dr. Smarr says. In essence, we are establishing a virtual community that shares its knowledge and pools its resources to create the computational and information infrastructure of the 21st century that will support the next generation of scientific and engineering research.
 
May 2000 -- Dr. Smarr joins the computer science and engineering faculty at the University of California at San Diego. Relying on the national distributed-computing network that he has helped advance for more than 15 years, he remains an adviser to the National Computational Science Alliance.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Coming to America to Learn a Secret: Boldness

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
SWITZERLAND, the land of Heidi, neutrality, chocolate and secret bank accounts, is not known for a business culture that encourages daring new ideas. And that is exactly what is worrying the Swiss government, which has watched in dismay as America's brash young executives spawn the hot companies and vast wealth of the new economy.
So in an uncharacteristic move, Switzerland has opened a mission in Cambridge, Mass., that is intended to help the country discover its inner entrepreneur. 
 Less Old World consulate and more 21st-century conduit to the Boston area's hotbed of technological and academic innovation, the outpost aims to encourage a new generation of Swiss businesspeople to think more like their American counterparts.
"We don't have a culture of, 'Let's grow big and fast and be master of the world,' " said Dr. Xavier L. Comtesse, 52, a Swiss diplomat who heads the mission, known as the Swiss House for Advanced Research and Education. "You never hear a Swiss say, 'I want to change the world,' like you do here. We need to take more risks."
Other countries with similar aspirations have taken notice of Swiss House, which is a research organization, consulting firm, incubator and meeting space rolled into one. Near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, in a region with the largest concentration of start-ups and venture capitalists after Silicon Valley in California, the outpost is described in a government brochure as "a privileged observatory of the efficient American innovation and technology transfer system."
With open cubicles, a conference table, and a pillow-lined "pit," Swiss House offers Swiss entrepreneurs a place to fire up their laptops, make phone calls, network and absorb the culture of the new economy.
Swiss House officially opened in October, after a prolonged renovation, but it has been operating for many months. Last May, it held a European start-ups conference with M.I.T. In January, Swiss House and M.I.T. will sponsor a biotechnology conference.
Swiss House has also asked Clarity Capital and Atlas Venture, two venture capital firms based in Boston, to participate in business development seminars for young Swiss executives and to screen business pitches from Swiss start-ups. Saleena Goel, an associate at Atlas, and Chad M. Jackson, a principal at Clarity, said they were interested in both proposals.
The outpost was also host recently for a delegation of Swiss information technology researchers and entrepreneurs, including some from Fastcom Technology, a digital camera maker and software distributor in Lausanne. Some members of the delegation visited M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory to learn how to translate technologies from the laboratory to the market. Others met with representatives of Putnam Investments, the Boston mutual fund company, which invests in emerging foreign companies.
And in tandem with a Swiss foundation, the outpost sponsored a business-idea contest for Swiss entrepreneurs last January. Nearly two dozen winners were awarded one-week crash courses in entrepreneurialism at M.I.T.
The course, called "a brain transplant for potential European entrepreneurs" by Kenneth P. Morse, managing director of M.I.T.'s Entrepreneurship Center, covered issues like customer focus, building management and raising money for start-ups.
"The Swiss know they have a problem," Mr. Morse said. "They're taught to fear risk and failure. They're conservative and conventional. Their culture doesn't favor entrepreneurialism. But they're coming out of the closet."
A case in point is Swiss House's commercial "spin-off," called Swiss Entrepreneurs Network Development, or SEND. Operating at Swiss House but registered as a private United States company, it is a consulting firm for Swiss start-ups. One project is to find an American acquisition target for a new Swiss company, Bioring, which makes medical devices. Aceair, a manufacturer of small aircraft, is using SEND to find legal counsel as it expands into the United States.
"My idea," said Pascal Marmier, SEND's Swiss director, "is to radiate U.S. entrepreneurial skills back into Switzerland."
Mr. Marmier, 27, a lawyer by training, is paid through grants and investments from Venture Partners, one of Switzerland's biggest venture capital firms, and SpaceVest, an investment firm in Reston, Va.
An artfully designed space of glass, blond-wood floors and chrome, surrounded by Webcams, flat panel displays and giant video conference screens, Swiss House has the feel of a high-technology start-up -- albeit one with a big interior-design budget. It even has a corporate-style advisory board; one member is Paul Sagan, president of Akamai Technologies, the Internet services company based in Cambridge.
The operating costs of Swiss House are paid by the Swiss government. But the $2 million cost of buying and renovating the red-brick building, a former grocery store, was financed by Lombard Odier, a 202-year-old private bank in Geneva. The bank hopes to organize seminars at Swiss House on how American high-tech start-ups do business.
Dr. Comtesse proposed the mission to the Swiss government in 1997, when he was the science counselor at the Swiss Embassy in Washington. Nearly two years later, Bern approved, but the deal was delayed by local homeowners who sued to block it out of concern that Swiss House would change their residential neighborhood. A judge ruled in favor of the Swiss.
The outpost idea appears to be spreading: officials from Britain, Ireland, Japan and Finland have asked Swiss House how to set up similar missions. Australia, Singapore and Canada established outposts this year in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.
Despite its small size, Switzerland is prosperous and is home to much potential start-up capital, and researchers there have developed promising biotechnologies and computer technologies. Nevertheless, the country ranks only 10th in Western Europe in private equity investing, which includes venture capital financing for new companies -- far behind Britain, France and Germany, according to the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, a trade group based in Brussels.
IN the United States, venture capitalists have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into risky start-ups in recent years. But Switzerland's secretive venture capital funds and financial institutions, daunted by high taxes, tend to invest in well-established Swiss companies or abroad. Swiss stock options are taxed so prohibitively that they are usually a burden, rather than a springboard to personal wealth or an incentive to build a good company quickly.
And while the American new economy has been fueled in part by the willingness of executives to put aside their dot-com failures, Swiss laws that make it difficult to write off debts can render an entrepreneur's failed venture his last.
Whether Swiss House can turn the Swiss into new-economy capitalists is unclear. Ms. Goel at Atlas Venture said that for Swiss House guests, learning a new entrepreneurial culture "will be a hurdle."
Dr. Comtesse sees Swiss House as a beachhead for changing a less-than-innovative mind-set. "Americans think differently," he said. "We need to have more dreamers."

Dissecting the Nature of the Downturn

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
NOW that Alan Greenspan is on record as alert to the economic slowdown unfolding in the United States, investors can breathe a collective sigh of relief and start buying stocks again. Or can they?
The equity indexes bounced back last week, on the hope that imminent interest-rate cuts would deliver the economy and corporate profits from disaster. But this time it may not be that simple. All economic slowdowns are not created equal, and some economists believe that the characteristics of the current one are more worrisome than equity investors seem to think. 
 "An important question for the Fed in the months ahead will be whether the economy is decelerating in a way that it desires," said Henry Willmore, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York. "Answering this question entails more than simply looking at G.D.P. growth."
Instead, investors must look at how much of the growth in gross domestic product comes from productivity increases and how much from job creation. One force -- slower job growth -- would be far preferable for the Fed and would have better results for investors, Mr. Willmore said.
If the economic slowdown comes from more modest job creation than the nation has seen recently, the Fed will be pleased because it means that inflation stays in check. In Mr. Willmore's view, the Fed would like to see employment growing by 50,000 to 100,000 jobs a month.
If, however, growth stalls because productivity falls, it will keep the Fed policy makers on inflation alert and thus less likely to cut rates aggressively. Slowing productivity means that companies cannot offset rising wages with higher earnings. "This puts more pressure on firms to pass through cost increases to consumers and has a negative effect on consumer prices," Mr. Willmore explained.
The steep nature of the deceleration is what troubles Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "As recently as the second quarter of 2000, the year-over-year growth rate of real G.D.P. in America was 6.1 percent," he said. "That rate by the middle of next year will be about 1.9 percent, a 4.2-percentage-point deceleration."
Mr. Roach pointed out that such a drop would exceed the sharpest decline -- of about three percentage points -- seen in the recession of 1990-91. "The deceleration we're seeing now was last seen in 1982," he said. "This is a recession-style compression in the growth rate. It's coming with great speed. And that speed of compression really could be destabilizing in influencing business decisions with respect to capital spending and could even be unsettling to consumer expectations."
At the same time, Mr. Roach sees no new sources of growth elsewhere in the world to pick up the slack for the United States. Indeed, because America has been the most powerful engine of global growth in recent years, its weakness would have a greater impact.
Mr. Roach said economic growth in the United States accounted for 30 percent of total global growth between 1997 and 2000, in excess of America's 22 percent share of the world G.D.P. A result, he added, is a 40 percent chance of a hard landing.
Mr. Roach said the Fed chairman's speech this week signaled that he was prepared to do more to avoid a hard landing, but that is not where Mr. Greenspan thinks the economy is heading. "He'll be reactive, not proactive," he said. "Whatever the Fed does early next year will be too little, too late to forestall the outcome in 2001. The next round of Fed easing will have more of a bearing on the upturn that follows than on the slowdown that lies ahead."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
In Fund Ads, the Weeks That Weren't

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
THE stock market is doing great. Honest. Just look at a recent crop of mutual fund advertisements.
Check out the ad in the Dec. 4 issue of Barron's, the one with the eight guys in sweats doing push-ups on a football field, with the stern headline, "American Discipline." According to the ad, the American Century Vista fund, which invests heavily in technology stocks, had a 12-month return of 108.1 percent. Imagine that. No sign here of all that doomsday claptrap about technology stocks. 
Then there is the T. Rowe Price Science & Technology fund, which, according to a recent ad in Business Week, had a 12-month return of 38.4 percent. The $19 billion Fidelity Aggressive Growth fund? Up 49.3 percent, according to a recent ad in this and other newspapers. Scudder 21st Century Growth? Up 40.6 percent.
A bear market? What bear market?
The stock market may be in general decline, but everything is still blooming in the land of mutual fund marketers. Their message this holiday season is simple: Try to remember the end of September -- or at least what your 12-month mutual fund returns were back then -- and try to forget that the Standard & Poor's 500 index is down 6.8 percent so far this year.
Fund companies defend their advertisements by pointing to Securities and Exchange Commission rules that require them to include in their performance advertising their 1-, 5-, and 10-year returns through the end of a fund's most recent quarter.
But Cynthia M. Fornelli, a senior adviser to the head of the S.E.C.'s investment management division, said the agency was considering changes in its rules. "Maybe it's not enough to rely on the last quarter of performance numbers if something extraordinary happens in the interim that makes those numbers misleading," Ms. Fornelli said. "I would remind people that there is currently an anti-fraud provision in our rules that may require such updating."
The National Association of Securities Dealers, which reviews fund ads to make sure that they comply with the S.E.C. rules and its own, has issued two additional guidelines. In 1999, it said that more performance data might be necessary if "the fund's performance suffers materially" after the end of the most recent quarter. An official said last week that the guideline was meant more for catastrophes, like the impact of a currency devaluation on an emerging-markets fund, than for market corrections.
This year, it added a recommendation."If a fund's recent performance was the result of its investment focus in an unusually 'hot' industry or other factors that may not continue to exist," the association said in a notice, "we believe members should include prominent, cautionary language."
Fidelity and American Century note that in recent weeks, they have added stronger caveats to the usual "past performance is no guarantee of future results" in their fine print. "Current performance may be lower than performance stated," the Fidelity advertisement says.
T. Rowe Price, however, disagrees with the N.A.S.D.'s 1999 guideline. "The N.A.S.D. notice is just a recommendation," said Jane White, a spokeswoman. "We have discussed it with them at length and disagree with them. We use the S.E.C. guideline."
BECAUSE the markets have been down this year, especially since September, adjusting the one-year returns through the date the ads actually appeared yields a bleak picture: T. Rowe Price Science & Technology was down 12.9 percent. American Century Vista was up 14.9 percent, far below the triple-digit gains in the ad. Scudder Kemper 21st Century Growth was down 0.42 percent.
Fidelity Aggressive Growth, meanwhile, was down 4.12 percent. Fidelity's Nov. 20 ad also lists the fund's top, five-star ranking from Morningstar Inc. But try to catch a falling star: By the time the ad appeared, Morningstar had downgraded the fund to four stars.
Neal Litvak, president of Fidelity's retail marketing division, regretted the disparity. "That would not be my preference to have that happen," he said. Since then, he said, Fidelity ads, besides adding stronger caveats, have moved away from emphasizing individual funds.
"We're trying now to modify those performance ads so they show a wider range of products," Mr. Litvak said. "They show small numbers as well as big numbers."
At least Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Scudder Kemper and American Century include fine print. Then there is Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal and Barron's. In several recent ads in The Journal, the company promotes its Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 different companies and exchanges that sell mutual funds and other products tracking the average, for which Dow Jones collects licensing fees.
The ad calls the average "an unbeatable equation with an extraordinary return" and encourages investors to "contact your financial sales professional." The prominently displayed numbers, including a 25.22 percent one-year return, are impressive.
But the ad has no fine print that says when the return was posted. When the ad appeared on Dec. 4, the Dow was down 5.7 percent over the previous 52 weeks. If you guessed that the advertised return was through the end of September, you would be wrong. It was from the 1999 calendar year.
Because it is not a fund company, Dow Jones is not subject to the same regulatory standards. But besides using a favorable period to calculate returns, Mercer Bullard, a former lawyer for the S.E.C.'s investment management division, said, the ad neglected to take into account the fund fees that would reduce performance. Mr. Bullard, who now runs Fund Democracy, a fund shareholder advocacy group, said that if he was still at the S.E.C., "I would refer it to an enforcement liaison."
He said that while it would not be easy to establish the S.E.C.'s jurisdiction, "in the S.E.C.'s favor, this is a very misleading ad."
Richard Tofel, a Dow Jones spokesman, said that despite its note to call one's financial adviser, the ad was not truly aimed at individuals. "The ad is soliciting people to offer such funds, not people to invest in such funds," he said, pointing out that the message at the bottom of the ad invites investment companies to arrange licensing.
Some fund companies show more current results. In a recent ad, Warburg Pincus listed its Capital Appreciation fund with a 45.2 percent one-year return through Sept. 30. Next to that number, displayed as prominently, was the year-to-date return through October. It was 4.19 percent, a glimpse of reality in mutual fund Fantasia.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
Why Junk Bonds May Not Look That Bad After All

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
KATHLEEN C. GAFFNEY, a bond portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Company in Boston, was saying last Tuesday morning that corporate and high-yield bonds were an attractive bet. Why? People think the economic outlook is much worse than it is, she said.
"We're not talking about a recession; we're just talking about an economic slowdown," she said in an interview. As one reason for her confidence, she cited her belief that the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, would cut interest rates quickly if they thought the economy was in danger of falling into a recession. 
 What she did not know was that Mr. Greenspan was proving her right, even as she spoke. In a speech to an audience of bankers that morning, he signaled the central bank's readiness to cut short-term interest rates if it saw any recession threat.
Some analysts have interpreted his remarks as suggesting that there will be an interest rate cut as early as the end of January, when Fed policy makers meet for the first time in the new year. Others said Mr. Greenspan was making a pre-emptive strike against a tax cut by a possible Bush administration. Last Sunday, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush's running mate, said the economy "may well be on the front edge of recession" and argued that the danger was a further justification for Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut of $1.3 trillion.
Other analysts contend that Mr. Greenspan is worried that the corporate bond market could seize up as it did in 1998, after Russia defaulted and a large American hedge fund collapsed, threatening to choke off the credit needed to keep the economy moving ahead. While Mr. Greenspan said there was yet no comparison to 1998, he cut rates three times that year to ease credit strains. He cut rates in July 1990 for the same reason.
Whatever his motives, Mr. Greenspan's reassurance improved the outlook for high-yield and corporate bonds.
But looking better is not difficult, especially for high-yield bonds, which have been shunned recently as fears of slowing growth and falling earnings raised credit concerns about many companies.
High-yield, or junk, bonds have been victims of a huge sell-off that pushed yields higher but slashed the prices of the bonds. According to a Merrill Lynch index, the high-yield sector is down 7.2 percent for the year through November. Most of that decline has come in the last two months.
What makes junk bonds attractive right now, of course, is their yield. Junk bonds, on average, are paying more than 14 percent -- nearly three times current Treasury yields -- while investment grade bonds of big companies are yielding 7.5 percent, according to Merrill Lynch bond indexes. On top of that is the prospect that the prices of high-yield bonds will eventually rally if current concerns about the economy prove unwarranted. Mr. Greenspan has said he will do his best to prove that those concerns are overblown.
Martin S. Fridson, Merrill Lynch's chief high-yield strategist, thinks that things could get a little worse before they get better, but that Mr. Greenspan's signal "is a move in the right direction."
BUT Mr. Fridson warned that the high-yield recoveries of 1991 and of 1998 did not happen until short-term interest rates had fallen well below long-term rates, a sign that the economy was poised to grow nicely, thereby lessening credit concerns. Right now the yield curve is inverted, with the 5.35 percent yield on the Treasury's 10-year note well below the 6.04 percent on the Treasury's three-month bill. That is because the Fed has pushed short-term interest rates higher over the last year and a half, while investors, expecting growth and inflation to slow, will accept lower rates on longer maturities.
Still, Mr. Fridson said, high yield is very attractive, even if things do get worse before they get better.
Look at it this way: Even if it takes a year for high-yield bond prices to move up, with 14 percent interest rates, you are being paid nicely to wait.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Making A Soft Landing Even Softer

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
ALAN GREENSPAN tried to apply some verbal balm, but the hits just keep on coming.
And so the fourth quarter is not looking too hot. If you don't believe it, just ask Bank of America. Or Apple Computer. Or Motorola. Or Intel. Each company said last week that profits would be down, or nonexistent, in the final three months of the year. 
 That isn't all. Executives at companies that make things like autos, refrigerators and washing machines are fretting about a sharp slowdown in spending for consumer durable goods. And retailers are looking at a soft Christmas selling season.
In a speech last week, Mr. Greenspan asked everybody to take a deep breath. The economy has indeed cooled, he said, but is in better shape than it was two years ago. He even suggested the Federal Reserve Board might start lowering interest rates.
What's an investor to do? Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities, took some time last week to talk about that very topic. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. Mr. Greenspan seems pretty certain that the economy is going to avoid a hard landing. Do you agree?
 
A. Yes. In his speech, he basically said that what he was hoping for is happening.
Earlier this year, he was concerned that demand was growing faster than supply. For example, back in July he forecast a slowdown in consumer durable spending. That is happening. On Dec. 6 Mr. Greenspan proclaimed victory, that the imbalances that were there earlier have been corrected.
 
Q. Is an easier monetary policy the main reason you think the economy won't tip over into recession?
 
A. I buy the soft-landing scenario, even though right now it is looking softer and softer.
The Fed is still very, very powerful. In 1998, it only took three cuts of 25 basis points each to turn a climate of fear into the biggest spike ever in the Nasdaq composite index.
 
Q. Is an interest rate cut coming?
 
A. I think we will get at least a 25-basis-point cut in the first quarter. And it usually takes about two rate cuts to turn market sentiment around. Three rate cuts does it for sure. So, if you are betting that Mr. Greenspan will engineer a soft landing, I would not be worried about being in the stock market.
 
Q. People are worried that a slowdown in capital spending will be a drag on growth next year. Is that likely?
 
A. There is a theory out there that we have overinvested. But this is a huge country, and we could have setbacks in some areas and improvements in others.
I would not be surprised, for example, to see the energy patch increase capital spending next year. Even telecommunications may not be as weak as anticipated. AT&T Wireless just got $10 billion from NTT DoCoMo. Some of the proceeds will go to buy equipment from Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies.
Technology capital spending is quite different from more traditional capital spending. Whenever the economy fell into a recession in the past, capital spending stopped because there was no point in expanding capacity. But technology spending increases productivity and reduces costs. These are things you have to do to be competitive.
For much of the last year I have been doing monthly surveys of about 100 chief information officers. They have been unflinching, saying that capital spending will increase 18 percent next year. Now, it is conceivable that these people haven't gotten the word from their chief investment officers that budgets have been cut. But so far it looks like information technology budgets are intact.
 
Q. With the Fed guarding against a recession, what do you expect from the stock market?
 
A. I think the economy will be pretty soft in the first half of the year, and the market will be pretty volatile. But bond yields will continue to decline.
The first beneficiary should be the financial sector. Money center banks, regional banks will do well, particularly if people believe the Fed will avoid a hard landing. Retailers should do better and maybe even the auto stocks might start to stabilize. Health care also deserves to be overweighted. Technology will make a comeback, but it will be the infrastructure companies building wireless, Internet and fiber optic networks.
There are lots of good opportunities, but because of the tech wreck and the Nasdaq plunge, people have been forced to become long-term investors. We will be lucky to get 8 percent to 10 percent returns from the stock market over the next five years. The last five years were an extraordinary period.

HEADLINE: Take Sugar, Eggs, Beliefs . . . And Aim

BYLINE: By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA 

 BODY:
TIME was when being embarrassed meant having egg on your face. These days, it's more likely to mean having a pie in it. Just ask Frank E. Loy, the under secretary of state for global affairs. Last month in The Hague, as he was delivering his daily briefing at the United Nations climate conference, a protester hit him with a cream pie.
The incident was the latest in a series of high-profile pastry attacks. The premier of Victoria, Australia, Steve Bracks, got whapped in October at the opening of the Melbourne Museum. In August, the Prince Edward Island Pie Brigade planted its weapon of choice on the Canadian premier, Jean Chretian. Other victims this year include Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Michel Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund managing director. 
 Until recently, pieing had gone the way of streaking. Its last major casualty was Anita Bryant in 1977. "Everyone associates this with the Yippies and the politics of spectacle," said Paul Lyons, author of "New Left, New Right and the Legacy of the Streets" (Temple University Press, 1996). But ever since a Belgian contingent fired a volley of fluffy projectiles at Bill Gates in 1998, it's been one fling after another.
Obscurity is no defense. Minnesota State Senator Carol Flynn was hit with a lemon coconut cream pie for her role in the rerouting of a local highway. Minutes after being crowned Miss Rodeo America 2000 in Las Vegas, Brandy DeJongh got mushed by a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
"I predicted this," said Aron Kay, the godfather of the pie-tossing set, who put out hits on such notables as McGeorge Bundy, G. Gordon Liddy, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and William F. Buckley Jr. in the 1970's and 80's. "Everyone has someone who needs to get pied."
The use of pies as ordnance, of course, is a hallmark of silent comedy; the shtick culminated with the hurling of more than 3,000 pies in the 1927 Laurel and Hardy film "Battle of the Century."
Today, such innocence has given way to more political purposes. Exactly 30 years have passed since the modern pie movement's opening salvo: a 1970 assault on the Senate Commission on Obscenity and Pornography by Tom Forcade, the founder of High Times magazine.
Pie-throwing is one way of venting anger at a world that has become maddeningly complex and intrusive, said Alexander Bloom, a professor of American history at Wheaton College in Massachusetts and co-editor of "Takin' It to the Streets: A Sixties Reader" (Oxford University Press, 1995). "There is this basic undercurrent of people who are feeling that all these forces beyond their control -- from the I.M.F. to the W.T.O. to Y2K to H.M.O.'s -- are in charge of their lives and are operating outside of the political process," he said. "I think people feel frustrated."
Pieing may also be part of a resurgent wave of political theater, typified by the protests at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. "Over the last year, a movement that I thought was thoroughly dead is not dead," said Barbara Epstein, a professor of the history of consciousness at the University of California at Santa Cruz. "Pie-throwing is part of that movement."
In general, pieing is a leftist activity with anarchist overtones. Targets tend to be identified with big business or forces seen as hostile to the environment, public health and/or human rights. The manifesto of the Biotic Baking Brigade, a San Francisco-based pie-throwing group whose members employ such pseudonyms as "Agent Apple" and "Agent Pecan," inveighs against "the technocrats who dominate industrial society."
Thus, the B.B.B. has creamed Monsanto's chief executive, Robert Shapiro, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and Martina McGlaughlin, director of the biotechnology program at the University of California at Davis. "We are working toward a time when corporate crooks and their lackeys in government and the nonprofit sector will have to leave this bioregion for fear of our delicious mischief," the B.B.B. pledges.
"The right wing doesn't have that kind of sense of humor," observed Professor Epstein. "If you're concerned with law and order, you're probably not going to be throwing pies."
Professor Bloom added: "It's assault, clearly, but pies defuse the anger and identify the target as a clown. If someone dumped feces or blood or mock toxic waste on you, that would be a lot more threatening."
Most victims treat their attacks with good humor. When the pie aimed at Secretary Glickman only grazed him, he joked, "That was not a very balanced meal." An amused Ms. McGlaughlin accused her ostensibly anti-biotech assailants of hypocrisy: "The pies were store-bought, so they were filled with genetically modified food components."
Not everyone is cracking a smile over this merry pranksterism. Three B.B.B. agents who pied San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown in 1998 to protest his policies toward the homeless were convicted on misdemeanor battery charges and sentenced to six months in prison. After Tim Eyman was pied in June for sponsoring a Washington State initiative to reduce funds for public transit, he complained of corneal abrasion and chemical burns from the warhead's fruit filling.
"I think it's terrible," said the comedian Soupy Sales, who estimates he has been on the receiving end of some 20,000 pies during his career. "Leave pies to the professional idiots. Better to sit back and enjoy them with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Mark D. Greenberg;
Invesco Leisure Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
LIKE many other people visiting New York City last week, Mark Greenberg came to shop. He wandered the aisles of various stores, looking at jewelry at Tiffany, toys at F.A.O. Schwarz and clothing at Ralph Lauren and Saks Fifth Avenue. But he is no ordinary holiday shopper.
"I look at my shopping as research," said Mr. Greenberg, who has run the $550 million Invesco Leisure fund for nearly five years. "Eventually, something happens, like the market beats up a company for the wrong reason, and I'll have done my work in advance." 
 Evidently, his shopping trips have benefited investors. The fund returned 25.1 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, taking first place in the mid-capitalization blend category, which returned 6.7 percent. It also outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which was up 12.4 percent, annualized, over the same period.
Mr. Greenberg, 43, takes fun seriously. "I'm looking for the best growth companies in the leisure industry worldwide," he said from his Denver office, which is filled with Beanie Babies, Rugrats, Barbie dolls and more than 100 toys and stuffed animals. His office, of course, is enormously popular with his daughter, Elizabeth, who is 6, and his colleagues' children.
What qualifies as a "leisure" investment? Mr. Greenberg picks the 80 or so companies in the fund from about 500 in the media, entertainment, hotel, casino, jewelry, toys and sporting goods industries, among others -- "pretty much all the fun things in life," he said.
Just 20 stocks account for 60 percent of the fund. The other 60 stocks are on what he calls his "farm team." He monitors them with an eye toward buying more shares.
Unlike many other money managers, Mr. Greenberg does no computerized screening. He knows the leisure industries from his 17 years as a media and entertainment analyst. His best source of information is the trade press -- Variety, Multichannel News, Casino Journal and Gaming and Lodging Today, among others.
He spends about 25 percent of his time on the road, sometimes visiting company managers, both at the top and down in the divisions. But he also may be found talking to dealers in casinos or quizzing the Toys "R" Us sales staff about best sellers. "I do a lot of shopping," he said. "I'll tell people I'm buying jewelry for my wife or video games for my nephew, and see what they recommend."
Quarterly earnings reports rarely cause him to act abruptly. "I don't hyperventilate over the numbers," he said. He may buy shares after an earnings shortfall causes a stock to plummet, if he believes the company's outlook is good. His long-term approach is reflected in the fund's low turnover rate of 30 percent a year.
Next, Mr. Greenberg dissects the company's finances. He prefers companies with earnings that are growing at least 50 percent faster than the S.& P. 500's, which he says will grow just 7 percent annually over the coming five years. The average earnings growth rate of the companies he holds is more than 20 percent.
He also looks for rising profit margins and profitable investments of company capital. "Many companies can generate a lot of free cash but don't know what to do with it," he said. "If management does that well, it pays off on a multiyear basis."
But he wants bargains, too -- generally, companies that sell for 25 to 50 percent less than the market's price-to-earnings multiple of 26.
Mr. Greenberg sees potential in casino stocks. "There's not much new capacity coming on in the next couple of years in most markets," he said, "and people like to gamble."
The fund owns shares of Harrah's Entertainment, the casino operator that caters to the middle class. "Harrah's is very good in treating people nicely and making them feel like big shots," Mr. Greenberg said. The company expects each casino to increase its earnings each year, he said. Its overall profit margin is 26.3 percent, up from 23.4 percent in 1997. He bought shares in December 1998 at an average of $14.54; they now trade at $26.
He also forecasts big growth in advertising, which he calls a "misunderstood industry" that is less dependent on a strong economy and on advertising fees than is commonly believed. One favorite is the Omnicom Group. "Over the last couple of years, John Wren, the C.E.O., has successfully pushed the company into nontraditional advertising businesses like direct marketing," Mr. Greenberg said. Its profit margin is 14.3 percent, up from 12.9 percent in 1997, he added.
Investors believe that companies slash their advertising budgets as the economy weakens, he explained, but such cutbacks would not have as large an impact on Omnicom because of its diversified operations. The fund bought the stock in April 1996 at an average price of $22.16; it now trades at $87.94.
IN the toy sector, Mr. Greenberg bought shares of Mattel in May, despite estimates that the company's profit margin would be 11 percent this year, versus 17 percent in 1997. "It's a wonderful brand name in the toy industry," he said, "but management has made several major mistakes in the last few years." He cited the 1999 acquisition of the Learning Company, a software and video game business that Mattel had trouble managing.
During the spring of this year, Mr. Greenberg visited Robert A. Eckert, who succeeded Jill E. Barad as Mattel's chief executive, and was very impressed by his analysis of the company's problems and his plans for management and marketing changes. Mr. Greenberg sees the stock as a bargain. "Expectations for Mattel are, to put it mildly, very low," he said. "But if they can get close to their profit margins from a few years ago, they could double their earnings and triple their stock price by 2003."
The fund bought shares at $12.50; they now trade at $14.03.

HEADLINE: CMGI Can Defy Gravity Only So Long

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
FIRST came the flashing video images. Then the dancers in psychedelic body paint, the New Age pianist, the opera singer in a white fur stole who descended on a construction crane and three men in gas masks who banged on garbage cans to disco music. White smoke billowed. Finally, the lights went up to reveal the Boys Choir of Harlem, singing spirituals.
This sumptuous show last fall at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan represented the avant-garde not of theater but of Internet hype. It introduced a new home page and ad campaign by AltaVista, the search engine, to about 100 journalists and Wall Street analysts, and laid the groundwork for an initial public offering. AltaVista -- prompted by its new owner, CMGI, one of the most successful incubators of Internet companies -- promised to take on Yahoo with "a portal as powerful and immediate as life itself." 
 To do so, it would spend $120 million on a new slogan, "Smart is beautiful."
These days, that strategy does not look very smart, and the prospects for the CMGI empire are not very beautiful.
Hopes for AltaVista's offering were dashed by the tumble in Internet stocks last spring. CMGI is closing other units, laying off employees and facing tough questions about the viability of the business behind the flashing lights and new-economy rhetoric.
In recent weeks, an increasing number of investors, analysts and even CMGI executives have wondered aloud whether David S. Wetherell, CMGI's chairman, founder and driving force, was too emboldened by his early success -- largely investments in some pioneering Internet companies that earned stratospheric returns. Now that the market will not let him profit by taking companies public, these skeptics are asking whether CMGI has the vision, strategy and management skill to make its sprawling portfolio worth even the sum of its parts.
"CMGI was the ultimate bull market creation," said Gene DeRose, president of Jupiter Media Metrix, the research company. CMGI, he said, claimed credit for what was just extraordinary good luck. "It epitomizes strategy in hindsight," he added, "rather than a disciplined process for incubating and managing companies."
Mr. Wetherell, 46, says the company is taking the steps that are needed to thrive in tough times. "Our foundation is solid and mission is clear," he wrote by e-mail. "After five years of hypergrowth, we, like the market over all, are taking a step back -- planning the coming steps and phases that can and will maximize growth and enhance investor support."
A year ago, CMGI was the model incubator, a new corporate creature somewhere between a conglomerate and a venture capital fund. It started some companies, invested in others and kept operating control of many, hoping to take all of them public. Mr. Wetherell was hailed as the "Warren Buffett of the Web," by The Daily News of New York, and CMGI ended 1999 with a market value of $41 billion. It was the best-performing United States stock of the preceding five years, returning 4,921 percent.
In its fiscal year ended July 2000, CMGI lost $1.4 billion on revenue of $898 million.
Today, CMGI's main companies, like Alta Vista and Engage Technologies, an Internet advertising business, are scaling back. The chief executives of both of those companies resigned recently. Smaller companies are being sold or merged. And CMGI's shares are off 91 percent this year, to a value of about $3.8 billion, closing on Friday at $11.94.
"A year and a half ago, people were saying this was the best business model ever," said Vik Mehta, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. "Now the financial markets are telling them they will go out of business."
Mr. Wetherell, whose 11.2 percent stake in CMGI is now worth just $430 million, still has defenders. They say he is a tough executive with an eye for financial detail, but he also understood that the early days of the Internet demanded growth, not profits.
"Most people thought he came by all this by accident, but he is a guy who has been very thoughtful and very strategic early on," said David Bohnett, co-founder and former chairman of Geocities, the online community that was one of CMGI's greatest successes. "You can't blame him for taking advantage of the opportunities in a bull market."
Mr. Wetherell declined to be interviewed for this article, choosing instead to answer some questions by e-mail. And he ordered many CMGI directors and executives not to respond to interview requests. But more than 20 current or former directors and executives, all of whom insisted on anonymity, were willing to discuss CMGI and Mr. Wetherell. Several former employees also took the risk of speaking, despite the confidentiality provisions that CMGI regularly writes into its severance agreements; they, too, requested anonymity.
From those interviews, a new picture emerges -- not so much of a company working from a visionary blueprint but of one in which decisions on everything from hiring to strategy are made on the spur of the moment -- and reversed just as fast. Many moves were made largely to generate optimistic news releases, helping the stock to surge, the executives said.
Some companies were started on a whim, and when they failed to fulfill Mr. Wetherell's grand hopes, they were transformed, renamed or merged. Of CMGI's 15 majority-owned companies at the beginning of the year, four were merged into other CMGI entities and two were closed. Of 40 companies in its venture capital portfolio, five were closed and four were sold.
Indeed, even as incubators have been promoted as a way to merge small-company entrepreneurialism with big-company resources, it is not clear that having CMGI as a parent is worth the trouble. The effort to encourage intra-company deals results as often in unpleasant compromises as it does in powerful synergy, executives said. And the oversight from CMGI headquarters in Andover, Mass., has limited value, they added, because Mr. Wetherell seldom hires experienced managers. Most of the few large-company veterans who signed on, like Neil Braun, the former president of NBC Television, and Jeff Cunningham, the former publisher of Forbes, left within months.
"CMGI is one of those great transitional companies that is not meant to last," one former top CMGI executive said. "They were meant to aggregate all the buzz of the new economy. They are not a General Motors but a Tucker" -- a reference to the failed upstart auto company memorialized in Francis Ford Coppola's 1988 film.
Mr. Wetherell contends that CMGI is far more than a dream.
"I try to use technology to solve tough problems that have broad market appeal," he wrote. "This provides high barriers to entry, providing there is a first-mover advantage and proper leverage from other CMGI companies. When all of these elements exist, we have a formula for success."
 
The Beginnings
From Mailing Lists To the Internet
In its short history, CMGI achieved astounding returns by staying one step ahead of the Internet explosion.
In 1994, CMG Information Services was a tiny company that sold mailing lists of college professors to textbook publishers. Mr. Wetherell, who started out in computer programming, acquired the company in a leveraged buyout in 1986. In trying to sell books online in 1993, it developed what became one of the first Web browsers, Booklink, which it sold a year later to America Online for stock it later sold for $70 million.
With that windfall, Mr. Wetherell began investing in other Internet companies. In its most significant move, Dan Nova, the only CMGI employee with venture capital experience, bought a search technology from Carnegie Mellon University for CMGI that became the basis for Lycos, now the Web's fourth-biggest site.
Mr. Wetherell also invested in Geocities, which enabled people to build home pages about their interests. He sold it to Yahoo in 1999 for $3.6 billion. But early on, he wanted to be more than an investor. So he started a series of companies that CMGI incubated, most based on the premise that the Web created the ideal environment to merge advertising and direct marketing. Engage, for example, was started in 1995 as a network of sites that would keep track of the topics that interested users, though not of who they were. A Web-surfing soccer mom would then see banner ads for minivans, while an aging stockbroker would see sports-car pitches.
As his investments expanded, the potential grew for CMGI's companies to cooperate with one another.
But it was just as likely for them to compete, and conflicts arose quickly. Mr. Wetherell announced, for example, that Geocities would contribute information about its users to Engage's data base, but Geocities spurned his pressure to do so. And he started Planet Direct, which offered a comprehensive Web portal -- seemingly a direct rival of both Lycos and Geocities, though it sought partnerships with each. Many executives at CMGI's Web site service companies complain that they were subjected to extraordinary pressure to do unattractive deals with corporate cousins.
Mr. Wetherell wrote that CMGI's policy was that companies deal with one another at arm's length.
The conflicts rose to a grand scale in January 1999, when Yahoo made an unsolicited bid for Geocities. Mr. Wetherell tried to orchestrate a combination with Lycos instead, but when he could not reach an accord with Robert Davis, Lycos's strong-willed chief executive, he backed the Yahoo bid.
"It was like a food fight," one bemused Geocities board member said. "Bob wanted to do what was good for Lycos, and Dave wanted to do what was good for CMGI."
Indeed, several Geocities directors said Mr. Wetherell notably did not recuse himself from voting on the merger transactions, despite the seeming conflict of his serving on Lycos's board.
Mr. Wetherell says he offered to recuse himself but the board did not ask him to; his pressure, he added, encouraged Geocities management to conclude the deal with Yahoo rather than accept a lower bid from another company.
These issues burst into public view the next month, when Lycos agreed to merge with the Home Shopping Network and other properties controlled by USA Networks. At a board meeting, one member recalled, Mr. Wetherell not only voted for the USA deal, but also stood up and applauded when it was approved.
Two days later, after Lycos's shares plunged 31 percent, Mr. Wetherell voiced public doubts about the merger; he soon resigned from Lycos's board and fought successfully to have the deal aborted.
To the public, it was a curious display of indecision, but to those who knew Mr. Wetherell, it was a reflection of impulsiveness. "Dave was a big believer in riding the wave," said a former chief executive of a CMGI company. "If auctions became hot, he would demand that auctions be front and center. Now."
Mr. Nova, the venture capitalist who worked at CMGI early on, said the market rewarded Mr. Wetherell's instincts. "The rising tide covered up any mistakes we may have made," he said. "Every spreadsheet we ran at the time was off by a magnitude of five or six times. No one expected Lycos and Geocities to be worth billions."
And Mr. Wetherell, an eye on the market, was convinced that speed and growth were paramount. Inside CMGI, employees summarized the strategy with the initials G.B.F., for Get Big Fast. "At our management meetings," one former executive said, "any time Dave heard of a deal or other good news, he would say, 'Sounds like a press release to me.' "
To maintain momentum, Mr. Wetherell needed Wall Street. "The currency he did deals with was his stock," one former executive said. "Keeping the stock going was a theme that went through a lot of our conversations."
 
The Upswing
Expansion Binge Brings Strains
Mr. Wetherell's success at killing the Lycos-USA merger, and the resulting publicity, appeared to embolden him, former executives said. The company's surging stock price, along with the cash it made from selling Yahoo stock it received for Geocities and from other investments, allowed him to embark on an expansion binge. CMGI bought 18 companies in 1999 and 5 more this year.
The expansion was a strain. CMGI hired a head of human resources and created strategy and business development units, but Mr. Wetherell continued to make the key decisions.
"When I got inside, it was clear they weren't really an operating company," one former senior executive said. "They didn't have guys who could sit across the table and say, 'I have seen this before.' "
Another former executive described CMGI headquarters as a "giant chicken with its head cut off."
"They were working crazy hours, but it would take a long time to get things done," he added.
Mr. Wetherell wrote that CMGI is shifting the sort of executives it hires from "entrepreneurial types" to those with broader experience. But some of those hired from big companies did not work out because they found the Internet to be "foreign territory."
All last year, Mr. Wetherell kept pressing companies for growth and talked often of taking on America Online, Yahoo and DoubleClick. But there were signs that the slingshots of CMGI's giant-killers were empty.
Consider the effort to best AOL through Planet Direct. It was meant to provide content and services in partnership with providers of Internet access, like telephone companies. But the company attracted few service providers.
As the business languished, Mr. Wetherell pressed management last year to spend $100 million to buy another company that would transform Planet Direct, renamed My Way, into something else. Earlier this year, My Way bought Zip2, which operates Web sites for newspapers, from AltaVista, by then also owned by CMGI.
Engage, Mr. Wetherell's pet project in targeted advertising, was also in trouble. The few advertisers who tried the system found only modest benefits. Mr. Wetherell bought eight Internet advertising companies and merged them into Engage, broadening its scope and giving it a new lease on life -- for a while.
Icast was another company that transformed itself several times. In February 1999, Mr. Wetherell hired Mr. Braun, formerly of NBC, to spend $100 million to develop a company that would use sound and video over the Internet. (Yahoo had just bought Broadcast.com, a similar company.)
There was little agreement, however, about what Icast should actually do. Mr. Braun wanted to focus on live events and celebrity Web sites. He bought Signatures, which sells celebrity-endorsed merchandise, from Sony. But Mr. Wetherell saw Icast as the multimedia equivalent of Geocities, where users could post their own sound and video. He soon merged Icast into another of his struggling companies, zinezone, a knockoff of About.com, which features hobby and other topical sites.
Nine months later, Mr. Braun was dismissed. In a federal lawsuit filed last December, he contends that Mr. Wetherell did not honor his contract, which he says was worth $30 million to $50 million because of the run-up in CMGI's stock. CMGI denies the accusation.
Far and away Mr. Wetherell's biggest bet was in July 1999, when he bought 85 percent of AltaVista from Compaq Computer for CMGI shares worth $2.3 billion. It was a curious deal: AltaVista was a big rival of Lycos, in which CMGI still held a major stake.
But CMGI was under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission to expand its operating businesses, lest it be categorized as a mutual fund and subject to strict regulations. Moreover, relations with Lycos were strained, and Mr. Wetherell figured that he needed a general-purpose portal to tie together all his other companies.
The strategy turned out to be flawed. Despite its reputation as a very good search engine, AltaVista has never established itself as a provider of a broader range of information, former executives said. It did not attract enough traffic to help other CMGI companies, and they did not have enough to help AltaVista.
Still, as the Nasdaq was cresting, CMGI's stock reached a record high, $163.50, on Jan. 3.
 
The Downturn
A Stock Tumble, And Cutbacks
As the Nasdaq index began sinking in April, so did CMGI stock. But even as that slide turned into a free fall through the spring and summer, the company continued its expansion. It started a company jointly with Compaq to provide employee benefit information on the Web. And it agreed to spend $7.5 million a year to put the name CMGI Field on a football stadium being built for the New England Patriots. Former employees say that move was made largely to drive up the stock price, because none of the company's consumer businesses use the CMGI name.
As the year wore on, operating problems increased, especially as the market weakened for Internet advertising.
Engage was hit especially hard, although CMGI did what it could to shore up the problems with deals from its affiliates. In the quarter ended in July, it met analysts' forecasts for $67 million in revenue -- but only because Compaq bought $13 million worth of advertising software and two other CMGI affiliates spent $7 million.
By the next quarter, Engage had to face reality. It laid off 175 people in September. In the quarter ended in October, Engage said it would post revenue of less than $42 million, and Paul L. Schaut, its chief executive, resigned.
The online retailers in CMGI's venture capital portfolio faced more bitter medicine. Unable to raise more money from outside venture funds, and unwilling to use more of its own cash, CMGI let Furniture.com, Mothernature.com and Productopia.com simply die off.
In September, CMGI announced a restructuring, saying it would focus on five business lines and on venture capital. It would chop the number of companies it operated from 17 to less than 10 through mergers or sales. The new goal would be profitability at all of its units.
That set in motion a huge shuffling of the portfolio.
My Way, based in Andover, was simply merged with Zip2's operations in Mountain View, Calif. In reality, My Way's original advertising-supported business closed entirely.
AltaVista abandoned its effort to be a vast consumer portal and focused on selling its search software to corporations to use on their own sites. It laid off 225 people. Rodney W. Schrock, its chief executive, quit in October.
Mr. Wetherell said the moves were not meant to abandon either AltaVista or My Way, but to focus more on revenue from licensing software, which is more dependable than that from advertising.
"We are concentrating on what works in both today's and tomorrow's Internet," Mr. Wetherell wrote. "Advertising will continue to be a major force for the Web, but it will be slower to develop than other revenue sources. When it does take off more strongly, we are well positioned to benefit."
Curiously, even through the fall, Icast, which depended largely on advertising, continued to hire senior executives and proceeded with its expansive plan to build an entertainment site. But in mid-October, CMGI suddenly decided to stop financing Icast and gave its management a few weeks to find a buyer. After fruitless discussions with prospects like the News Corporation, Icast closed. "It was very abrupt," one former Icast executive said. "It wasn't thought out. They were in panic mode."
The bad news was not over. Last month, the company warned analysts that revenue in the quarter ended in October would actually decline, a mark of dishonor for a growth-driven Internet company. It promised to reduce its burn rate from $225 million a quarter last July to $45 million next July. (It will announce its complete results this Thursday.)
Cutbacks, meanwhile, continued. CMGI closed 1stUp, its advertising-supported Internet service offered free to consumers, and it hired investment bankers to sell Raging Bull, a series of chat boards about stocks, which has been a personal favorite of Mr. Wetherell.
One director said the board's main priority was to encourage Mr. Wetherell to make sure he had enough cash on hand to stay solvent. Mr. Wetherell did not raise as much money when the stock was at its peak as the board had hoped, this person said, though CMGI's $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities does provide a buffer.
The mood in Andover is grim. "It's a changed and beaten company," said one executive who left this year. "It has none of the bravado and world-domination schemes that had been there a year earlier."
One current top executive said CMGI's low stock price was prompting employees to abandon worthless options and seek their fortunes elsewhere.
Mr. Wetherell, moreover, wrote that he began looking for a chief operating officer last month because "we are getting to critical mass in size."
But even analysts are asking what that critical mass has become now that the quick I.P.O. profits are gone. CMGI says it will be a confederation of operating companies, perhaps a new-economy General Electric. But CMGI is missing at least one key piece of the G.E. formula: None of CMGI's businesses are No. 1 in their categories, and few are even No. 2.
"The market had evaluated Wetherell on his ability to identify great new concepts," said Lowell Singer, an analyst at Robertson Stephens. "Now the rules have changed. He is being graded on his ability to run them as businesses."

Chart: "The Sum Also Falls"
At its peak in January, CMGI's stock sold for more than twice the per-share value of its sprawling portfolio of Internet companies (both operating subsidiaries and investments). By November, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs, the holding company's shares had fallen to less than the value of its holdings. Since the last estimate, CMGI shares have fallen in half again and its publicly traded holdings have tumbled even more.

He Knows How to Torment Presidents. Who's Next?

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN a little-noticed speech to American veterans of the Persian Gulf war last year, former President George Bush joked that it was a "sore spot with me" to be "out of work while Saddam Hussein still has a job."
"It's not fair," Mr. Bush complained.
Mr. Hussein was supposed to be long gone by now -- or at least inexorably weakened by an erosion of support at home and by crippling sanctions from abroad. But eight years after Mr. Bush lost his bid to be re-elected president, Mr. Hussein is not only firmly in command but also emerging again as a leader with whom much of the world feels it can do business. 
 The system of international arms inspections of his facilities that was a linchpin of American strategy at the end of the war collapsed two years ago. Soaring oil prices have given Mr. Hussein much more hard currency to play with. Sanctions have eroded badly, as ministers from foreign governments and foreign investors come and go in Baghdad. And the Palestinian-Israeli crisis has allowed Mr. Hussein to position himself as a champion of the Palestinian cause. Last week, the Security Council, over Washington's initial objections, agreed to give Iraq new leeway in spending billions of dollars in oil proceeds.
The dictum inside the Clinton White House in its final weeks is to do anything to avoid a military confrontation with Iraq before Mr. Clinton hands back the keys to the Oval Office. It goes without saying that Mr. Hussein will be around to torment and test whichever of the presidents-in-waiting is inaugurated in January, just as he did Mr. Clinton. Just three hours after Mr. Clinton returned to the White House from his inaugural balls in January 1993, Mr. Hussein's radar was in action, locking on to American warplanes over Iraq and prompting American retaliation.
If Gov. George W. Bush emerges triumphant, there will be an uncanny symmetry in American policy. The son may get the chance to make things right in his father's name -- and with some of the same people who made the decisions to wage -- and end -- the war itself.
By all accounts, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Iraq crisis, is Governor Bush's first choice to become secretary of state, and, therefore, the point man in the struggle to salvage the remnants of a policy of containment begun in the first Bush administration.
But Mr. Powell's presence would be no guarantee of a robust approach, if past performance is any guide. His role as the reluctant warrior from the start of that crisis is well documented. Even Brent Scowcroft, who was President Bush's national security adviser, has criticized General Powell's initial desire to limit the American response to Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait to economic sanctions. "I was frankly appalled at the undertone of the discussion, which suggested resignation to the invasion and even adaptation to a fait accompli," General Scowcroft wrote in "A World Transformed," the memoirs he wrote with President Bush, of the first military briefing after the invasion.
General Powell argued to end the war without carrying it to Baghdad, and without arming Shiites and Kurdish rebels even though President Bush had called on them to rise up against Mr. Hussein. And he refused to believe American intelligence reports that Mr. Hussein's Republican Guard divisions were crushing Shiite and Kurdish rebels, arguing -- incorrectly -- that the divisions had been destroyed.
After the war, General Powell, like President Bush and others in the administration, justified the decision not to overthrow Mr. Hussein, claiming that the United States would have had to occupy Baghdad, militarily and indefinitely, and risk the dismemberment of Iraq. The general began to talk about Mr. Hussein in medical terms, likening him at one point to a recurrent toothache and at another to a kidney stone that, however painful, would eventually pass.
For his part, Richard Cheney, who was secretary of defense, was not quite so reluctant to go to war, but concurred on when to stop fighting. But that was then, and throughout his presidential campaign, Governor Bush said little about what he would do to punish Mr. Hussein except to vow to strengthen the weak opposition-in-exile against him and to strike at Iraqi sites used to produce weapons of mass destruction.
Condoleezza Rice, Governor Bush's apparent choice for national security adviser, has done little to clarify matters, saying in an interview before the election, "The thing that should be clear to Saddam Hussein is that if there is a George W. Bush administration, he is going to be taken very, very seriously."
Then there is the possibility that Vice President Al Gore, rather than Governor Bush, will become president. Mr. Gore has said publicly that he will take a tougher position than Mr. Clinton's. He has met with Iraqi opposition figures (even though he is said to have little confidence in their ability to overthrow Mr. Hussein) and has pressed to have Mr. Hussein named an international war criminal. After Iraq refused to allow United Nations on-site weapons inspections in December 1998, prompting the United States to launch intensive air strikes against Iraq, Leon S. Fuerth, Mr. Gore's national security adviser, argued for a number of punitive actions against Mr. Hussein, including the destruction of some of his key political and military installations. Mr. Fuerth was overruled.
Mr. Gore also, as a senator in 1991, declared that "the only way we can hope for long-term relief from Saddam Hussein is if Saddam Hussein ceases to hold power, and if his Baathist regime is dismantled as well." That maximalist stance, said Mr. Fuerth, "is one that would have to be revisited."
In the end, whoever is president will have to reconcile an inherent contradiction in American policy -- trying to reinstate international arms inspections and to overthrow Mr. Hussein at the same time. He will have to decide whether to use some of the money authorized by Congress for arming the Iraqi opposition groups. It may turn out that the current policy, which might be labeled messy containment, will continue to be seen as the only real option.
"We have to realize that the Iraqi opposition has no credibility in the region," said retired Gen. Anthony Zinni of the Marines, who until recently headed the American military command in charge of the Persian Gulf region. "Containment is hard, but when you don't have popular support or the political will to do anything else, you're stuck with it."

California Screaming

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
California's deregulated power industry, in which producers can sell electricity for whatever the traffic will bear, was supposed to deliver cheaper, cleaner power. But instead the state faces an electricity shortage so severe that the governor has turned off the lights on the official Christmas tree -- a shortage that has proved highly profitable to power companies, and raised suspicions of market manipulation.
The experience raises questions about deregulation. And more broadly, it is a warning about the dangers of placing blind faith in markets.
 True, part of California's problem is an unexpected surge in electricity demand, the byproduct of a booming economy. It's possible that the crisis would have happened even without deregulation. 
 But probably not. In the bad old days, monopolistic power companies were guaranteed a good profit even if their industry had excess capacity. So they built more capacity than they needed, enough to meet even unexpectedly high demand. But in the deregulated market, where prices fluctuate constantly, companies knew that if they overinvested, prices and profits would plunge. So they were reluctant to build new plants -- which is why unexpectedly strong demand has led to shortages and soaring prices.
Now you could say that in the long run there is nothing wrong with that. Building extra generating capacity was costly, and the costs were passed on to consumers; while prices may fluctuate in a system with less slack, on average consumers will pay less. In fact, textbook economics suggests that it's actually a good thing that electricity prices skyrocket when supply runs short: that's what gives the power companies an incentive to invest. And so you could argue that no public intervention is warranted -- indeed, that the caps that still place an upper limit on electricity prices only worsen the problem, that we should rely on market competition to solve the crisis.
But how competitive is the electricity market? What makes California's power crisis politically explosive is the suspicion that it's not just about inadequate capacity, but also about artificially inflated prices.
How might market manipulation work? Suppose that it's a hot July, with air-conditioners across the state running full blast and the power industry near the limits of its capacity. If some of that capacity suddenly went off line for whatever reason, the resulting shortage would send wholesale electricity prices sky high. So a large producer could actually increase its profits by inventing technical problems that shut down some of its generators, thereby driving up the price it gets on its remaining output.
Does this really happen? A recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Severin Borenstein, James Bushnell and Frank Wolak cites evidence that exactly this kind of market manipulation took place in Britain before 1996 and in California during the summers of 1998 and 1999.
You wouldn't normally expect this to happen in colder months, when demand is lower. Still, state officials have understandably become suspicious about California's current power emergency -- an emergency precipitated by the odd fact that about a quarter of the state's generating capacity is off line as the result of either scheduled repairs or breakdowns.
Maybe California power companies aren't rigging electricity prices. But they clearly have both the means and the incentive to do so -- and you have to wonder why the deregulators didn't worry about this, why they didn't ask seemingly obvious questions about whether the market they proposed to create would really work as advertised.
And maybe that is the broader lesson of the debacle: Don't rush into a market solution when there are serious questions about whether the market will work. Both economic analysis and British experience should have rung warning bells about California's deregulation scheme; but those warnings were ignored -- just as similar warnings are being ignored by enthusiasts for market solutions for everything from prescription drug coverage to education.

HEADLINE: The Election;
Five Lessons We Had No Time to Learn

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DISTRACTED by nearly five weeks of squabbling over who really won, the American public has never had a chance to catch its breath and ponder the presidential election itself. Given the latest twists, that's particularly true. Now, the nonelection could run into the holidays -- or beyond.
But there are several overlooked surprises and fresh patterns that carry important clues as to how Republicans and Democrats might govern and how the parties might position themselves. Here are some undigested lessons of the election of 2000. 

The Unshakable Black Vote
The biggest disappointment for Republicans is that for all of Gov. George W. Bush's efforts to attract African-American voters and to present himself as an inclusive and "compassionate" candidate, his support among those voters was the weakest of any Republican nominee since at least 1976. Mr. Bush captured only 8 percent of the black vote, exit polls show, while Bob Dole drew 12 percent in 1996 and President George Bush attracted 10 percent in 1992.
Republicans never expected to make huge gains among blacks. And Mr. Bush's moves to court those voters were partly designed to make him more appealing to moderates. Even so, many Republicans said that given Mr. Bush's extraordinary efforts to reach out to minorities, including his address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and his parading of minorities at the national convention, they hardly expected such a repudiation.
"This is a blot on the party of Abraham Lincoln," said Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, a Republican. "The first order of business for Republicans in Congress, governors and a Republican administration must be to determine what went wrong and why."
Many party strategists said the energetic turnout among blacks -- and their abandonment of some Republicans -- provided a crucial boost for Mr. Gore and took a toll on Republicans in several close governors' races this year and in 1998.
Despite Mr. Bush's plan to appoint Colin L. Powell as secretary of state and Condoleezza Rice as his national security adviser, several Republicans said that if he becomes president Mr. Bush will have to take more steps to bring blacks into the fold. But resentment is running high among black voters who believe they were disenfranchised, and a Bush victory could further galvanize minorities against Republicans in 2002.
Mr. Bush has less to worry about among other minorities; he performed far better among Hispanic voters than he did among blacks, pulling in about 31 percent compared with 21 percent for Mr. Dole in 1996.
 
The Issues Issue
Democrats have reason to worry as well. Mr. Bush's effort to mimic President Clinton by appropriating the other party's issues seemed to work. While most voters still identified more closely with Democrats on major issues, Republicans significantly narrowed the gap, and were viewed as nearly as credible on issues like education, prescription drugs and Social Security.
As a result, Republicans may feel greater pressure to work with Democrats on issues that Republicans have usually stayed away from. The paper-thin partisan divides in the House and Senate will certainly compound the pressure to find common policy ground.
"If you have a Republican president, he and the Congress will be on the spot to do things in a mostly Republican way with mostly Republicans or in a bipartisan way with more Democrats and fewer Republicans and cutting out the right wing," said Steve Elmendorf, chief of staff to Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader. "That's the ultimate choice."
The risk for Democrats is that voters will continue to identify Republicans with policies that have long been the province of Democrats. One such issue was taxes. Democrats were so determined to condemn Mr. Bush's huge tax-cut plan that their own proposals to cut taxes were overshadowed. So voters who wanted any kind of tax relief favored the Republicans by far wider margins than they did in the past two presidential elections.
Democrats now face an uphill battle to convince the public that they favor some proposals to cut taxes. "It is to our decided disadvantage to go through this next Congress being perceived as arguing against any and every tax cut," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. "That is not our position but one that came through to most voters."
 
Luring Labor
Labor unions turned out in full force for Mr. Gore and the Democrats, and some officials say Mr. Gore and the party are so indebted that the Democrats will have no choice but to bow to labor's agenda by fighting such Republican initiatives as "paycheck protection," which is intended to prevent union members from allowing money from their paychecks to be sent to candidates.
Unions have been so energetic for Democrats that some Republicans say their party has no choice but to aggressively court labor to try to at least reduce some of that support. If Mr. Bush becomes president, said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist, "watch for Bush to attempt to break the Democratic stranglehold on unions." He added, "We need to go after the middle-class union vote." (Just as President Ronald Reagan did.)
But former Representative Mickey Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican who teaches at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said the party should be careful. "I don't think we're ever going to win over the so-called labor bosses," he said. "We are not protectionists and not about to become protectionists."
Instead, he said, the party should dwell on what kind of economic policies might appeal to union members.
 
The Elusive Suburban Vote
The new political map shows the widest geographic divide between the parties in more than a generation. Mr. Gore's support was concentrated in the big cities, while Mr. Bush's backing was overwhelmingly in rural areas.
That left the suburbs as the biggest battleground. While Mr. Bush did slightly better than Mr. Gore in the suburbs, the Republicans' failure to do much better may present a problem.
Mr. Clinton won the White House twice by winning suburban voters decisively, as did Mr. Bush's father in 1988. With rural America shrinking and urban metropolitan areas growing, the Democrats have a voter base that is more reliable for the future. That leaves Republicans little choice but to win back the suburbs.
But Democrats fret that so much of their support is confined to urban pockets. Congressional Democrats are already mulling ways to attract rural white voters in the midterm election of 2002. Among the possibilities is playing down their support for gun control.
In fact, the geographic differences between the parties may play out most clearly on social issues: Rural constituencies would be expected to oppose gun control and abortion rights measures, while big city voters would be likely to line up on the other side.
 
No Free Delivery
This year's election may finally convince politicians that the notion that governors can use their organizations to ensure victory for a presidential candidate is a myth. One after another, the most prominent Republican governors were unable to deliver their states to Mr. Bush, including John M. Engler in Michigan, Tom Ridge in Pennsylvania and Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin. (Just the same, Vice President Al Gore couldn't deliver his home state, Tennessee, to himself.)
"I just don't think states are deliverable any more," said Charles Cook, editor of a nonpartisan political newsletter. "John Engler has a fantastic organization. If he can't deliver a Republican primary, then I don't think anybody can deliver anything for anybody ever."

Speaking Of Recession

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
After the longest economic expansion in American history, and with the latest economic report showing the economy still growing at a decent 2.4 percent annual rate, recession talk is suddenly upon us.
Part of that talk comes from the fact the economy is slowing -- the third quarter's growth was less than half the rate of the second quarter -- and some comes from fear that the fall in technology stocks may be signaling a problem. 
 And then there is politics. "We may well be on the front edge of a recession," Dick Cheney, the Republican nominee for vice president, said a week ago.
Mr. Cheney used the recession warning as a pitch for a tax cut soon after (as he sees it) he and Gov. George W. Bush take office. He'd be happy if any recession is blamed on the Clinton administration.
Of course, plenty of economists say there is no recession threat, so how do we know?
In a way, it's simple. There's a recession when the National Bureau of Economic Research says so. The bureau, a private research organization set up in 1920, convenes eminent economists, who decide if the economy has declined for two consecutive quarters, and then studies all the statistics to decide exactly when the downturn began. It is known for quality work, but not for quick action.
Figuring it out before the N.B.E.R. is not always easy, as the last recession showed. "We have not tilted down," Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said on Sept. 19, 1990. "Clearly, growth is, at best, sluggish. Nonetheless, judging from both hard data and more anecdotal reports, we are not, at least as yet, witnessing a cumulative unwinding of economic activity."
In fact, the recession had begun the previous July, or so the N.B.E.R. concluded in April 1991. As it happens, that decision came one month after the recession had ended. But the bureau did not reach that conclusion until Dec. 22, 1992, seven weeks after President George Bush was voted out of office, largely on the basis of the weak economy.

Despite a Buyizng Spree, Worries Linger

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The stock market pulled out of its doldrums last week as the Nasdaq composite index soared 274 points, or 10.5 percent, on Tuesday, its best day ever, and followed that with a 6 percent jump on Friday.
 The propellants were word that the Federal Reserve had grown concerned about the decline in economic growth and in the stock market, as well as signs that the presidential election impasse might be broken. (A Florida Supreme Court ruling, prolonging the uncertainty, came after the market closed on Friday.) 
 Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, "paved the way for a policy shift to where the risks of recession and inflation are equal," said David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services in Summit, N.J. A few analysts said they thought the Fed could cut short-term rates as soon as Dec. 19.
 Those upbeat developments more than offset warnings from another passel of companies, including Intel and Motorola, that sales and profits would be shy of expectations. Apple Computer predicted an actual loss.
The Nasdaq ended the week up 10.2 percent, at 2,917.43. The Dow Jones industrials gained 3.3 percent, to 10,712.91, while the Standard & Poor's 500 was up 4.1 percent, to 1369.89. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

To the Editor:
Imagine! In the year 2000, someone is touting the value of one of the most unrepentant racist enclaves in the city as an accidental utopia. 
 It was no "accident" they kept people of color out, and it was security guards that chased our children when they tried to walk from a true racial -- if not economic -- utopia, the Lower East Side, through StyTown to get to the Parks Department swimming pool on 23rd Street.
The author speaks of this community as a "way of life." Whose life? Certainly not mine, or my children, or my grandchildren, all of whom value the racial diversity of this city as one of its greatest gifts to those of us lucky enough to live here.

HEADLINE: The Taste of Pork In Budget Politics

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "The Politics of Surplus Cut Across Partisanship" (Economic View, Nov. 19), which looked at how the budget surplus is causing new ways of thinking in Washington: 
 Too many members of Congress, whether liberal Democrats or conservative Republicans, would rather spend any budget surplus to finance pork-barrel projects.
Billions of dollars are spent annually on these so-called investments in an attempt to grease the wheels of re-election. Trying to forecast the federal budget surplus beyond the current budget year is like going to a fortuneteller to learn about our personal futures.
Who really knows what tomorrow will bring? Today's economic growth could turn into a recession overnight, with a corresponding reduction in tax revenue and a disappearing surplus.
The best investment for our surplus is to reduce the multitrillion-dollar national debt. For future generations, that would reduce the odds of inheriting a bill so large that it could bankrupt them. Growth in government spending must be reduced to a point where annual increases are less than the rate of inflation.
Just as taxpayers and the business community live within their means, so, too, should Big Brother.

Stepping Into the Unknown to Cross Bay Bridge

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: PIEDMONT, Calif., Dec. 8

 BODY:
At 7:30 a.m., with the sun barely awake, the line of cars idling on Oakland Avenue extends the entire block. The cars, which are mostly the fancy kind, Passats and Saabs and a gamut of S.U.V.'s, are vying for the same thing: two strangers, any two strangers, to hop in their nice shiny vehicles, no questions asked.
The strangers pile in, the drivers take off, and the cars move forward on line, like cabs at an airport. 
 "This works for me," said Tauheedah Rashid from the driver's seat of her silver 2000 Jetta as she waited for passengers. Ms. Rashid, who works for a dot-com recruiting concern, started car-pooling, sometimes as a driver, sometimes as a passenger, six months ago. She finds comfort in the routine of it. "You say good morning, you hear a news station or music and you get to work."
The block is like this for hundreds of people every weekday morning from just before 6 to just after 9. One long line of cars, one steady stream of strangers entering those cars and both benefiting neatly from what the suburbs east of the San Francisco Bay have labeled "casual car-pooling." For the driver, it means a go on the high-occupancy-vehicle lane (at least three people) on the freeway to the Bay Bridge, shaving 20 to 30 minutes off what would be about an hour's trip to San Francisco (not to mention the $2 toll, which is waived for diamond-lane traffic). For the passengers, it means free rides.
And for the world at large, it means fewer cars on the road. At least fewer than there could be. Given the growth of the Bay Area in the new economy era, there are many more cars on the road, and many more casual car poolers, than there used to be. Since the casual car pool phenomenon began, sometime in the late 1970's, somewhere in Oakland, it has grown to encompass several thousand commuters.
In towns like Piedmont, which prefers life tidy, residents complained about growing lines of cars. So casual car pool sites are now officially designated, with official signs, making them seem not so casual. Longtime casual car poolers, like Dallas Phillips, say their zippy commute in the fast lane is now 40 to 45 minutes, double what it was 10 years ago.
"I've also noticed that there used to be a lot of people waiting for cars," Mr. Phillips said. "Now there are a lot of cars waiting for people."
With so much traffic, the conversation in the car, if any, is likely to be about the shortest cuts to reach the diamond lane.
Still, the casual car pool has, somewhat miraculously, retained its aura as a throwback to more innocent times. It serves as a reminder of the days when people did not lock their doors and the kindness of strangers was the rule. How else to explain the idea of strangers sitting shoulder to shoulder in a car, trusting they will make it to work just fine?
"I travel the United States and tell people about this and they say, 'You're crazy,' " said Mr. Phillips, who, at 7:50 this morning, piled into a black Ford Explorer whose driver he did not know.
"You are in a vulnerable position," said Mr. Phillips, who works for Delta Dental insurance. "But this is Piedmont, land of Beemers and Volvos. You have a false sense of security, trusting that everyone going to work is O.K.."
Drivers say they take some precautions. Some women prefer to pick up at least one woman, rather than two men. Some drivers only pick up people they have seen before, and some passengers will only enter cars they have seen before.
In this culture, drivers get designated nicknames. A woman is known as the "Gospel Lady" because she plays gospel music all the way to San Francisco. A man who drives a car with the words "ship oil" on it is the "Ship Oil Guy."
The rules of the road are simple. It is a given that no one smokes or drinks or eats. And like Victorian children with their elders, passengers do not speak unless spoken to by the driver (who may have other rules, like no perfume). These rules are just the way people like it.
"I was reluctant to do this at first, because I didn't want to have to talk to people," said Ken McCarty, who works in a mail room in San Francisco. Car-pooling, which he began as a passenger six months ago, became irresistible to him because he pockets $30 a month in bus fares. "It's not about saving time," he said. "It's more flexible than relying on bus schedules."
But like most car poolers, he takes the bus back home.
Mr. McCarty also appreciates the blissful silence of early morning meditation in a stranger's car. "Once I realized we didn't have to talk, it was great," he said. He entered a Nissan, gave a nod to the driver, and settled in behind him in the back of the car.

In the nine months since the city began a program called Digital NYC to market tax incentives to technology companies interested in moving to parts of the city outside Silicon Alley, it has had notable success in one area: the Brooklyn waterfront neighborhood known as Dumbo, where it has lured 11 companies that have brought 225 jobs and leased 70,000 square feet.
To some, Dumbo provides a road map for how the Digital NYC initiative can be replicated in other parts of the city. 
 But at a time when city officials are pushing hard to make Manhattan north of 96th Street and the other boroughs attractive alternatives to the New Jersey waterfront, it appears they have been unable, at least so far, to replicate the success they have had in Dumbo in six other technology districts in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Harlem and Queens.
So far, in four of those districts -- the Brooklyn Navy Yard, 125th Street in Harlem, Long Island City in Queens and the so-called Silicon Harbor in Red Hook, Brooklyn -- no leases have been signed. At two others, the Brooklyn Information Technology Center in Sunset Park and the Staten Island High Urban Bandwidth area in St. George, only three companies have signed on, for a total of 20,000 square feet.
City officials point to positives, like the fact that 10 leases are being negotiated in some districts, and that landlords in these districts have committed about two million square feet of space that will be wired and available soon. And some of these areas are no more remote, despite the perception, than Manhattan's far West Side, which has attracted dozens of Internet companies, real estate brokers say.
But the brokers say that for a range of reasons, from safety concerns to alarm over losing employees and a lack of amenities, many technology companies remain reluctant to look outside Silicon Alley, which runs from the Flatiron District south to Wall Street.
"Its all about perception," said Andrew Peretz, a director at Insignia/ESG, the commercial real estate firm who has taken technology clients to look at sites in Queens.
"Long Island City may be closer to Grand Central station than downtown is, but there is still a perception of going over that river and entering a separate culture that is not New York City," he said. "These companies are driven by young people who want things to be sexy, fun."
In the mid-1990's, the Giuliani administration helped fund the so-called smart-wiring of buildings and offered targeted tax cuts to businesses that moved to Lower Manhattan, moves that were seen as important in the development of Silicon Alley.
"New York City has been able to encourage the growth of these dot-coms, now one of the questions being asked is will they be able to retain them," said Marc M. Goloven, a senior regional economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "The question of when a new media company moves, does it have to move outside of New York City? Can the outer boroughs make themselves attractive compared to Hudson County in New Jersey?"
To address that issue, the city began Digital NYC, hoping that it would alleviate overcrowding in Lower Manhattan, and at the same time spread the dot-com boom to other parts of the city. The idea has shifted a bit since dot-coms began experiencing financial problems earlier this year, but city officials are convinced that the shakeout will only encourage more companies to flee high-dollar leases.
Michael G. Carey, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, calls Dumbo "a success from the standpoint of our expectations since we started the program nine months ago."
The city has teamed up with local economic development corporations, giving them money for marketing to find tenants and landlords willing to install powerful high-speed Internet connections.
The leases are often half what companies would pay in Silicon Alley, and in July the city began a program that provides tax refunds of $3,000 per employee relocated from Manhattan's most desirable neighborhoods and from outside the city.
"The economic benefits are fantastic," said Robert Eisenberg, corporate managing director at Julien J. Studley, who has visited some of the areas with technology clients. "But Manhattan is where their employees want to work, and there are perceived transportation issues, safety issues and a lack of amenities."
Some city officials have expressed concern that Dumbo -- which stands for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass -- has some advantages that the other technology districts do not. Among those are its proximity to City Hall just two subway stops away, its emerging art community and the fact that developers were working on technology projects there before the Digital NYC program.
Still, many people, like Charles Millard, a former president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, believe that "all they need is somebody to make the first move" for some of the new districts to become popular. "When somebody noteworthy from Silicon Alley goes out that is when you will see this programs take off."

HEADLINE: Signs Point to Economic Growth, Clinton Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
After a week in which Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, repeatedly raised doubts about the economy, President Clinton painted a different picture today, saying all signs are that the long expansion is continuing.
In his weekly radio address, Mr. Clinton sought to rebut arguments by the Republican ticket that slowing growth and the possibility of a recession make the time ripe for the big tax cut they have proposed. 
 With an eye on his end-of-term battle with Republicans in Congress over this year's budget, the president also said that one of the best investments the country could make in continued prosperity was to increase spending on education.
"Over the last two years, our economy has grown at an exceptional pace, often achieving growth rates as high as 5 percent," Mr. Clinton said. "Obviously, economic growth at such a brisk level cannot be sustained forever, but the bulk of evidence suggests that our record-breaking expansion is continuing."
Mr. Clinton added, "The overwhelming majority of private sector experts are predicting solid but measured growth in the coming year."
He did not mention Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney by name, but White House officials have clearly been irked by the suggestions that the recent prosperity is coming to an end.
"I don't think people who want to assume national leadership should be signaling that they're willing to talk down our economy and speculate on recessions without substantial private-sector foundation because it's convenient for a political objective," Gene Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview this week.
The economy has clearly slowed in recent months, in part because of the Federal Reserve's raising of interest rates. It has also been driven to some degree by nervousness in the financial markets, where investors have been fretting over lower-than-expected corporate profits, the bursting of the technology stock bubble and concerns about the creditworthiness of all but the strongest of borrowers.
And while there is little evidence yet that a recession is on the horizon, economists say it is more of a possibility than it was a few months ago.
"We continue to believe that the U.S. economy can avoid recession in 2001," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, an investment firm.
But Mr. Barbera said it would take a significant reduction in interest rates by the Fed "to prevent U.S. economic weakness from snowballing into recession."

HEADLINE: Consumers Across the Nation Are Facing Sharp Increases in Health Care Costs in 2001

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Consumers across the country will face double-digit increases in their health care costs starting next month, reflecting the biggest surge in medical inflation since the early 1990's. The increases will show up in larger deductions from paychecks and higher deductibles and payments for care, especially prescription drugs.
Employers learned earlier this year that their health care premiums would be increasing between 10 and 30 percent in 2001. Most companies are absorbing the majority of the hefty increases, hoping to retain important employees in a tight labor market, but they are sharing the burden with workers. And at some companies, employees are paying a growing share of the costs. 
 As their health care expenses rise, low-income workers and the self-employed may decide to drop coverage altogether. Although the number of Americans without insurance dipped to 42.6 million last year from 44.3 million in 1998 as many temporary workers moved up to jobs with benefits, health policy experts say rising costs for 2001 may lead to an increase in the number of people without insurance.
"If the double-digit increases continue and the economy turns down, that could eventually drive the uninsured to 50 million or higher," said Jack Meyer, president of the nonprofit Economic and Social Policy Research Institute in Washington.
"My concern is that when costs go too high, there will be a certain number of companies and employees who will say they can't afford it," said Marshall Abrahams, president of Desks Inc., a Denver office supply firm with 50 employees.
Employers facing double-digit premium increases are "starting to get panicky," said Janet Trautwein, policy director of the National Association of Health Underwriters, an insurance agents group.
"Rates are going up dramatically in some parts of the country," Ms. Trautwein said. "Some employers have reduced their contributions and some have changed the benefits" to make them less costly, she said.
Large employers are raising payroll deductions by 20 percent, on average, while adding 15 percent to what workers pay in deductibles and copayments, said Kenneth L. Sperling, a health care expert at Hewitt Associates, the benefits consulting firm.
Over all, employees of large companies will pay 18 percent more, or $1,401 on average, in 2001, according to a Hewitt survey of 350 employers with six million workers and dependents. The employers' health care costs will rise 9.8 percent to $4,026 per employee. Combined costs for these companies and their workers will rise 17 percent, Hewitt said.
Costs are increasing for government employees as well. In the federal employees' health plan, the nation's largest, monthly payroll deductions will rise 14 percent to $74.23 in January for most single employees, and increase 21 percent to $175.30 for families, said Bill Pierce, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which covers about half of the eight million federal workers and retirees. The annual deductible and employee payments for hospital and outpatient care will also rise.
The trustees of the 1.2 million-member California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's second-largest health plan, will meet this week to deal with cost increases as high as 24 percent for 230,000 members of the system's financially troubled "preferred provider organizations," networks of preselected doctors and hospitals. The retirement system's staff is suggesting cuts in coverage to keep down the increase in premiums.
The staff proposals include doubling the annual deductible employees pay, to $1,000 a family, and adding a $50 payment for emergency room visits.
But for 850,000 of the California public employees, who are in H.M.O.'s, several unions rejected cuts in benefits last summer. Their premiums were then raised 9.2 percent for 2001.
Employers have been paying most of the increase in health care costs over the last two years in order to retain workers in a tight labor market. But if the economy slows, that could change. "The American public is in for a shock when the recession comes," said Jon R. Gabel, vice president of the Health Research and Educational Trust, an independent research affiliate of the American Hospital Association. "They have no idea how much health care costs have increased over the last five or six years."
Big companies that offer choices of health plans have long arranged reduced premiums for low-cost plans. If workers choose a more expensive plan, they often have to pay the difference in charges, said Dave Rahill, a health care consultant in New York with William M. Mercer, benefits consultants.
With health insurance costs rising, small companies are more likely to follow suit and offer their employees more choices. Many are joining health care purchasing alliances that offer an array of choices, so their workers can also choose between joining a low-cost plan or spending more if they want better protection.
Gary Ahlquist, a senior vice president at Booz-Allen & Hamilton, a management consulting firm, predicted that as costs increase, more employees will choose high-deductible insurance, with lower premiums. That insurance may appeal to healthy people who are willing to risk paying $1,000 or even $2,500 if they need care, he said.
That would mark a change from past years. High deductibles "have not been particularly successful" in finding customers, said Greg Scandlen, a senior health policy fellow in Washington at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research center.
That may be because "rank-and-file employees don't have the resources to draw on, if they have to come up with $1,000 quickly," said Richard Ostuw, a health care expert with the Watson Wyatt consulting firm.
"When we raised prices, people left," said Mark Weinberg, group president of individual and small employer business at Wellpoint Health Networks, based in California. "A certain percentage went uninsured" rather than pay higher premiums.
Wellpoint's California Blue Cross unit, which covers 850,000 individuals in the state, is also trying to give consumers more options, lowering premiums to appeal to individuals without insurance. At the same time, it is asking members who need care to pay more. Under some policies, patients would pay 25 percent of the charges for anything other than visits to the doctor, generic drugs and preventive care, as well as a separate deductible for brand-name drugs.
"Seventy percent of any population spends $150 or less on health care in a year," Mr. Weinberg said.
"This is a watershed time for us," he added. "Either we, as an industry, recognize these cost trends and make the right decisions," or the customers will drift away, going without insurance or trying Internet-based alternatives to the managed care companies.
But some employees have few choices. Until last year, Harlequin Books, a publishing company, paid the entire cost of health coverage for its 40 employees in New York as well as the 20 members of its national sales force. The company gradually introduced cost-sharing, requiring employees to cover 5 percent of health coverage premiums this year and 8 percent in 2001, when Harlequin's premiums will rise by 14 percent.
"It's a problem for the employees," said Linda Kleinman, manager of human resources and administration. "They don't earn princely sums. Publishing salaries are not like those in dot-com companies."

HEADLINE: With Trepidation, Saudi Arabia Meets the World

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
Prince Sultan bin Salman is a familiar face in Saudi Arabia. A strapping former Air Force pilot, he flew as an astronaut on an American space shuttle 15 years ago, is a grandson of the nation's founder, the son of a well-known governor, and now the nation's tourism chief.
But on a recent trip to a village market near Taif he saw firsthand what it might be like to arrive a stranger in the conservative and provincial kingdom. 
 The prince and his aides pulled out their cameras to take photographs of the market scene, all part of their research for the budding tourism industry. It took but an instant, the prince recalled, before they were the center of hostile attention from the local people. One old man, sure they were outsiders with bad intentions despite their traditional Saudi dress, grabbed a big stick and chased them.
The incident underlined the challenges facing Saudi Arabia as it attempts to open up to influences, and visits, from the world outside. Its lesson was not lost on Prince Sultan. "You just can't bring thousands of people in and let them out and about," he said, in an analysis that applies to much more than his own tourism project. "We are going to move carefully and cautiously."
Though they have yet to bear fruit, reforms have been set in motion that aim to diversify the economy and create jobs. But the overriding question is whether the royal family can execute economic reforms and open up the kingdom of 22 million people without also sharpening demands for political change.
Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, has proposed several steps over the last two years. The government has for the first time offered foreigners the chance to own property and open a business without a Saudi national as a majority stakeholder. And a new General Investment Authority has been set up to seek foreign investors in gas development, power industries and desalination of sea water.
The government has said it intends to set up a capital market, which would require new standards of openness for Saudi companies. It has also started work on reforming its legal system and trade regulations, all in pursuit of membership in the World Trade Organization. And it has signed international treaties and conventions on human rights.
Each of these steps would mean that Saudi Arabia, a country that follows a combination of Islamic law and ancient tribal traditions, will be pressed to acknowledge international norms. And in those cases where its own norms differ, Saudi Arabia will be pressed to explain itself as never before.
"At the high levels, the interest is there and the thinking is clear," said Saleh Mutabbakani, a businessman in Jidda who has put together ventures with foreign partners.
But many Saudis simply resist change. "They might not know why they are against it, but they are," he said. "One problem is that religion and tradition have melted together and people don't think about the difference."
For a society accustomed to its king and princes, where foreign publications are censored, where the study of Western philosophy is banned, and where women may appear publicly only if swathed in black cloth, there are minefields ahead.
"We are motivated to join the W.T.O. and be part of the wider world and its institutions," said a senior Saudi official. "But it's a trial. As we look at how we are reflected in the eyes of the world, we are going to see what's missing in our reflection."
The kingdom has responded fiercely to unexpected change in the past. In 1965, then King Faisal, a modernizer with a flair for dramatic gestures, introduced television. Tribal leaders and members of the king's own family, including a nephew who ultimately assassinated the king, denounced the newfangled invention as the work of the devil.
When American and European soldiers, male and female, poured into Saudi Arabia for the Persian Gulf war 10 years ago, a group of educated women in Riyadh, emboldened by the presence of Westerners, flouted the ban on women drivers. They were arrested, and those who worked lost their jobs. Alarmed at the intrusion of the soldiers, radical Islamic preachers attacked the Saudi ruling family. The preachers were arrested.
Liberals and conservatives alike sent letters to the king asking for more participation in decision making. They were arrested or vilified in semiofficial newspapers, but King Fahd finally made good on a promise by his elder brother in 1956 to create an appointed council to advise him.
Introducing foreign ideas about competition, freedom of movement and human rights could again provoke a public backlash, some Saudi officials acknowledged, but not an earthquake. "The dynamics here have changed," said Prince Sultan. "The country is different than it used to be."
Still, each change may have a ripple effect on the country's political dynamics, many Saudis said. For example, if companies are required to follow standard accounting rules, demands may also intensify for more openness in the government.
"The first thing people are asking for is transparency from the government," said a banker in Riyadh. "Before we ask private companies to show their figures and all the guts of their business, we need to know what the government programs and spending plans are. How else can you expect people to invest or bring back money from abroad?"
Similarly, some Saudis said they believe that outside pressure is their only hope of putting a check on police powers, elevating human rights and reforming the judicial system, which is run according to Islamic law.
"There are no lawyers," said a Saudi writer. "You don't have the right to be told why you're being taken to jail. The judges are corrupt. And yet we hear all the time that if you attack Saudi Arabia's human rights record, you are attacking Islam."
The government has made human rights a priority and intends to respond forcefully to its critics, said Prince Turki bin Muhammed, an undersecretary who is in charge of relations with international organizations.
Saudi Arabia has ratified four conventions on human rights and discrimination against women, though it submitted formal reservations. And prompted by its acceptance of international treaties and trade rules, the government is considering creation of an appellate court and a codification of defendants' rights.
But conflict with international norms is inevitable. Like many nations that have adopted the Islamic legal code, Saudi Arabia gives a woman's testimony in court only half the weight of a man's. Religious freedom, as the State Department has noted, does not exist. Only Muslims may be citizens.
Even if the government wanted to change what Western critics regard as discriminatory laws, many Saudis said, it would risk enraging conservatives inside the country.
"I am a member of a tribe," said Fahad al-Harthi, an urbane member of the Majlis who holds a doctorate in humanities from the Sorbonne in Paris and runs a new newspaper called Al Watan.
"That identity and connection is crucial to me," he added. "And no matter how I might feel about it, I can tell you that if I were to let my wife drive, the next day I would no longer be considered a part of my tribe. That's how strong the societal pressures are."
While market reforms and economic opening may have wrought political changes in some countries, many Saudis said the chances of that happening in their nation are slim.
"If we had elections, there would be only two kinds of people on the Majlis: tribal chiefs, no matter how uneducated or bad, and businessmen," said one influential Saudi prince. "We take into account what those people want, but there is a big difference between giving them what you think they should have or having them grab it from you."
"We can never have political parties," the prince added, "because we are all of one party -- the party of God."

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE BUSH CAMP;
For Texas Governor's Camp, 'Nightmare Situation' Was Only a Bad Dream

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 9

 BODY:
Inside the Texas Governor's Mansion on Friday evening, Gov. George W. Bush's aides had a term for the scene they knew would begin to unfold today on television, as Florida counties began recounting disputed ballots.
"The nightmare scenario," one adviser said. "A nightmare because it's uncontrolled, and because the political damage could be severe." 
 Yet by this afternoon, moments after the United States Supreme Court stepped in to stop the count, the roller-coaster mood of the Bush camp was suddenly back to one of confidence. For now, they didn't have to worry about the prospect that a recount might give Mr. Gore a lead for the first time since election night.
That would create not only a legal problem but a political one: public opinion could quickly follow the numbers. And if the headlines blare that Mr. Gore won not only the national popular vote by 300,000 votes, but a narrow majority in Florida as well, one aide said, it "could change the political dynamic of the last month."
Not often in the past month has the Bush camp been through a scare like the one it had Friday night and today until just after lunch, when the recounts were halted by the 5-4 decision of the United States Supreme Court. And even that victory brought less of a sense of elation to Mr. Bush's aides than a sense of utter confusion. "I'm going to go crazy," said one Bush aide in Florida. "If somebody really wanted me to go insane, this is the way to do it." Another aide, remembering times when victory seemed within grasp, only to slip away, asked: "How many times have we been here before?"
For his part, Mr. Bush stayed out of sight today. After an early-morning briefing he left Austin for his ranch in Crawford, Tex., about 90 minutes away. He heard the news of the stay on a cell phone, aides said, while driving two magazine reporters around his property in a Suburban. "That's great news, that's great," he told Donald L. Evans, his campaign chairman, who was on the other end of the line in Florida. Later, he called back for details.
Many of Mr. Bush's remaining campaign staff members here had flown to Florida on Friday night on a hastily arranged charter flight dispatched to send reinforcements to James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state, who is running the Florida legal wars. They were followed this morning by Mr. Evans and Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political strategist.
Mr. Bush spoke several times today with Mr. Baker, but the reality was that there were few decisions left to make. "It's in the hands of the supremes now," one aide said, "and everyone knows what everyone else's argument is going to be."
That did not dampen the frequency of conference calls between Tallahassee and Austin, however, with several of Mr. Bush's top advisers cautioning, before the United States Supreme Court halted the recount, that should the vote count swing to Mr. Gore's favor, the strategy of turning to the Florida Legislature to put up its own slate of electors could engender a political backlash.
"It's a way of winning, but winning ugly," one said.
The fear was that the wave of public opinion that seemed to be building against Mr. Gore until Friday, that he should finish his one last legal appeal and then concede the election, could begin to swing the other way.
No one knew, of course, who would prevail in a recount, but the Bush team has assumed that Mr. Gore would not be fighting so hard to get the count started if he wasn't assuming he would win.
One Bush aide said Friday that in the campaign's view, the hand-recounted tally in Florida would include figures that "we don't think would be fair, or accurate." But in an election this close, any count would clearly be within a statistical margin of counting error that make any numbers suspect. The perception of who won would become as important as the numbers themselves.
That is why so many of Mr. Bush's advisers want the United States Supreme Court to settle the issue -- and why they took heart from today's injunction. If the court permanently bars recounts of the disputed ballots, Mr. Bush's advisers have concluded, that would be the best politically for the Republican candidate -- putting the court's imprimatur on his presidency.
"In spite of all the deep-seated emotion about this, Baker believes that it's important, though not essential, to Bush's presidency that he win from the U.S. Supreme Court as opposed to winning the other way," one adviser said, referring to action by the Florida Legislature, with support from Gov. Jeb Bush, Mr. Bush's brother. But he quickly added: "The Legislature is perfectly constitutional and legitimate, and they're going to play that card if they have to."
In their public comments, Mr. Bush's aides have continued the strategy Mr. Baker laid out on Friday night and again today: to attack the Florida Supreme Court and commend, at every turn, the United States Supreme Court. Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the campaign here, talked this morning of "liberal, activist judges" on the Florida Supreme Court who ignored, he said, the existence of an "accurate and reliable count of the vote in Florida."
"We're already seeing massive confusion," Mr. Bartlett said before the United States Supreme Court halted the recount. "These counties have been asked to manufacture votes on behalf of their neighbors," he said, by divining the intent of voters using vague and inconsistent standards. By this afternoon, after the halt, Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, was talking about the "sense of comfort the American people will feel as the highest court in the land gets involved."
But in the moments before the recount stopped, at least some of Mr. Bush's advisers had noted that the judges who were reviewing the 9,000 "undercount" ballots from Miami-Dade County appeared to be using a stricter standard than the county's canvassing board used before it suspended its recount three weeks ago. If that standard was applied around the state, they suggested, Mr. Bush could prevail -- a result that they believed would prove the quickest road to a concession by Mr. Gore.
The spin about how the votes might turn out ended as soon as the United States Supreme Court action suggested the recount might end as well. It was replaced by brief celebrations surrounding the injunction, followed by apprehension that the 5-4 majority might not hold on Monday. ("Every day, we're up, we're down, we're in, we're out," said one aide. "I've become almost anesthetized to all of this stuff.")
Of course, this was hardly the way that Mr. Bush and his top advisers had envisioned this weekend playing out.
All week, the Texas governor had nurtured an air of inevitability about his move to the White House. His spokesmen were reporting that he was receiving daily intelligence briefings, and those briefings apparently gave Mr. Bush the confidence to issue a warning to potential terrorists that they should not even think of taking advantage of this moment of electoral indecisiveness.
Mr. Bush's aides were already talking about the economy, warning that a slowdown could turn into an economic downturn, and using that prospect to build support for their proposed tax cuts as an economic stimulus package. Mr. Bush even said he had decided on the composition of his White House staff, and aides hinted that announcements were ready to flow as soon as Mr. Gore conceded.
There was talk of a Bush trip late next week to Washington, perhaps to meet Mr. Gore and Congressional leaders, maybe even to take the measure of the Oval Office.
Now the short-term challenges are obvious. Few in the campaign underestimate the challenges ahead, even if the United States Supreme Court paves their way to a victory.
Nearly half the time presidents ordinarily enjoy to organize a transition has slipped away, with only one or two officials in place. If the recount that was cut short today in Florida ultimately restarts, and leads to lengthy legislative or court battles, or ultimately ends up in the House and Senate, the next president would have had only days to get a Cabinet and staff prepared.
The medium-term challenge is more severe. No matter who takes office on Jan. 20, the chances have now been heightened that half the Congress will regard his election as tainted, if not illegitimate. That is why Mr. Bush's aides have been so concerned about throwing the election into the Florida Legislature or even Congress. In both forums, Mr. Bush would likely win.
But in both, it would be regarded as a partisan victory.
"That would not be an insurmountable challenge," one Bush policy adviser said late Friday. "We understand the need to govern from the middle."

U.S. Supreme Court Halts Counting of Florida Ballots
The United States Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to stop the recount in Florida, in a sudden and devastating blow to Vice President Al Gore, and set Monday morning for arguments on Gov. George W. Bush's appeal of the Florida Supreme Court ruling. 1
 
Judges and election officials who had begun counting ballots shortly after dawn across Florida, began packing them up and waiting to see if the earth would shake again. 1
 
Aides to Mr. Bush sounded confidant that he would prevail. But they had been beginning to recalibrate their strategy in case the vote count began to favor Mr. Gore. 1

Whispers Turn to Talk of Eliminating Clubs

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Commissioner Bud Selig, an executive of a team said, is studying contraction. No, not contractions like don't and wouldn't and aren't, but contraction as in consolidation, as in eliminating teams.
"I can't honestly say I've done that," Selig said when asked about his study. "There are people who like contraction. What I have said relative to contraction is the problems are so significant that every option is on the table. That's one of them. We're no more advanced than that. There's nothing critical about it." 
 Jerry McMorris of Colorado, Larry Lucchino of San Diego and Peter Angelos of Baltimore have been the leading proponents of paring the number of teams to something less than 30.
"They believe in it very strongly," Selig acknowledged. "There are others who don't. I've heard from both sides. I've encouraged people who want to talk to me about it to do so."
Even if it is only a signal to owners to discuss the issue, the commissioner seems to have changed his position on contraction. Earlier this year, when talk of it surfaced, he said he was aware of the talk but added, "I really don't accept that."
Study or not, the idea of contraction has arisen because some owners see it as the solution, or part of the solution, to baseball's economic problems. The owners see the problems as being created by player salaries, which continue to soar and leave low-revenue clubs lagging further behind the high-revenue teams.
Over several days last week, for example, the Colorado Rockies signed two free-agent pitchers for a total of $174.5 million. They acted just days after the Yankees signed Mike Mussina for $88.5 million.
The Montreal Expos have not signed any players to those types of contracts lately. They are Exhibit A in the contraction debate. Jeffrey Loria, the club's relatively new owner, dismisses the talk.
"We are still struggling," he said, "but we are confident that our situation will be resolved when baseball resolves its problems. I plan on being in this game a very long time. I cannot imagine anything that would take place that would take me away from this game that I love."
The Expos are scheduled to receive about $24 million this year, most among the 13 recipients under baseball's revenue-sharing plan. Their revenue problems were exacerbated by their inability to get a reasonable amount of money for local television rights. The $800,000 they were offered would not have paid one player making the average salary.
Loria, faced with the likelihood that the Expos will not get a new stadium in Montreal, would be far better off if he moved the team, perhaps to northern Virginia. The Oakland Athletics, another candidate for extinction in the eyes of some owners, would benefit from a move to the San Jose area.
But owners of teams that draw fans and television viewers from those prospective locations, the Baltimore Orioles and the San Francisco Giants, have balked at the possibility of those moves. And Selig said recently that relocation would not be considered until a new labor agreement was in place. The contract expires at the end of next season.
Some skeptics have suggested that talk of contraction is a negotiating ploy, aimed at making the union nervous about losing jobs so that it would concede some important economic issues. Donald Fehr, however, did not sound like a concerned labor leader when he was asked about the possibility of losing teams.
"If that becomes a real possibility, I assume they'll talk to us about it," Fehr said. Asked if the owners could act unilaterally, he said: "I don't know. This isn't something we have an opinion on. If it becomes real, we'll have an opinion."
None of the owners linked contraction to labor negotiations. McMorris, in fact, called it "a last resort."
"I only talked about it in the beginning," he said, "because if all else fails and they can't support a team in a market, we have to look at what we're doing with revenue sharing and the central fund sharing that's going to some of these places."
Contraction, McMorris added, was "brainstormed during our sessions with the blue ribbon panel." He referred to the committee that produced a report on the state of baseball's economy, making recommendations about revenue sharing and payroll taxes. "If the recommendations outlined in this report are implemented," it said, "there should be no immediate need for contraction."
But the owners who favor contraction believe management could gain control of player salaries because jobs would be in greater demand and players would sign for less money than they make now. They feel the present system creates salary inflation by having too much money chasing too few players.
Eliminating two to six teams, some proponents believe, would be ideal, creating a higher quality of baseball as well as lower salaries.
Montreal, Minnesota, Oakland and the two Florida teams are the candidates most often mentioned. No owner of those teams, however, would find the idea palatable even though Major League Baseball would pay for the franchises.
"I don't think anything has been moved that far along," McMorris said. "I know Bud is being thoughtful." He estimated that roughly half the owners would favor contraction but added, "I don't think there's been enough serious analysis or discussion to come to a conclusion."
 
Disney on the Dole
Imagine stopping at a red light at a street corner on Manhattan's West Side and suddenly seeing Michael Eisner race over to the car and begin wiping the windshield, simultaneously holding out his other hand. Or walking down Broadway and having him jump out holding a tin cup.
Eisner runs the Walt Disney Company. Disney owns the Anaheim Angels. The Angels are a big-market team that has operated itself into small-market status. They are one of 13 teams this year that will receive handouts from baseball's revenue-sharing plan. They are scheduled to receive about $8 million.
The Philadelphia Phillies are on the dole for about $12 million, the same as the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is a village compared with Philadelphia. The Florida Marlins, who won the World Series only three years ago, will receive about $15 million, same as the Milwaukee Brewers, placing them third among the recipients.
Montreal will receive the most money, about $24 million. Minnesota is next at about $21 million, meaning it will get more money than the $16.5 million it paid its players.
As they were at the end of the World Series, the Yankees ($22 million) and the Mets ($18 million) are 1-2 among the 17 teams that will pay out about $164 million in revenue-sharing funds. They are followed by Cleveland ($13 million), Atlanta ($12 million) and Boston ($12 million).
 
Cone's Life Goes On
For David Cone, life on the mound did not end with the pitch to Mike Piazza for the third out in the fifth inning of Game 4 of the World Series.
"I think you constantly have to prove yourself," Cone said, taking a break from workouts in Tampa, Fla. "I know the position I'm in right now. That's why I'm down here working so hard. If someone wants to come and watch me throw, come on. If I have to hold a tryout camp, I will."
He laughed. "I say that half jokingly," he continued, "but that's how serious I am. When I do show up for spring training, I'll be ready to go."
Cone, let loose by the Yankees last week after five-plus seasons, knows he is in no position to dictate where he plays or how much a team has to pay him to play. A 4-14 record at the age of 37 tends to obviate that.
"What I'm looking for is the challenge," he said, "a situation where I can play a prominent role and help a team." He was agreeable to leaving the Yankees because he believed his role as their No. 5 starter would not have met that desire.
"I understand the position that I'm in," he said. "I also feel it was just a Murphy's Law year for me. I do believe I was turning things around before I dislocated my left shoulder."
Steve Fehr, Cone's agent, is beginning to take calls from prospective employers and was as confident as Cone that he would pitch, and pitch productively, next season.
Cone said he was working hard to straighten out his mechanics and get in midseason shape. "I think much of my problem last year was mechanical," he said, "experimenting too much. I'm working to fix that. I don't believe you can fall that far that fast in one year. It was just one year."

Mets Still Optimistic About Finding Pitching Help

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The scuttlebutt floated through the halls at baseball's winter meetings today. One general manager said he heard from someone with the Atlanta Braves that they were hot in pursuit of Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez. It seemed very likely that Rodriguez would wind up choosing between the Braves and the Texas Rangers.
The same general manager said the Cleveland Indians were back in the quest for outfielder Manny Ramirez, whose agent later acknowledged that he had continued talking with the Indians and had even exchanged new proposals earlier in the week. But as the agent spoke on the phone, two executives of the Boston Red Sox sat in a room down the hall in his office in Newport Beach, Calif., taking a respite from their second successive day of negotiations. 
 The Mets, their general manager said, "were not getting crazy in the Manny Ramirez chase." But Jeff Moorad, Ramirez's agent, said he would nevertheless meet with Steve Phillips here at the winter meetings on Sunday.
Ramirez and Rodriguez were the two premier free agents remaining. The other two had signed with new teams, Mike Mussina with the Yankees and Mike Hampton with the Colorado Rockies.
Hampton appeared at the Wyndham Anatole Hotel here today, explaining that he loved his season with the Mets but proclaiming the Rockies to be "our kind of people," Colorado "our kind of place." It is so much Hampton's kind of place that his father and his wife's parents will eventually move there.
"This is a family decision from top to bottom," he said, "not just myself and my wife."
Hampton's defection, despite the Mets' seven-year, $105 million offer, left the Mets with decisions to make. They have to fill his spot in their starting rotation, and Phillips continued talking to agents and other general managers seeking that pitcher and one other starter.
"I feel confident we're going to be able to fill our holes in a way that we'll feel good about our pitching staff," Phillips said.
Could Phillips leave here Monday night with a pitcher? "I think there's a chance," he said. "We have enough irons in the fire that there's a chance we'll get something done."
Phillips didn't mention any names, but he has been talking with the agents for Kevin Appier, Bobby J. Jones and David Cone. Dan Horwits, Appier's agent, said the Mets "economically are a little bit behind other clubs."
Phillips has also talked with other general managers, including those who currently employ Pedro Astacio and David Wells.
"I'd say we're talking about pitchers you can slot in to the rotation in front of Rick Reed and behind Rick Reed," Phillips said. "The likelihood is we'll slot somebody in front and somebody behind."
But it didn't appear that he would be inserting Ramirez in the right-field slot.
"We have the luxury of having young, productive outfielders that are affordable," Phillips said. "Affordable and productive enough that it allows you to consider spending your money in other areas, particularly pitching. We also have depth coming up in the organization with outfielders. We feel we have enough depth that mortgaging the organization for an outfielder is not really in the best interests of the club."
Moorad, also the agent for Jones, the Mets' free-agent pitcher, said Phillips had made it clear that he was going to continue to focus on pitching. "But he's also interested in sitting down and talking about Manny in Dallas," Moorad said. "I intend to see him sooner rather than later."
Moorad said he also planned to meet here with John Hart, the Indians' general manager. "We've talked daily for probably the last 10 days," he said. "We exchanged proposals earlier this week. It's fair to say we each took a shot at a creative approach."
Each side has turned down the other's proposals. Their inability to reach an agreement to keep Ramirez in Cleveland has enabled the Red Sox to jump into the breach. Dan Duquette, the Red Sox general manager, and Mike Port, another club executive, arrived at Moorad's office Friday and were still there yesterday. "It's been an intense couple of days," Moorad said. "We've shared an awful lot of ideas in an effort to find common ground, but at this stage common ground is still eluding us."
What the Red Sox offered, the agent said, was not enough to scoop up Ramirez without Moorad seeing Hart first here on Sunday. "I've committed to John that I would see him," Moorad said.
Before Mark Rodgers, Hampton's agent, contacted the Rockies to begin final negotiations, he said he told Hampton, "I think I can go back to the Mets and get you more money."
But, Rodgers said, "He said it's not about the money."
A skeptical Phillips said, "It's always about money, especially when it's not about money."
The Rockies announced that their eight-year deal with Hampton was worth $123.8 million. However, that total includes subsequent interest on the deferred $19 million of his $20 million signing bonus.
The basic contract is worth $121 million, which is still the biggest contract a baseball player has ever received. The contract includes an option for a ninth year at a $20 million salary or a $6 million buyout.
But what about pitching at Coors Field, the black hole for all pitchers?
"There's no doubt it's the toughest place to pitch," Hampton said. "It takes total mental and physical concentration and effort. It's going to be a true test. It's a test I look forward to."

HEADLINE: Effort to Repair Armenia and Azerbaijan Ties

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In the effort to resolve the smoldering conflict over Azerbaijan's mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, international negotiators are trying to assemble an aid package that would help make peace palatable to the bitterly opposed peoples of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
This week, they secured what was portrayed as an important promise from the Turks to restore regional trade and to aid both neighboring Azerbaijan, an increasingly close ally of Turkey, and Armenia, historically a foe, if peace is agreed. 
 While avoiding specifics, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey told American and French negotiators on Friday that his country would play a substantial role, participants said.
"We came here to highlight the important role that Turkey would play and to coordinate with Turkey on the steps we are taking to try to move forward in the peace talks," Carey Cavanaugh, the special American negotiator for Nagorno-Karabakh, said in a telephone interview.
For Turkey, helping put the economies back together would enhance its campaign to become a major regional power. The country is closely aligned with Azerbaijan and has been making inroads with the former Soviet republics in Central Asia.
For the United States, France and Russia, which are trying jointly to broker a peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the pledge from Turkey offers another incentive to offer the warring countries.
The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-inhabited enclave within Azerbaijan, has proven intractable, and the impasse threatens to affect the stability of an important swath of territory stretching from Russia to Iran. In 1992, Armenian-backed troops pushed hundreds of thousands of Azeris out of Nagorno-Karabakh and proclaimed it an independent state. A cease-fire agreement was reached in 1994, but skirmishes persist and at least 100 people have been killed this year.
In addition, an estimated one million Azeris displaced by the fighting remain in wretched refugee camps. Blockaded by Azerbaijan and Turkey, Armenia's once-thriving economy has collapsed.
The only hint of progress has been sporadic meetings in recent months between President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan and President Robert Kocharian of Armenia.
But Western diplomats said both leaders face political trouble and personal danger if they are perceived as giving up too much. So the negotiators are trying to assemble a multi-billion-dollar international rebuilding package to make peace more acceptable in both countries, and to spur on the talks.
The issue is sensitive for the Turkish foreign minister. Relations with Armenia -- always tense -- worsened in recent months after Armenian-Americans nearly persuaded Congress to declare the mass killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 a genocide. Still, Mr. Cem said peace would help normalize relations between Turkey and Armenia and possibly bring the resumption of trade along the border, which has been closed since 1993.
To highlight the possibilities for renewed regional trade, Mr. Cavanaugh and his French counterpart, Jean-Jacques Gaillarde, crossed the border between Turkey and Azerbaijan today to meet up with Nikolai Gribkov, a Russian diplomat who is also trying to negotiate peace for Nagorno-Karabakh. The team plans to cross into the no man's land between Armenia and Azerbaijan on Sunday to meet with military leaders. Four people were killed last month along the border and the sides have exchanged mortar and sniper fire in recent days.
"They say they think all the mines have been cleared," Mr. Cavanaugh said. Last July, Mr. Cavanaugh donned a flak jacket and helmet and walked three-quarters of a mile down a three-foot-wide path through a minefield for a similar session.
After meetings with military commanders from both sides next week, the negotiators will have separate discussions on new peace proposals with Mr. Kocharian and Mr. Aliyev.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Admiring Houston's Creative Bent

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
MY first trip to Houston, about 20 years ago, was on assignment for Rolling Stone. There I interviewed a rock musician with a 10-gallon hat and a foot-long beard who, as it happened, also sat on the board of the city's Museum of Contemporary Arts. I was impressed by this, because it suggested that Houston was a city that embraced, even encouraged, eccentricity.
The Rand McNally road map of Houston that I used for navigation in the 1980's is half the size of the 2000 version I bought to guide me through the city on my three-day trip there early last November. Using the new map was like trying to fold a bedsheet in the breeze. Houston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, has outgrown first one, then another beltway loop since my first visit. Immigrants from all over the world -- from Iran to Nicaragua, the Philippines to Trinidad, India to Vietnam -- have added new spices to Houston's three-alarm chili. 
 Perhaps the most interesting barometer of Houston's changes is that the bearded rock star, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, has traded in his cowboy hat for a Moroccan knit skullcap and is learning to play African-style guitar.
Eccentric and eclectic though it may be, Houston nevertheless has a rather conventional American travel infrastructure; its hotel landscape is dominated by Hyatt and Marriott at the top of the pile (where prices hover between $150 and $200 a night), and Super 8, Motel 6 and Hampton Inn at the low end (where I saw prices as low as $59.99 for a clean but cookie-cutter room by a freeway interchange).
My needs fall somewhere in between those of the expense-account business executive and the long-haul trucker. I dug into the guidebooks, surfed the Internet and called up friends, hoping to find an affordable room with some local atmosphere.
Eventually I found a couple of possibilities. The first was a place I'd heard about five years ago when I was in Houston to write about a trial. The pro bono defense team, from South Texas, had encamped itself at the Allen Park Inn, a vintage 1960's motel just west of the downtown area that is owned by a Houstonian. An investigation on the Internet revealed that the Allen Park Inn had recently been voted "best budget hotel" by CitySearch.com's Houston outlet. The listed rack rate of $89, though, seemed high -- and it didn't even include Houston's 16.25 percent hotel tax. But I called, and a friendly reservations clerk gave me a price quote of $69 (with tax, $82) for the day I wanted, so I booked -- and was pleased with my standard-issue room, which was large enough for me to practice yoga around the king bed.
I also knew there were interesting lodging possibilities in Houston's Museum District, a leafy residential area west of downtown within walking distance of some of Houston's, and America's, biggest art attractions (the Menil Collection, Rothko Chapel, and Museums of Fine Arts and Contemporary Arts). A handful of Victorian houses there have been converted to bed-and-breakfast establishments and seem to be doing a brisk business. I had to call several before I found an opening for the two midweek nights I needed at the right price. And at Robin's Nest Bed-and-Breakfast the room I wanted (the cheapest of the four guest rooms, at $89 a night) was taken. So I had to reserve a larger room, at $99.
Still, I wasn't upset -- my large, airy room had a bathroom with zebra-print curtains and a French Provincial style cabinet in the bedroom. The rest of the two-story house was bursting with personality and animal prints -- hand-painted giraffes adorned the stairway walls -- and I slept well in an antique queen bed appointed with half a dozen pillows and a feather bed.
America's oil and gas capital, not surprisingly, is a city that's hard to negotiate without a car. Finding one at the best price involved an entire morning of Internet surfing and telephoning, hands on the calculator. The bewildering, ever-changing fares of the airlines are nothing compared with the Nasdaq-like rate fluctuations of a midsized automobile at car rental companies. After price shopping on several online travel services like Expedia, Travelocity and Cheap Tickets, then leafing through the ads and coupons in my latest issue of AAA's Car & Travel Magazine, I got price quotes on a week's rental out of Houston with a return in San Antonio (my next stop) that ranged from $225 to $450, before insurance. Most of the quotes didn't include any of the four separate taxes and fees levied on car renters in the state of Texas. In the end, I got the best deal by simply calling up the 800 number of National Car Rental and telling the reservationist I was an AAA member. National's weekly rate of $264.92, before insurance, included the Sports Authority Tax, the Concession Recoup Fee, the Property Tax License and Title Fee, and the Rental Tax. Curiously, it was cheaper than any of the rates available to me through the AAA Web site.
I took it. And when at George Bush International Airport in Houston I was offered a free upgrade from a midsized car to an intermediate, I didn't hesitate a minute before jumping behind the wheel of a maraschino-red Grand Am .
The next day I pulled this flashy number up to the curb by the house of Cleveland Turner, known to his neighbors in Houston's Third Ward as the "Flower Man." Mr. Turner was relaxing in a lawn chair out in the street in front of his house -- not on the sidewalk or in the yard, because those areas were packed with assorted farm implements, hobby horses, windmills, mirrors, stuffed animals, plastic lawn ornaments and handmade mobiles. "Nice car," he smiled, and invited me to sit down and chat.
Which I did, eagerly. Mr. Turner, in his mid-60's, is one of Houston's best-known practitioners of a folk art that ethnographers have labeled the yard show. A yard show is a house and/or lot that, through the creativity and imagination of its owner, has been transformed, with junk and found objects, into what a museum curator might term an installation, or what a grumpy neighbor might call an eyesore. Houston is a hotbed of yard shows, in part because the city has few zoning regulations, but mostly, I suspect, because the hometown of Howard Hughes and 12-inch beards is a haven of idiosyncratics.
Houston's yard shows and their creators are well known among Texans (they've been featured over the years, in local newspapers and magazines) and American folklorists, and are slowly emerging as a Houston tourist attraction. The most famous of them all, the Orange Show, dates back to the late 1950's. When its creator, Jeff McKissack, died in the early 80's, an independent foundation formed to maintain the property as a museum. The Orange Show Foundation now serves as an unofficial center for information about Houston's yard shows; it runs occasional tours of the sites, and will point out the locations for travelers who want to see them independently.
I did my own tour, using a map I'd found in an old issue of Texas Highway magazine. I started at the Orange Show, in a drab neighborhood of ranch houses near the University of Houston. Walking through a creaking iron turnstile into its riot of orange-painted farm machinery, steam engine wheels, flags and whirring weather vanes, I felt as if I'd wandered into an abandoned circus. The reasons why McKissack, a retired postal worker, created the block-long installation in the first place are obscure. He believed in the restorative properties of oranges, and the Orange Show's walls are emblazoned with exhortations to "Love Oranges and Live."
Puzzling over the Orange Show's mysteries, I got back into the Grand Am and moved on. After a few wrong turns under the Interstate, I found the neon purple house called Pigdom, so called because its facade has been decorated with pictures of pigs and highway signs warning that one is approaching "Hog Heaven." I stood and watched the door for a while, curious as to what the inhabitants of a hog heaven might look like (all the yard shows except the Orange Show are owner-occupied). But no one emerged from the pen.
MY little tour was starting to feel like a treasure hunt as I drove in circles through streets of quiet houses, searching for flashes of glittery inspiration, towers of gorgeous junk. It occurred to me, turning into a street in an old West Houston area called the Camp Logan Extension, that I was getting a great introduction not only to Houston's folk artists but to some of the city's oldest neighborhoods as well.
In the middle of Malone Street, flanked by quiet, modest bungalows, the Beer Can House sparkled in the morning sun. It was an ordinary ranch house until its owner decided to incorporate 50,000 aluminum beer cans into its facade, which now dazzles like a mirage. Long strings of can tops, hung like beaded curtains, tinkle in the breeze.
But still no owner appeared. So when I finally got lucky and met Mr. Turner, the Flower Man, I was brimming with questions about these houses-cum-obsessions. He was happy to answer them all.
"I was in the hospital, drying out from Skid Row, and I had a vision," Mr. Turner said. "And I saw this beauty, swirling all around." Released from the hospital, Mr. Turner began working on a literal interpretation of his vision, using objects, artifacts and plants from his native Mississippi, including cotton, yams and peanuts. "I use junk. Only junk. Nothing new," he explained his aesthetic succinctly. "You have to find the beauty in the junk."
After I had seen Mr. Turner's house, he invited me to join him on a tour of Row Houses, a block of shotgun houses in Houston's historically black Third Ward that have been renovated (with corporate money) and turned into art galleries that showcase work by local artists -- including Mr. Turner himself. Then he guided me to a tiny trailer parked in an empty lot from which delicious smoky meat smells wafted. At Gumbeaux's truck I wolfed down a tender hot beef sandwich ($3.75).
When we arrived back at Mr. Turner's house, a television crew from the Disney Channel was setting up to interview him.
My personal tour of yard shows and of local art spaces with Mr. Turner gave me new eyes with which to view the superb collection of French and Spanish Surrealist paintings in the Menil Collection. I imagined Mr. Turner admiring Dali's visions and approving of the materials used by Max Ernst. And as I entered the separate, brilliantly designed gallery that showcases the work of the Abstract Expressionist Cy Twombly, I began to have some visions of my own. Smiling at the artist's dancing pencil marks and cryptic but exuberant doodles and phrases, I imagined taking Twombly over to the equally cryptic and exuberant Orange Show.
Houston's worlds of popular and fine art, I observed, shared more than aesthetics -- they shared economic policy. The yard shows, the Menil Collection and the Contemporary Arts Museum are absolutely free (the Orange Show and Row Houses welcome donations). And if you plan your visit to the Museum of Fine Arts for a Thursday (which I did), that museum is free, too. Since I was spending no money at all on my art spree, I felt fine about spending a slow, rainy afternoon over a three-course lunch (about $37, with wine and tip) at one of Houston's trendy restaurants, a Latin American fusion place called Americas not far from the Galleria shopping mall.
Inside its dark, Art Nouveau-ish space, decorated with glittery mirrored tiles and Gaudi-like pillars, I swirled my "fettuccine" around a fork, wondering how in the world the chef had managed to craft something that looked exactly like Italian noodles from strips of a corn tortilla. Like Mr. Turner, the chef had fashioned something elegant from an unexpected source. I gave silent thanks -- to all of Houston's idiosyncratic, creative spirits as I savored something that looked like fettuccine but tasted vaguely like a taco.
 
The bottom line: Beer Can House to fine arts
 I spent $137 a day during three days and nights in Houston on food, hotel and activities.
 
Air Fare
My ticket on Continental Airlines, (800) 525-0280, took me from La Guardia to Houston, and then from San Antonio back to La Guardia; the fare was $336.50.
 
Car
National Car Rental, (800) 227-7368, gave me the best weekly rate: $264.92, including tax for a midsize car. At the airport in Houston I got an upgrade to an intermediate-sized car at no extra charge. I dropped the car off at San Antonio airport, again at no additional charge.
 
Hotels
The Allen Park Inn, 2121 Allen Parkway, (713) 521-9321, www.allen parkinn.com is an old-fashioned two-story motel right out of the 60's, complete with a courtyard pool ringed by thatch-covered picnic tables. My room was on the ground floor, facing the courtyard; it was bigger than what you'd get in most chain hotels and had a king-sized bed, cable TV, telephone and bathroom with tub and shower. My single was $82 with tax.
Robin's Nest Bed-and-Breakfast Inn, 4104 Greeley Street, (800) 622-8343, www.therobin.com, has four rooms done up in a quirky Victorian tropical style. Mine was big, had a queen bed, a private bath and a small cable TV tucked discreetly inside a French Provincial-style cabinet. The rate was $99, or $115.50 with tax. A homemade breakfast (eggs, fresh biscuits, cereal and somewhat weak coffee) is included.
 
Restaurants
I splurged on an interesting pan-Latin lunch at the large, trendy restaurant Americas, 1800 Post Oak Boulevard, (713) 961-1492. My "fettuccine" made from tortillas poached in a lobster bisque and presented with grilled shrimp in a lobster sauce, plus a salad, dessert, and glass of Chilean wine, came to $31.
Houston has a huge Vietnamese community, so I was eager to try that cuisine. But the food at the stylish Mo Mong, 1201 Westheimer, (713) 524-5664), was somewhat disappointing. A dinner of two courses, with no drinks, came to $27.
At the corner of Southmore and Dowling Streets in Houston's Third Ward, there's a small empty lot where a truck belonging to the Gumbeaux Restaurant, 5200 Dowling, (713) 520-9962), is parked. The barbecue beef sandwich, served on white bread, ($3.75) is superb.
 
Activities
The Orange Show, 2401 Munger Street, is open to visitors on Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 5 p.m.; in practice, you can usually visit during the day on weekdays (I called ahead to ask permission.) On weekends there's an admission charge of $1; donations at other times are welcome. (The show closes on Saturday till mid-March for restorations.) The Orange Show Foundation, (713) 926-6368, which runs the attractions, also sponsors tours of Houston yard shows.
Some of the other landmark Houston yard shows can be observed from the outside, but they are not open for inspection, since they're private homes. I visited the Beer Can House, 222 Malone Street, north of Memorial Drive, a bungalow covered with a skin of 50,000 beer cans, and Pigdom, 4208 Crawford Street, near the corner of Eagle Street, a house painted purple and dedicated as a whimsical shrine to the porcine.
Cleveland Turner, creator of the Flower Man's House, is often sitting in front of his place at the corner of Sampson and Francis Streets in the Third Ward (his address is 3317 Sampson).
About a mile from Mr. Turner's house are the Row Houses, 2501 Holman Street, www.projectrowhouses .org, (713) 526-7662), restored and revamped as community gallery spaces.
The Menil Collection and the Cy Twombly Gallery, 1515 Sul Ross, (713) 525-9400) are both free. They're open from 11 a.m to 7 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday.
Thursdays are free (other days $5) at Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, 1001 Bissonet and 5601 Main, (713) 639-7300, sprawling buildings with excellent collections -- I especially enjoyed the gold jewelry from West Africa. Across the street at the Contemporary Arts Museum, (713) 284-8250, which rotates its exhibitions every month or so, all days are free. Both museums are closed Mondays. DAISANN McLANE

 ROMANCING THE FOLK
 Public Memory & American Roots Music.
 By Benjamin Filene.
 Illustrated. 325 pp. Chapel Hill:
 The University of North Carolina Press.
 Cloth, $49.95. Paper, $19.95. 
 BENJAMIN FILENE'S premise -- that the realities of artistic practice "call into question . . . rigid definitions of 'pure' folk music" -- is by now so widely accepted that even purists have to live with it. His conclusion, "that the backward glance can be more than nostalgic -- that memory can create American culture anew," never discusses the American present in the detail it deserves. But in between these two rhetorical disappointments, "Romancing the Folk" proves a fascinating history of an idea and a shape-shifting body of song.
Filene, a historian at the Minnesota Historical Society, declares himself unconcerned with who the proper creators of "folk music" might be, and he never gets very specific about what forces in modern life rendered their presumably unspoiled isolation so enticing to those bent on redefining America's past. What interests him is how the concept of "folk" was adjusted according to the tastes, needs and ambitions of those who dedicated their lives to it, and the varieties of music such reconceptualizations brought to the surface. Filene traces the way changing notions of the "pure" and the slightly less exclusionary "authentic" -- always counterposed to a vaguely defined "commercial" -- inflected what folk music genres were disseminated and how they were performed, and the profound effect these ideas exerted on all of American pop music and its overlapping audiences. The folklorists, academics, bureaucrats and entrepreneurs who dominate his story are colorful characters, and they are joined by artists who inspire Filene to critical heights few historians approach.
He begins at the unavoidable beginning: with Francis James Child, the Harvard Shakespeare scholar whose name lives on in the Child ballads he canonized in "The English and Scottish Popular Ballads" in 1882, and then with the English folklorist Cecil Sharp, who after years of scouring his homeland crossed the ocean in 1916 to certify a great mother lode of "authentic" Child ballads transcribed in an Appalachia he idealized as a simulacrum of England past. In keeping with the reflexively racist nativism of the time, this pseudoscientific research marginalized black American song, which had been attracting white chroniclers since the Civil War. It also denied that Sharp's Appalachian subjects exercised any legitimate aesthetic prerogatives in choosing or (heaven forfend) changing the songs he elected to preserve -- not to mention the commercially distributed music and black music they also performed, which he dismissed as irrelevant.
It was commercial exploiters like Ralph Peer, the traveling talent scout and soon-to-be publishing mogul, who first secured phonograph records of the breakdowns, ballads and blues that dominate what we now think of as folk music. But another wayward Harvard professor with a passion for authenticity forever changed how such recordings were understood. Where Child and Sharp condescended to folk music's creators as passive conduits of a static, immemorial tradition, John Lomax and his doubly influential son, Alan, honored them as active producers of an evolving one. The Lomaxes sought out both new variants on old material and contemporary topical songs, as long as they were convinced their subjects had generated the music without input from the increasingly inescapable mass media. Lugging a 350-pound recording machine through the South on a 1933 song-hunting expedition that eventually gained them entree to the Library of Congress, the Lomaxes came upon Huddie Ledbetter, who as Leadbelly became the first folk "primitive" sold as such. Imposing their own standards of authenticity, the Lomaxes urged their discovery ("a nigger to the core of his being," John Lomax once remarked) to remain "raw" -- as Filene puts it, "premodern, unrestrainedly emotive and noncommercial"; they even put him onstage in convict's stripes. Yet at the same time they encouraged him to insert spoken explanations and political messages into songs that had never required them before. Moreover, as Filene's diligent analysis of successive recordings of "Mister Tom Hughes' Town" makes clear, Leadbelly himself deliberately sentimentalized, desexualized, sweetened and slowed his music to cater to listeners who preferred their authenticity tamed further.
For Filene, no career better epitomizes the professional quandary of the putative folk musician than that of another Lomax discovery, Muddy Waters. Spurred first by Mississippi-born Chicagoans nostalgic for home and later by folkies and rock 'n' rollers with related but distinct notions of what authenticity might entail, this paragon of the true Delta never stopped adjusting to fashion. Quickly abandoning a sophistication tailored to the pop blues of the day, first freeing and then simplifying his beat, deploying a broad spectrum of electric and acoustic timbres, putting his all into Willie Dixon lyrics that stylized and commodified the macho voodoo of the "hoochie coochie man," Waters made some awkward records. But at his frequent best he bent his overwhelming physical presence to recombinant interpretive genius, adapting usages he had absorbed in one place and time to the social and aural realities of another.
Alan Lomax and New Deal allies like the Federal Writers' Project popularizer B. A. Botkin were more open-minded about who qualified as folk than John Lomax, much less Child and Sharp -- Anglo-Saxon heritage, white skin and even rural isolation were no longer a priori requirements. But even though this folk establishment had built its own economic infrastructure -- dominated by genteel, progressively inclined outsiders, with considerable support in government and academia -- not until the 1960's, if then, was it equipped to appreciate the hit-making likes of Waters, whose crucial patron was the highly unidealistic record executive Leonard Chess. That establishment's direct legacy was the line running from Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, himself the son of a left-wing classical composer turned folklore honcho. Filene is plainly inspired by Seeger, whose music and persona he describes with a nuanced complexity that could almost beguile one into pulling out records whose bug-eyed earnestness has not worn well with casual fans. And he is obviously right to identify the apostate Bob Dylan, who so enraged Seeger by playing electric instruments at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, as the last half-century's most original explorer of the folk idea.
But Dylan is so protean and prolix that you can use him to explore any number of things, and parsing his songs is a favorite ploy of intellectuals set on demonstrating their intimacy with popular culture. So given Filene's interest in the remade past, he should have gone easier on Dylan's 60's output, concentrating instead on the records of the 90's, which he stuffs in at the very end. A new vision of America's musical and spiritual past has been half-articulated during the past decade in two Dylan albums reprising often obscure canonical material combined with his folk-sounding, Grammy-winning "Time Out of Mind" (1997) and the rerelease of Harry Smith's 1952 "Anthology of American Folk Music." Rooted in the recordings of Peer and his contemporaries, and in the Lomaxes' collecting as well, this work spins a vision of pre-World War I America as Bizarroworld Lost -- a site of magic, myth and mystery, a place where honest men told their desperate truths and vanished into the dust. This vision has risen up alongside the wide-ranging and inchoate folkie culture that is busy being born right now -- a culture that stretches from black blues neotraditionalists to the punky faux honky-tonkers of the alt-country movement.
There is no reason to believe that the new vision is any more factual than those that preceded it. It is merely the richest and most recent story certain seekers after the real and the beautiful have devised for themselves. In an era when increasingly interconnected and information-laden media have rendered both reality and beauty harder to grasp, and to live for, such stories play the vital function of sparking new kinds of musical creation -- the products of which, at their best, transcend their theoretical underpinnings as the best art always does. Filene has set himself the task of telling the stories' story. If he has failed to bring them into the present, no doubt that is because he too finds more comfort and inspiration in the past.

HEADLINE: COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE WEB: A FOUNDER;
An Archetypal Entrepreneur Says Mere Profits Are Not Enough

 BODY:
In a single day, Aug. 9, 1995, Marc Andreessen became the epitome of the Web entrepreneur: 20-something, technonerdy and, thanks to a successful initial public stock offering, suddenly worth $58 million.
A few years earlier, while a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Mr. Andreessen had been one of the developers of Mosaic, a free software program that was the first popular Web browser. With Jim Clark, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Mr. Andreessen subsequently founded Netscape Communications. Netscape created a commercial version of Mosaic --and started a phenomenon when the company's stock soared 92 percent on that first day of trading in August 1995, even though Netscape was profitless. 
 Suddenly, every young geek wanted to start a Web business and become the next Marc Andreessen.
Mr. Andreessen, now 29 and the co-founder and chairman of Loudcloud, a Web-development company, recently spoke with John Markoff of The Times about the Web, then and now.
 
Q. What's most in line with what you expected when you were developing the Web?
 
A. It was really hard to predict that there would be any uptake. The first release of Mosaic went to 12 people, literally. They then passed it on to 100 people each, and before long we had 100 and then 1,000 and then 10,000 users and then a million users and we were like, "Whoa!" When I started going to parties and people I'd never met started to say, "What about this Mosaic thing," then I knew something was happening.
 
Q. What's been the biggest surprise?
 
A. That ranks as the biggest surprise. And then the next biggest surprise was the opportunity to build a business, and then the biggest surprise after that was the boom that came in 1996, '97, '98. And then the growth of the companies like Amazon and eBay.
 
Q. What has Microsoft's impact on the Web been?
 
A. The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley right now -- not shared by me -- is that Microsoft had an impact on the Internet in the mid-1990's but no longer does. Then there is another view among Microsoft boosters that says that they have an 80 to 90 percent browser share, and with all of their different initiatives and software development efforts they are going to be a major factor.
The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, although probably closer to the actual Microsoft point of view because they are still a very, very powerful company that has a tremendous amount of influence over software. And at the end of the day the Internet is still all about software.
 
Q. What can we learn from the e-commerce meltdown of the last couple months?
 
A. You've got to build a real business. A lot of people have it wrong right now. They say the key is you have to be profitable. It's actually not enough in modern business; you have to be hugely, insanely profitable to build a lasting business in the modern economy. The landscape is so competitive. Just think about what it would take to compete with Amazon.
 
Q. So far the Web has been a PC phenomenon. How quickly will cell phones and digital appliances replace the PC?
 
A. It's not clear it's an issue of displacement. The user experience is very different, and one thing people have always underestimated is the importance of the user experience. You have a different-size screen and a different kind of keyboard.
I think all of the attempts to graft a browser interface on top of a cell phone are going to fail. The key is you have to say, "O.K., what do people really want to do when they're mobile?" Probably some level of e-mail, probably some level of information access, like traffic reports. Maybe or maybe not e-commerce or what they're calling "mobile commerce."
 
Q. What might be the next big impact of the Web?
 
A. Most companies still have not integrated the Web into their fundamental operations. That's the biggest thing on the business side. The consumer phenomenon is extremely hard to predict. Nobody predicted eBay or Amazon in its modern form, nobody predicted instant messaging.

HEADLINE: COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE WEB: ESSAY;
Fast-Changing Genie Alters the World

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
At the outset, it was a free and simple map to the buried treasures of the information age.
Then it morphed into something else, fueling an astounding "new economy" gold rush that at its peak last year contributed several trillion dollars in new wealth to the nation's stock markets. (Lately, things have not panned out as well for the prospectors.) 
 In a remarkably short period, the World Wide Web has touched or has promised to alter -- some would say threaten -- virtually every aspect of modern life. The Web has caused giant corporations to adjust their business strategies, whether General Electric, General Motors or General Mills. And such are the abilities of the Web to "scale" -- whether up or down -- that it is also restoring craft and commerce in remote Cambodian villages. (Click on www.villageleap.com to view the current selection of woven scarves from the village of Robib in north central Cambodia. Major credit cards cheerfully accepted.)
The Web has been hailed as the most significant computing advance of the 20th century, and yet to see the Web as a single, static invention is to miss the point. Today's Web is not yesterday's, or tomorrow's.
Initially, the Web simply exploited the most powerful attribute of what was then a collection of computer networks called the Internet. That attribute, simply put, was the ability to share information globally and, when everything was working, instantaneously.
Recall that during this same period, in the early 1990's, companies like America Online and Prodigy were trying to keep computer users corralled within proprietary online services. Such services, which by that point had attracted only a few million users combined, were designed to make customers captive audiences of whatever "content" the network operators chose to provide. (It says as much about the adaptability of America Online's executives, as it does about evolving technology, that AOL has been able to turn itself into one of Web's most popular brand names.)
Compared with the old proprietary approach, the Web had a truly worldwide reach -- even if going overseas meant little more, at first, than checking the Webcam that was trained on a coffee pot in a Cambridge University computer lab.
The Web's strengths were precisely what many experts had long viewed as the Internet's weakness: the so-called "any to any" quality that treated all computers on the network as equals. Unlike the telephone network, in the words of David Eisenberg, the former Bell Labs researcher, the Internet was the ultimate "stupid" network, because all the intelligence and the power resided at the end points, not in the middle.
As with the Internet itself, the Web's roots lay in the late 1960's. Back then, Douglas Engelbart, a young engineer leading a small team of researchers at Stanford Research Institute, and Ted Nelson, a social scientist working solo, had independently come up with an idea that came to be called hypertext. With hypertext, information that allows the cross-referencing of digital documents is encoded right into the documents.
But it was not until 1990 that Tim Berners-Lee, a British programmer at the CERN physics research center in Geneva, developed hypertext markup language -- or HTML, the embedded referencing system that is encoded into each Web document. It was HTML, followed a few years later by easy-to-use Web browser software like Mosaic (and Mosaic's commercial offshoot, Netscape Navigator), that made today's Web feasible.
But feasibility also came in a confluence of related technologies that made computers usable by nontechnical people: mice pointing devices; graphical, or image-based, interfaces; widespread commercial access to the Internet; and perhaps most important, affordable personal computers with sufficient power to search for and display graphical information.
The Web turned the formerly text-based Internet into a multimedia system. And as technology continues to evolve, the Web is incorporating elements of all other media -- print publishing, telephones, music and even television and movies. (Of course, as anyone who has conducted an Internet phone conversation or downloaded a Web video can attest, the medium is not yet always as good as the message.)
Where does the Web go next?
As it moves beyond the PC onto hand-held devices, tablet computers and other so-called digital appliances, while spinning out a gossamer matrix of fiber optic cables and wireless antennas, the Web seems intent on living up to its World Wide name. Today, about half the nation's population has access to the Web via PC's. Within a few years, the Web could be accessible by half the global population, although in many cases the access will be through digital cell phones and other wireless devices.
Another watershed technology is also starting to redefine the Webscape. Until now, the Web has largely involved humans retrieving information from machines. But now comes a protocol known as XML, for Extensible Markup Language. XML organizes data so that computers can communicate directly without human intervention.
Within the next three years, XML is expected to be at the heart of the next-generation Web. And the cultural implications may be even more profound than with the first generation.
One possibility is the creation of vast automated global markets in which suppliers and manufacturers can let their computers find, buy and sell goods and services roboticly. Or genetic researchers looking for gene therapies could turn their computers loose to sift through one another's databases to identify and propose medically promising possibilities.
What are the consequences, if many routines of modern life can be conducted without human intervention?
Though the Web was initially hailed as a global digital library of Alexandria, it soon became apparent that the free flow of digital information had a darker side. The last seven years of the Web have brought new social challenges, including new threats to privacy and intellectual property law. Whether music, child pornography or hate speech, the flow of information across geographic, legal and cultural boundaries is now virtually unstoppable.
What will happen in technology's next generation, when Web machines routinely speak directly to other machines? A grand utopian transformation? Or is the world about to embark on the dark course described in Arthur C. Clarke's 1965 short story, "Dial F for Frankenstein"? The story details the first moments of a globally connected computer network, in which the network becomes a sentient being -- though one that behaves like a 2-year-old child.
In reality, the impact of the Web's next generation will probably resemble the current one, with changes taking root on the broad middle ground between human perfection and willful machine tantrums. The only certainty may be this: The world will not have time to comfortably contemplate the consequences, for the next chapter in Web's history is already hurtling forward, in Internet time.

HEADLINE: New Economy;
Science fiction has long been the role model for the Internet world. But how does the reality fit in with the fantasy?

BYLINE: By John Schwartz 

 BODY:
CYBERSPACE didn't turn out quite as advertised.
Not that I'm complaining. I spend hours a day online, whether grabbing the news and mail, doing research, becoming involved in discussions, or simply wandering in the ether. But nothing I've encountered online has ever matched the experience the novelist William Gibson described in "Neuromancer," the first installment in an influential 1980's trilogy. "Neuromancer" gave countless readers their first vision of what might come to pass when they themselves could "jack in" to a worldwide network: 
 A gray disk, the color of Chiba sky.
Now --
Disk beginning to rotate, faster, becoming a sphere of paler gray. Expanding --
And flowed, flowered for him, fluid neon origami trick, the unfolding of his distanceless home, his country, transparent 3D chessboard extending to infinity. Inner eye opening to the stepped scarlet pyramid of the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank of America, and high and very far away he saw the spiral arms of military systems, forever beyond his reach.
This does not happen on a visit to Walmart.com.
But not for lack of trying on behalf of the technovisioneers, who labored to recreate the online experiences envisioned by authors like Mr. Gibson and Neal Stephenson -- and, incidentally, to become rich in the process. In the biggest collaborative act of creation since M. C. Escher drew a pair of hands drawing each other, the World Wide Web and the so-called new economy have looked to the literature of science fiction for a sense of direction and of style.
The cross-fertilization worked both ways. In an afterword to the edition of the "Neuromancer" trilogy produced on floppy disc by the Voyager Company in 1991, Mr. Gibson said his "direct inspiration" for the elegant little machines his characters use to reach cyberspace was a billboard advertising the sleek, portable Apple IIc computer.
"This seductive little unit, looking not that much bigger, really, than your present-day Powerbook, was depicted dangling from a handle in the hand of some unseen suit with a nicely laundered cuff," he wrote. "I didn't know that you had to lug the monitor around, as well, plus a bulky little transformer and another disk drive that weighed nearly as much as the computer itself."
The headlong rush toward a future of our own design was stirred with hyperactive fervor by publications like Wired magazine, which put the science fiction writer Bruce Sterling on its first-ever cover in March 1993, and Mr. Gibson a few months later.
"At Wired, we often talked about whether we were finding a revolution or making one," Kevin Kelly, a former executive editor of the magazine, said in an e-mail message. "We did both, of course."
"The acts of finding and creating are exactly identical," Mr. Kelly added. "There is no conceptual difference."
If this seems overstated, Mr. Kelly asks what's wrong with that. "I think hype gets a bum rap," he said. "Hype is the derogatory term for the good practice of imagining what we are creating, because unless we can imagine it we can not find it or make it."
"And the more the idea is rounded out by description and anticipation, the more it is believed and articulated, the more possible it becomes," he said. "This is why science fiction is now the theology of our times."
It's so seductive. We're not just fantasizing, or peddling hype: we're building the future -- leading the way! A problem with that kind of thinking is that dreams might not be the best models for things that have to survive the harsh light of day.
For a while there, the hypemongers of the World Wide Web were able to dangle, virtually, any idea and the venture capital moneymen would open their pockets. Take the company public and the day traders and home investors would claw at each other for a chance to give up their cash. From moment to moment, the buzzword would change. "We're a portal." "We're a community." "We're B2B." "B2C." Too seldom did anyone ask if the business made sense, or if it could ever make money.
At the height of the silliness last winter, a buddy of mine, Doug Levy, performed an impromptu experiment. Mr. Levy, a former newspaper reporter, was working as a manager for the online drugstore PlanetRX, and he was showing a Canadian friend around Silicon Valley. He took her to one of those parties that is all about networking -- young singles on the make, looking for love, for money or some mixture of the two.
At such events, people usually talk about their work. Doug didn't feel like talking about his company, which wasn't hiring at the time anyway. So he decided to invent a company. He recalls thinking that he would "make up something that was so ridiculous that people wouldn't want to talk to me."
In honor of his Canadian visitor, he told anyone who struck up a conversation with him that he was starting an Internet-based company that focused on hockey. He was developing a training system, he explained, in which the user would attach location sensors to his skates, which would transmit up-to-the-second information to a radio-equipped Palm VII handheld computer. The machine would then be able to give skating and hockey guidance, in real time.
Mr. Levy giggled just recalling the sheer idiocy of the idea: "What's the last thing somebody wants to do when learning to play hockey or learning to skate? Looking at the screen of a handheld!"
As the night progressed, however, he found that his little joke was being heard dead earnest. "I wound up having engineers following me around the room, handing me their business cards and saying they could write the Java script for my site," he said.
That was then. Now the Nasdaq composite is 42 percent below its high point set in March. And Mr. Levy's PlanetRX, like so many other Internet start-ups, seldom is referred to without the modifier "troubled." (He has left the company to become a consultant to technology companies.)
Even after the Nasdaq meltdown was well under way, the message that reality actually does matter hadn't quite sunk in. A few months later, Mr. Levy was sitting at another dull party and again amusing himself with talk of his hockey-training idea. He hoped it it might discourage a drunken techie from continuing to bend his ear.
Instead, the listener was soon lobbying for the position of chief technology officer of Mr. Levy's hockey company. "He thought he had it all figured out," Mr. Levy recalled. "He thought of other sports where the same technology could be used."
When Mr. Gibson, the novelist, imagined cyberspace, he called it a "consensual hallucination." Maybe things did turn out as advertised, after all.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Weak Retail And Dot-coms Take a Toll

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT and JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
The last week brought a barrage of bad news from marketers and the media that some described as the gloomiest since the recession years of the early 1990's.
There were reports of sudden sharp slowdowns in the sales of mainstay products like personal computers, automobiles, appliances and apparel. Layoffs were announced by Knight Ridder. Hiring freezes were imposed by the News Corporation, parent of networks like Fox Broadcasting and Fox News Channel, and the NBC unit of General Electric, which also asked division heads to reconsider Christmas parties and even to cut back on newspaper subscriptions. 
 Consumer confidence in a closely watched index compiled by the University of Michigan skidded to its lowest level in more than two years. And Dow Jones & Company reduced its profit estimates for 2001 in the face of a decline in advertising lineage, as did the Tribune Company.
An advertising slowdown usually happens in slow motion, "but this time, it's like the market fell off a cliff," said Bill Cella, director for broadcast and programming at Universal McCann in New York, the media services unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. "The fourth quarter has been virtually a dead quarter for ad spending." McCann is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
"We're at the precipice, looking a little scared," said Jon Mandel, co-managing director at MediaCom in New York, the media services agency owned by the Grey Global Group.
As bad as conditions appeared, they could look much worse in just a couple of weeks, if the early sluggishness in holiday shopping or the slump in sales of cars and trucks is not reversed.
So are the unusually prosperous times that advertisers, agencies and the media have enjoyed most recently coming to an abrupt end? The prevailing opinion, like the electorate on Nov. 7, is closely divided. For every top executive who says the sky is falling, it seems, there is another who perceives the deluge to be pennies from heaven.
"It's like the stock market," said Paul Rittenberg, senior vice president for ad sales at Fox News Channel in New York. "For the last five or six years, it's been double-digit increases every year, and all of the sudden it comes to a screeching halt."
Don Logan, chief executive at Time Inc. in New York, the giant magazine publishing division of Time Warner, agreed.
"We've had extraordinary increases for the last couple years," Mr. Logan said. "Some of it was fueled by the dot-coms, whose spending we hadn't seen before, and it showed up in television and print especially."
"Our rate of growth is slower in the fourth quarter than the year before," he added, because "many of those dot-coms are not here anymore."
The disappearance of an estimated $200 million in dot-com spending is a major reason for the extreme softness in fourth-quarter revenue for some media, like local television stations and the so-called scatter market, where advertisers buy time on broadcast TV networks soon before the commercials run. Indeed, there is widespread agreement among network executives and ad buyers that this is the slowest fourth-quarter scatter market since the Gulf War and recession days of 1991.
The dot-coms "spent like drunken monkeys trying to build their brands," said one television executive. "They were willing to pay any price. They were unsophisticated and in a hurry." The executive did not want to be identified for fear of alienating those companies if by some chance they ever get back on their feet and resume advertising.
"Dot-com money was like a fool's gold rush," said Gene DeWitt, chairman and chief executive at Optimedia US in New York, a media services agency that is part of the Optimedia division of the Publicis Groupe. "The fools may still be around, but the gold is gone."
Not only is the gold gone, but it vanished so quickly. Decisions to buy or not to buy -- and reversals of those decisions -- are now made at breakneck speed and at the last minute. So when demand is rising, there's a stampede to buy and prices can soar. Conversely, when demand is falling, there's a stampede away from buying and prices can plunge.
"When we're doing some buying, it's very affordable," Mr. Cella at Universal McCann said. "Where for years there had been 25, 30 percent increases, we haven't seen that at all."
"There's a bit of a correction," he added, that was inevitable after the euphoric, inflated markets of 1999 and early this year. That has clearly given buyers much greater leverage over sellers than has been the case recently, to the point where some agencies that bought commercial time at record rates in the "upfront," or advance, market for the 2000-2001 TV season may be thinking of trying to sweeten the terms of those deals.
One factor weakening the advertising outlook is a disparity in performance between some local and national media. For instance, according to Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann, spending for ads in local newspapers will increase 4.4 percent in 2000 from 1999 -- far less than the 13 percent increase for spending for ads in national newspapers. The reason Mr. Coen gave was continued sluggishness in ads from retailers.
For 2001, Mr. Coen predicted, ad spending in local newspapers will lag their national counterparts again, and for the same reason, with a 4 percent gain versus a 7 percent gain.
Another factor contributing to the weakness is that "there are no major events on the calendar" besides the Super Bowl to act "as engines to drive things forward," said Kevin Malloy, chief executive for international operations at the Starcom MediaVest Group in New York, a media services agency owned by the Bcom3 Group.
Dan Rank, head of national TV buying for the OMD USA division of Optimum Media Direction in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, estimated that the biggest media event of 2000, the Summer Olympics, "sucked a couple of hundred million dollars in incremental money" into the third quarter, weakening the fourth quarter.
Add that missing money to the absent dot-com dollars and spending cutbacks by consumer-product advertisers whose business has suddenly softened "and six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred million dollars is gone," Mr. Rank estimated, "and that's all it takes" to cool a feverish market down to frigid.
"Is advertising spending being cut on a wholesale basis?" he asked rhetorically. "No. Is it being cut 5 or 6 percent? Yes. And in our business, 5 or 6 percent means the difference between a great year and a not-so-great year."
The question now is, how long does the slowdown last? And will it accelerate into a downward spiral?
"It's a softening, but it's not a crashing," said Jack Kliger, president and chief executive at Hachette Filipacchi Magazines in New York, part of the Lagardere Group, which owns publications like Elle, Premiere and Woman's Day. "We don't think we're in a recession or heading into one."
"How many years have we been running pretty hot, five, six?" he asked. "There's a certain digestion now. Our outlook for next year is for growth in the low-to-mid single digits, versus a revenue gain for 2000 of from 8 to 10 percent."
Mr. Kliger has expansion plans for 2001 that include the introduction of Elle Girl, aimed at teenage readers, and adding more editorial pages to the movie magazine Premiere.
"A good idea is a good idea not only in the best of times," he said. "There is certainly no recession among teens, and entertainment does well in many economies."
The new year will get off to a strong start at CBS, owned by Viacom, which is carrying Super Bowl XXXV and introducing a sequel to the summer hit "Survivor."
"For the first quarter, the jury is still out right now, but it looks strong," said Joseph Abruzzese, president for network sales at CBS in New York.
Mr. Malloy at Starcom MediaVest said: "I don't think the sky is falling. What we're seeing is a flattening of advertisers' budgets, or maybe slight increases."
One big advertiser, the Ford division of the Ford Motor Company, is budgeting a "fairly flat" figure for 2001 compared with 2000, said Julie Roehm, car marketing communications manager in Dearborn, Mich., "but we haven't cut back."
Rather, "we have gotten better at how we spend," she added, citing an elaborate campaign with a fashion theme for the Ford Focus line that will run in Hachette Filipacchi magazines, as well as other campaigns that combine spending in print, television and Internet media. Ford does not disclose spending data, but the 2000 budget to advertise Ford division products is about $750 million.
Automotive advertising, the largest category for all media, "is kind of a mixed bag" for 2001 at Time Inc., Mr. Logan said. "Imports continue to be strong; with Detroit, we expect to have a decent year."
Over all, "we expect '01 will be a pretty good year," he added, after the media get through the fourth quarter and the problems caused by "many companies trying to shore up earnings" through spending cuts.
As a sign of that cautiously optimistic outlook, Time Inc., unlike other media companies, is not asking that holiday parties be canceled.
"As a matter of fact, I'm going to all of them," Mr. Logan said, laughing, "all of them that I can."

HEADLINE: Johnson City Journal;
In Winter, Hill Country Texans Live by Their Watts

BYLINE: By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: JOHNSON CITY, Tex., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Back in 1990, Norma Honeycutt realized that this quiet ranching community of about 900 people, named for an uncle of President Lyndon B. Johnson, was dying a slow economic death.
"The cattle business had just about dried up," Mrs. Honeycutt recalled recently. "There was only one grocery store left, all the storefronts downtown had been abandoned, and our kids were moving away to take jobs in the bigger cities." 
 Even the town's usually reliable source of tourist revenue, President Johnson's boyhood home, was languishing, a victim of dreary winter weather and fading memories of the 36th president.
"The whole place was drab and humdrum and even the people who lived in Johnson City didn't want to be here in wintertime," said Mrs. Honeycutt, a retired insurance executive.
But that was before Mrs. Honeycutt, now 64, used money raised from bake sales to dress up the Blanco County Courthouse here with Christmas lights -- thousands of Christmas lights -- and thus began a movement that has become a major winter tourist attraction in Central Texas.
"The scariest time was that first night, when we had a big crowd gathered around the courthouse to turn the lights on all at once. We kept saying, 'Let there be light, let there be light,' and nothing happened," she recalled recently. "It turned out that the old electrician manning the light switch was deaf and couldn't hear us."
Eventually, the lights came on, and what Mrs. Honeycutt began that evening in 1990 has grown in the intervening decade into the Texas Hill Country Regional Lighting Trail. The trail is a chain of 12 small cities, strung out over 150 miles of rolling hills in Central Texas, that set their main streets ablaze with millions of sparkling lights each year between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve.
The Lighting Trail attracts thousands of visitors each year, drawn not just by the lights but by a series of related events, including arts and crafts shows, parades of Christmas-lighted horses and wagons and seasonal ethnic festivals capitalizing on the cultural history of the area, Mrs. Honeycutt said.
"Every one of our storefronts is occupied nowadays, and a lot of the business people tell me they couldn't make it through the winter without the tourists coming to see all the lights," she said, adding modestly, "Of course, just calling them 'lights' doesn't really capture what we do out here."
From tiny Bulverde in the south, near San Antonio, to even tinier Goldthwaite in the north, the town squares and area homes are alight with every imaginable kind of Christmas display: glowing candy canes and snowflakes are mounted on power poles along the streets; winged angels soar over leaping reindeer in brilliantly lighted trees; wagons with Santas wearing cowboy hats are drawn skyward by horses; carousels, windmills, snowmen, toy soldiers and, of course, many versions of three wise men are all formed by dazzling arrays of multicolored lights in a hundred different settings.
Many displays mingle Christmas traditions with Western themes or the towns' cultural heritage. At a Weihnachten celebration last week in nearby Fredericksburg, 52 trees in the Marketplatz were decorated as they might have been by the town's founding German ancestors, and 400 people participated in a traditional candlelight prayer parade among a half-dozen of the town's churches. At the Bethany Lutheran Church, a live Nativity scene featured Sunday school students playing the Holy Family. (The scene was not overly solemn. At one point, the children, barely suppressing giggles as an adult urged them to remain motionless, turned a tinsel wreath into a flying Frisbee, and the Virgin Mary very nearly was hit in the head.)
There are now more than a million Christmas lights in Johnson City alone, said Nick Nelson, who gives guided carriage rides through town during the season. He explained the spirit behind the displays by pointing to a chain of lights on the courthouse lawn that spelled out "Hill Country Style."
"That means do it up big, do it up right, and that's just what we do," Mr. Nelson said. "A lot of people come out here and can't believe that a little town like this can put on such an amazing show."
Ray and June Heim, who traveled nearly 500 miles from near Lubbock with a family friend, Wanda Miller, just to see the lights, said the visit was an annual tradition.
"We just love to see all the small towns lit up, and we love to eat the German food over in Fredericksburg," Mrs. Heim said.
Though Mrs. Honeycutt is less active in the lighting project these days, her brainchild has expanded to include the Hill Country communities of Blanco, Burnet, Canyon Lake, Dripping Springs, Llano, Mason, Marble Falls and Round Mountain.
"There's just too much to see in one night, so we recommend that people take two or three days to see all 12 cities," said Deborah Farquhar-Garner, who now directs the Lighting Trail's activities from its headquarters in Fredericksburg.
Mrs. Farquhar-Garner estimates that hundreds of thousands of visitors have seen the lights in the last decade, but she said no one knows exactly how many, nor their exact financial impact on the Hill Country.
"We don't even know for sure how many lights are involved," she said, "but we think it's somewhere over seven million. We just know we're getting an awful lot of people spending an awful lot of money, and it's been great."

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE BIG NEWS;
Floridians at Last Have a Vote to Cheer

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 10

 BODY:
All day Saturday and into that evening, people here waited hopefully for a decision, an outcome. They sat in front of television sets and watched experts analyze the contest and theorize on first one candidate, then another. Others gathered in bars, restaurants and just on sidewalks, talking in small groups, hoping, some even praying.
It was not just the big story, it was the only story. 
 Would a winner ever be named, in what had become one of the closest contests in history?
It seemed, to them, to take forever.
Then, on Saturday evening, the question on so many minds was finally answered. The candidate who had won the hearts and souls of most people here had the votes he needed.
It was over.
"I was shocked," Chris Weinke, quarterback for the Florida State University Seminoles, told reporters after winning the Heisman Trophy.
That other thing, the recount mess, might not be over -- and may never be over, it seems to many people -- but that story was overwhelmed here in the Florida Panhandle. Tallahassee, after all, is home to both the Florida Supreme Court and Florida State University.
Many, many beers were emptied. Many, many war cries rang through the night. Many, many people, rescue workers said, were still drunk when the sun came up.
The presidential election could wait, and would wait, anyway. Waiting is what it has been about. The United States Supreme Court on Saturday halted the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court, so Tallahassee, as reporters said, was no longer the story, anyway.
In Tallahassee, where the Seminoles are heading toward what many here hope will be another national college football championship, Mr. Weinke, a senior quarterback, had won the nation's highest individual football award. As in the presidential race, it was close. He edged Josh Heupel, the quarterback at Oklahoma, 1,628 votes to 1,552.
"I voted for Bush, but every vote should be counted," said Travis Oaks, 40, at Tallahassee's Central Fire Station. He could live with the winner, no matter who it was.
So, he was asked, if Mr. Weinke had been edged out by Mr. Heupel or some other candidate, would he be satisfied with that outcome, too? "No," he said immediately. "That's two different things, presidential politics and football. In football, it's win at all costs."
Some people had doubted that Mr. Weinke would win the Heisman because of his age. He is old for a college athlete at 28, after delaying his college football career to play minor league baseball.
The top story in The Tallahassee Democrat, the day after a dizzying, history-making day in that other big contest, carried a dignified banner headline:
"Weinke credits Heisman win to experience."
Beneath that, was this:
"Court cuts short recount."
That, said many people here, was how it should have been.
"It the biggest story in this city," said T. J. Almond, a student at Florida State who is majoring in applied economics.
At the Tallahassee Central Fire Station, firefighters said it was just more fun to talk about one race -- the Heisman contest -- than the other.
"Football here is big time," said Mr. Oaks. "The big story here would be if we did not have a quarterback or running back in the Heisman race."
The Heisman competition would have taken precedence anyway, he said, but the on-and-on presidential race has worn people down and numbed their interest.
People here found comfort in the Heisman victory for another reason, Mr. Oaks said. For weeks, Floridians have seen their state ridiculed around the country, and seen it become the focus of late-night television sarcasm and comedy.
"I hate to see Florida look like a bunch of idiots," Mr. Oaks said. If some other state had been the deciding one in this election, its elections process, too, would have shown itself to be imperfect, he said.
Football games have a final whistle, and almost always there is a winner and a loser.
Kyle Henson, 11, of Land O' Lakes, Fla., said there had been a little talk in his school about the election, "but all the people are talking about the Heisman."
When the presidential election is over, Mr. Weinke will still have an advantage over the president-elect, joked Ed Rosenberg, the manager at A. J.'s sports bar.
"His election," Mr. Rosenberg said, "is more credible."

HEADLINE: In a Charitable Mood? Just Pick, Then Click

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
The Hunger Site, the Internet's first click-to-donate venture, was an instant hit -- a no-charge way to help save lives.
It was so simple: Go to the computer, sign on to TheHungerSite.com, click the "Donate Free Food" button, and, with each click, every business advertising on the site would donate a half-cent to the United Nations World Food Program, enough to buy a quarter-cup of grain for the world's poorest people. 
 Web surfers leaped at the chance to contribute to a cause -- with someone else's money. Last December, when the Hunger Site had been up about six months, it was getting more than eight million clicks a month, generating about $40,000 for the food program from each of that month's dozen business sponsors for a total of $480,000.
Everyone was happy: The United Nations food program got new income, and new interest in its work. Sponsors got a thousand pairs of eyes on their advertisements for every $50 they paid, and a bolstered reputation for social responsibility. And the site's visitors had the pleasure of helping the poor.
"I go to the Hunger Site just about every day," said Kris Berggren, a freelance writer in Minneapolis. "How can you pass it up? It's so easy, it helps kids, and it doesn't cost me anything."
But these days, the Hunger Site has hit rocky times. In November, the United Nations World Food Program suddenly ended its participation, concerned about the finances of the organization that now runs the Hunger Site and troubled that the donations were being passed on more slowly. Though the Hunger Site now supports two other food programs, it has fewer visitors and fewer sponsors, in part because of the new competition it spawned.
A galaxy of click-and-donate sites has sprung up in recent months, modeled on the Hunger Site. One site pays for mammograms for poor women. On one site, each click gets 15 seconds of care for a child with AIDS, and on another site each click buys a vitamin A capsule to be distributed by Unicef.
The range, the specificity and the gimmicks are all stunning:
*The Environmental News Network has a click-to-donate index, www.enn.com/interact/freedonate .asp, listing dozens of sites offering free donations to plant trees, save bats, help orphans, cure Parkinson's disease, shelter the homeless and more.
*Ecologyfund.com lets those interested in saving open land choose where their money should go. Click on the parrot, and Mexico's largest conservation group gets a donation that will pay for 16.5 square feet of Sierra Madre forest. Click on the bear, and the Nature Conservancy of Canada gets money to conserve 0.8 square feet of Canadian wild land. Or click on all seven pictures, and pay for the preservation of 283 square feet around the world. Do it every day for a year, the site advises, and preserve a whole acre, free.
*Stargiving.com combines the American passions for celebrities, contests and charity. Visitors can click for a free donation (paid for, that is, by a corporate sponsor) to a star's favorite cause and then register for a chance to meet that celebrity. Every click on Magic Johnson, for example, generates a contribution to the Magic Johnson Foundation, and one wins dinner and a Lakers game with the former basketball star.
Just how much these sites will produce for charity -- or for the for-profit companies that run them -- remains an open question. While the United Nations Food Program got more than $3 million from the Hunger Site in 18 months, no other site has produced anywhere near that kind of money. And most of the sites are run by start-up companies struggling to break even.
Still, most beneficiaries love the click-to-donate sites, as much for consciousness-raising as for any income they produce.
"As a fund-raiser, I love it because it gets our name out there, heightens awareness of our work and doesn't cost us anything," said Sheri-Lynn Armstrong, development director of the Nature Conservancy of Canada, the beneficiary of an EcologyFund.com site.
The Hunger Site was the brainchild of John Breen, a computer programmer from Bloomington, Ind., who created a site showing a map of the world, with one country darkening every 3.6 seconds to represent a death from hunger. The sponsors agreed to pay the United Nations food program for each click on the "Donate Free Food" button; only one click a day by each visitor would be counted. But as the number of visitors skyrocketed, the time and costs involved in running the site rose, too, and by late last year, Mr. Breen was overwhelmed. In February, he sold the site for an undisclosed price to GreaterGood, a Seattle-based online shopping mall that gave part of its sales to charity.
Since then, the site has become more obviously commercial, offering extra donations if visitors buy holiday wreaths or Hunger Site hats, or click the link to Amazon.com and make a first-time purchase there.
GreaterGood, which has created five more click-to-donate sites since buying the Hunger Site, takes a 25 percent cut of the donations to cover its costs, and has recently been having cash-flow problems.
While the Hunger Site still draws far more traffic than the other sites, it has suffered since GreaterGood took over. Early in November, the company decided that the United Nations food program should not be the only beneficiary, and added two other food programs, Second Harvest and Mercy Corps. On Nov. 23, the United Nations food program ended its relationship with the Hunger Site, announcing that it had received only $200,000 of the $371,675 the site raised between June and September.
GreaterGood wired the additional $171,675 to the United Nations food program on Dec. 6, but Abby Spring, the food program's spokeswoman, said the relationship would not resume.
"When John Breen started the Hunger Site, the agreement was that when someone clicked, the sponsor would send the money directly to the food program," Ms. Spring said. "After the GreaterGood became the intermediary, we felt the money was coming in too slowly. We're deeply grateful that the Hunger Site created more awareness of our work, and gave us $3 million, but as a matter of integrity, and for the future of this kind of site, we thought it was important to let the public know that the money wasn't coming as quickly as it was supposed to."
GreaterGood was surprised by the food program's action. "We were only 20 days late on that payment," said Lynn Ridenour, the marketing director. "And we had been warning them since September that we were expecting a shortfall because of cash flow problems and sponsors who were slow in paying what they owed."
Despite its troubles with the Hunger Site, Ms. Ridenour said GreaterGood was committed to click-to-donate sites.
"We started the breast cancer site and the kids with AIDS site in September, our land-mine site just went up Nov. 30, and based on e-mails from visitors to our sites, we're going to be starting an animal-rights site," Ms. Ridenour said. "It's a promising field, even though the economics are very different from a year ago. Sponsors are not so willing to pay a flat fee for the eyeballs anymore. Instead, they want to pay on the basis of the further actions the visitors to the site take, like buying something."
Operators of the other click-to-donate sites face the same problem.
"We're all trying to develop new revenue streams, to get ourself into a break-even position," said Greg Hesterberg, a founder of EcologyFund .com, one of the click-and-donate sites that passes on 100 percent of the donations it generates. "The whole economics of the Internet are changing so fast it's hard to know where this will go."

HEADLINE: Gene-Altered Corn Changes Dynamics Of Grain Industry

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa

 BODY:
At the Archer Daniels Midland Company's plant these days, the arriving truckloads of No. 2 yellow corn all need to pass the same test: they are checked for odor, damage, moisture, and something called Cry9C.
A seven-member crew divides, sifts, weighs, grinds and even sniffs the corn samples -- a practice that grew more complicated a few weeks ago, after Kraft Foods recalled millions of taco shells possibly containing StarLink, a genetically engineered variety of corn that produces the Cry9C protein. The corn is not supposed to be in the human food supply because of concerns it might trigger allergic reactions. 
 Now, after a series of recalls, nearly every major food and agriculture company is frantically testing for Cry9C. The result has been a costly disruption to the nation's grain-handling system. Scores of trucks, rail cars and river barges are being turned away daily by inspectors who say that a splotch of red dye has turned up on what looks like a home pregnancy test, meaning their corn is not fit for food.
"It's a logistical nightmare," said Steven Phillips, the grain merchandiser at East Central Iowa Co-op in Hudson, a supplier to the plant here. "We had 15 truckloads of corn rejected last week."
The costs for the corn's developer, Aventis CropScience, are huge. It has promised to find markets for this year's StarLink crop and to compensate farmers, elevator operators like Mr. Phillips and processors for some of their expenses. Aventis received less than a million dollars in licensing fees over the last three years on StarLink, but the controversy could cost the company several hundred million dollars to resolve.
The StarLink episode has also raised the decibel level in an already high-pitched debate over the agricultural use of biotechnology. Though most farmers seem to favor biotech crops, saying they deliver higher yields or cut down on chemical spraying, many here in Iowa say they are growing wary.
Grain processors are warning farmers about next year's harvest, with Archer Daniels running radio commercials emphasizing that its plants will not accept genetically altered crops that do not have worldwide approval. And some farmers are questioning whether to plant even varieties that have been approved for human consumption
"I don't know what I'm going to do," said Chris Huegerich, a farmer in Breda, Iowa, who grows Roundup Ready soybeans, a bioengineered variety that can be exported worldwide. "I want to do Roundup Ready beans but I'm worried something might happen. You just don't know."
Planting of StarLink, in any case, is moot; Aventis has already withdrawn its license for further sale. And no actual health hazards have been established from StarLink or any other bioengineered crops on the market. But some agricultural experts say they are worried that the StarLink case is simply a harbinger of more troubles to come.
Among other things, they say, the Cry9C mess shows how complicated the logistics of biotechnology can be for a grain-handling system that typically ships undifferentiated crops in bulk.
"We're not cut out to segregate," says Gary Alberts, a spokesman for the Iowa Institute of Cooperatives, a trade association for elevators. "We handle a lot of grain in a hurry. We're built to load a rail car in a day."
Yet now that farmers can choose between traditional and biotech seeds, new sorting, segregating and distribution needs are arising that may radically alter the dynamics of a grain-handling system built on economies of scale.
In the United States, a few big food makers have said they will seek conventional crops because of consumer concerns, but for the most part they have contracted directly with farmers to grow, say, nonbiotech corn for Frito-Lay chips. So there has been relatively little need for testing or segregation in the general grain supply.
But with increasing skepticism among consumers in Europe and Japan about bioengineered food, and in some cases new requirements for labeling, the need to separate bioengineered and conventional crops has grown. And so there may be more scenes like the roadblocks set up to stop any StarLink corn from getting into processing plants.
On a chilly morning in Cedar Rapids, a steady stream of semis was pulling up under a canopy at the inspection site to have their loads tested before entering the Archer Daniels corn processing plant, where raw corn is turned into high-fructose corn syrup, corn starch and other products.
Inspections have always taken place at processing plants, to check the quality, moisture and weight of crops, but these days two additional men are sitting by a coffee grinder, grounding up corn samples, shaking them up in water, dipping tiny strips into the solution and then waiting 10 minutes for the results.
By 9:45 a.m., the inspectors had rejected 9 trucks out of 213, each filled with about 950 bushels of corn. The number of trucks turned away is striking, since less than 0.5 percent of this year's corn acreage nationwide was planted with StarLink seed. The elevators that shipped the corn are then stuck with it until they can find an alternative buyer for another use.
The inspections have clearly slowed the process of shipping corn to market, and some farmers and truckers complain that the tests being used, intended to detect Cry9C in one kernel of corn out of 400, are flawed.
"It's all in the probing," said one trucker, who asked not to be identified. "You have 10 samples that test positive and then one that doesn't. It's all the luck of the samples."
Farmers and truckers say their loads could be rejected over the presence of just one StarLink kernel in a batch of grain sampled from the 950 bushels. And while the truckers, and farmers, have been promised compensation, they say the difficulty of finding new buyers, and possibly losing out in some markets, has been troubling.
To ease the situation, Aventis has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to approve StarLink for human consumption for four years, to allow the StarLink corn already harvested to work its way through the food chain. In the meantime, several processors are asking the E.P.A. and food companies to make a tiny percentage of Cry9C acceptable in food, as they do with many other impurities.
"When the handler makes the decision, they have to have realistic expectations," said an Agriculture Department official. "When they have zero tolerance, it's impractical."
Farmers may be the hardest hit by all the testing. Even some who knew nothing about StarLink say it has turned up in their harvest.
"I didn't grow any StarLink corn, but I got contaminated by a neighbor," said Keith Weller, 50, who farms near Westside, Iowa. "This issue of contamination is a real problem."
Some farmers who planted StarLink say they were not told about 660-foot buffer zones mandated by the E.P.A. between StarLink corn and corn grown for food, and they say pollen may have drifted even longer distances, leading to cross-pollination with a neighbor's crop.
Randy Kohorst, a 43-year-old corn and soybean farmer in Arcadia, Iowa, says he planted 200 acres of StarLink. But he says he was told nothing by the Garst Seed Company of Slater, Iowa, which sold him the seed, about buffer zones or marketing restrictions.
"We had it harvested before we heard it was a problem," he said. "And it was commingled, so now all my production is contaminated."
Now he is stuck with a StarLink crop and complaining about lost marketing opportunities.
A spokesman at Garst said that the company was informing farmers about the requirements placed on use of StarLink corn. "It's unfortunate some customers say they weren't informed about the program," said Jeff Lacina, the spokesman. "But we worked hard to get that message out."
And corn prices -- already in a slump -- may decline further this year because exports to Japan, the largest purchaser of American corn, are down because of concerns about StarLink, which has also been found in food there.
Mr. Kohorst and other farmers say the problem may be costing them more than the 25-cent premium Aventis is offering for the StarLink crop.
Elevator operators, who buy crops from farmers and then ship them to giant processors or feed lots, are also facing inconvenience, despite receiving extra transportation expenses from Aventis.
For Aventis, containing the spread of StarLink is not easy. The company says it has accounted for 90 percent of the 350,000 acres planted in 2000, but it admits that the 1998 and 1999 harvests are either buried on farms and elevators (in an undocumented fashion) or have already reached the market and entered the food stream.
To help deal with the problem, the company has supplied Cry9C test kits to grain elevators and processors around the country. It also says it will help farmers who did not plant StarLink but whose crops were contaminated by cross-pollination to find a market for their corn, and will consider additional compensation in some cases.
The bigger cost, though, could be borne by the biotech industry, which has spent billions of dollars over the last decade to develop genetically altered crops that mean higher yields for farmers and may some day deliver medicines and vaccines as well.
That effort, of course, could be upset if farmers decide not to plant biotech crops like Roundup Ready soybeans and corn, which are bioengineered to resist a common Monsanto herbicide called Roundup. Though the soybeans can be sold everywhere, the corn is unapproved in Europe.
"StarLink has definitely set back the biotech industry, maybe five years," said Lewis W. Batchelder, a senior vice president at Archer Daniels, which is based in Decatur, Ill.
Regardless of what farmers decide to plant, Jim Magnuson, general manager at the Sully Cooperative Exchange, an elevator in Sully, Iowa, says farmers need to pay more attention next year.
"For a producer, the lesson is to know exactly what you're planting," he said. "We as an industry have operated on the handshake. But what we know now is that in a big, bad world, those assurances no longer apply."

HEADLINE: Former Chief Of Romania Retakes Office Over Rightist

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In what experts called a showing of political maturity, Romanians today gave former President Ion Iliescu another term in office, rejecting an ultranationalist by a large margin.
Exit polls indicated that Mr. Iliescu had won 70 percent of the vote in his runoff against Corneliu Vadim Tudor, who had run on a promise that he would "liquidate the mafia" that has drained the economy but is infamous for his magazines' screeds against Jews, Hungarians and Gypsies. The final vote will not be known for a day or two, but recent exit polls have been accurate here. 
 Minutes after the polls closed, an angry Mr. Tudor charged that the vote was "the biggest fraud in the history of Romania" and claimed that pollsters had been paid $150,000 to invent data, bribe election monitors and sabotage vote-tallying computers.
"How can Mr. Iliescu have won the whole pot?" he demanded, wondering if the likely winning party and election officials "really think we are so stupid?" He said he would complain to an international human rights court and called the results "a victory of the Antichrist."
Television commentators refused even to discuss his charges. Emil Hurezeanu, who covers Romania for German radio, called the statement "delirium and self-parody"; and Cornel Nistorescu, editor of Evenimentul Zilei, a national daily, said: "We have more important things to discuss tonight."
When he voted at noon today, Mr. Tudor made an impromptu speech that accused his opponents of "crucifying" him and conducting a "lynching campaign." He said he was the victim of "a huge electoral fraud perpetrated by a former K.G.B. agent" -- Mr. Iliescu -- who is also "an atheist free-thinker with the blood of the people on his hands" as well as a tool of Moscow "since it lost Yugoslavia and now wants to get to the Balkans through Romania.
"Inside every child born is another Vadim Tudor, who will know what to do to protect this country," Mr. Tudor added. He said repeatedly that he is not a vengeful man and, borrowing Jesus' dying words, added: "Forgive them, God, for they know not what they do."
Mr. Iliescu said later that Mr. Tudor's failure to concede and his claims "show him for what he is: not qualified to be president or even a politician."
Mr. Iliescu's own victory speech, delivered seconds after the polls closed at 9 p.m., was a promise "to reform a suffocated economy in order to fight poverty, starvation and misery," to pursue integration with the European Union, membership in NATO and a partnership with the United States; to enforce laws against "those who have stolen our national property" and to pursue "dialogue, tolerance and cooperation."
During Mr. Iliescu's last presidency, from 1990 to 1996, he was seen as at heart a socialist who could not bring himself to close dying factories or shrink a bloated bureaucracy. Asked tonight if he had become a convert to Western-style market economics, he answered: "Life forces us to change. Those who don't are eliminated."
Despite intense interest in the race outside Romania, turnout appeared to be even lower than for the first round of voting two weeks ago, when it was less than 60 percent.
Exit polls suggested that Mr. Iliescu had picked up most of the votes for the four centrists and a moderate ethnic Hungarian candidate, who were eliminated in the first round. Many young voters, who heavily backed Mr. Tudor in the first round, apparently came over to Mr. Iliescu's side. One poll suggested that 15 percent of voters who picked Mr. Tudor the first time switched to Mr. Iliescu, while only 4 percent switched the other way.
Neither side conducted a get-out-the-vote campaign, as is routine in American elections.
Ilie Neacsu, secretary of Mr. Tudor's Greater Romania Party, said the idea was not even discussed because it "would be taken as electoral campaigning, or as propaganda." Under Romanian law, campaigning is illegal in the last 48 hours before an election.
Lucia Ceuca, a spokeswoman for Mr. Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy, said there was no voter-turnout plan, but mayors from her party were authorized to prod people to vote if turnout seemed low. In the 1996 election, she said, the party tried something like a get-out-the-vote effort. It hired political science students, some of them educated in the United States, to telephone voters, "but we received negative publicity -- people said these were poisoned phone calls."
This year, confident of victory, they did not repeat the effort.
Political experts repeated their frustration that the center-right coalition that may have begun an economic turnaround last year had been unable to pick a single candidate and had knocked itself out of running in the first round, allowing an extremist to get close to the presidency.
Dorel Sandor, a political analyst, said that the world had seen "a rational vote in the second round" and that the new government "can rely on that maturity."

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
BUSH'S AIDES SAY AN END IS IN SIGHT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush returned here this afternoon from his ranch, with his advisers saying they were now increasingly optimistic that the Supreme Court would effectively end the presidential race in his favor, perhaps within the next 36 hours.
In public, Mr. Bush's army of lawyers, advisers and aides, led by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, were careful not to assert that victory would be theirs after the Supreme Court heard arguments on Monday morning. In television talk show appearances today, Mr. Baker said "it absolutely is not a foregone conclusion" that Mr. Bush would prevail. 
 But should the court decide in Mr. Bush's favor, the campaign already has a plan for assuming power. After waiting for what one adviser said would be a "decent but short interval" for a concession speech by Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush would appear on national television, probably before an audience of supporters, and deliver a speech laden with talk of reunifying the country. Drafts of the text are already changing hands among top aides here, in Florida and in Washington.
"Everyone's feeling reasonably good," Gov. John Engler of Michigan, one of Mr. Bush's strongest supporters, said in a telephone interview this afternoon. "Monday is a day when we could finally have this incredible election ended."
Mr. Engler dismissed any suggestion that Mr. Bush's authority would be undercut if he took office through a judicial ruling that permanently halted the hand recount.
"People will move on," he said. "I don't think this will linger."
While some Bush staff members flew to Washington today for the Monday arguments, most stayed in Florida, just in case. "We're not turning off the coffee machine here," one of Mr. Bush's top aides said from Tallahassee, noting that the Republican nominee was keeping a large number of staff members on hand in case they needed, once again, to monitor ballot recounts in more than 50 counties.
"But I don't have much doubt about the eventual outcome," the aide said. "Now the only question is the interim outcome."
The Bush camp's fear, the aide said, was that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy or Justice Sandra Day O'Connor would defect from the conservative alliance that granted the stay on Saturday afternoon. "They're wild cards," the aide said.
From the start, Mr. Baker's preferred method of winning the presidency for Mr. Bush has been clear: a definitive ruling from the United States Supreme Court that would prevent a hand recount and with it, the risk that Mr. Gore could suddenly take the lead. That would make it unnecessary for the Florida Legislature to name an alternative slate of electors, a route to the Oval Office that Mr. Baker fears could undercut Mr. Bush's claims to legitimacy.
While some Bush advisers believe they could win a recount, it is a road Mr. Baker said again today he did not want to travel.
Tucker Eskew, a top Bush adviser, said, "We view any recounts as attempts to manufacture votes, so we take no pleasure from any kind of recount at all."
While Mr. Baker and other members of the legal team prepared for Monday's oral arguments, here in Austin aides were once again mapping out a strategy for Mr. Bush if victory came in the next few days.
Celebrations, they have determined, will be muted, nothing like the victory party that started in front of the Texas Capitol on election night. Then, within a day or two, Mr. Bush would conduct, in rapid succession, a series of announcements of top White House aides and cabinet officials.
Andrew H. Card Jr., a Bush family loyalist and former automobile industry lobbyist, would become the chief of staff; he is already operating out of a corner office of the Bush campaign headquarters here. Gen. Colin L. Powell would almost certainly be named secretary of state, and Condoleezza Rice the national security adviser. Two other important posts, defense and treasury, are undecided.
There is particular concern among some of Mr. Bush's allies in the financial world that the three names floated for the treasury post, all current or former Wall Street executives, have not generated much excitement, and some fear that none of them have the experience managing the kind of foreign economic crises that punctuated the Clinton years.
"This needs to be thought through again," said one informal economic adviser to Mr. Bush. Other aides are cautious about discussing cabinet choices before Mr. Bush has sealed an election he has often thought was about to end.
Mr. Baker, somewhat testily, spent much of the day answering queries about whether a candidate installed by a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision could assume all the moral authority a president needs. "I think all this talk about legitimacy is way overblown," Mr. Baker said on ABC's "This Week." Some Democrats acknowledged that they were raising the question of legitimacy to bolster their own argument that the only way the next president will be fully accepted by the country is to continue the recount.
Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a Republican ally of Mr. Bush's who was considered for his running mate, took strong exception to those arguments today.
"Look," Mr. Ridge said in an interview, "if it's 5-4 or more in the Supreme Court, it's over. The vice president has to take the pegs out of the tent, fold it, and go home. For a while you heard Republicans saying they wanted a unanimous decision from the court. But if Democrats can get so excited by a 4-to-3 victory in Florida, we can be just as happy with 5-4 in the Supreme Court."
"What goes around," he concluded, "comes around."

HEADLINE: For Deliveryman, Hard Work, Small Tips and Vindication

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
The sparkling glass doors of an Upper West Side high-rise open before him, courtesy of an eager top-hatted doorman, and Marcel Mweze makes his way through the gilded lobby to an elevator, where, as he has so many times before, he pushes the button for Penthouse A.
The lavish surroundings could easily have the familiar feel of home for someone like Mr. Mweze, who is fluent in three languages and has a degree in business. 
 But Mr. Mweze does not live in Penthouse A. He is there to deliver groceries from the Food Emporium, one of several grocery chains in the city that use deliverers -- many of them, like Mr. Mweze, immigrants from Africa -- to shuttle groceries around neighborhoods where people are either unable or unwilling to lug their own bags. Customers pay Food Emporium $3.95 for the service. The $3.95 goes to the store, not the delivery person.
Last week the chain agreed to pay its 110 deliverers a total of $3 million in back wages to settle a lawsuit in which it was accused of violating the federal minimum wage law. The deliverers contended that even with tips, they worked long hours, often six and seven days a week, for far below the $5.15 hourly minimum.
On Friday, the day after the settlement was announced, word has spread among other service workers Mr. Mweze usually passes on the street. On his way to the Food Emporium on Broadway and 68th Street, he is heralded as a "millionaire!" by a man selling flowers on a corner. Another man on the street asks him when he is going to quit pushing his delivery cart. Mr. Mweze just smiles.
His portion of the settlement could be as much as $30,000. "You do not really know what you are going to get," he says.
The same is true of his tips. "Sometimes you deliver 20 bags and get $2," says Mr. Mweze, 31, who came to New York five years ago. "Sometimes you deliver two bags and get $2. Sometimes they say only 'Thank you' and smile." Most deliverers are pleased when they get $1 a bag, he says.
On Friday Mr. Mweze's workday starts at 9:28 a.m. He carries four bags one block and rides the elevator at 2000 Broadway near 69th Street up 22 flights. His tip: $1.
Back at the store, there is not much demand for deliveries. Mr. Mweze is sent out again an hour later, with a total of 17 bags, for three destinations. He piles the plastic bags onto an aluminum cart, careful not to break the light bulbs, damage the eggs or bend the rolls of wrapping paper.
He looks like an odd version of Santa Claus as he leaves the store, pushing the cart through the frost. "It is not easy for an African to walk through snow," he says, laughing.
He continues west on 68th Street to No. 88 and rides to the 11th floor, where he receives $2 for dropping off two bags. So far so good.
At the next stop, though, 101 Central Park West, he encounters the deliverer's worst situation: a doorman building with a sign at the service entrance reading, "All deliveries and packages must be left on the bench." Mr. Mweze knows what this means: If there is a tip to be had for the nine bags of groceries, it will go the doorman or another building employee. He leaves empty-handed.
The last stop on this round is 145 West 67th Street. "I have something special for you for the holidays!" Kate Weller gushes when Mr. Mweze rings the door of her 36th-floor apartment. She gives him $3 for the six bags of groceries and a white envelope, whose contents Mr. Mweze will not disclose.
"He's my favorite guy," Ms. Weller says. "He works so hard and is always so polite."
At 11:18 a.m. Mr. Mweze reports to the store's dispatcher, picks up 10 bags and heads back into the snow. First stop: 155 West 68th Street, two bags to the seventh floor. On the way up, Mr. Mweze says he is thankful for elevators. He collects $2 and heads up Broadway to 70th Street, where eight bags dropped off at a penthouse apartment near Central Park West earn him $2 and a thank you.
Mr. Mweze is showing no signs of physical fatigue as he makes the return trip to Food Emporium. But the same lobbies and elevators that he sees day after day are not terribly exciting, so, he says, his thoughts often turn to that house he wants to buy someday, maybe in Minnesota, and the great job he wants to find, perhaps after he uses some of the money he will get from the legal settlement to attend classes.
Mr. Mweze studied marketing in Burundi, and planned to follow in his father's footsteps and own a business. But that dream ended about six years ago, when tribal warfare in Burundi escalated and the country's economy collapsed.
Nothing on the Upper West Side reminds Mr. Mweze of Burundi. "My feet are here, my mind is there," he says.
At 11:44 a.m., he heads out again for a relatively quick trip, delivering 14 bags to three locations over five blocks. Total tips: $8.
On his way back to the store he says: "People think that if you push a cart you must be a stupid guy. This is about how to make the living, nothing else."
Over the next two hours he delivers 28 bags to five locations and receives $9 in tips, money that will go toward paying his $280-a-month rent in the Bronx. He shares an apartment with seven other men, but his room is his own.
Much of a deliveryman's good fortune depends on serendipity. After a lunch break for chicken fingers and fries, Mr. Mweze carries a Food Emporium customer's bags just outside to the curb where a cab is waiting. The man hands him $5.
It is nearly 3:45 p.m. and the dispatcher is waiting for Mr. Mweze to deliver 16 bags to three addresses. At the first, Sophia Strong, 91 and an author, addresses Mr. Mweze as "sir" and gives him $2 for her four bags. He gets nothing from the next customer, who requested a delivery to an office in Lincoln Center, then $2 from a woman at 55 Central Park West. After walking 13 blocks back to the store, he is cold and damp.
Mr. Mweze packs four more deliveries onto his cart at 4:45 p.m. and makes $2 at each stop. It is 5:10 p.m. and officially his day could be over, but he cannot resist two final deliveries and the tips they might bring. So at 5:30 p.m. he departs yet again. This last trip takes 19 minutes, covers four blocks and earns him $7.
He is tempted to take yet another order, but fatigue has started to set in. He decides to go home and sleep. Mr. Mweze takes only Tuesdays off.
"This job, it is not a great job, but it is better now," he said heading home. "It's like life; you work your way through it."

Imagine a Day When Candor Rules Politics

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
JUST about now, we suspect, the general public is ready to sign on to a classic journalistic fantasy. Pretty tame, as fantasies go. To wit, politicians would suddenly be compelled to dispense with evasions and platitudes and tell the truth.
Maybe for a full day, like in that 1997 Jim Carrey film, "Liar Liar," about a compulsive liar who, to keep a birthday pledge to his son, had to be honest for 24 hours. 
 Think of the possibilities.
Al Gore wouldn't say he wants a recount because every vote should count. Nope, he'd say he wants a recount so he could move into the White House already.
George W. Bush wouldn't say that he opposes more vote-counting because the Florida's votes have already been counted. No, he'd say he might lose a recount.
Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running-mate, would break his silence on the subject and admit that he is thrilled he had the prescience to keep his day job as a United States senator.
James A. Baker III, the Bush post-election pointman, wouldn't denounce the Florida Supreme Court's 4-to-3 decision on Friday to count more votes as an affront to democracy. He'd say, darn the luck. If only Jeb Bush had become Florida's governor sooner, the state's top court -- now six Democrats and one independent -- would surely include at least one Republican by now.
Closer to home, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani would admit that he wants the Board of Education to be a mayoral agency not only because the current hybrid system guarantees unaccountability. But also because, with a year left as mayor, Mr. Giuliani wants to broaden his legacy. Rescuing the school system from more than 30 years of bureaucratic chaos would surely qualify.
If truth reigned, Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, would concede that her union opposes mayoral control not because it prizes educational independence, but because City Hall could cut into the union's power.
The Rev. Al Sharpton would finally admit that Tawana Brawley was not kidnapped and raped in 1987. Mr. Sharpton, who said last week that he cannot afford to pay the $65,000 he owes to a former Dutchess County assistant district attorney for defaming him in the hoax, still hasn't set the record straight.
If forced to be candid, Gov. George E. Pataki, an "observer" of Florida's short-lived vote count, wouldn't tell CNN that he is seeking "a fair election;" he'd say he wouldn't mind trading up, from Albany to Washington. Or at least guarantee warm treatment from a Bush administration.
Maybe Andrew M. Cuomo would even admit -- if consigned to a moment of truth -- that he's lavished taxpayer dollars on self-promotion to help his likely race for governor of New York. Mr. Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, just sent out 30,000 glossy, full-color copies of "Vision for Change," a 150-page report, complete with a narrated CD-Rom.
THE report glowingly assesses HUD, of course. Nary a mention of how speculators and non-profit groups allegedly defrauded a federally insured mortgage program right under HUD's nose, worsening the blight in poor neighborhoods and creating the false, damaging impression that Harlem was going through a real estate boom. The program is under investigation, with HUD's full cooperation.
"You can't say everything in every report," Mr. Cuomo said. "This was an overall story of management reform." That explains it. Management reform. That's why the report includes 19 photographs of Mr. Cuomo -- at Yad Vashem in Israel and on tour in China; with such luminaries as the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson; Mr. Gore; former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres; South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki; Martin Luther King III; Gov. Gray Davis of California; Bob Vila; Sarah Jessica Parker; and Kweisi Mfume, president of the N.A.A.C.P. Good management for sure, though perhaps not of housing.
Just a standard report, says Mr. Cuomo, and economical because the department used to publish 12 reports for $750,000, and this report consolidated them, for $421,000 (including the CD-Rom).
"If it saves money, fine, but it needs not to be a promotional piece, so obviously political," said Rep. Robert W. Ney, Republican of Ohio and vice chairman of the House subcommittee on housing and community opportunity.
Counters Mr. Cuomo: "This is a strategy of harassment, of Congressional harassment of the executive."
Maybe it is a vast Congressional conspiracy?
Would make a good film. Wonder if Jim Carrey is available.

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE REACTION;
Justices Are Final Arbiters Of Vote, Lawmakers Say

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Prominent Congressional Democrats and some Republicans said today that the United States Supreme Court should be the last word in the divisive, monthlong standoff over the contested presidency.
But Senator Trent Lott, the highest-ranking Senate Republican, did not discourage the Florida Legislature from acting on behalf of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, should the nation's highest court unexpectedly find in favor of Vice President Al Gore in his quest for recounts. 
 As House and Senate members spoke a day before the Supreme Court was to hear arguments on whether to allow manual recounts to resume in Florida, they began to look beyond the contested election to how to govern. The lawmakers said they were keenly aware of the difficulties of making government work with a split Congress and a president who, no matter who prevails, would probably face lingering questions about his legitimacy.
"If this is concluded in the next 48 hours, the person who is on the losing side of this should go and meet with the winner," said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, on "Fox News Sunday." He added: "They should make an appearance together. There should be an immediate call for national unity and for accepting the results of this election, getting about the country's business."
A day after Democrats criticized the United States Supreme Court for its 5-to-4 vote Saturday to stop the recount that had begun just hours earlier in Florida, party leaders sought to moderate any anticourt tones.
On Saturday, some angry Democrats had said the Supreme Court had diminished its credibility. But today, Democratic leaders said they would rally around any court decision, and they sought to contrast themselves with Republicans who have used phrases like "judicial aggression" and "unelected judges" while objecting to rulings in favor of Mr. Gore by the Florida Supreme Court.
"We have a court system," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader. "We have a rule of law in this country. And I have said from the beginning we have got to stick with it."
Asked whether Mr. Gore should concede if the court found in favor of Mr. Bush's effort to stop the recount, Mr. Gephardt said on ABC's "This Week," "I believe he will, and I think George Bush would do the same thing if it were the other way around."
Mr. Torricelli also said of the expected Supreme Court ruling: "I believe that probably is the last word, and it's the last chance to have this issue not go to the United States Congress. I think it would be very regrettable if the fight in Florida became a fight in Washington."
Under the Constitution, Congress can approve or reject the members of the Electoral College. If Florida's electors were in dispute, Congress might face a bruising fight.
But in his appearance on CBS's "Face the Nation," Mr. Lott, the Senate majority leader, declined to call for the Florida Legislature to hold off on naming Bush electors should the United States Supreme Court unexpectedly support Mr. Gore's drive for a recount.
"I am sure that they would prefer not to have to step in," he said of the Florida lawmakers, "but they do have a role to play, and I think they are prepared to do that."
Asked whether he would support such a step, Mr. Lott, of Mississippi, said, "Well, I wouldn't oppose it." He added that it was not his first choice.
"I don't want that to happen," he said. "We have an important agenda for the American people we have to tend to. And every day that this is delayed is making that a little more difficult."
But Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said the Supreme Court "should be the final word."
"I think everybody in America would respect that," he said.
After a month of uncertainty over who would be president, lawmakers started to weigh how the president would be able to govern after the bitter election. And despite the oft-stated recognition that Congress needs to close ranks behind whomever is elected, the partisan divisions stood out in stark relief.
While some Republicans have said that if elected, Mr. Bush should shy away from pursuing his proposed $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut, saying it is too polarizing, Mr. Lott said he thought Mr. Bush should seek large tax-rate reductions to keep the economy growing.
But Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader, said today, "I don't think that's possible."
Senator Daschle, of South Dakota, said on CBS that a drive by a Bush administration for the full tax cut would send a signal that the calls for bipartisanship were not serious.
Mr. Daschle said Democrats would support some tax cuts, but added: "I don't think we would ever go to the magnitude that George Bush has proposed. It would destroy the fiscal opportunities we have to retire the debt in the not-to-distant future."
Asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" if he could work with Mr. Gore should the vice president be elected president, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, put the onus on Mr. Gore.
"That would depend on President Gore," he said. "He would have to rise above the history of being partisan and he would have to extend the invitation of let's work together and get this to work."

HEADLINE: Long Island Bishop, James McHugh, Dies at 68

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Less than a year after becoming the spiritual leader of Long Island's 1.4 million Roman Catholics, Bishop James Thomas McHugh, an anti-abortion leader, died yesterday. He was 68.
Bishop McHugh, the head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, died of liver and gallbladder cancer, said Joanne C. Novarro, a spokeswoman for the diocese. 
 His illness was diagnosed a few months after he became the designated successor to Bishop John R. McGann in February 1999. But when he was installed in January, his doctors said the cancer was in remission.
Born in Orange, N.J., on Jan. 3, 1932, Bishop McHugh spent most of his school and working life in New Jersey, attending the Immaculate Conception Seminary in Darlington. He was ordained in 1957 and became a priest with the Archdiocese of Newark. Before moving to the Long Island diocese, he had been the bishop of Camden for 10 years.
He was an expert on issues involving human life, including abortion, the death penalty and euthanasia. In 1965, he became the director of the family life bureau of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
In 1971, Father McHugh was appointed papal chamberlain by Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II made him a prelate of honor in 1986.
In 1972, Father McHugh became the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' first director of pro-life activities, said Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the conference.
Bishops in the United States looked to Bishop McHugh and a handful of other prelates to articulate the church's position on human life issues, Monsignor Maniscalco said.
Bishop McHugh also specialized in demography and population matters, traveling to three United Nations conferences on population and three international conferences on women with the Vatican's delegation.
Part of his job was to help rebut what the Roman Catholic Church sees as exaggerated projections of world population growth, Monsignor Maniscalco said, and to encourage policies of economic development rather than population control.
"He was a tenacious defender of innocent human life," said John Carr, the director of social development and world peace for the bishops conference. "Part of it was loyalty to the church's teachings, and part of it was his conviction that this was the moral measure of our society."
After leaving the conference, Monsignor McHugh went to graduate school in Rome, where he earned a graduate degree in moral theology in 1981.
In 1987, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark, and was ordained a bishop in 1988. The following year, he became the bishop of Camden, where he focused on encouraging Catholic education and on drawing men to the priesthood, said Monsignor Maniscalco.
Although some of his time in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties, was consumed by his battle against cancer, he did complete negotiations with the teachers of the diocese's two Catholic high schools, ensuring that the teachers' contracts contained a clause saying that the teacher supported the Catholic faith and teachings, Mrs. Novarro said.
Bishop McHugh is survived by his mother, Caroline Scavone McHugh, and a sister, Sharon Foster.
Mrs. Novarro said that the Vatican had not yet chosen a successor for Bishop McHugh, and that a group of priests in the diocese would choose an administrator in the interim.
Bishop McHugh was with Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, in the last few hours before the cardinal's death in May. And yesterday, Archbishop Edward M. Egan of New York said he and Bishop McHugh had been friends since the 1960's.
"During these months of illness, he continued to preach the sanctity of life," Archbishop Egan said. "Only now he added his own example of the beauty of life, even when it is attended by sickness and suffering."

Phillips and Mets Avoid Off-Season Shutout by Adding Appier to the Starting Rotation

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Mike Hampton no. Mike Mussina -- no. Denny Neagle -- no. Kevin Appier -- yes.
Yes, this off-season will not be a complete washout for the Mets. Steve Phillips, their general manager, recently promised that the Mets would open next season with a full pitching staff, and today he learned that he had filled one of the openings in the starting rotation today with Appier. 
 After pursuing but failing to catch Hampton, Mussina and Neagle, Phillips snared Appier, a 33-year-old right-hander. The Mets made no announcement of the four-year deal because minor issues remained to be worked out, said a person familiar with the negotiations. But the person said the deal was expected to be completed in time for an announcement Monday.
Early in the day at the winter meetings, Dan Horwits, Appier's agent, said, "It's pretty much down to Baltimore and the Mets." He also said he had a 4:30 p.m. meeting scheduled with the Orioles.
However, he canceled the meeting after Appier made it a one-team race. "Kevin decided he wanted to play in New York and go to the World Series fast," Horwits told the Mets.
The Mets will pay Appier about $42 million, more than they would have preferred to spend on a second-tier starter but far less than has been committed to Hampton (Colorado), Mussina (Yankees) and Neagle (Colorado). Those pitchers will earn a combined $265 million, more than Alex Rodriguez is expected to get in his new contract, presumably with the Atlanta Braves or the Texas Rangers.
A year ago, second-tier starters were not being so enriched. A contract at $7 million a year was more common.
Asked why the price had soared, Phillips mentioned supply and demand, as well as timing, and added: "There weren't the rabbits out in front like there were this year with Mussina and Hampton that took the pace out there and left a lot of space in between. There's been, for whatever reason, some sort of drafting effect that's pulling teams along to chase the rabbits."
Appier, like Neagle, became a beneficiary of that development.
Pitching for Oakland last season, Appier had a 15-11 record and a 4.52 earned run average. He was the starting and losing pitcher in Game 2 of the American League division series against the Yankees. His victory total marked the fifth time in his career that he gained at least 15 victories -- his high was 18 in 1993 -- but the first since 1995. He missed nearly the entire 1998 season after a shoulder operation that March.
Just as they did in re-signing three of their own free-agent pitchers -- Rick Reed, John Franco and Turk Wendell -- the Mets came from behind in getting Appier. With the other three, the Mets began their negotiations with relatively low offers but raised them as market forces dictated.
Horwits said Saturday afternoon that the Mets were "economically a little bit behind other clubs" on Appier, but they increased their offer Saturday night.
Talk at the winter meetings had two starters possibly changing teams in trades -- Jose Lima of Houston to Detroit and Pedro Astacio of Colorado to Toronto. David Wells, the Blue Jays' 20-game winner, is a pitcher the Mets have discussed and would certainly qualify as a trade acquisition who would pitch in the rotation ahead of Reed. Phillips also called David Cone's agent, Steve Fehr, but his degree of interest could not be gauged.
"We're making some progress," Phillips said. "I'm still working on a number of things, primarily pitching, but we're considering some other things as well."
He was not, he reiterated for the third time in three days of the winter meetings, considering Rodriguez.
Why, Phillips was asked, would he not consider getting back into the Rodriguez race, considering that the superstar shortstop said he did not need the perks that Phillips said prompted the Mets to pull out of the running?
"I understand that; it doesn't change anything," said Phillips, who had said that Scott Boras, Rodriguez's agent, had talked about a marketing staff and an office for the player, a tent in spring training to sell his merchandise and a plane to fly him or his staff. Boras denied Phillips's characterization of their meeting last week, but also accused the general manager of violating the trust of a private meeting.
"The way it was explained to me," Phillips said, maintaining his stance, "was those things, that structure that was necessary to manage him, is necessary to manage him. He's been managed for the last couple of years. The structure they have in place with the office and staff is necessary to handle his life off the field and on the field and allow him to be able to perform.
"For the last two years he has functioned as a managed athlete. Because he's evolved into an international icon and earning $15-20 million off the field, those other demands take a lot of attention, and without that structure he wouldn't be able to succeed."
Such a structure, Phillips added, did not fit the Mets.
"They certainly have left the door open for us to consider it because I think it would be in their interest to do that," he said.
Did he sense that Boras would like to get the Mets back in? "I'm sure he would," Phillips said "There are a lot of reasons why it would benefit their process, including having the specter of a New York team being in a negotiation with other teams."
"I'm not going to be used," he said. And if the Braves, their division nemesis, should sign Rodriguez?
"We fully considered that as a possibility," Phillips said, "and decided if that's what they choose to do, everybody has to make their own decision about what's good for the organization."

Scholarly Regulator Guides Antitrust Law Into New Age

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ROBERT PITOFSKY is amused at the thought that the same law that spawned the Federal Trade Commission early in the last century also gives that agency the authority to regulate the Internet.
"The agency started in 1914," Mr. Pitofsky explains with a glint of historical pride, an understandable expression considering that he has been at the commission in one top position or another for more than 10 of the last 30 years. "In 1912, the Supreme Court decided to break up Standard Oil in an opinion to this day that hardly anyone understands. Business thought it gave too much to the courts. The Legislature thought it was too soft on business. 
 "President Wilson," he continued, "acting on the advice of Louis D. Brandeis, decided that there should be an agency that enforced antitrust but also worked with industry to anticipate economic trends. This became the second independent agency. The first was the Interstate Commerce Commission, which set rates and decided who could have licenses and get in and out of certain businesses. We were different. We never set rates."
During those years, Mr. Pitofsky said, antitrust was such a popular and populist issue that it was actually an important aspect of presidential campaigns. Now, it is largely unnoticed by the masses, a dreary discipline that, although central to the well-being of a competitive marketplace, is largely executed by technocrats.
"With rare exceptions, like Microsoft and the Time Warner-AOL deal, the public is not engaged in antitrust issues," he said.
Antitrust issues may once again come to the fore, as Mr. Pitofsky and his fellow commissioners prepare to decide whether to approve or block the largest merger in American history -- the proposed marriage of America Online, the world's largest Internet company, to Time Warner, one of the world's largest providers of entertainment and news. The difficult legal issues make the deal perhaps the most challenging Mr. Pitofsky has considered.
But on a recent gray afternoon, Mr. Pitofsky was more interested in talking about the history of the agency and the legacy of his tenure. His term expires next summer, although if Vice President Al Gore were to take office as president, everyone expects that Mr. Pitofsky, who enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress, would be invited to serve another term.
A leading antitrust scholar and a former dean of the Georgetown University Law Center, Mr. Pitofsky has brought a decidedly academic approach to his role as a regulator. Hardly ideological, he has taken a keen interest in the development of antitrust case law, and as an academic he has had a rare opportunity to shape the area of his scholarly pursuits.
"Antitrust has swung left, right and center," he said. "We went from being the most vigorous of countries in enforcement in the 60's to one of the least aggressive in the 80's. My goal was to find a middle between the extremes."
While Mr. Pitofsky is less known than Joel Klein, his recently retired counterpart at the Justice Department who prosecuted Microsoft, in the corporate world he is no less feared. And among consumer groups he is widely respected for pursuing tough cases and standing up to powerful corporate interests.
Mr. Pitofsky, who turns 71 in two weeks, cut his antitrust teeth as a junior lawyer defending a drug company in a major criminal case against polio vaccine makers. The senior lawyer on the case was former Gov. Thomas D. Dewey of New York. Born and raised in Paterson, N.J., Mr. Pitofsky was the first in his family to attend college; his father worked in a silk mill.
He first joined the trade commission in the Nixon administration as its top antitrust official, returned in the Carter years as a commissioner, and was appointed chairman by President Clinton in 1995.
Mr. Pitofsky has been a central player in the transformation of the agency from what was known as the "little old lady of Pennsylvania Avenue," a dumping ground for defeated lawmakers, to a formidable institution that is the leading regulatory body of Internet and consumer issues, as well as one of Washington's two antitrust enforcers.
"It was very much a junior partner to the Department of Justice," he recalled. "The typical remedy then was to sign what was called an 'assurance of voluntary discontinuance.' It wasn't worth the paper it was written on. It had no force of law. And there was no redress for consumers."
NOW adorning Mr. Pitofsky's office are trophies of past triumphs, including a box of Doan's pills recalling a successful deceptive marketing case and a bottle of McCormick's Beijing Rub from "the one price discrimination case we brought in my six years as chairman."
For all of the successes of the agency, he says he regrets that it has been unable to do more.
"I'm concerned that we've spent so much time in antitrust on this merger wave that we've neglected other cases," he said. "I know there were other things we should have addressed. But the merger wave has been so important to the economy and the deadlines are so tight that we had little choice. There were cases that were pushed aside because we simply didn't have the budget to work on them."
Perhaps it is a testament to his respect on Capitol Hill, and especially among Republicans, that Mr. Pitofsky, a Democratic head of an agency not widely admired by corporate America, is likely to get a 15 percent increase in his budget this year, the largest in many years.

HEADLINE: Higher Pay Found to Erode Law Firms' Profit Growth

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The sizable increases in salaries paid to lawyers this year are already beginning to slow the growth of law firms' profits, according to a recent survey that could be an early sign of coming trouble.
Expenses at 16 law firms, seven of them bellwether New York firms employing more than 300 lawyers, have risen 24 percent in the first six months of the year compared with figures in the period a year earlier, according to the survey, conducted by Citibank Private Bank. 
 With record revenue growth -- on average, 18 percent in the first half of the year, compared with 15 percent for the largest firms in all of 1999 -- this probably means profits will merely narrow at some of the city's largest firms, but for smaller or less busy firms, higher costs may foretell difficult economic decisions about how many lawyers to hire, how many to make partners and even how many to dismiss, lawyers say.
The reason for the increase in costs is simple. The single largest expense for law firms is the salaries of lawyers who are not partners, and this year wages of associates have risen by one-third or more if hefty year-end bonuses of as much as $40,000 for first-year lawyers -- more for more senior lawyers -- are included.
The salaries of associates rose sharply this year as firms sought to stem the loss of lawyers to more lucrative careers. The wave of raises began in California, particularly Silicon Valley, and then moved east as New York firms sought to match them.
The Citibank survey, which is conducted annually, is preliminary and includes only a fraction of the 280 firms whose financial results are summarized in the bank's 1999 report. But it is the first sign that for some firms, at least, the recent raises may spell trouble.
There was nowhere to go but down, partners at large firms said. "One would have been shocked" if costs did not start to rise more quickly than revenue, said Robert C. Sheehan, executive partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. "Given the percentage increase in the salaries at the beginning of the year -- they went from roughly $100,000 to $125,000 for first-years -- it would not at all be a surprise."
The sample of 16 firms reflects broader trends because it includes firms that charge premium rates and firms that do not, capturing firms with high and low profit margins, said Danilo DiPietro, a vice president at the Citibank Private Bank who coordinates the survey.
If anything, the situation is likely to begin to worsen more rapidly than the survey suggests, at least for small and medium-size firms, Mr. DiPietro said, because smaller firms -- which are less well represented in the Citibank survey -- have experienced slower revenue growth and are thus less able to absorb higher costs.
Judging from the 1999 survey, smaller firms have experienced revenue growth in the 10 percent to 12 percent range, rather than the 18 percent at larger firms. Their costs, however, have closely tracked those of larger firms because all are competing for the same scarce commodity: good lawyers.
"The firms that are competing for the same type of business as the upper tier generally have matched" big-firm associate salaries, Mr. DiPietro said.
Law firms have been driven to increase wages to recruit and retain graduates from top law schools, who now have more options than ever, lawyers say.
"Everyone is looking for those talented people," and there is only a finite number of such law school graduates to hire, said Evan Davis, president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and a partner at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton. "The law of supply and demand is driving these salary increases," he added.
And reducing salaries or cutting back on bonuses is not an option, at least for now, given the still-hot market for lawyers. Top-tier firms do not want to lose the critical, talented people they need to keep billing clients hundreds of dollars an hour for legal services. Nor do they want to risk having a shortage of experienced lawyers in a few years, as a result of hiring fewer law graduates now.
"We can't get all the people we need, even at these salaries," said Benjamin F. Stapleton III, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. "We're trying to be competitive without being foolhardy."

HEADLINE: After Violence, Possibilities Of Renewal;
As Conflict Recedes in Northern Ireland, Economy Tries to Wean Itself From Britain

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland

 BODY:
When people talk about a peace dividend in Northern Ireland, Roger Johnston is part of the new world they have in mind.
Remote from the familiar images of hooded gunmen, defiant marchers and the bloody debris of bombings, Mr. Johnston, 36, a father of two, commutes between his 5,000-square-foot home in a late-model silver BMW (with baby seat in the back). He works in a new business park on the city's raw outskirts as European representative of Avalanche Technology -- a software start-up based in Denver that became the latest high-technology company to open an operation here. It was drawn, in part, by British government grants intended to switch the economy from old to new. 
 To complete the picture, Mr. Johnston is one of the province's prodigals -- the migrant sons and daughters who, unlike those in the Irish Republic, still outnumber the stay-at-homes. He left Northern Ireland in 1984 to work in London and Chicago after earning a degree in business administration at Queen's University here. Now, he has been drawn back by what he calls quality of life considerations and a sense that economic renewal is now possible for the first time in decades.
"We aren't really confident yet," Mr. Johnston said. "But we are a lot more confident than we were 10 years ago. We are prepared to say that we can compete on a global basis."
Of course, the politics has had a bumpy ride since the so-called Good Friday peace agreement was signed under American tutelage in 1998. But when President Clinton comes here for a swansong visit intended to re-energize the faltering accord, Belfast start-ups like Avalanche will be one of the proofs offered by local worthies that this torn and still bloody province is on the cusp of a resurgence comparable to that of the Irish Republic, the so-called Celtic Tiger economy, just to the south.
"We are in the endgame of whether we are going to pull this off or not," said Sir Reg Empey, the minister of enterprise, trade and investment. "But we don't believe the problems are insoluble. What I can say is that if you look back at the position 10 years ago, it's totally transformed."
There are other changes, too. When Mr. Clinton paid his first visit as president in late 1995 one year after a ceasefire, he used the backdrop of McErleans Bakery on the staunchly Roman Catholic Falls Road for a groundbreaking public encounter with Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army. Even the bakery has changed in a way that gladdens those seeking to coax entrepreneurship from a region still dependent on handouts from London.
In the president's honor, the bakery's new owner, Kerry O'Connor, has renamed her establishment Clinton's Hot Food Sandwich Bar and Bistro, serving quarter-pounders, fries and scones. "In the past people didn't start up because they were afraid they couldn't make money," said Ms. O'Connor, 31, a former waitress who took a $20,000 bank loan to take over the establishment five months ago and spruce up its interior with bright mauve and yellow decor, bedecked with Irish and American flags.
"There are better opportunities now," she said. "More people have got jobs. They spend more. And I think everybody has put the troubles behind them."
In a telling counterpoint, on the troubled mainly Protestant Shankill Road where rival paramilitary groups run fiefs that compete for the spoils of conflict, another woman running a small business lowered her voice to a nervous whisper and declined to be identified by name when asked to talk about how business was going. "There's no peace dividend here," she said.
Indeed, said Sir George Quigley, the chairman of Ulster Bank, the province's second largest, until the peace has proved its durability, "you are going to get some potential investors who say that until it's all hammered down, we are not going to take a decision" on risking money here.
Much of what Northern Ireland puts on display is eerily reminiscent of the successes of the Irish Republic: low wages, a high proportion of young, skilled people and corporate incentives. Unemployment now is at a low of 6.1 percent compared with its peak of 16.8 percent in 1986. That is higher than in the rest of Britain or in Ireland, but lower than European averages and no longer makes the region the sickly laggard among Britain's most depressed areas. The province's growth, indeed, local dignitaries say, is the fastest within Britain, while foreign investment has boomed to record highs, 80 percent of it in high-technology industries.
In the 1990's, the provincial economy created 90,000 new jobs. And since a ceasefire in 1994, foreign investment has totaled $3.2 billion, rising and falling in step with the fortunes of peace efforts. Along the Belfast waterfront, glittery new prestige buildings -- a theater and a leisure center, hotels and offices -- reflect a surge in property development. House prices in Belfast were up 25 percent in 1999, the authorities said.
But, of course, that is not the whole story. Economic growth has been handicapped by almost three decades of conflict that have cost more than 3,000 lives. With one-time mainstays like shipbuilding, textiles and farming in decline, the province is heavily dependent on handouts from London. More than one-third of the available jobs are in the government bureaucracy. A staggering 55 percent to 60 percent of the provincial economy is derived from taxpayers' money and Northern Ireland remains poor in comparison with Scotland or Wales, with less than 80 percent of Britain's average per capita wealth.
And, while the figure is half what it once was, it still costs the public purse about $13,500 to create one new job.
"You would expect to see a lot of money sloshing around, creating fairly buoyant consumer demand," said Prof. John Bradley, an economist with the independent Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin. "But as an outsider I wouldn't mistake that for anything but funding from outside."
Outsiders, too, tend to be more skeptical than insiders about the whole idea of a peace dividend. "The notion is getting a bit thin," Professor Bradley said. "The first thing you have to adjust for in Northern Ireland is that this is a psychologically battered region, and they definitely want to be pointing at something that's going well."
While Northern Ireland seeks to emulate the boom in the Irish Republic, it finds itself disadvantaged by one element in its neighbor's success -- Europe's single currency. Ireland is a member of the euro zone while Northern Ireland, as part of Britain, is a holdout. Yet, the two places share a porous frontier that enables northerners armed with strong British pounds to head south to hunt for bargains. And exports from Northern Ireland to the rest of Europe bear the burden of the strong British pound.
The difference in the gasoline price alone makes a huge impact, Sir Reg, the enterprise minister, said. By driving 40 miles, motorists can buy gas at the equivalent of $2.64 a United States gallon, compared with $4.23 in Northern Ireland, where British gasoline taxes are among Europe's highest. Gasoline smuggling costs the province $140 million to $280 million, he said.
"The euro is devastating a whole range of Northern Ireland industry," Professor Bradley said. "They have a huge exposure to the southern market, but they can't compete" against an exchange rate that makes the British pound so expensive compared with the Irish punt.
So why invest here when, just down the road, a cheap currency, long-term corporate tax breaks and membership in the euro zone might seem to offer a better launching pad for Continental Europe?
Part of the answer lies in Ireland's own success. So popular has Dublin become for foreign investors that prices are rising and trained people are in shorter supply than in the north. The most compelling reason to focus on Northern Ireland is the ready availability of skilled people, said Alan Gillespie, a former investment banker with Goldman, Sachs who heads the northern Industrial Development Board, a government agency that promotes investment. "The Republic of Ireland is experiencing considerable congestion and high labor costs," he said. "Northern Ireland has a cost structure that's quite attractive."
Not to mention free money.
When Avalanche Technology, for instance, began its Northern Ireland operation as the first link in a global chain of software outsourcing businesses, three-quarters of its modest start-up capital of roughly $5.6 million came from a British venture capital firm, 3i, and the rest from government funds. Subject to the company's success in profitability and job creation, the total is set to increase to $32 million, roughly $5 million of it from the authorities. On average, the Industrial Development Board said, its contribution to new investments is 20 percent.
Avalanche said it would create 480 jobs by 2005. Some two and a half years after the province's politicians signed a historic peace accord, Mr. Johnston says he has just hired his first 50 software engineers, both Protestants and Catholics, and found no difficulty at all in dipping into a pool of trained talent.
Both donor and recipient prefer to minimize the role played by grants. "I would play down the financial incentives," said Fred Crowe, the chief executive of Avalanche, in a telephone interview from Denver. "It wasn't the ultimate decision-maker" in his choice to put the new company's first European operation in Northern Ireland.
Ultimately, Mr. Crowe said, it was due more to other factors like the availability of people, broadband telecommunications links, finding a gateway to Europe and anticipating being able to attract many people back to Ireland. And it did not hurt that Mr. Crowe is himself a native of Northern Ireland.
Salaries, too, make a big difference. According to Mr. Johnston, software engineers in Northern Ireland may be hired for the equivalent of about $25,000 a year, compared with starting levels of $35,000 in Britain. And, while Northern Ireland, like the Irish Republic, once suffered from its isolation, the advent of a wired, global economy has reduced its sense of remoteness.
"Northern Ireland is not just coming out of a political and civil shadow," Dr. Gillespie said, "but the emergence of a globalized economy means that geography is no longer a disadvantage."
And others are crossing their fingers that the economic advances will prevent the political process from sliding back into conflict.
"There's a buzz about the whole situation," said Sir George of Ulster Bank. "People are saying: 'Why do we want to lose all that?' It would be absolutely crazy."

HEADLINE: Burmese Junta May Be Ready To Release Top Opponent

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
The military dictatorship in Myanmar signaled yesterday that it might soon release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the country's democratic opposition and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize who has been under house arrest since September.
The junta that rules Myanmar, formerly Burma, has been bombarded in recent weeks by criticism from the United Nations, human rights groups and Thailand. It has been accused of torturing political opponents, using forced labor and condoning an illegal drug industry that is spreading addiction across Southeast Asia. 
 Amnesty International will release a report today that charges the Burmese government with using torture as an "institution" of state repression. The report says torture is used routinely "as a means of instilling fear in anyone critical of the military government."
In what may be an attempt to defang these critics, Burmese officials attending a meeting in Vientiane, Laos, told European Union officials that they would allow a four-member European delegation to visit Myanmar next month.
Its members would be free to talk to opposition leaders, including Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is likely to be released from house arrest before the visit, said Charles Josselin, a French official who attended the meeting.
Early this month, the government released six other prominent opposition leaders. They were detained, along with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, when she tried to travel outside Yangon, the capital, on Sept. 21 to meet with other members of her party. The government has all but banned the party, the National League for Democracy, in recent months, locking up nearly all of its leaders in the capital and around the country.
President Clinton last week awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest American civilian honor, to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi.
Since her party won the national election held in 1990, which the generals in power ignored, she has spent most of the last decade confined to her house in Yangon, formerly Rangoon.
At the meeting in Laos, Foreign Minister Win Aung of Myanmar reportedly did not mention Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi by name. But he led European Union officials attending a meeting with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to believe that she and two other opposition leaders would be released soon, Mr. Josselin told reporters.
"It's hard to imagine that a lifting of the restrictions would not happen before the visit," Mr. Josselin said.
The government of Myanmar has been singled out in the last month for an exceptionally scathing round of condemnation from the United Nations General Assembly, international trade unions, human rights groups and military leaders in Thailand.
The General Assembly last week accused the government of condoning the use of rape, torture, mass arrests, forced labor and summary executions to suppress dissent.
The International Labor Organization, an agency associated with the United Nations, recommended that member nations consider sanctions against Myanmar for its continued use of forced labor. In support, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, with members in 148 countries, announced that it would demand the withdrawal of foreign investors who aided or abetted forced labor in the country.
The chief of Thailand's armed forces said he planned to use a visit to Myanmar this week to warn the government that the widespread production of heroin and amphetamines there was a threat to regional stability, as well as a cause of drug addiction in Southeast Asia.
Of all the criticism in recent weeks, the most detailed is Amnesty International's report, "Myanmar: The Institution of Torture." It says political prisoners, believed to number about 1,700, are routinely tortured.
Drawing on interviews with former political prisoners who escaped from Myanmar this year, Ms. Guest said Amnesty had established that the junta consistently used the same torture techniques during interrogations. They include near-suffocation, electric shocks to various parts of the body and the "iron road," a technique that involves rolling an iron bar up and down the shins of a prisoner until the skin peels off.
"At least 43 political prisoners have died in custody since the military's violent suppression of the democracy movement in 1988, although the true number is believed to be much higher," the report said.
The International Committee of the Red Cross last year was granted access to Myanmar's prison system. Conditions have reportedly improved since then. But the Amnesty report said Red Cross officials still did not have access to detention centers, where torture during interrogation most commonly took place.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Leads Nasdaq Rally as Blue Chips Edge Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Led by technology shares, the stock market rose modestly yesterday as investors awaited a decision by the United States Supreme Court that could determine the outcome of the presidential election.
Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each presented arguments to the Supreme Court over whether a manual recount of ballots in Florida should resume, and investors were seeking signs of how the court might ultimately rule. An audio tape of the 90 minutes of arguments was released early yesterday afternoon. 
 Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, said some investors might be encouraged by a better sense of certainty while others, like himself, were not willing to bet on an outcome.
"We've learned it over and over again that we are not good at forecasting the political process," he said, referring to the unexpected twists and turns of the battle to count the votes in Florida.
"I listened to parts of the debate before the Supreme Court, and it looked like it could go either way," he said.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index gained 97.67 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,015.10, its first move above 3,000 in three weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.31 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,380.20. And the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 12.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,725.80.
Among the stocks leading the market higher were Cisco Systems, up $2.44, to $54.81; Microsoft, up $3.63, to $58.06; and Intel, up $3.44, to $37.44. J. P. Morgan, which is being acquired by Chase Manhattan, surged $9.75, to $156.75, and accounted for most of the rise in the Dow. Other bank and financial stocks, which had fallen sharply recently because of concerns about the slowing economy, also rallied.
Among the declining stocks was Wal-Mart Stores, which fell along with other retailers as investors worried about sales being weaker than expected during the holiday season. Wal-Mart was down $3.06, to $51.38.
Coca-Cola fell $2.63, to $58.31, after its president, Jack Stahl, reiterated the company's 6 percent to 7 percent sales growth target for 2001, according to Bloomberg News.
Mr. Stahl also said Coca-Cola would broaden its offerings of juice drinks and teas but "do it on our own." He said Coca-Cola had declined to buy Quaker Oats for its Snapple brand because it was too expensive. The company's chief rival, PepsiCo, is buying Quaker Oats.
These declines, plus that of Exxon Mobil, erased most of the gain in the Dow from the J. P. Morgan surge, leaving that index up just marginally for the day.
Mr. Johnson said many investors were still eager to buy stocks, especially in the technology sector, that had fallen sharply since September. But he also said the recent rally in the stock market, in which the Nasdaq jumped 10.3 percent last week, was already making stocks look a little less attractive given the slowing pace of economic and earnings growth.
On Friday, Mr. Gore won a significant victory when the Florida Supreme Court ruled 4 to 3 that thousands of disputed ballots should be counted by hand. If that decision stood, Mr. Gore could win Florida and the election.
The immediate investor reaction to the new uncertainty that the decision brought to the presidential race was negative. In trading after the decision was announced just after 4 p.m., the futures contract on the S.& P. 500 index plunged 3.4 percent, or 47 points.
But on Saturday, the United States Supreme Court stopped the counting on a 5-to-4 vote and seemed to indicate that it would rule in favor of Mr. Bush, a decision that in all likelihood would finally give him Florida's 25 electoral votes and the presidency. That apparently helped the market rally early yesterday, as the S.& P. 500 made up its Friday after-hours loss and then some.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices fell as investors questioned whether an expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve justified the magnitude of the recent run-up in bond and note prices.
Government debt lost ground because "the market is way ahead of itself" in pricing in an interest rate cut by the Fed, said Mark MacQueen, who is considering adding higher-yielding corporate debt rated AA or better to the $1 billion he manages at Sage Advisory Services in Austin, Tex.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 102 30/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.36 percent from 5.30 percent on Friday.
The 30-year bond fell 15/32, to 110 9/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.54 percent from 5.51 percent on Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: October Wholesale Inventories Rose 0.3%, While Sales Stalled

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Inventories at the nation's wholesalers rose less than expected in October and sales stalled, government figures showed today, pointing to a cooling economy in the final three months of 2000.
Stockpiles at warehouses and distributorships increased 0.3 percent in October, to $327.4 billion, after being unchanged in September, the Commerce Department reported. 
 Sales were unchanged after increasing 0.5 percent, to $251.1 billion, the month before.
"We are going through a period of adjustment, a transition to slower growth," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Combined factory, retail and wholesale inventory gains had already slowed in the July-September quarter from the second three months of the year. Six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve between June 1999 and May this year have raised the cost of borrowing, especially for automobiles, furniture and other durable goods. Lower stock prices have eroded consumer confidence.
Wholesalers are avoiding excess stockpiles, which can pose problems if the economy continues to slow. The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures the time goods sit unsold, was unchanged in October at 1.3 months, near the recent low of 1.29 months in June.
Analysts had expected a 0.4 percent increase in inventories after a previously reported gain of 0.2 percent in September. Sales were expected to rise 0.4 percent after being reported up 0.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Peace in the Horn of Africa

 BODY:
A disputed border, nationalistic fervor, reckless personal honor and diplomatic miscalculation have all contributed to the fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and have produced one of the world's bloodiest conventional wars in recent years. Horrific trench combat reminiscent of World War I has claimed the lives of between 75,000 and 100,000 conscripts. The two countries, among the poorest on earth, have squandered more than $1 billion on arms, enriching profiteers from Russia and Bulgaria to China and North Korea while impoverishing their own people.
The American-brokered peace treaty to be signed in Algeria this week is therefore a profoundly positive development. It should bring a formal end to fighting that was suspended by a cease-fire in June, after a final Ethiopian offensive that killed many troops on both sides and displaced hundreds of thousands of Eritreans from their homes. The treaty also establishes a peaceful mechanism for the demarcation of their disputed 620-mile border, an exchange of prisoners and the release of civilian detainees. 
 The United Nations has begun deploying a modest, 4,200-member peacekeeping and military observer mission, to which the United States is contributing $60 million but no troops. The exhausted people of these two countries may now renew the urgent task of development that they began with so much promise a decade ago after 30 years of armed struggle against the successive tyrannies of Emperor Haile Selassie and Mengistu Haile Mariam.
This belated conclusion to the hostilities is cause for relief, but not self-congratulation, on both sides. With so many lives lost and so much treasure wasted, there remains the question of accountability for a war that should never have happened. The leaders of the two countries, Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, arrogantly clung to their own objectives, heedless of the suffering and squandered resources. The two men once fought as allies against Mr. Mengistu, and had been embraced by Washington as promising reformers, princes of what President Clinton called an "African Renaissance." But they proved to be fundamentally men of the gun. Washington and the rest of the world should refrain from lavishing praise or aid on either until they have demonstrated a commitment to peaceful and accountable governing.
The Clinton administration, particularly former national security adviser Anthony Lake and Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice, deserves credit for brokering this accord after a long campaign of intensive and sometimes highly personal diplomacy. But the administration should be doing some soul-searching of its own. Through most of the war it refrained from publicly criticizing its two African allies, and it resisted calls for sanctions, belatedly supporting an arms embargo only after fighting resumed in May. Nor did the administration seek to slow down more than $1 billion in World Bank loans at a time when the two countries were hemorrhaging cash on weapons.
As this war comes to a close, there is reason to wonder whether lives could have been spared with a less accommodating form of engagement.

HEADLINE: Western Banks Say They Will Continue Lending Money to Turkey

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Western bankers have vowed to continue lending money to Turkey, giving a vital boost to efforts to restore confidence in that nation's finances just days after the International Monetary Fund agreed to provide a multibillion-dollar emergency aid package, bankers and I.M.F. officials said today.
The commitments, which are considered nonbinding but are vital for Turkey's financial stability, were made at a meeting of representatives of 30 European and American banks in Frankfurt, where Turkish officials outlined an accelerated plan to sell state assets, reduce spending and close troubled banks. Bankers have organized a similar session to be held in New York on Wednesday. 
 "The international financial community will be supportive," said William R. Rhodes, a Citigroup vice chairman whose bank attended the Frankfurt meeting and organized the New York session. "People are optimistic that Turkey will implement its reform program as it agreed with the I.M.F."
The I.M.F. agreed last week to provide $7.5 billion in new loans and deliver about $3 billion in already promised loans early to bolster Turkey, where stocks plunged and overnight interest rates soared on fears that the nation's banking system could collapse. The turmoil raised fears not only that Turkey's ambitious economic overhaul would fail but also that investors would lose faith in the prospects of other major emerging economies.
Both Turkey and Argentina experienced a sudden drop in investor confidence late last month, posing the biggest challenge to the I.M.F. and the United States since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990's.
The two nations are likely to receive emergency I.M.F. loans later this month, the largest bailout packages since an I.M.F. rescue of Brazil in 1998.
The troubles are linked to the sharp slowdown in the growth rate of the United States economy and the sell-off in American stock markets. Export-oriented developing nations in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East have depended heavily on robust expansion in the United States to power their own tentative recoveries from a recession in the late 1990's.
Foreign investors began withdrawing credit lines from Turkey two weeks ago after fears developed that many Turkish banks, which are under heavy pressure to reorganize, had become insolvent. Argentina faces a different problem: investors there are worried that its slow-growing economy may not have the wherewithal to repay its hefty foreign debt.
In Turkey, the coalition government of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, acting with I.M.F. support, began an economic overhaul early this year intended to bring the economy up to European standards, part of its bid to join the European Union.
Turkey set up a strict currency management system, imposed budgetary discipline and moved to sell some state assets. The effort reduced government borrowing and sharply lowered inflation, but the program forced Turkey's 81 banks to improve their operations or die.
Allegations of widespread corruption and the government's seizure of 10 banks last month caused investors to panic about the solvency of the banking system.
Gazi Ercel, the governor of Turkey's central bank, and Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund, conducted today's meeting in Frankfurt, which was organized by Deutsche Bank and included representatives from Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank of Germany and Citigroup of the United States, among other major lenders.
Officials described the session as a "soft touch" appeal to bankers to stay engaged, an effort to forge a public consensus that Turkey's problems can be readily overcome.
One official briefed on the meetings said that there was a general sense among bankers that Turkey's economic plans made sense. But the official also said bankers present were not "ecstatic" about the situation and that Turkish officials would be left to negotiate loan commitments in follow-up sessions.
Over all, Turkey has about $25 billion in debt that must be paid back within a year, according to Moody's Investors Service. Turkish banks hold about $14 billion in such short-term loans. Though Turkey's overall debt burden is moderate, its banks could face a serious cash squeeze without continued foreign credits.
Turkey's aggressive program of selling state companies -- it promised to speed up the sale of its telecommunications and airline companies in conjunction with the latest I.M.F. loans -- also depends on the willingness of foreign companies, and their bankers, to invest more money.
Early indications are that there is no rush for the exits.
After declining sharply during the crisis, foreign currency reserves held by Turkey's central bank have risen recently, to about $19 billion, Western officials said today.
"We remain optimistic about the stabilization program and its effects on the Turkish economy," Deutsche Bank's chief executive-designate, Josef Ackermann, said in a statement today.
Mr. Rhodes of Citigroup said his bank was prepared not only to keep its credit lines to Turkey open but also to increase its investments there, particularly if the government follows through on promises to allow more foreign ownership of local banks.

HEADLINE: Deregulation Called Blow To Minorities

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The 1996 landmark law that was warmly embraced by the Clinton administration and many Republicans as a way to begin deregulating the nation's telecommunications industry has had the unintended effect of raising substantial new barriers for companies controlled by minorities and women, new independent studies commissioned by the federal government have found.
The studies show that the wave of consolidation in the broadcast, telephone and cable industries prompted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 had created "nearly insurmountable obstacles" to those seeking to enter those industries and to thrive. 
 They also found that in general over the last 50 years, companies controlled by minorities and women have been far less likely to win government licenses for telephone service and radio or television stations, even if they are qualified to run those operations. In recent years, the studies found, the 1996 law in combination with changes in tax law and affirmative action rules, had made the problems for small businesses particularly acute.
"Today small firms face barriers erected by deregulation and consolidation in both wireless and broadcast," one of the studies said. "Minorities and women confront those same barriers; and yet those obstacles stand high atop a persistent legacy of discrimination in the capital markets, industry, advertising and community -- and prior F.C.C. policies, which worsened the effects of discrimination."
"The barriers to entry have been raised so high that, left standing, they appear virtually insurmountable," the study concluded. "Minority, women and small-business ownership in these industries is diminishing at such an alarming rate that many we spoke with felt we had passed the point of no return."
While it has long been known that minorities and women face difficulties in a wide range of industries, the five studies to be released on Tuesday by the Federal Communications Commission conclude that barriers imposed by both the government and the marketplace have taken a particular toll in telecommunications and the so-called new economy companies, where the lifeblood is the government license to use a part of the airwaves.
"These studies confirm that small minority and women-owned businesses are encountering significant difficulties in participating in the new economy," said William E. Kennard, chairman of the F.C.C. "With consolidation in the past few years it's clear that it's become harder for any business that is small to participate as an owner of infrastructure, whether it is cable systems or whether it is phones or broadcasting. But this is still a vitally important part of our economy, and we have to make sure that we are creating opportunity for small minority- and women-owned businesses."
In his more than seven years as the agency's general counsel and then its chairman, Mr. Kennard, the first African-American to head the F.C.C., has struggled against a hostile Republican Congress and a lukewarm administration in trying to find new opportunities for minorities and women. An earlier study he commissioned showed minority broadcasters often cannot command the same advertising revenues as other broadcasters.
Mr. Kennard said he had hoped that the studies would provide a blueprint for a Gore administration to take new steps on behalf of small companies. He also acknowledged that the prospect of a Bush administration may significantly diminish the impact of the studies on future policy makers.
Regulators and courts have long described the spectrum as a public trust that needs to be managed in the best interests of the public, but the studies conclude that minorities and women have had a difficult time for the last half-century and that it still remains especially difficult for them to win licenses and get financing for their ventures on a footing comparable to their rivals.
In one study, entitled "Whose Spectrum Is It Anyway?" researchers found that the 1996 law, following other adverse trends in the courts and in Congress, had been particularly hard on those small companies.
In 1995 Congress eliminated a tax program intended to encourage investment in small, minority- and women-owned telecommunication companies. Around the same time, the United States Supreme Court and other federal courts began to hand down a series of decisions that made it significantly more difficult for the federal government to carry out affirmative action programs and take steps to assist minority businesses.
The studies concluded that in the area of broadcasting, ownership can have a deep impact on programming, and that the lack of diversity among owners could lead to less diverse kinds of programs. Minority-owned radio stations, for example, were far more likely to choose a programming format that appeals particularly to a minority audience, and were more likely to have greater racial diversity of on-air talent.
The studies show that minority- and women-owned companies have had a more difficult time getting financing for starting new ventures and expanding, and when they have received financing, it is often on less favorable terms than comparable businesses run by white men.
The F.C.C. had earlier encouraged small businesses by permitting them to bid in license auctions and make payments in installments. But after some businesses defaulted on those loans, the rules were changed.
On Tuesday the agency will begin what many expect will be the largest auction in its history, for licenses to operate mobile telephones, and all winners will have to make their payments upfront.
The studies also show that officials at the F.C.C. have been inconsistent in their application of equal opportunity guidelines, and that the agency "often failed in its role of public trustee of the broadcast and wireless spectrum by not properly taking into account the effect of its programs on small, minority- and women-owned businesses."
The studies, which are expected to be made public by the F.C.C. on Tuesday, were conducted by KPMG; Ernst & Young; the Ivy Planning Group, a consulting group based in Rockville, Md.; and researchers from Santa Clara University and the University of Washington.

HEADLINE: Rush Hour All Month At the Beauty Salons

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
In Sarah Ban Breathnach's book "Simple Abundance," and in her latest effort, "A Man's Journey to Simple Abundance," she counsels readers to find and nourish their "authentic" selves, a journey that, she acknowledges, sometimes requires detours through the more lavish sectors of the service economy. Specifically, these are detours that might include saying yes to a $300 double-process coloring at an East Side hair salon.
In preparation for Christmas, which she will spend at a country estate in England, Ms. Ban Breathnach plans to have her hair cut and colored at John Frieda, her eyebrows shaped and tweezed by Eliza Petrescu (regarded by some as the Bernini of eyebrow-arching), her manicure administered at Vogue Nails on Lexington Avenue and her muscles toned in extra sessions with her personal trainer. Conservatively speaking, the cost of Ms. Ban Breathnach's authentic holiday self should total about $700, tips not included. 
 "There's no place like New York for beauty maintenance," Ms. Ban Breathnach said. And there is no moment for beauty maintenance and the frenetic energy with which it is pursued in the city quite like the weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. All around New York, salons that attract the kind of clients who attend English country-house parties, and the ones that don't, report a 20 to 25 percent increase in business in December. As Randall Seale, an owner of Ultra, a hair salon in the East Village, put it, "December is the money month."
In a normal week, the Elizabeth Arden salon on Fifth Avenue at 54th Street may see 4,500 clients; in December the number jumps to about 5,700, said Teresa McKee, the general manager. Saturday appointments during holiday time are sold out three months in advance, with many women rushing to use up soon-to-expire gift certificates from the previous Christmas.
Adding to the mania bubbling at salons is the fear that seizes a certain kind of woman having nothing to do with the possibility of family psychodrama and everything to do with exposed roots. "No one wants to go home with them," Mr. Seale said.
Garren, owner of the salon at Henri Bendel that bears his name, has noticed that "people double up on color" during the holidays, meaning that those who come in every four weeks for a $325 treatment visit twice between Thanksgiving and Christmas. "They try to make sure there's not a root in sight," he said.
Securing an appointment at this time of year can demand a tobacco lobbyist's level of political skill. With blow-dryers whirring around him last Thursday afternoon, Jason Lore, a stylist at the Peter Coppola salon on Madison Avenue and 65th Street, said that women who forget to book appointments well in advance and want them at the last minute often call with enticements. "They'll say 'I'll bring up anything,' " he said. " 'I'm stopping by Prada.' "
Late last Friday afternoon, Mr. Lore was in the middle of blow-drying the long brown hair of one of his regular clients, Fran Borden, a television commercial producer. When this reporter suggested that Ms. Borden seemed to be getting more poof to her hair, Mr. Lore gently corrected. "We don't say poof," he offered. "We say movement." Ms. Borden will be a showcase for a lot of "movement" in the coming days.
"Essentially, I'll be living here for the next week," she said as she sipped the second glass of white wine she had ordered from La Goulue, the restaurant downstairs. "I need frequent flier miles." Ms. Borden was planning to have her hair blown out (at $60 an appointment) four times next week for four Christmas parties, including one at her gym.
Like others who avail themselves liberally of all that the grooming industries have to offer, Ms. Borden must now extend the season's largesse to her handlers. As it turns out, the culture of the $300 haircut involves a holiday tipping etiquette in which a $9 panettone has little place.
"Some people will give you airline tickets or use of their summer home," River Lloyd, a top stylist at John Frieda, explained. He has received tickets to Italy, jewelry and Prada luggage. Last year in addition to tipping Mr. Lore in wineglasses, Ms. Borden bought beaded bracelets for all the receptionists at the front desk of the Coppola salon and a pashmina for her manicurist there, only to discover that the manicurist had already received countless others.
Perhaps no salon was quite so hectic last week as Pilo Arts, a 22-year-old beauty parlor and spa in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, which has bestowed upon its senior stylist, Paul Pastore, the title of artistic director, and which boasts a colorist who as Jude LaBarca, an owner, put it, "brings in $250,000 a year in color." During December, Mr. LaBarca said, 40 percent of the salon's styling business is conducted in up-dos, coiffure vernacular for party hair. On Saturday, with every manicure table filled in a room with bronze nude sculptures on the wall, Margaret Woods was getting her hair elevated for her husband's office Christmas party that night. "I'm going with half-up, half-down," Ms. Woods said, "typical of my life."
Not too far away, party makeup was being applied to three women. "They want a lot of shimmer, they want lashes," said Ilene Stein, a makeup artist who was applying one lash at a time to a young woman in a head full of curlers. "It photographs beautiful," Ms. Stein said. "It dresses up the eye without a lot of heavy-looking makeup."
At the most, an up-do and a special makeup session at Pilo take about an hour and a half. Procedures at Sokhna Diarra, a salon specializing in African styling on Flatbush Avenue about 20 minutes away, require a longer commitment -- sometimes much longer. At 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, Lucha Cineas arrived for microbraiding -- in which the braids made are wire thin -- and did not finish until 6:30 that evening.
Sokhna Diarra, which also houses the small work space of a Senegalese tailor and a sign that reads "Airline Tickets for Any Destinations Sold Here," has two stylists. On Saturday, both spent the day weaving and attaching three packs of long human hair strands to Ms. Cineas's head of short curly hair.
Ms. Cineas, an assistant to lawyers at Merrill Lynch, was preparing for a holiday season that would include listening to Christmas carols at Madison Square Garden. She said she endures the microbraiding every two months, generally without getting up from her chair, because "I'm just so used to fake hair." Her bill is $160 for styling, $90 for the purchased hair strands and $20 in tips.
A few doors down from Sokhna Diarra, Gavin Greaves owner of Urban Hair Style said that his December had been slow so far because the gypsy vans that transport passengers up and down Flatbush Avenue were having a harder time getting fares. "If people have no money," Mr. Greaves said, "they're not going to go anywhere."

Law Firms' Profit Growth Slowed by Higher Salaries
The sizable increases in salaries paid to lawyers this year are already beginning to slow the growth of law firms' profits, according to a recent survey that could be an early sign of coming difficult economic decisions.
Expenses at 16 law firms, seven of them New York firms employing more than 300 lawyers, rose 24 percent in the first six months of the year compared with figures in the period a year earlier, according to the survey, conducted by Citibank Private Bank. Page C4.

It's Hypocrisy, Yankees Say

 BODY:
The owners of the Texas Rangers and Colorado Rockies have agreed to the two largest contracts in baseball history in the past week and, coincidentally, both were part of a committee formed to study the game's economic problems. The coincidence was not lost on the Yankees' president, Randy Levine, who had another name for it: hypocrisy.
Levine said that Rodriguez's Texas contract, $252 million for 10 years, and the $121 million Colorado is going to pay to Mike Hampton, represented the height of hypocrisy "by two teams serving on the economic study committee preaching fiscal restraint and seeking to lessen their revenue obligations." 
 "It represents a total lack of credibility, and never again should we hear any complaints about the actions of the Yankees, which have proven over the years to be responsible for the team and its fans," Levine said. "Those two clubs, along with others, have been consistently arguing that they need more revenue-sharing relief, and that player spending is out of control."
The Rangers owner Tom Hicks and the Rockies owner Jerry McMorris were part of the committee. A four-member panel that included the columnist George Will and the former United States Senator George J. Mitchell used information provided by that committee and issued a report that called for additional revenue sharing, among other things.

HEADLINE: Albright, in Botswana, Announces U.S. Help to Fight AIDS

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: GABORONE, Botswana, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In this African nation where about a third of all adults are infected with H.I.V. -- the highest rate in the world -- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright hugged a singing star today and praised her bravery after the entertainer revealed she was infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
The gesture was a powerful one in a nation where AIDS infection brings shame and social ostracism, and acknowledging infection is taboo. 
 Mayoress Molefi-Mochangana, one of Botswana's most celebrated singers, told Dr. Albright and a small group of women gathered in a prenatal clinic that she only learned of her infection from a recent test and she urged other women to find out whether they have the deadly virus. "I'm living a happier life, and working and still a musician," said Ms. Molefi-Mochangana.
Dr. Albright praised Ms. Molefi-Mochangana's bravery in confronting the stigma against the disease.
"She is a wonderful example of what we can accomplish when we confront life's most daunting challenges with courage," she said.
There are few challenges more daunting than AIDS in Botswana, where the United Nations estimates that more than one-third of adults are infected.
Of the 62,000 babies born every year, 8,700 are infected with the disease, according to Health Minister Joy Phumaphi.
The government provides a rigorous course of the drug AZT for pregnant women with H.I.V. to prevent them from transmitting the virus to their babies during childbirth and gives them baby formula to protect the child from the mother's infected breast milk.
But in the country's small villages, women seen with formula are immediately suspected of being infected and ostracized. The stigma against H.I.V. is so overwhelming that many pregnant women are simply too frightened to take advantage of government programs.
"The rate of mother-to-child transmission in Botswana continues to grow, particularly in rural areas, where women are not able to benefit as much from public education," Ms. Phumaphi told guests at a ceremony outside the maternity clinic, one of the busiest in the country.
Dr. Albright announced today a United States government donation of 200 trailers to be used as H.I.V. counseling centers across the vast, sparsely populated country. The donation includes 200 televisions and video recorders to play a new video to teach pregnant woman how to prevent transmitting the virus to their children. Ms. Molefi-Mochangana's band recorded the video soundtrack. "As a mother and a grandmother, I must say I feel a special love and a friendship with all of you, because I can understand how difficult this all is," Dr. Albright said in a speech outside the clinic.
Inside the clinic, she sat with a group of women beneath posters urging testing. But many of the women said they feared having to tell their families they were infected.
Dr. Albright's visit to Africa is part of what could be her last big trip as secretary of state. In her visits to South Africa, Mauritius and Botswana, she has worked to highlight three African democracies with strong economies. But she has also cast attention to the AIDS pandemic.
On Tuesday, she was scheduled to fly Tuesday to Algeria to witness the signing of a peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

HEADLINE: Beneath Sheets, An Economy Largely Hidden;
The Billion-Dollar Life Of New York Bed Linen

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

 BODY:
The cotton was grown on the arid plains of West Texas where it was reaped by machines and lifted onto trucks, mostly by Mexican immigrants, for minimum wage. It was ginned clean of seeds and packed into bales by semiskilled Americans earning, on average, less than $10 hour.
The bales were shipped to Belgium where Turks and Moroccans spun them into yarn for 415 Belgian francs -- or about $9 -- an hour, and then woven into bolts. The bolts were shuttled across a factory floor where Flemish women, paid $8.70 an hour, cut and hemmed them. The new linen was shipped across the Atlantic, stored in a warehouse in Newark and sold to The Stanhope hotel, located across Fifth Avenue from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for a price ranging between $21 and $27 per sheet. 
 The Stanhope considers itself one of the finest hotels in the city. Its credo: a fine hotel catering to refined patrons must absolutely have fine linens. The hotel guest is paying $325 to $3,000 a night for the privilege of sleeping between them.
An entire economy revolves around these sheets, from the hotel that must have a large supply of them to the business executive who sleeps on them to the laundry worker who earns $6.75 an hour cleaning them. Numbers are abstract and ephemeral, slippery like soap bubbles, and they do not tell stories. But a day in the life of a sheet does.
The Stanhope sheets are crisp and white and 100 percent cotton. They have 204 threads per square inch (most commercial sheets have 184) and the king size measures 108 by 120 inches. Each sheet is stamped with the hotel's name.
The Stanhope linens are starched once a month and washed 150 times in a special three-step method, over a life span of about six months, before they are torn into rags.
At 8:55 a.m., Phillip M. Litchenstein emerges from room 1401. He is a tall man who wears round glasses, polished shoes and a camel hair coat befitting an international financier. He takes the elevator to the check-out desk.
"I slept fine," Mr. Litchenstein tells the concierge. He has been here two nights on important business, he says.
"The sheets were nothing to write home about though," he says. "I'll give them a B+. The best sheets in the world are at the Dukes Hotel in London. They are so incredibly smooth, they must be the finest linen in the world. My wife and I can't wait to go back there," he says after paying his bill and heading for the door.
"Of course, sheets are not the most important thing in the world. The towels are. And at the Dukes, they are absolutely exquisite."
And then Mr. Litchenstein jumps into a cab and disappears down Fifth Avenue.
Upstairs in room 1401, Sharon Singh separates the financier's used linen for $12.71 an hour. The way the Stanhope figures it, she must earn 14 credits for a full day's pay. A room this size, with its polished wood and Chinese lamps, will earn her one credit. The number of credits is translated into hours worked.
She makes $348 a week after taxes. "It's not great money," says Ms. Singh, 40, a mother of two. "When I started here four years ago I made eight," she said, referring to $8 an hour. "And then two years ago I made 10. And now we've got a union and I'm making 12 and next August they say it will go to $16."
The Stanhope was purchased last year by the Hyatt Corporation and with the building the company also got Local 6 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union. Over the last five years, the leaders of the 22,000-member union have negotiated a 22.5 percent increase (before inflation) in weekly wages for its average worker.
The economic boom in New York City has been fueled by Wall Street, but also in great part by the hospitality and health care industries -- industries that cannot function without clean linen. Hotel room revenues in the city will reach an estimated $5.1 billion this year, 65 percent higher than four years ago, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
More than 80,000 new restaurant seats have been created in that same time period, reports the New York State Restaurant Association, with more than 20 new hotels and 300 restaurants opening this year alone. And the operating revenues of city nonprofit hospitals totaled more $14.2 billion in 1999.
Workers' wages have begun to edge up past the rate of inflation over the last few years, but the gulf between the people who handle the sheets and the people who sleep on them is widening, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group.
Ms. Singh and her husband must manage a $1,400 mortgage in Ozone Park, Queens, and she has an hour-and-15-minute commute by subway. She sent one of her daughters to live with a relative in Long Island. The reasons were economic.
"Back in Guyana, I never had to work," she says.
She has heard that women did not always have to work in the States, either. "Now, of course, everyone must work."
She moves to the toilet where she scrubs the tiles on her hands and knees. "I'm lucky," she says into the commode. "I have silk sheets in a home that I own and a job. It's worked out so far."
Jusif Subasic is the house man and he comes to get the bags of used sheets at 11:36 a.m. He takes them by the service elevator into the freshly painted bowels of the hotel and places them in bins for sorting.
"My job is not redundant but required," he says. He was a high school principal in Bosnia until the war there broke out. Now, the erect and silver-haired academic is in New York, working for $12.71 an hour and paying $800 for a one-room apartment in Astoria, Queens, that he shares with his wife. "A hotel needs a man to hustle broken lamps to the engineer's office, to tote the dirty linen, to fetch with a smile."
The sheets wait until 3:30 P.M., when they are sorted again and counted on carpeting by Miguel Maldonado, a sleepy-eyed, 42-year-old Puerto Rican with a runny nose.
"My dream was to be a fireman," he says. "But I only went to the eighth grade. That's where I blew it."
He used to have a dream, he says again. Now he's just cleaning up after other people's dreams, trying to help support five children and a grandchild on $12.71 an hour, a wage that places him just above the national poverty level. He wears a mask and plastic gloves and he spends hours sorting king size, queen size, twin. Pillow cases, towels, robes.
"I should have stayed in school," he says.
Benny Boshnjakaj goes to school in the day to learn English and at night polishes brass and pushes the bins full of sheets out to the truck and brings the clean ones in. The laundry truck comes for the linen at 11:30 p.m. Mr. Boshnjakaj, 18, explains himself through cigarette smoke. His family owned a motel in Pristina, Kosovo, until the Serbs smashed it to the ground.
"Sometimes I look at myself and say, what am I doing here?" His father is a cleaner now, his mother unemployed. "My parents, they need me," he says.
The linen is driven to a small industrial shop, Central Laundry, in Stamford, Conn. The hotel used to do its own laundry on the third floor. "It is more cost effective to outsource your linen," said Mark Pardue, the general manager of the Stanhope.
There are about 7,000 commercial laundry workers in the metropolitan area, half of whom are covered by a master labor contract negotiated by the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. An agreement ratified last week will raise their wages by 20 percent over three years and starting pay will rise to $7 an hour.
But there are problems: since real wages for laundry workers dropped 13 percent over the last decade, their real gain will be 7 percent over the 13 years. And if inflation stays at its current rate, workers will gain little or nothing.
Central Laundry is a clean place. The floor is swept and orderly. The equipment is new. But the shop is nonunion and many of the workers say they earn $6.75 an hour.
In contrast, at the large unionized industrial laundries like Arrow and Seacrest in Brooklyn, wages will increase with the new contract. But they are decrepit places where bags of laundry bleed from hooks like hog carcasses. The pipes flake with rust and the bathrooms smell like wet goats. They employ hundreds of people.
Rudy Palma, 19, came from Guatemala 18 months ago to find an education. All he found was a high cost of living and a job at Central Laundry.
He starts work when the sky is still dark. "I came to go to school and now I'm just looking into a machine all day and my back hurts," he says. The place is choked with the smell of chemicals and dry heat. In a good week, Mr. Palma will gross $237. He walks to work.
"I dream about the rich man who slept on these sheets sometimes," he says. "I want to be that guy."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Atop a Little Army in the Year of the Dragon

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
DR. IFFATH ABBASI HOSKINS has the glow of a proud new mother as she checks the construction on the sixth floor of New York University Downtown Hospital.
This is the maternity ward, where births have soared since Dr. Hoskins was named chief of obstetrics and gynecology in 1998, with a mandate to expand the department. So she has, expanding into space that once belonged to internal medicine. 
 "We're the great advancing army," she said last week when the floor bustled with 25 women and their newborns, plus eight more patients in various stages of labor. "We want more. We're ready."
N.Y.U. Downtown is one of many hospitals at which births have jumped this year. The explanations are many, but at a hospital where 65 percent of the obstetrics patients are Chinese, the good fortune associated with having a baby in the Year of the Dragon leads the way.
Dr. Hoskins, 49, a native of Pakistan, is triumphant. She has made this N.Y.U. outpost a welcoming place for Chinese women, with a bilingual staff, Chinese-language videos for expectant mothers, and sensitivity training for staff members, so they understand the cultural aversion to breast-feeding (new immigrants think using formula signals assimilation) or to soothing a sore bottom with an ice pack (which violates rules of yin and yang).
It is no wonder that Dr. Hoskins has risen to the challenge of her multicultural clientele, which also includes Latinas, Hasidic Jews and Wall Street bankers. Herself an immigrant, she was unable to qualify for a surgical residency when she immigrated to the United States in 1977 with third world medical credentials. She is married to an American from Tennessee, a fellow physician, and has raised two children, now grown, whose college essays were about their hybrid upbringing.
After medical school in Pakistan, where her father was the first mayor of Karachi after independence in 1947, and her mother was one of the country's first female physicians, Dr. Hoskins set aside plans to be an obstetrician and settled for a residency in psychiatry at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington. Only after completing that nonsurgical training was she able to earn a place in the residency of her choice, at the National Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Md. There she met her husband-to-be, Dr. William J. Hoskins, now chief of the gynecology service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Meals at the Upper East Side home of the doctors Hoskins can make others queasy. Their 26-year-old son, studying law and health policy, and their 23-year-old daughter, an art history and film student, complained as teenagers when conversation turned to hemorrhaging patients. "You guys, it's dinner," she says one or the other would say.
While husband and wife share a specialty, only she enjoys delivering babies. "He finds it scary," said Dr. Hoskins, whose three siblings are also doctors. One is a reproductive endocrinologist, one an internist and the last an orthopedic surgeon.
The delivery room, she said, is the one place in medicine where there are always two patients, sometimes with competing needs. It is also a place where "things happen very quickly" and "you can lose a baby within five to eight minutes."
In that way, Dr. Hoskins said, it is like the emergency room. But since more than 90 percent of births are uneventful, mothers prefer a homey, nonsurgical environment. Her task, given the expectation of a happy outcome but with the specter of calamity always present, is to have "one side of the brain always on alert."
Dr. Hoskins knew that this was her calling. Yet the time at St. Elizabeth's was not wasted, she said, because she learned communications skills -- a bedside manner -- that are secondary in surgical training.
THE first residency also prepared her to explain to foreign-born students at N.Y.U. School of Medicine, where she is an associate professor, that the American system does not mean to exclude them, but rather to measure them against a familiar set of standards. "We pay a heavier price," Dr. Hoskins tells them. "But as onerous as it is, it is not an insult."
Her second residency, in Bethesda, is immortalized in the World War II poster on her office wall: "Gee I Wish I Were a Man -- I'd Join the Navy." She followed that residency with a tour of duty at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and a continuing military career as a commander in the Marine Reserves.
Slowed by the double residency, she has been sprinting ever since.
Dr. Hoskins moved quickly through the ranks at Bellevue, part time when her children were small and eventually as head of the department, with a specialty in high-risk pregnancies. That continues at N.Y.U. Downtown, along with the assignment to increase volume in a high-stakes economy, in which maternity wards are known as excellent places to recruit loyal patients.
This particular maternity ward, shared by poor immigrants and Wall Street tycoons, is the setting for a new research project on the fears of pregnant women and new mothers. So far, Dr. Hoskins said, her data support the observations of a 25-year career.
"I have yet to meet a mother, from any culture, who doesn't ask: 'Am I doing the right thing? Am I stressing the baby?' " she said. "And everyone, including myself, looks first to see if the baby is perfect: five fingers, five toes and those beautiful little ears."

HEADLINE: A Tale of Piracy: How the Chinese Stole the Grinch

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The Grinch may be stealing Christmas on movie screens across America, but Chinese copyright pirates have already done him one better: they've stolen the Grinch here.
Within a week after the Nov. 17 release in the United States of "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas," videodisc copies of the film were selling on China's streets for about $1.20 each -- further proof that China's well-oiled copyright piracy machine is running smoothly despite government promises to shut it down. 
 The discs are mocking reminders of the difficulties China has carrying out trade agreements even as it prepares to enter the World Trade Organization. Even the Communist Party's own anticorruption propaganda film, "Life and Death Choice," is widely available in pirated copies across the country.
Some people say the government has been reluctant to crack down on the pirates because the steady stream of cheap American movies has helped keep alive the state-owned factories producing videodisc players by the millions.
China adopted the video compact disc format in the mid-1990's, before many people here had bought the videotape players popular in the West. Dozens of state companies began making the disc players, which have since been adapted to play higher quality digital videodiscs.
As Western antipiracy efforts bore down on software and music-copyright thieves in the past five years, the counterfeit compact disc industry switched to producing videodiscs instead of software and music discs. The disc player makers and the pirates grew in tandem, until today there is an oversupply of both. China produces 20 million VCD players annually, but current market demand is only half that amount. Videodisc shops, kiosks and sidewalk hawkers, meanwhile, have saturated the major cities with pirated videodiscs.
By the end of 1998, according to government press reports, about 50 million Chinese families owned the players and were regular buyers of movie discs. Many young, urban Chinese have collections of hundreds of movies; active swapping is conducted and information traded on web sites like lovemin.1999net.com and fzdvd.3322.net.
Prices of both the machines and the discs have fallen steadily: a video disc player may sell for $70, and movies for as little as 80 cents, with rentals even cheaper. The trade has made it almost impossible to sell legitimate videodiscs here, which cost more than double the pirated versions, and dampened the lure of Hollywood films in movie theaters, even though the quota of such films released in China will rise to 20 each year under the W.T.O. agreement.
"Chinese consumers don't want to pay 36 yuan for a VCD, see it once or twice and give it away," said K. Y. Lai, general manager of Shanghai CAV Thakral Home Entertainment Ltd., a Chinese-Singapore joint venture and China's largest distributor of Hollywood films on video. "They would rather pay 6, 8 or 10 yuan to see a pirated copy and then throw it away."
His company did sell 300,000 legitimate copies of "Titanic," its biggest success. But pirates sold 20 million to 25 million copies of the film. Even with less popular films, the pirates outsell legitimate distributors about 35 to one, Mr. Lai said.
Pirates have films on the streets in China as little as two days after their debut in American theaters, while legitimate distributors must wait nine months or more for video release. Pirates first record the movies with video cameras in American theaters, then ship the tapes to China, where editors add subtitles and, more recently, dub some of the films into Chinese. ("Grinch" is available both dubbed and undubbed.)
The pirates then use computers to enhance the quality of later generations of the discs, and usually make new copies when the films are officially released on videotape or DVD. Competing pirated versions of the same film often circulate in the market, some of them smuggled in from factories in Taiwan.
In China, the videos are stamped onto discs with equipment imported from the West. Attempts to ban such imports are hopeless because the machines are easily broken down into components and imported piecemeal as "machine parts."
Many pirate disc labels carry the name of licensed VCD makers, but these state-owned factories deny they are involved with the copycats.
"We did not publish Guijingling," said an official of the Guizhou Cultural Audio-Visual Publishing House, the company whose name appears on one pirated version of the Grinch film. "Guijingling" is a Chinese word that means "ghost," and is used as the translation of "Grinch."
The official said her company had tried hard to track down pirates who use the company's name. But even if a factory is found and closed down, the equipment is sometimes simply moved and production starts up again. "It's just like drawing water with a bamboo basket," she said.

Dinner Requisite: A High I.Q.
Some guests said it was the most intimidating invitation they had ever received: a dinner party for a dozen Nobel laureates. These same nonwinners prepared by grabbing their copies of "Beloved" for a quick reread (its author, TONI MORRISON, won the Nobel for literature in 1993) and rushed out to buy SUSAN SONTAG'S latest novel, "In America." She had been invited by the host, the consul general of Sweden, OLLE WASTBERG, to give a speech. He had even assigned her a topic that sounded intimidating (though not to her): "Is there such a thing as world literature?"
So it went on Sunday as Mr. Wastberg carried on a 43-year tradition of having Nobel laureates to dinner at his residence on the same day that the Nobel Prizes are awarded in Stockholm. Into the consul general's residence, at 600 Park Avenue, marched such Nobel winners as Ms. Morrison; DR. GUNTHER BLOBEL (medicine, 1999); DR. CHRISTIAN DE DUVE (medicine, 1974), DR. ROBERT F. FURCHGOTT (medicine, 1998), DR. JOHN F. NASH JR. (economics, 1994), and ELIE WIESEL (peace, 1986). 
 At least one guest arrived wearing a medal; not a Nobel medal, but the St. Nicholas Society Medal of Merit. It was hanging by an orange ribbon around the neck of the city's parks commissioner, HENRY J. STERN, who said he had received it last week.
Soon Mr. Stern was identifying people by the noms du parc in his notebook. For years Mr. Stern has assigned nicknames to people he meets; he also gives them name tags and carries the notebook to keep everything straight. He greeted Dr. Blobel as "ZIP code" and Dr. Blobel's wife, LAURA MAIOGLIO, as "Barbetta," the name of her restaurant on West 46th Street. Mr. Wastberg, who was a newspaper executive before he joined the diplomatic corps, was "Bulletin."
"It's always interesting to go to a party where the other guests are more distinguished than you are," Mr. Stern said.
On the menu the dessert -- ice cream with spices and pineapple sorbet -- was listed as ice cream dome a la Nobel. It was served with flaming candles that Mr. Wastberg said he had brought from Sweden.
Mr. Wiesel was seated across the table from SUZANNE TUFTS, president and chief executive of American Woman's Economic Development Corporation. "I'm named after three women who died at Auschwitz," she said. "I've seen Elie Wiesel at lectures but I've never met him. So I've lived around survivors my whole life, but for one who lives with it in the present so much, 'moving' is such a trite word for what it was like to meet him. It was an affirmation for him of survival and for me of continuity and of renewal."
A moment later, she said, "I didn't get to talk much to Toni Morrison or Susan Sontag, but Bob had a great time talking baseball to them." (Her husband, BOB TUFTS, now a vice president in the international equities division at Jeffries & Company, a Wall Street brokerage firm, was a major league pitcher in the late 1970's and 80's, playing for the San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals.)
 
An On-Screen Doppelganger
Forget singing lessons: For the HBO film "Disappearing Acts," SANAA LATHAN took lip-sync lessons from MELKY JEAN, a singer who is also the sister of WYCLEF JEAN.
"I worked with Melky so I could learn to breathe from my diaphragm so it looked like I was singing," said Ms. Lathan, who lip-syncs to Ms. Jean's recorded voice in the film.
She said she wanted to look real, "even though I was not actually singing."
After a screening attended by Ms. Jean's co-star, WESLEY SNIPES, as well as DEAN WINTERS, JOHNNIE L. COCHRAN, QUEEN LATIFAH, NATALIE COLE and SEAN COMBS, Ms. Jean seemed both impressed and perplexed.
"All the movements she was making, the head actions, the way she held her arms and hands, were my movements," Ms. Jean said. "She did a great job. But it felt strange to hear my voice and see my movements up on the screen. It's me but it's not me. She had me down. It was scary." JAMES BARRON

HEADLINE: The E-Mania at the B-Schools

BYLINE: By Phil Buchanan; Phil Buchanan, a management consultant, graduated from the Harvard Business School in June.

 BODY:
Over the past few months, we've been seeing what many believe is just the start of a series of dot-com failures, as some companies go belly up, some begin large-scale layoffs and others announce they have but a few weeks left to live.
To many industry observers and economists, this shakeout is predictable and probably healthy. At Harvard Business School, however, there might be some anxiety. Why? Because the school, one of the nation's leading graduate business programs, has been wildly enthusiastic about e-commerce, as have other business schools. 
 I should know. I just received an M.B.A. from Harvard, which has overhauled its curriculum to emphasize entrepreneurship -- especially e-commerce entrepreneurship.
Entirely new elective courses have emerged, employing Harvard's famous case-study method of teaching: "Building E-Businesses," "Operating an E-Business," "Starting Technology Ventures." The school even replaced its required first-year capstone course, "General Management," with "The Entrepreneurial Manager," because, after all, who would want to work at a company someone else started?
I was among the last students, in 1999, to take "General Management." I also took the required "Technology and Operations Management," which once focused primarily on auto manufacturing and other old-economy businesses and which this year required students to build a Web site.
Harvard is proud of its curriculum changes, viewed by the administration as a sign that the school is now on the cutting edge of the new economy and that it is responding to the demands of its customers, as a marketing professor might say.
The customers are the school's students and potential students, of course. And they demanded such change because, in the early and mid-1990s, Harvard Business School was seen by many as way behind the curve on technology.
The curriculum changes were Harvard's way of listening to these customers -- students they might otherwise lose to Stanford University's business school, with its Silicon Valley location, or to the dot-coms that persuade young stars they don't need M.B.A.'s at all.
The problem is, platitudinous business maxims notwithstanding, the customer isn't always right. The customers -- and I include myself here -- do not have the perspective to see the big picture, to identify what remains important in the midst of the change occurring in the economy. Many of my classmates wanted only whatever was necessary for them to develop a business idea to get funding, go public, make millions and retire.
I got a solid grounding in finance and other fundamentals. And no one forced me to sign up for the e-commerce electives I chose with enthusiasm. But by my second year, my friends and I would joke whenever we got a case study -- in any course -- about an old-economy company. "Finally," someone would say, "a case about a company that actually makes something." Someone else would chime in, "Yeah, like a profit."
Now, as the radical new "truths" about the new economy seem less true, I realize that I needed more grounding in the old economy before I tried to understand the new one -- even if I "demanded" something else. At the rate the economy is changing, the "new" courses I took in business school are already beginning to look dated.

HEADLINE: Bishop of Long Island, James T. McHugh, Is Dead at 68

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
Less than a year after becoming the spiritual leader of Long Island's 1.4 million Roman Catholics, Bishop James Thomas McHugh, an anti-abortion leader, died Sunday at his residence in Rockville Centre. He was 68.
Bishop McHugh, the head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre, had liver and gallbladder cancer, said Joanne C. Novarro, a spokeswoman for the diocese. His funeral will be on Friday. Page B4. 
 His illness was diagnosed a few months after he was designated as successor to Bishop John R. McGann in February 1999. But when he was installed in January, his doctors said the cancer was in remission.
Born in Orange, N.J., on Jan. 3, 1932, Bishop McHugh spent most of his school and working life in New Jersey, attending the Immaculate Conception Seminary in Darlington. He was ordained in 1957 and became a priest with the Archdiocese of Newark. Before moving to the Long Island diocese, he had been the bishop of Camden for 10 years.
He was an expert on issues involving human life, including abortion, the death penalty and euthanasia. In 1965 he became the director of the family life bureau of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
In 1971 Father McHugh was appointed papal chamberlain by Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II made him a prelate of honor in 1986.
In 1972, Father McHugh became the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' first director of pro-life activities, said Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the conference.
Bishops in the United States looked to Bishop McHugh and a handful of other prelates to articulate the church's position on human life issues, Monsignor Maniscalco said.
Bishop McHugh also specialized in demography and population matters, traveling to three United Nations conferences on population and three international conferences on women with the Vatican's delegation.
Part of his job was to help rebut what the Roman Catholic Church sees as exaggerated projections of world population growth, Monsignor Maniscalco said, and to encourage policies of economic development rather than population control.
"He was a tenacious defender of innocent human life," said John Carr, the director of social development and world peace for the bishops conference. "Part of it was loyalty to the church's teachings, and part of it was his conviction that this was the moral measure of our society."
After leaving the conference, he went to graduate school in Rome, where he earned a graduate degree in moral theology in 1981.
In 1987 he was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark, and was ordained a bishop in 1988. The following year, he became the bishop of Camden, where he focused on encouraging Catholic education and on drawing men to the priesthood, said Monsignor Maniscalco.
Although some of his time in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties, was consumed by his battle against cancer, he did complete negotiations with the teachers of the diocese's two Catholic high schools, ensuring that the teachers' contracts contained a clause saying that the teacher supported the Catholic faith and teachings, Mrs. Novarro said.
Bishop McHugh is survived by his mother, Caroline Scavone McHugh, and a sister, Sharon Foster.
Mrs. Novarro said that the Vatican had not yet chosen a successor for Bishop McHugh, and that a group of priests in the diocese would choose an administrator in the interim.
Bishop McHugh was with Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, in the last hours before the cardinal died in May. And Sunday, Archbishop Edward M. Egan of New York said he and Bishop McHugh had been friends since the 1960's.
"During these months of illness, he continued to preach the sanctity of life," Archbishop Egan said. "Only now he added his own example of the beauty of life, even when it is attended by sickness and suffering."

HEADLINE: Kim Tells Nobel Audience Of Need for Korean Unity

 BODY:
President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea, a former political prisoner, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday for his longstanding campaign for human rights and reconciliation with North Korea. Here are excerpts from his acceptance speech, from a text released by the Norwegian Nobel Institute. Speaking in Korean, Mr. Kim recalled his meeting in the summer with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il; said the concept of human rights has deep Asian roots; and described the strength that he found in his religious faith and sense of history.
In mid-June, I traveled to Pyongyang for the historic meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Il of the North Korean National Defense Commission. I went with a heavy heart, not knowing what to expect, but convinced that I must go for the reconciliation of my people and peace on the Korean Peninsula. 
 There was no guarantee that the summit meeting would go well. Divided for half a century after a three-year war, South and North Korea have lived in mutual distrust and enmity across the barbed-wire fence of the demilitarized zone. . . .
I had expected the talks with the North Korean leader to be extremely tough, and they were. However, starting from the shared desire to promote the safety, reconciliation and cooperation of our people, the chairman and I were able to obtain some important agreements. . . .
The two sides concurred that the U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula should continue for stability on the peninsula and northeastern Asia. In the last 50 years, North Korea had made the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula its primary point of contention.
I said to Chairman Kim, "The Korean Peninsula is surrounded by the four powers of the United States, Japan, China and Russia. Given the unique geopolitical location not to be found any other time or place, the continued U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula is indispensable to our security and peace, not just for now, but even after unification. . . .
To this explanation of mine, Chairman Kim, to my surprise, had a very positive response. It was bold switch from North Korea's longstanding demand, and a very significant move for peace on the Korean Peninsula and northeastern Asia. . . .
In the decades of my struggle for democracy, I was constantly faced with the refutation that Western-style democracy was not suitable for Asia, that Asia lacked the roots. This is far from true.
In Asia, long before the West, the respect for human dignity was written into systems of thought, and intellectual traditions upholding the concept of "demos" took root. "The people are heaven, the will of the people is the will of heaven, revere the people as you would heaven." This was the central tenet in the political thoughts of China and Korea as early as 3,000 years ago. Five centuries later in India, Buddhism rose to preach the supreme importance of one's dignity and rights as a human being.
There were also ruling ideologies and institutions that placed the people first. Mencius, disciple of Confucius, said: "The king is son of heaven. Heaven sent him to serve the people with just rule. If he fails and oppresses the people, the people have the right, on behalf of heaven, to dispose of him."
And this, 2,000 years before John Locke expounded the theory of the social contract and civic sovereignty.
In China and Korea, feudalism was brought down and replaced with counties and prefectures before the birth of Christ, and Civil Service exams to recruit government officials are 1,000 years old. The exercise of power by the king and high officials were monitored by robust systems of auditing.
In sum, Asia was rich in the intellectual and institutional traditions that would provide fertile grounds for democracy. What Asia did not have was the organizations of representative democracy. The genius of the West was to create the organizations, a remarkable accomplishment that has greatly advanced the history of humankind.
Brought into Asian countries with deep roots in the respect for demos, Western democratic institutions have adapted and functioned admirably, as can be seen in the cases of Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. . . .
I believe that democracy is the absolute value that makes for human dignity, as well as the only road to sustained economic development and social justice. . . .
Five times I faced near death at the hands of dictators. Six years I spent in prison, and 40 years I lived under house arrest or in exile and under constant surveillance. I could not have endured the hardship without the support of my people and the encouragement of fellow democrats around the world. The strength also came from deep personal beliefs.
I have lived, and continue to live, in the belief that God is always with me. I know this from experience. In August of 1973, while exiled in Japan, I was kidnapped from my hotel room in Tokyo by intelligence agents of the then military government of South Korea. The news of the incident startled the world. The agents took me to their boat at anchor along the seashore. They tied me up, blinded me and stuffed my mouth. Just when they were about to throw me overboard, Jesus Christ appeared before me with such clarity. I clung to him and begged him to save me. At that very moment, an airplane came down from the sky to rescue me from the moment of death.
Another faith is my belief in the justice of history. In 1980, I was sentenced to death by the military regime. For six months in prison, I awaited the execution day. Often, I shuddered with fear of death.
But I would find calm in the fact of history that justice ultimately prevails. I was then, and am still, an avid reader of history. And I knew that in all ages, in all places, he who lives a righteous life dedicated to his people and humanity may not be victorious, may meet a gruesome end in his lifetime, but will be triumphant and honored in history. He who wins by injustice may dominate the present day, but history will always judge him to be a shameful loser.
There can be no exception.

HEADLINE: Studies Dispute Some Assumptions on Welfare Overhaul

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Four years after the national overhaul of welfare, economists and welfare researchers are questioning some of the conventional wisdom of its shrinking rolls, including the belief that people who got off the rolls were the ones best prepared to work and that the caseload increases that inspired the overhaul were caused by a rising number of single mothers on relief.
An analysis of several studies suggests that the women who have been most likely to leave the welfare rolls include many with difficulties, like serious health problems, that make them more likely to be thrown off for violating stricter rules, Robert A. Moffitt, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University, said at a recent conference of welfare researchers and economists sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. These women make up a substantial proportion of those who are neither working nor on welfare, Professor Moffitt said. 
 By the same token, he said, many of the women best able to find work remain on the rolls because some states, like California, chose to reduce benefits gradually for mothers who work while on welfare.
Historically, welfare caseloads have followed the economy, rising with unemployment and shrinking when more jobs and better wages are available. When caseloads rose sharply from 1990 to 1994, there was concern that dependence on welfare had become a chronic problem of dependency by single mothers, rather than a temporary effect of bad times or life crises. That belief became a driving force behind Congress's decision in 1996 to end welfare as something people were entitled to if they met certain criteria.
But researchers who have since investigated the increase in caseloads of the early 1990's found that most of it did not come in the core program of benefits paid to single mothers and their children, said another expert, Rebecca Blank, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan who evaluates a wide range of welfare studies under federal contract.
Instead, much of the change occurred because two-parent families became eligible for welfare in all 50 states, and there was a rapid rise in cases in which only children received benefits, including American-born children with parents who were undocumented immigrants, and children of the crack epidemic who had been taken in by relatives.
Even the most ardent proponents of the federal welfare overhaul of 1996 could not have imagined a rosier national picture four years later.
The number of people on public assistance is half what it was at its peak in 1994. More recipients have found jobs. And the majority of low-skilled women appear to have increased their incomes, although evidence suggests that the most disadvantaged are suffering more.
But there is a glaring problem with this vision of success. Researchers evaluating welfare studies are cautioning policy makers that it is impossible to tell how much in the picture reflects changes in welfare policy and how much is the product of an extraordinary economic boom that now shows signs of faltering.
Just when welfare changes were taking place, the opportunities for and rewards of work rose sharply nationwide, not only because of a general economic boom, Professor Blank emphasized, but also because of increases in the minimum wage and in the earned-income tax credit.
A study by Pamela Loprest of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington that uses data drawn from 40,000 households in its National Survey of American Families, found evidence of considerable hardship both among those who left the rolls from 1995 to 1997 and among those who left later.
By the time of the study interviews in 1998 and 1999, 29.1 percent of the first group and 22.1 percent of the second group were back on public assistance. About one-third of the women who are no longer on welfare say they have had to cut the size of meals or skip meals in the past year because they did not have enough food, and about half report that either often, or sometimes, they do not have money for more food when it runs out, Ms. Loprest found.
In the first group, 38.7 percent reported that they had been unable to make a payment on the mortgage, rent or utility bills in the past year. That figure rose to 46.1 percent in the second group, an increase that may reflect rising housing costs in the economic boom.
Even emphasizing the fate of former recipients may be missing larger question, some analysts now say. One reason the rolls are shrinking, they say, is that caseworkers have been given greater discretion to turn people away, so many families are being kept off welfare to begin with.
Matthew Diller, a law professor at Fordham University, pointed out in an article last month on "The Revolution in Welfare Administration" in the New York University Law Review that if former recipients were rarely tracked for long, the growing number of families "diverted" from aid before they were ever enrolled generally were not tracked at all.
"While agencies might have some incentive to achieve successful outcomes for recipients," Professor Diller added, "they have little reason to be concerned about those who did not manage to become recipients in the first place."
Single mothers with preschool-age children have been the ones most affected by changes in welfare and the job market. Participation in the work force by never married mothers with children under 6 rose by 25 percent in a period when such participation by single women without children did not change at all, Professor Blank said.
Many economists believe that as more of the mothers work, it will be easier for them to find jobs in the future, should they leave or lose employment. But the same economists worry that without changes in policies, these women, who are often part-time and short-term workers, will not be able to gain access to welfare or the unemployment insurance system in times of high unemployment.
"The public is notoriously ambivalent about issues relating to poverty and welfare," Professor Diller said. "Americans both want people to leave the welfare rolls and want to prevent hardship, particularly among children."
And because welfare policies are compromises that try to accommodate these conflicting goals, researchers agree that an economic downturn will change the politics of welfare anew.

HEADLINE: U.N. Report Says Yugoslavia Needs More Aid

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Dec. 11

 BODY:
A United Nations report has warned of a $460 million shortfall in aid for Yugoslavia and stressed the need for urgent international action to help the Balkan country after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic.
Yugoslavia needs that amount of aid in coming months on top of assistance that has already been committed for crucial areas, according to the report, which was prepared for a meeting of international donors in Brussels on Tuesday. 
 The report, put together by the Belgrade mission of the United Nations' office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, detailed the financing gaps in six sectors including energy, food, health and education.
The head of the agency's office in Belgrade said he expected donors at the Brussels meeting to announce important amounts of aid, narrowing the deficit.
"We are expecting significant announcements for contributions," Paul Hebert of the office said. "We are very optimistic."
The Yugoslav deputy prime minister, Miroljub Labus, who will head his delegation, said aid was required to cover the population's basic needs during the winter. "Pledges so far cover the period until January," he told reporters. "We must negotiate aid for several more months."
The United Nations report said the dramatic political changes in Yugoslavia, in which President Milosevic was forced by a popular uprising to accept defeat in the September elections, and the country's fragile economic and social conditions called for a prompt international response.
"The quality and capacity of public services have been undermined during the past decade by economic decline, lack of reform and investment, economic sanctions and the conflicts which accompanied the disintegration of Yugoslavia," it said.
Western nations have rushed to show support for Yugoslavia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica.
The European Union is in the process of distributing a $177 million emergency package to help Yugoslavia cope with the winter cold. Several countries have also pledged aid, including the United States.
The United Nations report estimated donor contributions for coming months in the six areas at a total of $240 million so far. It said that amount would not be enough to meet all needs and estimated that $262 million was required until the end of March in the energy sector alone.

HEADLINE: Businessmen Who Created Fashion Cafe Are Hit With Fraud Charges

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
The creators of the Fashion Cafe, an international restaurant chain featuring the world of models and couture, have been indicted on federal charges of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering, the United States attorney's office announced yesterday.
One man, Tommaso Buti, 33, was arrested in Milan on Thursday, while his partner and brother, Francesco Buti, 39, remained a fugitive, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. 
 The 51-count indictment, unsealed on Friday, accuses the men of using investors' money for personal expenses, and of falsely claiming that they had invested millions of dollars of their own money in the restaurant.
The Fashion Cafe had a star-studded opening in Rockefeller Center in 1995. It sought to capitalize on the craze for theme restaurants.
But many of these restaurants had financial trouble within years of opening. While the former Wall Street favorites Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock Cafe have endured, even they, the trailblazers for such restaurants, had hard times in the late 90's.
The indictment of the Butis alleges that the brothers misrepresented the Fashion Cafe's financial condition to investors to obtain additional capital and loan contributions.
The Butis, who live in Florence, Italy, were also charged with defrauding investors connected with Food Evolution, a health food venture; the Benetton Sports Cafe, a theme restaurant focused on racing and connected to the Benetton clothing company; and an office building at 158 Madison Avenue.
Repeated calls to lawyers representing the defendants and the Fashion Cafe were unanswered yesterday.
Tommaso and Francesco Buti are each charged with 35 counts of wire fraud, 14 counts of stolen property transportation, 1 count of money laundering and 1 count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to transport stolen property in interstate and foreign commerce. If convicted, they could face fines and prison terms of 5 to 20 years on each count.
The indictment did not name any of the investors involved, or state the exact amount of money lost by investors as a result of the Butis' schemes, but the document said the Butis made multiple transactions in excess of $10,000, which ultimately transferred more than $10.1 million into accounts in their names or into companies they controlled.
The indictments were not the first trouble for the restaurant chain. In 1998, tax agents issued warrants against the New York cafe for failing to pay taxes for months, forcing the restaurant to cough up immediate payments or face seizure.
The State Labor Department had also filed liens against the cafe for failing to pay premiums on unemployment insurance for its help. Legal action was also taken to collect back rent and utility fees owed the cafe's landlord, Rockefeller Center.
Tommaso Buti made news about that time for renting a $25,000-a-month former Olympic Towers apartment of the Gucci family on a 10-year lease. He also threw himself a model-studded birthday party at the trendy nightspot Nell's at a cost of more than $20,000, friends told The New York Times in February 1998.
At least one supermodel "partner," Christy Turlington, left the Fashion Cafe enterprise in 1998.
Other models -- Naomi Campbell, Elle MacPherson and Claudia Schiffer -- helped market the restaurant, but were not official partners or owners. The three were promised shares of profits for each appearance at openings of the New York and London cafes, and of franchised cafes in South Africa, Mexico City and Barcelona, Spain, court records indicate.
The Fashion Cafe in Rockefeller Center closed in 1998.

HEADLINE: Courthouse That Tweed Built Seeks to Shed Notorious Past

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Call it the Ghost of Tweed.
Or, more specifically, the Ghost of the Tweed Courthouse, a somewhat forgotten building in Lower Manhattan that may well be the finest brick-and-mortar testament to public corruption in all of America. Its construction, its disrepair -- its mere presence -- have vexed mayoral administrations since the days of the man who helped to build it: once the grand sachem of Tammany Hall and forever the archetypal political boss, William M. Tweed. 
 Back in 1871, the swirl of swindles that enveloped the building's sporadic, often sloppy construction contributed to Tweed's downfall. Today, the building at 52 Chambers Street -- long the naughty, neglected sibling of majestic City Hall, just a few yards away -- is being carefully restored by the Giuliani administration, which received considerable acclaim last year for the nearly $30 million renovation of City Hall Park.
It is a worthy venture, according to Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University who is the editor of The Encyclopedia of New York City.
"I take people down there, and what I say is that this is the physical manifestation of an American municipal crisis," he said.
But the restoration is expected to cost taxpayers at least $89 million, considerably more than originally estimated, and city officials have yet to decide what to do with the place once the job is done. Meanwhile, workers digging in front of the building recently stumbled upon eight graves that probably date from the Colonial era.
The public works project has become enough of a touchy matter that all involved, from the administration to the city's Economic Development Corporation to the architectural firm overseeing the restoration, refuse to discuss it; it is a level of silence unusual even for this tight-lipped administration.
A year ago, Newsday reported that the estimate had grown to $80 million from nearly $35 million in June 1996, partly because the building was in worse shape than anticipated. By last July, the cap was reset at $85 million, according to a memorandum signed by Deputy Mayor Robert M. Harding, one of four deputy mayors who declined to return calls seeking comment.
And by October, the cost had climbed to $89 million, according to figures provided to the City Council by the mayor's office, which declined several requests for elucidation on the project.
With more than $30 million already spent on the restoration or allocated to it, city officials have not quite figured out what to do with the handsome and historic building. At the moment, they are considering various practical options, including a visitors' center, a museum gallery, a restaurant, perhaps even a charter school. Public officials who deal with the administration say the hope is to have something to announce in time for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's final State of the City address in January.
Among those contacted by the city in its quest to find a purpose for the building was the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, which offers lectures and seminars and is currently helping to underwrite two history-centered public schools in New York. Its founders are two philanthropists: Richard Gilder, who in 1998 donated $25,000 to the School Choice Now Political Action Committee, which promotes charter schools, and Lewis E. Lehrman, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor in 1982.
Lesley S. Herrmann, the institute's executive director, said that several months ago, the city expressed an interest in opening a public school in the courthouse. "I wish I could tell you it's a done deal," Dr. Herrmann said. "We've been talked to, but quite probably 100 other people have been talked to as well."
The information blackout is peculiar, given the reports of those who have been invited inside to marvel at the work-in-progress. "It's a superb restoration, one of the most significant restorations in the country," said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. "What I've seen of it is glorious."
Then again, the building christened the New York County Courthouse long ago assumed the name of the man credited, probably unfairly, with a comment that seemed to capture a certain approach to government: What are you going to do about it?
By the late 1860's, Tweed was the boss of the city, reigning from the opulently appointed headquarters on East 14th Street known as Tammany Hall. A coarse but brilliant man who often sported a diamond in the shirt draped over his huge stomach, he orchestrated elections, controlled the mayor and made sure that the Tammany faithful were well rewarded for the often questionable services they provided.
Their primary sources of income flowed from the bribes and kickbacks that had become an accepted way of securing public works contracts. And the choicest example of that practice was the construction of the New York County Courthouse, principally designed by John Kellum and begun in 1861 on the site of a former almshouse; many of its sick and poor tenants were buried in and around what is now City Hall Park.
Officially, the city wound up spending nearly $13 million -- roughly $178 million in today's dollars -- on a building that should have cost several times less, although many historians estimate that tens of millions of dollars more changed hands. Its construction cost nearly twice as much as the purchase of Alaska in 1867.
The corruption was breathtaking in its breadth and baldness. Nearly every major contractor was submitting fraudulent bills for work that was never done, sometimes in the names of people who did not exist.
Tweed was profiting in myriad ways, including his financial interest in the Massachusetts quarry providing some of the courthouse marble. When a committee was assigned to determine why construction was taking so long, it spent $7,718 (roughly $105,000 today) on printing its lightning-quick findings that everything was aboveboard; the printing company, of course, was owned by Tweed.
A carpenter was paid $360,751 ($4.9 million) for one month's labor in a building with little woodwork. A furniture contractor received $179,729 ($2.5 million) for three tables and 40 chairs. And the plasterer, a Tammany functionary named Andrew J. Garvey, got $133,187 ($1.82 million) for two days' work; his business acumen earned him the sobriquet the Prince of Plasterers.
In July 1871, two low-level city officials with a grudge against the Tweed ring provided The New York Times with reams of documentation that detailed the corruption at the courthouse and other city projects.
The newspaper published a string of articles, teasing out the details day by day before publishing a special supplement, in both English and German.
Those articles, coupled with the political cartoons of Thomas Nast in Harper's Weekly, created a national outcry, and soon Tweed and many of his cronies were facing criminal charges and political oblivion.
But there was still the nettlesome matter of the unfinished courthouse, whose builders and suppliers were fleeing to Europe, hiring lawyers or trying to cut deals with prosecutors. After several years of inaction, work was finally resumed and the building opened in 1880, nearly 20 years after ground had been broken.
By then, the courthouse had become a looming symbol of public betrayal.
"The whole atmosphere is corrupt," said George C. Barrett, a reformer from that time. "You look up at its ceilings and find gaudy decorations; you wonder which is the greatest, the vulgarity or the corruptness of the place."
Such visceral reactions blinded people to the building's merits, according to several historians and architects. They say the building is a striking 19th-century structure, with marble walls, a Corinthian portico and a beautiful skylight rotunda.
"In the end, the Tweed Courthouse is a good building," said Mary Dierickx, a preservations consultant. "A lot of corruption went on, but it's not all that bad, as far as the courthouse went."
Dr. Jackson agreed. "It may have cost four times what it should have," he said, "but it's still a grand public building."
Among those not especially taken with the building's aesthetics were the city's Democrats, who saw in its every nook a reminder of their party's shameful past. For most of the 20th century, up until 1974, it was slated for demolition to make room for a civic center, but outraged preservationists made sure the wrecking ball never swung. After years as a county courthouse and then a city courthouse, it became a haven for various city agencies and the municipal archives, albeit one sliding ever deeper into disrepair.
In the early 1980's, the Koch administration paid for some extensive repairs. ("It is a jewel of a building," Edward I. Koch, the former mayor, said recently.) So did the Dinkins administration in the early 1990's. Then came Mr. Giuliani's turn.
For well more than a year now, the building has been surrounded by scaffolding. A few weeks ago, workers running utility lines into the building came across what forensic archaeologists determined were eight graves, probably from a burial ground for the almshouse that once stood on the site. The graves were protected and the lines rerouted; the work continued.
"We decided to let them rest in peace," explained Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the City Landmarks Preservation Commission.
But more than scaffolding surrounds the Tweed Courthouse; mystery does, too. In budget records, it is referred to as a "visitors' center." In a document from the Economic Development Corporation -- the agency, controlled by the Giuliani administration, that is overseeing the project -- it is referred to as the "Gateway New York" project.
"We're all scratching our heads about it," said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for the City Council.
City officials normally refuse to discuss the public's business only when it touches on matters of privacy. But William M. Tweed, broken in spirit and in body, died in prison in 1878, taking with him any expectation of privacy.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Global Effort to Make Machines That Make Chips

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A decade ago, when a Japanese company sought to acquire a Silicon Valley operation making crucial equipment for semiconductor manufacturing, the prospect was treated in this country as a threat to national security. Chip industry executives and politicians feared that the sale would touch off a chain of events ending an era of American technological supremacy.
Now those fears have all but vanished. And a growing number of industry executives say the most important lesson is not the threat of overseas competition, but the value of international cooperation. 
 The reason is a practical one: it will require almost $1 billion to develop the essential technology for the next generation of chip-making equipment. And with fears of Japanese domination having abated, the United States government is underwriting less and less of the underlying research. So chip makers say continuing advances are now beyond the grasp of Americans alone.
Indeed, an alliance of American, Dutch and German chip makers is expected to reach a milestone in April when they switch on a futuristic chip-making machine able to etch circuit lines no more than several hundred atoms across. It is a commercial engineering challenge -- and an international collaboration -- on a scale rare if not unequaled in any other industry.
"The semiconductor industry has been unique in pursuing this form of global cooperation," said Ulrich Schumacher, president and chief executive of the German participant, Infineon Technologies. "It's because our costs are brutally high."
The privately financed cooperative effort is being conducted in national laboratories better known for their work on the American nuclear arsenal. It harnesses optical technologies involving highly reflective mirrors and high-powered laser light sources borrowed from research done as part of a missile-defense program known as Star Wars.
If the researchers succeed, the resulting chip-fabrication plants -- which themselves will cost $1 billion to $2 billion apiece -- will be able to produce chips for myriad applications that will be 100 times as fast as those in use today, with 100 times the storage capacity.
While the burden of developing chip technologies has brought a trend toward global cooperation, it has also led to the emergence of new players in the race to build state-of-the-art computer chips. In the last decade, the semiconductor industry has expanded significantly with aggressive new chip makers emerging in Taiwan, Korea and Europe.
The globalization of the industry is accelerating partly part because other regions are adopting gadgets like cell phones and wireless digital devices at a faster rate than the United States is. But the role of American chip makers in sharing and transferring technology has also been a factor. I.B.M., for example, rather than bear the cost of research and development on memory chips by itself, entered into a venture with Infineon, and the partnership was instrumental in helping make Infineon a world leader in memory technology.
And though the result has indeed been a dilution of American leadership in the chip industry, there has been almost no evidence of the anxiety that shaped a national debate on industrial policy in the United States a decade ago.
"There was a concern in Washington that this had to be a U.S.-only technology, and we've been working hard to explain to them that this has to be an international technology," said Charles W. Gwyn, program director of the American-European consortium working on the next generation of chip making gear. In 1999 global sales of the semiconductor equipment industry were $28.6 billion and worldwide chip sales reached $149 billion. Growth rates for chip production and chip-equipment purchases in Europe, Korea and Taiwan indicate that those regions are rapidly gaining on Japan and the United States, particularly in the most advanced memory chips -- widely used in the most popular consumer products, from desktop PC's to digital music players -- and in state-of-the-art factories.
Today three European chip makers -- Infineon, ST Microelectronics and Royal Philips -- are among the world's 10 leading chip makers. Meanwhile, a decade after the Japanese had come to dominate the memory-chip industry and were threatening to overtake the United States in microprocessors, they are now being outpaced, in part because they have tried to go it alone rather than cooperate in research and development, Mr. Schumacher said.
"They thought it was about controlling the technology," he said.
The shift toward collaboration can be seen most clearly here in the Bay Area, where the privately financed international effort to design the next generation of chip-making gear is under way at three national laboratories, Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Sandia California.
Infineon of Germany, ASM Lithography of the Netherlands and three American chip makers -- Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Motorola -- are underwriting the initiative, which involves an exotic new technology known as extreme ultraviolet lithography, or E.U.V.. The research is considered crucial to continuing advances in the semiconductor industry beyond 2004, when current technology is expected to reach its limits in etching ever-smaller circuits on silicon.
When Robert Noyce, co-inventor of the silicon chip, set out four decades ago to build one of the first chip-making machines, he drove to a photographic supply house in search of an inexpensive, used camera lens for his new machine.
In contrast, the new machines, called steppers, are custom-made devices of the highest order. They are based on a laser-generated light source at wavelengths far shorter than those used today. And they require engineering feats, like the ability to create a machine that can send light through a vacuum -- and one that moves fast but produces no vibration.
The consortium researchers acknowledge that they still have thorny technical problems to solve. And I.B.M. and Lucent Technologies are pursuing an alternative direction, using ultrashort-wavelength X-rays to etch the circuits, instead of light.
But the Semiconductor Industry Association points to E.U.V. as the more promising technology, and the confidence of the California-based researchers has been growing in recent months. Their approach is expected to lead to a prototype machine by April. If all goes well, such machines will be producing chips commercially within five years.
The company that figures to bring the technology to market is, in fact, the Silicon Valley Group, the outfit that caused a furor when it was coveted by Nikon of Japan a decade ago. At the time it was the lithographic division of Perkin Elmer; I.B.M. ultimately stepped in to ensure that it stayed in American hands. But after further changes in ownership, it was recently sold to ASM.
At the same time, Japan is independently pursuing the E.U.V. technology in a government-financed consortium. Whichever team arrives there first, it appears likely that for the first time there will not be an independent American-owned maker of the most advanced chip-making machines.
Today the new landscape is being hailed by many in the computer industry as a major step toward a borderless world in which economic and technical interdependence are the hallmark of a global economy.
But some American officials remain concerned that while government-financed consortiums in Japan and Europe are continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new technology, United States government money for research in semiconductor making is dwindling.
In the early 90's, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was spending more than $300 million a year to develop new semiconductor capabilities, in part to ensure that the Pentagon would not have to turn to foreign suppliers for its own needs. With such concerns fading, that outlay is now $55 million a year, and is to be phased out by 2005.
"The United States programs in basic research are a lot smaller than the Japanese or European efforts," said Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, the leading American maker of chips. "But people here are riding high and so there just isn't a great deal of concern right now."
There is another, more fundamental reason there has been no political outcry about the new globalization of the chip field, according to many industry executives.
The rapid internationalization of the industry has made it possible for large and small American companies to take advantage of the low and subsidized cost of capital in countries like Taiwan and South Korea.

HEADLINE: Canada Gets Approval to Impose Trade Sanctions Against Brazil

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Canada won approval today from the World Trade Organization to impose $233.5 million annually in sanctions against Brazil in a dispute over aircraft export subsidies.
The organization's dispute settlement body gave its automatic endorsement to Canada's request, following five findings in recent years that Brazil's financial support for its medium-range passenger jets violated global free trade rules. 
 Canada's spokesman said today, however, that Ottawa had yet to decide when to impose the sanctions, or to draw up a list of what goods would be selected for higher import tariffs. Brazil is Canada's second-largest Latin American trading partner, after Mexico. Brazil's principal exports to Canada include concentrated and frozen fruit juices, steel products, iron ore, textiles and footwear.
Canada and Brazil have been negotiating the dispute for five years, and Brazil could still agree to pay compensation instead of accepting sanctions.
Canada maintains, however, that it can impose the hefty amount for as long as six years unless Brazil overhauls its regional jet subsidies. If that were to happen, a possibility that trade experts consider unlikely, it would bring the total to $1.4 billion in sanctions, the second-largest amount after the $4 billion annually the European Union is seeking from the United States in a dispute over the American foreign sales corporation tax program.
Each country is competing for the medium-range passenger jet market. Canada's entry is the Bombardier, and Brazil makes the Embraer. In 1996, Canada challenged Brazil's subsidies as illegal, and an initial W.T.O. ruling found both countries flouted global trade rules. The group told them to end their subsidy programs. Later, Canada's program was found in compliance.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Between a Rock and a Hard Place

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, West Bank

 BODY:
The Nassar Investment Company, the Palestinian economy's biggest exporter, had an urgent $100,000 order from a prized new client. Eight containers of limestone blocks were loaded on its own trucks, bound for a luxury condominium complex in South Korea.
There was a slight delivery hang-up, however. 
 The problem was not the daily gun-battles raging a few miles north, west and south of the stone-cutting complex. The drivers knew when and how to avoid these flash points.
Nor was the issue a ban on Palestinian vehicles on Israeli roads. The trucks were all licensed in Israel and driven by Israelis to minimize delays en route to Israeli ports, the only feasible shipping outlet.
Nassar was facing different, quite literal obstacles: the Israeli army, to keep Palestinians in and Israelis out of Bethlehem, had installed concrete roadblocks on main roads around the city. And across dirt tracks that Palestinians used to bypass the bulwarks, the army had heaped mounds of rocks and earth.
"We had a ship calling at Haifa the next day, our only opportunity to make the delivery," said Samir Huleileh, the sales manager. "The Koreans want the product on time, period. They don't care who is fighting whom."
So in the middle of the night, a Nassar bulldozer stole up one of Bethlehem's back roads and scraped away the army's earthworks. The trucks rumbled through, and were soon on the highway to Haifa.
The bulldozer then pushed the dirt back.
"We built it again the way that it was, so they wouldn't notice," Mr. Huleileh said. "I suppose we were taking a risk of getting shot, but we really had no choice."
These were not the kind of nontariff barriers that preoccupied Mr. Huleileh when he negotiated trade pacts with Israeli six years ago.
An economist who was a top aide to Yasir Arafat, he helped to hammer out financial and commercial arrangements between Israel and the then-new Palestinian Authority. At the deal's heart was a customs union and internal free trade area, with Palestinians getting access to the world through Israeli seaports, air terminals and border posts.
But now, after working for three years as a business executive, the last two months amid civil turmoil and military siege, Mr. Huleileh fears those arrangements may be irreparably broken.
And he worries about his company's ability to land the high-profile contracts that have put its stone in projects from the Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan to the reconstruction of the earthquake-damaged San Francesco church in Assisi, Italy.
By United Nations estimates, the Israeli clampdown on the movement of goods and people in and out of the Palestinian territories has cost the Palestinian economy more than $500 million in lost sales and wages -- one-tenth of the Palestinians' projected gross domestic product for the year. Unemployment has tripled since September. Most local industries are paralyzed by import and export restrictions and a drastic drop in domestic demand -- the inevitable consequence, Israel contends, of rioting and attacks against Israeli military posts and settlements.
"No matter what agreements you reach with them, everything can be overruled as a security issue," Mr. Huleileh said. "It is nonnegotiable. You can't even discuss it."
For all his frustration with Israel, Mr. Huleileh seems almost equally vexed at the Palestinian Authority's trade and finance ministries.
Rather than seek alternative markets and credit lines for Palestinian exporters, he says, officials are preoccupied with plans for a boycott of Israeli imports. "What does this do for us?" he asks.
Most irksome of all to Mr. Huleileh is what he sees as the authority's reluctance to press Arab countries to grant Palestinian goods the same duty-free status they have in North America and Western Europe. Most Arab nations sent food and medical supplies to the Palestinians in recent weeks, and several, led by Saudi Arabia, pledged substantial long-term financial aid. But Syria, Iraq and most Persian Gulf states will not let in Palestinian products, on the ground they include some Israeli content.
Egypt, which Mr. Huleileh says could provide the best alternative to Israeli sales and seaports, imposes steep tariffs on most Palestinian goods, including cut limestone, he complains.
Hewn hard limestone is no small matter in the West Bank, accounting for most nonagricultural exports.
Scores of small quarries and stone-cutting shops dot the rocky corridor between Bethlehem and Hebron. Nassar, a family-owned business founded 15 years ago, is by far the most profitable and ambitious, with 250 skilled workers and an $8 million array of Carborundum saws and polishing machines.
Selling its trademark Jerusalem Stone on five continents, Nassar is one of the few Palestinian companies still able to make payroll without major layoffs. With its raw material coming from local quarries it owns or controls -- the company keeps a three-year inventory of limestone blocks in a pit -- it is relatively insulated from Israeli supply cutoffs. And its $25 million a year in foreign sales has given it the cash it needs to keep going in hard times. Even sympathetic Arab bankers are reluctant to extend credit to West Bank businesses these days.
Producing 10 million square feet of stone slabs each year, Nassar is determined to keep its place as the biggest stone producer in the Middle East. To expedite access to Arab markets and circumvent Israeli export controls, the company opened a stoneworks in Jordan.
What the company cannot afford to do, Mr. Huleileh says, is blame local violence for delays, because he expects those problems to continue. The company air-freighted stone to a San Diego airport project when Israeli closures made it miss a merchant shipping deadline.
"We would do it again, even though we lost money," he said. "I look at the Lebanese, who somehow learned how to work and live as normally as possible in times of incredible crisis. Beirut may not seem like a place to emulate, but they are my role models."

HEADLINE: Foie Gras and Short Ribs: Harlem's Rich New Menu

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
A TICKLE of excitement passes through New York's partying crowd when an 18,000-square-foot restaurant like Jimmy's Uptown gets ready to open. Even before it welcomed its first paying customer the day after Thanksgiving, fashion magazines had stopped by for photos and parties, the New York Knicks had staged a celebration there and Woody Allen had given a party for his cast and crew after wrapping a production. Business as usual for any high-budget new restaurant wanting to zoom into its opening on a jet of publicity? Perhaps.
But Jimmy's is in the center of Harlem, in a blocky white two-story building at Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and 130th Street. Across the street is a somber housing project, but Jimmy's is a sleek world of white, yellow and purple, filled with onyx, mahogany and custom-made chairs imported from Italy and covered in baby-soft leather, with a menu of Hudson Valley foie gras and short ribs braised in cabernet sauvignon and a 75-bottle wine list. 
 Jimmy's may be making the biggest splash in Harlem, but other new restaurants are struggling up from among the old-time fast-food shacks and after-church retreats. This new wave began a couple of years ago with several places that tried to update the fluorescent, threadbare image of restaurants in the neighborhood as Harlem tentatively joined the economic revival that has driven up the price of real estate almost everywhere in Manhattan. For the most part, these are not like the restaurants of Smith Street in Brooklyn, where ambitious young chefs, fleeing Manhattan real estate prices, have established a world of up-to-the-minute culinary ideas for a hungry market of former Manhattanites. Jimmy's aside, Harlem's new restaurants exert a home-grown charm aimed mostly at Harlem's longtime residents, staying true to Southern and Caribbean themes.
The most significant of the new restaurants, in culinary terms, is Bayou, a handsome second-floor spot that opened on Lenox Avenue this year and serves perhaps the most authentic Creole food in New York. Its brick walls and brass lamps look like those in countless other bars and grills in other parts of the city, but in Harlem, Bayou is in the vanguard of inviting designs. The real attraction, though, is the food -- dishes like sherry-laced turtle soup and crayfish etoufee that draw a diverse crowd from all over New York as well as local politicians and business types.
Cafe Largo, which opened in 1998 on the largely Hispanic western edge of Harlem, also broke the Harlem design mold with its warm brick walls and pressed tin ceiling. Its lively crowd, including new Harlemites and students from the City University of New York, go there for pastas and well-executed Hispanic dishes, like chunks of boneless chicken with yellow rice, made piquant by pickled peppers, olives and bay leaves.
Sugar Shack, a lounge and restaurant that opened in 1998, is another young Harlem veteran. With a low-key, jazzy vibe that echoes its plush red and black colors, Sugar Shack attracts a well-dressed crowd of local professionals who stop there for the nightly music and poetry performances as well as the food, which, truth be told, strays little from the standard Harlem formula of fried chicken, shrimp and collard greens.
"It's changed drastically," said Odell Holland, owner of the Sugar Shack. "When I first opened everyone thought I was crazy."
For longtime residents, the new arrivals not only expand the choices but can make life easier. "I have lots of visitors, and I think it's great I don't have to take them downtown for brunch," said Sydney Kai Inis, who has lived in Harlem for 20 years and owns One Good Thing, an arts and collectibles shop on Lenox Avenue.
Amy Ruth's, which opened a year ago serving standout Southern dishes, is already expanding, while Norma Jean Darden, the caterer and cookbook author who serves classic Southern dishes at Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too on 110th Street, opened the bigger and more inviting Miss Maude's Spoonbread Too this year at Lenox Avenue and 137th Street. Even old-style Harlem establishments are doing well. Charles's Southern-Style Kitchen, which serves maybe the best fried chicken in New York, now has an all-day breakfast outlet on Frederick Douglass Boulevard near 151st Street.
What you won't find in Harlem, so far, is a diversity of cuisine. Italian, Japanese and Indian restaurants have so far not made the trek. Even Jimmy's, whose chef, Linda Japngie, cooked at Bouley Bakery, La Caravelle and the Mark, has interspersed its menu with dishes like horseradish grits, mustard greens, corn bread croutons and plantain bread pudding.
While these new places have created a bustle within Harlem, Jimmy's, which can seat 400 to 500 people in downtown splendor, and several more ambitious restaurants that are scheduled to open in the next few months are inspiring the ready-made cliche about a second Harlem Renaissance. Sugar Hill Bistro, in a 100-year-old Victorian-style town house on 145th Street near Harlem Hospital, will serve refined Southern dishes, while Mongoose Bar and Grill, on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard near 135th Street, will have a menu that its owner, Leon Ellis, calls quasi-Italian.
"It's economic development," said Jimmy Rodriguez, a bearish, soft-spoken man in a black goatee and a Gucci suit who also owns Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, a glittery hangout near Yankee Stadium, and is planning to open Jimmy's Downtown on East 57th Street. "Retailers are realizing the great potential of income that can be made. The perception that you can't go to Harlem, that it isn't safe, is no longer there."
Harlem, of course, has perennially been touted as the next great neighborhood for real estate, a hope that has just as perennially fallen short, and the obstacles facing new restaurants may be just as daunting. Established investors and restaurateurs alike are leery of the unproven market, while the specter of an economic downturn is almost too much to contemplate. Any number of cautionary tales can be trotted out to discourage would-be restaurateurs.
For years people have been trying to revive Minton's Playhouse, at 118th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, a 10,000-square-foot tribute to Harlem's heyday that would include a restaurant, a lounge and a jazz club. Restaurateurs as well known as Drew Nieporent have dropped out of the project because of difficulty getting financing. When it finally looked last summer as if construction on Minton's would get under way, the principal investor, Kevin Ingram, a Wall Street executive who had no experience in the restaurant business, pulled out at the last minute.
"Opening any restaurant takes a lot of money," said Jerri Banks, a food and wine consultant who worked on the Minton's project. "Many people have wanted Harlem to take its place as an entertainment and dining mecca, as it once was, but a restaurant is a basic business, and you have to know you're going to have a return. It's hard to open a restaurant as a social experiment, particularly on that level."
Apart from Jimmy's, which Mr. Rodriguez managed to finance privately, many of Harlem's new restaurants are helped considerably by the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development agency that gives low-interest loans and special training to small businesses.
"We're underserved, and we want to increase the standard and variety of cuisine in the community," said Terry C. Lane, the agency's head. "Bayou is the classic example of that: a different cuisine than soul food that is extremely successful. It brings diversity to the area. I think Mongoose and Sugar Hill Bistro will do the same thing."
That may be, but the going has not been easy for Sugar Hill Bistro or its guiding force, Dr. Michael Jones, a surgeon who has lived in Sugar Hill for 13 years and has tried to recruit colleagues to move to Harlem, only to be asked, "Where do we eat?"
Dr. Jones said that he and his partners, who also live in the neighborhood, were unable to get loans from banks because they had no restaurant experience. So they pooled their own money and got a $300,000 loan from the empowerment zone. "The biggest attractions in the neighborhood are the homes, so we purchased this landmark house, renovated it and are opening it as a restaurant," he said.
"The concept is Southern American plantation cuisine, not glorifying the scraps like soul food but the food at the plantation table," Dr. Jones said.
To succeed, Sugar Hill will have to attract diners from other parts of the city as well as the tourist buses that unload their passengers at Sylvia's. "Clearly, there's been an influx of people buying houses of over a half-million dollars in the neighborhood, but it's not enough to sustain us," Dr. Jones said. "We hope to be a destination spot that will not only glorify Harlem, but Sugar Hill and Hamilton Heights."
Not every new restaurant in Harlem is that ambitious. Marc Calcano, who opened Cafe Largo, is a former police officer who still lives in the building he grew up in, around the block from the restaurant, his first. He said his goal was simply to serve the people in the community, and on a recent Saturday afternoon, the dining room, with its bistro look, was bustling with couples and groups of friends sipping bloody marys and mimosas with brunch.
"We don't pretend to be cuisine experts," Mr. Calcano said. "We offer a dining experience for a community that hasn't had something like this. You have a lot of diners, but you don't have a place for families to sit down and relax, at least not on Broadway."
Bayou's owner, Michael Eberstadt, is not a cuisine expert, either. He worked in social services and had no connection to Harlem when he opened his first enterprise, Slice of Harlem, a pizza place at 135th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, in 1998. "I wanted to open a business in an inner city and create jobs that way," Mr. Eberstadt said. "I didn't care if I was selling pizza or selling shoes, but business was great."
This year he opened a second Slice on Lenox Avenue and then Bayou on the second floor above the new Slice.
Mr. Eberstadt had noticed that few restaurants in Harlem would deliver food, and he capitalized on that in his pizza business. Later, before opening Bayou, he walked the streets observing traffic patterns before settling on his Lenox Avenue site, not far from Sylvia's. Perhaps his biggest coup was finding Steve Manning, an experienced chef from Clancy's in New Orleans, who just happened to be resettling in New York. Mr. Manning has easily navigated the tricky New York waters, avoiding cliched blackened dishes while giving Bayou the feeling of a true Louisiana outpost.
So far, Jimmy's appears to be drawing the celebrities and corporate events it needs to build an uptown buzz. It has luxuries like platters of oysters in a raw bar and a more clubby bar and lounge upstairs, even a roof garden where tropical drinks can be served in warmer weather. Other restaurants are going to have to rely on the conventional foundation of foot traffic and visibility. When Mr. Ellis of Mongoose opened his first restaurant, Emily's, at Fifth Avenue and 111th Street eight years ago, it struggled to attract patrons. "We were a trailblazer, and you have to hang around until the patrons come in," he said.
He says Emily's has done better recently as downtown customers have felt more comfortable with the neighborhood. Still, it has irked him that many outsiders still feel that going to Harlem is an adventure. Nothing would make Mr. Ellis happier than for the sense of novelty to wear off.
"When a person comes to a place in Harlem, it should be like going to anyplace in the city," Mr. Ellis said. "Not, 'I went to a restaurant in Harlem,' just, 'I went to a restaurant.' "
 
Big Welcomes, Bold Tastes
OF the restaurants that have opened in Harlem in the last couple of years, these are among the most appealing:
AMY RUTH'S -- 113 West 116th Street; (212) 280-8779. This attractive little place, soon to expand, offers Southern dishes that are up to date yet honor tradition. Waffles (whole grain with real maple syrup) and salmon croquettes are the stars at breakfast, while tender short ribs and spicy shrimp over rice lead the procession of dinner dishes.
BAYOU -- 308 Lenox Avenue, near 125th Street; (212) 426-3800. One taste of the exceptional turtle soup here, thick with bits of turtle meat and smoky andouille sausage, and you know that the chef, Steve Manning, is a fine New Orleans hand. His 10 years of experience in New Orleans also show in dishes like snapper Alexandria, sprinkled with roasted pecans and drenched with lemon butter, and his own delicious invention, fried oysters and spinach with melted Brie.
CAFE LARGO -- 3387 Broadway, near 137th Street; (212) 862-8142. This welcoming cafe is a respite from the diners and takeout places on Broadway. The menu breaks little ground, but the dishes, whether chunky sopa de pollo, grilled skirt steak or piquant chicken and rice, are generally well executed and occasionally superb.
JIMMY'S UPTOWN -- 2207 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, near 130th Street; (212) 491-4000. Jimmy's ambitious menu stays true to Southern and Caribbean themes while passing them through the refining prism of French techniques. In its early days, the kitchen has been erratic, but highlights include meaty crab and corn fritters, a fresh and attractive seasonal salad, tender short ribs braised in red wine and pork tenderloin with sweet-plantain bread pudding.
MISS MAUDE'S SPOONBREAD TOO -- 547 Lenox Avenue, near 137th Street; (212) 690-3100. The dining room is bright and cheery, and Southern favorites like smothered pork chops and fried shrimp are done exceedingly well. ERIC ASIMOV

HEADLINE: Scarce Slots? Hold an Auction

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, served as chief economist for the Civil Aeronautics Board from 1978 to 1980.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
In April, Congress passed a law intended to stimulate competition at La Guardia Airport and increase service to small communities. In response, the Federal Aviation Administration substantially increased the number of flights allowed to operate at La Guardia, already one of the nation's busiest airports.
Unfortunately, La Guardia simply couldn't handle the new traffic. Something had to be done, and a week ago, the F.A.A. rolled back the number of daily flights to pre-April levels. Then it held a lottery for operating slots that gave preference to nine small airlines. 
 Reducing operating slots in this way clearly ameliorates crowding. But it does so in a wasteful way, one that guarantees continued unfairness and frustration for area travelers.
Slots at crowded airports are a valuable economic resource, much like scarce seats on an oversold flight. History has taught us a valuable lesson about how best to allocate seats on oversold flights, one with a message for the problem of crowded airports.
Carriers once handled oversold flights on a first-come, first-served basis. If 120 passengers presented tickets for a flight with 100 seats, only the first 100 got to go. For passengers coming from connecting flights, this was like a lottery. If your connecting flight was late, you got bumped.
This solution never considered that individuals have different needs. People with urgent schedules were often forced to wait, while those less pressed made their flights.
Parallel issues arise with overcrowded airports. Just as a plane can accommodate only so many passengers, an airport can handle only so many operations. So every time a 19-seat Beechcraft 1900 uses La Guardia, the F.A.A. must deny permission to some larger plane -- say, a Boeing 757 with several hundred passengers. Today, even among carriers currently authorized to use La Guardia, delays and flight cancellations are legion. More important, a host of carriers would like to provide large-aircraft service to La Guardia but are not authorized to use the airport at all. That means some travelers have to use less convenient airports, just as someone has to wait when flights are oversold. In both cases we have a strong interest in minimizing total inconvenience.
On this score, the La Guardia lottery is even worse than first-come, first-served. Not only does it make no attempt to minimize the number of diverted passengers, but it actively increases their number by setting aside special slot allocations for carriers that serve small communities with small aircraft.
There are better ways to solve both problems. In 1979, the Civil Aeronautics Board called for carriers to offer cash payments, free tickets or other rewards to induce volunteers to relinquish their seats on oversold flights. Passengers could decide for themselves how important it was to avoid waiting. Those with pressing business simply wouldn't volunteer. The board's proposal was adopted and soon became widely recognized as both more fair and more efficient than the earlier system.
Scarce operating slots at La Guardia can be allocated in essentially the same way. Rather than give them away by lottery, the F.A.A. could sell them to the highest-bidding airlines. If the market value of a slot were, say, $5,000, carriers would have to charge travelers on a 20-passenger flight $250 more for a one-way ticket, while those on a 200-passenger flight would have to pay only $25 extra. Passengers on small flights would thus have a strong incentive to divert to less crowded times or less crowded airports.
For oversold flights, the auction solution works because it gives people an incentive not to use a scarce seat unless its value is high to them. Similarly, auctioning operating slots at crowded airports creates an incentive to use those airports only if the value of doing so is high.
Granted, this doesn't do much for passengers from Ames, Iowa, who want to visit New York City. But they can still fly to nearby airports, especially in Westchester or Long Island. And if aviation authorities really wanted to help the citizens of small communities, they could sell scarce slots to the highest bidders, then give cash compensation to those communities that suffered as a result.
Even if such compensation is impractical, we should bite the bullet and realize that the best way of minimizing the inconvenience we impose on air travelers is to charge handsomely for the convenience of landing at La Guardia.

HEADLINE: Yes, It's About Money

BYLINE: By Andrew Zimbalist; Andrew Zimbalist is a professor of economics at Smith College and author of "Baseball and Billions."

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
Alex Rodriguez, the 25-year-old all-star shortstop, this week signed a contract with the Texas Rangers that will make him the highest-paid player in the history of sports. The contract -- for $252 million over 10 years -- has drawn harsh criticism as an example of the runaway spending that is ruining the sport.
Yes, the deal is extravagant. Two years ago Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner, bought the team, along with the lease on the stadium near Dallas and options on about 200 acres of surrounding land, for $250 million. Is Rodriguez worth more than the team? Crazy as it seems, he almost is. 
 Hicks is a crafty businessman. The contract itself isn't quite as high as it sounds: it includes long-term deferred money that reduces its net present value to $180 million. But, more fundamentally, Hicks is betting that Rodriguez will help fill his 49,000-seat stadium, allowing him to raise ticket prices, sell more concessions, increase parking revenue, and so on.
And there's a kicker. Hicks wants to sell the right to name the ballpark, and he is developing the surrounding acreage. If Rodriguez brings a championship, Hicks's payoff comes in the form of tens, if not hundreds, of millions of additional dollars in real estate and advertising value.
Like any good capitalist, Hicks is attempting to maximize his profits. He expects that Rodriguez alone will produce well over $25 million a year in value for all his investments. There are no guarantees, of course. Should Rodriguez be injured, his guaranteed contract will leave Hicks hurting. And should Rodriguez stay healthy, Hicks still needs to find some way to strengthen a pitching staff with one of the worst earned-run averages in the American League last year. Can Rodriguez pitch, too?
While Hicks's deal with Rodriguez might make sense for the Rangers, it may not make sense for Major League Baseball. The imbalances in the revenues of baseball's haves and have-nots have grown acute over the last decade. The top- and bottom-earning teams were $30 million apart in 1989; in 1999, the spread was more than $160 million. Since 1995, out of 189 post-season games, only three have been won by teams with payrolls in the bottom half.
Unlike typical businesses, baseball needs balanced competition. That is not to say that all teams should be equal in their resources and their ability to win games: the most successful league would have the big cities' teams win most often because they lift the television ratings the most.
But it's not healthy for the sport to be dominated only by the richest teams. When the biggest city's team wins the championship four of five years, and begins to play its crosstown rival for the championship, as happened in the Subway Series, inequality has gone too far. Too many Americans, feeling left out, will yawn and turn away.

HEADLINE: Compaq Sees Weak Results This Quarter

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
In another sign of weakness in the personal computer business, Compaq Computer said today that its sales and profits in the fourth quarter would be lower than expected.
Compaq said it would post sales of $11.2 billion to $11.4 billion, up 7 percent from a year ago, but nearly 10 percent below its earlier expectations. It forecast that its profit from continuing operations would be 28 to 30 cents a share, below the 36 cents Wall Street had expected. 
 In recent weeks, several big computer makers including Gateway, Micron Electronics and Apple Computer have announced sales shortfalls, as have chip makers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.
"This isn't a Compaq problem; it's an industry problem," said Kevin McCarthy, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
While Compaq's sales in October and most of November were as the company expected, sales to consumers were weaker than expected over the Thanksgiving weekend and continued to lag in December, when sales to small business and Internet companies started to fall off as well.
Demand from larger corporations remains strong, the company said, but price competition, always vigorous, has accelerated.
"We have been rocking and rolling and doing pretty significant growth," Michael D. Capellas, Compaq's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. "Even with 20-20 hindsight, it would have been difficult to predict this at the beginning of the quarter."
Compaq is the No. 1 maker of personal computers worldwide, although in the United States it is second to Dell.
Separately, Compaq said it would take a write-off of more than $1 billion, reflecting the drop in the stock of CMGI, the Internet incubator. Compaq received a 16.4 percent stake in CMGI last year, worth $2 billion at the time, in return for an 83 percent stake in Alta Vista, the Internet search engine that Compaq had acquired when it bought the Digital Equipment Corporation. CMGI's shares were at $48 when the deal was struck. They shot up to $163, but have since fallen, to $11.88 yesterday.
Compaq's shares rose 53 cents, to $20.77, yesterday in regular trading before the earnings announcement. After hours, the shares fell to $19.75.
Consumer demand for PC's has fallen sharply after growing at a 30 percent annual rate from the middle of 1998 to the middle of this year, said Roger Kay, an analyst with IDC, a research company. Demand had surged, he said, as prices under $1,000 made computers affordable for a much broader portion of the public at the same time as the Internet gave people new uses for them.
But now, he added, computer sales are being sapped by the slowing economy and rise of intriguing new gadgets like hand-held organizers and digital cameras.
IDC expects personal computer sales worldwide in the fourth quarter to grow by 20 percent over the year-earlier period. But sales to United States consumers will grow only 10 percent, down from its previous forecast of 21 percent, a shortfall of 500,000 computers.

HEADLINE: A High-Ranking Democrat Lobbies for a Dues Break From U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, came to the United Nations today to do a little politicking.
In the Security Council and in a closed-door meeting later at Ambassador Richard C. Holbrooke's official residence with diplomats from a range of nations, Mr. Biden put himself in the middle of the conflict over the level of dues for the United States. He left the impression that if the rest of the world would give Congress the lower dues it wants for the regular United Nations budget, there might be a slight relaxation of the hard line on reducing American payments for peacekeeping. 
 He noted, as other members of Congress visiting here have recently, that there is far less hostility toward the United Nations in Congress now, and more knowledge about it, than there has been for many years.
Mr. Biden, a Delaware Democrat, visited just as diplomats here were beginning to believe that they may after all come up with some figures that the Republican-led Congress could accept. That would mean lowering the percentage of the United Nations operating budget billed to the United States to 22 percent, from the current 25 percent.
A group of Latin American nations is also leading an effort to work out a compromise on the peacekeeping budget that would eventually reduce American payments to about 26 percent, from 30.
Congress passed a law in 1995 saying it would pay no more than 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget. Some diplomats are concerned that if they agree to their part of Mr. Biden's deal and lower American payments to the regular budget to 22 percent, Congress may still balk at the peacekeeping figure of 26 percent, and there is no guarantee that in future years Republican-controlled committees will not come back demanding even more cuts.
Senator Biden had jointly devised the Congressional position with the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. He said he spoke for himself today when he saw room to maneuver in the Senate. He told reporters and diplomats that he would not have tied budget payments to a host of conditions, the most important being a change in dues.
"But quite frankly," he said, "my view is not a majority view." He added that a reduction to 22 percent in regular dues by the General Assembly, which handles financial decisions, is an absolute requirement. Without that, he said, diplomats can forget the whole package.
Many members of the United Nations are concerned that their payments will go up if the United States pays less. Few deny that the existing scales for both regular budget assessments and peacekeeping are out of date. China, for example, pays next to nothing, though its economy has grown enormously. But many diplomats still bridle at the way the United States gave the United Nations a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum that holds American payments hostage until rates change. The United States is $1.7 billion in debt to the United Nations.
European anger was demonstrated again today in the Security Council by Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France, which currently holds the rotating European Union presidency. He reminded Mr. Biden that the European Union had the same gross national product as the United States but pays nearly $1 billion more a year.

HEADLINE: Kodak Cuts Its Profit Forecast For Third Time This Autumn

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company sharply lowered its profit estimates for the next two quarters yesterday, saying that an abrupt slowdown in the economy was weakening film sales.
This was the third time since September that Kodak had cut its profit forecast. 
 "We are seeing quite a bit of slowdown in the consumer business," Daniel A. Carp, Kodak's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday at a meeting with analysts in New York. "It started in September and it has carried on and gotten worse through Thanksgiving."
For the fourth quarter, Kodak now expects to earn 65 to 75 cents a share, considerably less than the $1.07 a share that analysts expected.
In the first quarter of 2001, the company expects to report profits of 50 to 60 cents a share. Analysts had been expecting first-quarter earnings of about 89 cents a share. The company expects sales to rise 4 percent to 6 percent for all of 2001.
Kodak said it would counter a slide in demand with tougher cost controls, cuts in capital spending and a $200 million reduction in inventories. There are no plans to lay off employees, but Kodak said it would impose hiring limits. And Mr. Carp suggested that if conditions worsened, job cuts were likely.
Investors, who have pushed the price of Kodak stock down sharply this year, did not punish the shares yesterday. They rose $1.50, to $41.06. The stock has fallen 36 percent this year.
"The stock is moving this way because this had been widely anticipated," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "We knew the film business was weak."
At the analysts' meeting, Mr. Carp said demand had fallen in both the United States and Europe. Emerging markets, in contrast, remain a source of growth.
"We are assuming gross domestic product growth will be in the range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in 2001," he said. "It's a lot more fun when the economy is growing at a rate of 4 percent or more."
The company expects growth to accelerate in the third and fourth quarters of 2001. Still, Mr. Carp acknowledged, "I am nervous about the second half."
Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he was sympathetic to Kodak's situation, even though this was the company's third warning since September.
"I am not skeptical at all about the economy-slowing rationale Kodak used," he said. "I have seen it too much in the last two months, and it really started in the summer."
Mr. Kelly said that in 1998 and 1999, film shipments were up about 14 percent and roughly 8 percent, respectively, far above the historical average of 4 percent to 5 percent.
For the first two quarters of this year, the rate of increase was 7 percent to 8 percent, he said. It slowed slightly during the first two months of the third quarter and then plunged in September.
"In September, that number was zero, and the fourth quarter is going to be zero," he said.
Mr. Carp said Kodak was maintaining its market share with the rival Fuji Photo. Sales in wholesale clubs compensated for a loss in share in retail channels. And pricing has remained stable.
Kodak is the largest seller of film in the United States, with an estimated 65 percent of sales. Fuji accounts for about 25 percent, according to analysts.
Mr. Rosenzweig said that Kodak might find it difficult to expect market share to expand further and that it could see it begin to erode.
"They have kicked everyone else out of the wholesale club area," he said. "There is no more share to gain there. So, at some point next year, wholesale will not be giving them much of a boost. The question, therefore, is: Are they going to be able to halt the decline they are experiencing in the food, drug and mass merchant markets?"

HEADLINE: Daily News Owner May Sell Business Magazine to Gruner & Jahr

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In a move that if completed would further pare down his media empire, Mortimer B. Zuckerman is negotiating to sell Fast Company, the five-year old business magazine, to Gruner & Jahr.
Mr. Zuckerman, who also owns The Daily News in New York and U.S. News & World Report, did not return phone calls for comment, but executives at Fast Company and Gruner & Jahr confirmed that he was negotiating to sell the magazine. The news of the negotiations was first reported on the media Web site Inside.com on Monday, which estimated the sale price at more than $200 million, an estimate supported yesterday by an executive involved in Mr. Zuckerman's media holdings. 
 Fast Company, aimed at Internet entrepreneurs and technology managers, is considered the most successful and problem-free of Mr. Zuckerman's media properties.
Circulation is 538,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Newsstand sales -- a major barometer of a magazine's vitality -- were up 35 percent in the first six months of 2000, and total paid circulation was up 64 percent for the first six months of 2000. Ad pages are up by 34 percent, to 1,443, for the year to date, according to the Publishers Information Bureau; revenue is up 117 percent, to $70.3 million for the year to date.
Mr. Zuckerman, a real estate developer, has made a reputation as a businessman who can navigate unpredictable markets. He thinks the time may be right to turn the spigot off at Fast Company, the Zuckerman media executive said. Though still strong, the market for Internet advertising -- one of the advertising mainstays of Fast Company -- is softening. The number of magazines dealing with many of the same issues covered by Fast Company has grown, with titles like Red Herring, Business 2.0, Wired and The Industry Standard eating up market share.
Mr. Zuckerman, the executive said, is in the process of paring down his empire to those holdings for which he feels a passionate affinity. In September 1999, Mr. Zuckerman sold The Atlantic Monthly, the 141-year-old monthly magazine, to the National Journal Group, a Washington magazine publisher and research firm, for about $10 million.
"You read Fast Company and it doesn't really deal with the issues that Mort is interested in," one executive said. Mr. Zuckerman is interested in issues of global economy more than Fast Company's articles, which are aimed at the Internet entrepreneur and technology manager.
Gruner & Jahr, the publisher of eight consumer magazines in the United States and more than 80 magazines worldwide, has been looking to expand ever since Bertelsmann A.G., the German media company that owns 74.9 percent of Gruner & Jahr, sold its stake in AOL Europe last year for about $8 billion. Daniel B. Brewster, the chief executive of Gruner & Jahr since May, has been given a significant war chest to reinvigorate the company.

HEADLINE: G.M. Phaseout of Olds Is at Center of a Range of Cutbacks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 12

 BODY:
General Motors said today that it would gradually shut down its Oldsmobile division over the next several years, ending production of cars that symbolized sophistication and affluence through most of the 20th century, but came to be seen as simply dowdy.
Stuck with its largest supply of unsold cars since the 1991 recession in an auto market that has slowed significantly, G.M. also announced that it would eliminate 10 percent of its 66,000 salaried jobs and 11,000 contract positions in the United States and Europe. The company said it would close a 2,000-employee assembly plant in Britain. 
 Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said that the job cuts would come, "primarily through voluntary separation and early retirement programs."
Blue-collar workers will be largely insulated from layoffs. The same G.M. assembly plants in the United States that make Oldsmobiles build similar cars for other divisions, like Chevrolet and Buick, and will stay open. G.M. hired tens of thousands of factory workers a year in the 1960's and now has 6 to 8 percent of its blue-collar work force retiring each year. So instead of dismissing them, it can more easily transfer its blue-collar workers as factories close.
Still, G.M. confirmed the long-expected closing of a 900-employee engine factory in Lansing, Mich., Oldsmobile's hometown.
While G.M. warned that its profits would take a hit, the decision to end the Oldsmobile brand was welcomed on Wall Street, where investors bid up G.M.'s stock 19 cents a share to close at $51.75.
G.M. will continue to sell its current Oldsmobile models but will not develop any new ones. Production of each of the current models will be halted once the price they can be sold for falls below the cost of assembling them, said Ronald Zarrella, president of North American operations at G.M. The money that otherwise would have gone to designing and promoting new Oldsmobile models will be spent on other vehicles instead, particularly Saturns, which will replace Oldsmobiles as the cars that G.M. relies on most to fight foreign brands in the United States.
Oldsmobile dealers criticized G.M.'s decision to shut down the division. They argued that executives of the 103-year-old division had erred in abandoning older buyers of large cars the last five years in an unsuccessful attempt to woo younger, better-educated customers instead.
"It's a very sad day -- we've been an Oldsmobile dealer since 1932," said J. Chapman Morris Sr., whose family dealership in Fillmore, Calif., also sells Chevrolets. "They left a market that's still there."
But Wall Street has been calling for years for Oldsmobile to be shut down. After selling more than a million cars a year in the late 1970's and again in the mid-1980's, the division has lost so many customers that its sales are projected at a mere 300,000 this year.
Despite the plunge, Oldsmobile executives, long powerful within the company, continued to use the division's storied history and nearly universal name recognition within the United States to win billions of dollars from G.M.'s board to invest in sportier models like the Intrigue and Alero. Those models failed to reverse the slide.
Oldsmobile was founded by Ransom E. Olds in 1897, six years before the creation of the Ford Motor Company. It produced four cars in its first year. In 1901, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash quickly became the nation's best-selling car. Eclipsed by Ford's success with the introduction of the Model N in 1906 and the Model T in 1908, Oldsmobile was sold at the end of 1908 to the new General Motors, which had been set up a couple of months earlier and had previously owned only Buick.
In the "ladder" of G.M. divisions, Oldsmobile was a cut above Chevrolet and a step below Buick. Oldsmobile built a reputation for performance, with innovations like automatic transmissions, and for understated elegance, with a style that contrasted with the flashier image of Cadillac.
G.M. executives became alarmed in the early 1990's that they were losing market share among baby boomers to Toyota, Honda and other foreign brands and designated Oldsmobile as the company's "import fighter" division. Big cars that appealed to older drivers, like the Oldsmobile 98, were replaced by smaller, more nimble models like the Aurora, Alero and Intrigue.
But while older buyers fled Oldsmobiles for rival large cars like the Mercury Grand Marquis, younger buyers did not step forward to replace them. John P. Wolkonowicz, a partner at the Bulin Group, an automotive consulting firm in Northville, Mich., said that his company's research found that Oldsmobile sold no more cars last year to baby boomers -- those Americans born from 1946 to 1963 -- and younger buyers than it did in 1991. Simultaneously, it lost much of its market among older Americans.
"The G.M. approach to brands says you can make a brand anything you want it to be, all you have to do is change the product," Mr. Wolkonowicz said. "In reality, the customer sets bounds on what a brand can be."
Mr. Zarrella defended G.M.'s overall brand management strategy, while acknowledging that the company's Oldsmobile division had not survived the effort to transform it. "We tried to do a very difficult thing, which is to walk away from a customer base," he said at a news conference today. The result, he said, was "lots of positive demographics -- the problem was, there weren't enough of them."
Oldsmobile also suffered from the relative success of two other G.M. divisions: Pontiac, which has captured the performance image that Oldsmobile once held, and Buick, which meets the needs of a big slice of the large-car market with vehicles like the LeSabre, the nation's best-selling full-size car. "Oldsmobile had too much in common with all the rest" of G.M.'s divisions, said David Martin, the executive director of brand consulting at the Interbrand Corporation in New York.
Until now, G.M. had been leery of shutting down Oldsmobile partly for fear of lawsuits from dealers, who could argue that the company was breaking its franchise agreements with them by continuing to sell many models but only under other brand names. Indeed, even as G.M. is phasing out its Oldsmobile division, it is creating its first new division since Saturn a decade ago and laying plans for new dealerships, to sell Hummer sport utility vehicles.
Harold Wells, the chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, and an Oldsmobile dealer since 1956, said today that G.M. should provide assistance to the dealers. "G.M. needs to move quickly to take into account the millions of dollars that dealers have invested in facilities, equipment, personnel and training," he said in a statement. "They deserve nothing less than fair compensation."
Mr. Wagoner said that G.M. would try to assist dealers, while making sure that parts and service remained available for current owners of Oldsmobiles. Only 63 of the 2,801 Oldsmobile dealers do not have franchises of other brands.
"I'm not going to speculate on lawsuits, because our real intention is to work individually with dealers," he said.
G.M. also provided several warnings today about its profits. It said that it would take a one-time after-tax charge of $900 million to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter to cover the various moves announced today. Losses in G.M.'s European operations will deepen in the fourth quarter compared with the third-quarter loss of $181 million, G.M. said.
Excluding special charges and gains, G.M.'s operations will remain profitable over all in the fourth quarter, earning $550 million to $600 million, the company forecast. But G.M. had to take action on Oldsmobile anyway because of its persistent losses, Mr. Wagoner said, adding, "The car side of the business has been under pressure for several years, and Oldsmobile has been in the red."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
Changes of Scenery Taken to the Ninth Degree

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN 

 BODY:
Rick Lukianuk loves watching the surprise on people's faces as he describes his journey from the upper echelons of corporate America to small-town academia -- or, put another way, from coping with stress to having a ball. "I can see it in their eyes," he said. "They say, 'Wait a minute, you can actually do what you want to do?' "
Just 17 months ago, Mr. Lukianuk, 43, was vice president and general counsel for Fischer Scientific Worldwide in Hampton, N..H. Today, he is the high school principal at the Portsmouth Christian Academy in Dover, N.H. It is an unlikely career switch, one that he himself would never have predicted. 
 But a new brand of career counselor is helping managers afflicted by the early stages of burnout find new jobs that they love rather than ones dictated by their resumes. Many of these executives have made a bundle in the decade-long economic boom, so they can often afford the risk.
Mr. Lukianuk practiced international law for 17 years, first at a division of United Technologies in Dearborn, Mich., and then at Fischer Scientific. The frequent travel was tiring him out and, worse, limiting the time he spent with his wife and two children, age 14 and 11.
"It was a great job," he said, "but I knew with that kind of pace, I wouldn't be able to keep it up forever."
So he contacted New Directions, a Boston firm that works with senior managers and professionals. New Directions says it focuses on identifying what clients want to do, not what they think they should be doing.
"We really try to get our clients to slow down and get into neutral and to think about where they are going," said Jeff Redmond, the firm's managing director. "When they do that, then they start thinking about, 'Well, maybe I've had my traditional phase of my career, now I'd like to do something different.' "
After an intensive period of testing and personal assessment that confirmed Mr. Lukianuk's strengths and interests, he took up the headmaster of Portsmouth Christian on a long-standing offer to teach an introductory law class. It would be fun, he figured, and bring him closer to his children, who attended the school.
"It took about four to six weeks to figure out I just loved teaching," Mr. Lukianuk said. Years before, he recalled, he had thought about becoming a history teacher, "but that kind of got lost along the way."
Still, the course was little more than a diversion until the school's principal resigned and Mr. Lukoanuk was asked to take the job. His first instinct was to refuse because of the lower salary, but New Directions set up a meeting with a group of senior-level lawyers so he could sound out his peers. He expected them to ask, "Are you crazy?" he said. Instead, their message was: "If there was any way to do something you are passionate about, do it."
So he took a closer look and concluded that the basic management skills he had picked up in corporate America, like establishing budgets and planning strategy, were crucial to running a school, too. Besides, he could be involved in activities he loved, like music and theater.
He said yes.
He moved to a smaller house, got smaller cars and today enjoys simple pleasures, like raking leaves with his children, that once eluded him. "I always traded time for money," Mr. Lukianuk said. "Now, I'm downscaling in a lot of ways, but I'm upscaling my life."
This is the kind of transition that New Directions prides itself on. Mr. Redmond, a former executive recruiter, helped start the firm more than a decade ago so he could represent job seekers rather than big companies. It has since opened offices in Wilton, Conn., and New York.
New Directions encourages clients to do volunteer work while job hunting, arguing that it will give them perspective and reduce the anxiety of the search. When Bill Boysen left Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1999 after 26 years, he did a stint at SoundWaters, a nonprofit in Stamford, Conn., that educates people about Long Island Sound and its watershed. Mr. Boysen, who had spent most of his tenure at Bristol-Myers as a senior financial officer, agreed to run the organization. Today, he works on a small island in a recently restored 18th-century house with geothermal heat and floor coverings and countertops made of recycled tires and soda containers. He sometimes also works on SoundWaters' 80-foot schooner. "I ended up doing something which I dreamed about," he said.
Another client, W. C. Bird, said farewell to his responsibilities as vice president for human resources at S. D. Warren, a division of Scott Paper, to buy and run Ash Mill Farm, an 11-acre bed-and-breakfast in Holicong, Pa. He remembers telling Mr. Redmond of New Directions, "I don't have a clue what I want to do. I want you to prod me, poke me and give me every test."
Yet another client, Chris Ridley, departed WGBH, the Boston public TV station where he was vice president for corporate communications, to start For the Birds, a Concord, Mass., backyard wild-bird store. "I can't believe anyone can make a living doing this -- to have a job this fantastic, this much fun," he said.
While no official statistics exist on how many people embark on new vocations, counselors say demand for career advice is surging. Susan Eubanks, associate executive director of the National Board for Certified Counselors in Greensboro, N.C., says the number of requests for referrals has shot up to about 300 a month today from 30 to 40 eight years ago. And Juliet Miller, executive director of the National Career Development Association in Columbus, Ohio, says, "It used to be that you just sent out a resume, and you'd get a job. Now we're really helping people look at who they are, what they really want to accomplish in their life."
Ian Summers, a career consultant, helps clients ranging from marketing directors and graphic designers to a fighter pilot and a small-town Indiana ear, eye and nose doctor who was "bored out of his mind" until he took up writing novels about doctors.
Mr. Summers's workshops in a renovated barn in Stockton, N.J., often begin with his burning incense and asking participants to begin "vacuum cleaning the universe" -- scanning the world for jobs that match their interests, not their skills.
Sometimes that even means staying put. Several years ago, he counseled a renowned economist who was thinking about leaving his profession. "I helped him to evaluate what he stood for," Mr. Summers recalled. After attending a two-day workshop, he said, the economist decided to remain in his field. After that, Mr. Summers said, he "approached his work from his heart."

In the Tank?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Even cynics were a bit startled by the revelation that Justice Clarence Thomas's wife has been employed by the Heritage Foundation to gather resumes for potential appointments in the next administration. But let me leave ethical issues to the experts and focus on a different question suggested by the story: To what extent will a Bush administration, if that's what we're about to have, be staffed by people from Heritage and its sister institutions? Are we about to enter an era of government by professional ideologues?
Heritage describes itself as a think tank, a term originally applied to nonpolitical institutions like the RAND Corporation. Whether it is really appropriate for organizations like Heritage depends on what you mean by the word "think." Most of Washington's so-called think tanks don't have to ponder the issues -- they already know the answers. The Heritage mission statement makes no bones about it: the institution's purpose is to "formulate and promote conservative public policies." Can you imagine any circumstances under which Heritage researchers might recommend a tax increase, or a new environmental regulation? I didn't think so. 
 Since the policy recommendations that come out of Heritage, or the Cato Institute, or even the American Enterprise Institute are so predictable, what purpose do these organizations serve? Good question.
The important think tanks are all very much institutions of the right. Jon Corzine notwithstanding, left-wing multimillionaires are not exactly the norm. So liberal think tanks don't have anything like the resources or the influence of their right-wing counterparts. Some might cite the Brookings Institution as an exception -- but Brookings isn't liberal the way the conservative think tanks are conservative. Put it this way: Even A.E.I., the most moderate of the big right-wing think tanks, lists Newt Gingrich among its "scholars."
The glory years of the think tanks were the 1970's, when they provided an alternative to what was perceived -- with some justice -- as the liberal bias of academia. The think tanks were places where neoconservative intellectuals could think the unthinkable and say the unsayable. They provided a new element in the national dialogue, to such an extent that Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously declared that "the Republicans have become the party of ideas." And of course the think tanks provided the intellectual shock troops for the Reagan revolution.
But that was a long time ago. Neoconservative ideas are no longer radical; they have become trite. And the intellectual need for an alternative set of institutions is itself far less apparent than it was. In the field I know best, economics, academia no longer has a recognizable liberal bias; free markets command great respect, and many of the best-known professors are also committed Republicans. Nonetheless, the think tanks are bigger and better financed than ever. What is their purpose?
Mainly they have become waiting rooms for the conservative nomen klatura -- a class of intellectuals among whom talent is much less important than political reliability. The people whose resumes Mrs. Thomas has been helping put together are professional ideologues, who currently earn a living by repeating conservative slogans but hope that they will soon be under secretaries and assistant secretaries.
This hope doesn't have to be fulfilled. While a few Friends of Bill got special consideration in the early years, the Clinton administration was in general staffed by people notable more for their ability than their ideological fervor. In the economic area, the administration attracted some very impressive talent, including at least one likely Nobel laureate (Joseph Stiglitz, chief economic adviser from 1995 to '97).
George W. Bush could do the same -- staffing his administration with able Republicans from the business and academic worlds. But will he?
If Mr. Bush becomes president, the thing to watch is whom he appoints -- not so much to the glamorous cabinet positions as the less visible but crucial second and third tiers. If those slots are filled by people from Wall Street and Stanford, people who have made their reputations independent of their politics, good. If they are filled from Heritage and Cato and A.E.I., forget the rhetoric -- he's a divider, not a uniter.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Shares Retreat, Moving Nasdaq 2.8% Lower

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Technology stocks fell yesterday while some old-line consumer stocks had a modest day in the plus column.
The Dow Jones industrial average was led slightly higher by Procter & Gamble and Eastman Kodak. But the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell more than 2 percent.
After the market closed, Compaq Computer said that it would miss fourth-quarter sales projections by 8 percent to 10 percent while earnings per share would fall about 8 cents below current estimates. Compaq rose 53 cents, to $20.77, in regular trading, then slipped as low as $19 after hours before rebounding to about $20. Because investors have already been made well aware of the sharp slowdown in the personal computer business -- including an announcement from Advanced Micro Devices on Monday -- Compaq's news may have little effect. 
 To some extent yesterday, investors may have been distracted by the United States Supreme Court, which is expected to make a decision soon that could determine who will be president. "The market is getting increasingly nervous about how many wild cards are out there," said Todd E. Petzel, chief investment officer at Commonfund, a firm in Wilton, Conn., that manages money for nonprofit institutions.
The Dow gained 42.47 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,768.27, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq lost 83.33 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2,931.77. So far, the Nasdaq has managed to move back above the 3,000 level for just one day -- Monday -- in the last three weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.02 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,371.18.
Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase and Oracle pulled the Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500 lower. But Microsoft rose for the third consecutive day, up 31 cents, to $58.38, after trading as high as $60.
The rally of some stocks yesterday seemed to show that investors feel the recent declines in many stocks have already factored in enough bad news on sales and earnings.
For example, Eastman Kodak helped drive the Dow higher, even though it dished out its own disappointment. Kodak said the slowing economic growth was cutting into film sales. It projected fourth-quarter earnings of 65 to 75 cents a share, well below the $1.07 a share expected by Wall Street, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Kodak rose $1.50, to $41.06.
Procter & Gamble also drove the Dow higher after it confirmed that it would meet its earnings forecast of 91 cents to 93 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Its stock jumped $2.88, to $71.94.
In another sign that investors are no longer being surprised by companies that downgrade their earnings and sales expectations, Advanced Micro Devices managed to slip just 6 cents, to $17.25, after being up for most of the day. The chip maker said on Monday night that weak demand for personal computers would result in flat fourth-quarter revenue and earnings of just 50 to 60 cents a share, below the 68 cents a share forecast by analysts. Intel, A.M.D.'s big rival, made a similar announcement last week.
Delphi Automotive Systems, the largest maker of automobile parts, said yesterday that it expected sales to be flat to lower in the fourth quarter and next year. But the company also said it was thinking of selling off major parts of its business. The stock had a small gain, rising 50 cents, to $12.25.

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Bond prices edged up yesterday as investors walked on eggshells ahead of a Supreme Court decision that could end five weeks of legal squabbles over the presidency.
Treasuries came under mild pressure in morning trading as dealers took profits after a powerful run-up in prices in recent weeks.
But players squared up positions ahead of reports on consumer spending and inflation scheduled to be released later this week, which are expected to point to further evidence of a slowing economy.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note gained 3/32, to 103 1/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.34 percent from 5.36 percent. The 30-year bond rose 3/32, to 110 12/32. Its yield fell to 5.53 percent from 5.54 percent.

ASIA
 
AFGHANISTAN: U.N. AIDES PULL OUT
Eight United Nations officials have left Kabul for security reasons, fearing a violent reaction if the organization goes ahead with an American and Russian request to hit Afghanistan with more sanctions. The proposed curbs include an arms embargo against the Taliban, without a similar ban on opposition forces. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
SRI LANKA: READY FOR PEACE
The government announced that it was prepared to begin peace talks with the separatist Tamil Tigers, but rejected demands to lift an economic embargo on rebel-controlled areas. It also said there would be no immediate de-escalation of the military campaign as a predicate for negotiations. Barry Bearak (NYT) 

INDIA: PARLIAMENT TIE-UP ENDS
Seven days of paralysis in Parliament has ended with the nation's political parties agreeing to a debate about contentious plans to build a temple on the ruins of a destroyed mosque in Ayodhya. Opposition legislators have been furious with remarks by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, above, in support of the temple construction. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
JAPAN: EMPEROR FOUND GUILTY
Closing a symbolic trial of Japan's World War II leaders, a mock tribunal found the late Emperor Hirohito guilty for his army's policy of systematically forcing Asian women into sexual slavery. "Superiors can be responsible for the acts of their subordinates if they'd known or should have known that these acts had been committed," said Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, one of four judges at the Women's International War Crimes Tribunal. (AP)
 
KOREAS: NORTH AND SOUTH MEET
High-level government negotiators from South and North Korea met to set the tone for future relations between the two former adversaries. In Pyongyang, Unification Minister Pak Chae Kyu of South Korea told his counterpart, Chon Gum Jin, that there was a perception that North Korea was not improving relations as quickly as promised. Both sides will open full talks today. (AP)
 
EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: TIES TO NORTH KOREA
Britain and North Korea agreed to establish diplomatic relations, and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the decision was "taken in recognition of the significant progress" in the dialogue between the two Koreas. In a sign of its opening up to the outside world, Pyongyang has this year already established formal ties with Canada, Italy and Australia. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
TURKEY: U.S. CLOSES CONSULATES
The United States closed its consulates in Istanbul and the southern city of Adana for what an embassy official in Ankara said were security reviews. The official declined to say what led to the review or whether there had been a specific threat. The embassy remained open because it is considered more secure. American officials have expressed concern recently about possible attacks sponsored by the exiled Saudi Osama bin Laden, who Washington believes was behind the 1998 bombings of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Douglas Frantz (NYT)
 
TURKEY: A POLICE PROTEST
About 3,000 policemen marched through Istanbul to protest the overnight ambush of a police bus that killed two officers and injured 12. Waving guns and chanting slogans, the police demanded better protection and tougher sanctions against criminals. The attack on the bus occurred in a neighborhood where the police clashed last week with protesters opposed to moving inmates to small-cell prisons from the current dormitory-style rooms in Turkish prisons. Douglas Frantz (NYT)
 
FRANCE: LAWYERS STRIKE
Courts ground to a virtual standstill as 35,000 lawyers staged a nationwide strike to demand more pay for providing legal aid to the poor. "It's the first time in history," said Francis Teitgen, a spokesman for Paris lawyers. Mr. Teitgen attacked the government for failing to offer more money and said Britain's budget for free legal advice was 10 times larger than France's. (Reuters)
 
SWITZERLAND: MAD COW MOVE
Reacting to the growing number of cases of mad cow disease in surrounding countries, Switzerland has banned the sale of meat and bone meal from its livestock. Such animal-based feed is suspected of spreading the disease to people. The ban, starting January, will affect some 100,000 tons of feed a year, most of which has been exported to Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Elizabeth Olson (NYT)
 
GERMANY: HELP FOR IMMIGRANTS
Germany's commissioner for foreigners announced a $282 million annual program for immigrants and said integration had been an area neglected in the past. The program puts special emphasis on language courses and measures for helping new arrivals, with migrants to be given a voucher for 600 hours of German lessons and tuition in living skills. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
PERU: REBEL GIVES UP
Capt. Ollanta Humala Tasso of the army, who mutinied and fled into the Andes with a band of soldiers two months ago to protest the corruption of the armed forces, said he is giving up his rebellion. The officer has requested a meeting with the interim president, Valentin Paniagua, and said he is ready to face justice. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
TRINIDAD: ELECTION VICTORY
Prime Minister Basdeo Panday's governing United National Congress gained a narrow victory in Trinidad's parliamentary election, but the opposition appeared set to begin a legal challenge. Mr. Panday's party won 19 seats and former Prime Minister Patrick Manning's People's National Movement gained 16 seats. But Mr. Manning said his party would file court documents challenging the candidacies of two Congress winners. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: TROOPS WITHDRAWN
Iraqi troops have withdrawn from positions they took in a weekend incursion into a Kurd-controlled part of northern Iraq, Kurds in the region said. Kurdish factions have controlled most of northern Iraq since Baghdad was defeated in the 1991 gulf war. The Kurdish enclave is protected by American and British jets that enforce a no-flight zone over northern Iraq. No fighting was reported in the incursion. (Agence France-Presse)

GHANA: RUNOFF SET
The opposition candidate John Kufuor and John Atta Mills of the governing National Democratic Congress will meet on Dec. 28 in a runoff in the presidential election, the electoral commission said. Its chairman also gave the final results of the Dec. 7 election, in which no candidate won an outright majority. Mr. Kufuor of the New Patriotic Party polled 48.35 percent of the vote, with 44.85 percent for Mr. Mills. (Reuters)
 
BURUNDI: INTERNATIONAL AID
International donors meeting in Paris agreed to grant Burundi some $440 million in relief, reconstruction and development aid, the World Bank announced. The announcement came at the close of a two-day conference led by South Africa's former president, Nelson Mandela. He has been mediating peace efforts in Burundi, laid waste after seven years of civil war. (Agence France-Presse)
 
IVORY COAST: COUNTING BALLOTS
President Laurent Gbagbo's Ivoirian Popular Front will be the dominant force in the new Parliament after Sunday's general election, but with no absolute majority will be forced to work with the former governing party.

HEADLINE: Medical Journal Bars Authors' Prepublication Comments

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
In a move that renews debate about when new research findings should be disclosed to the public, The Journal of the American Medical Association has tightened its rules about what scientists and research institutions can say before their results are published.
Authors "must not participate in press conferences or issue press releases before publication," the journal said, and authors "must refrain from granting interviews" about their findings unless journalists agree to hold the information until after the journal publishes it. Also, authors were admonished not to tell other people that they had submitted a manuscript to the journal. 
 The policy comes at a time when proponents of electronic publishing and the Internet are challenging traditional print scientific journals to allow speedier dissemination of research findings. The restrictions and embargoes that journals have imposed on their contents in recent years have created a contentious issue between journalists, who contend that the measures restrict the gathering of news in a timely way, and journal editors, who say their scrutiny protects the public from misleading information.
The new rules revise a 1991 policy that said the journal preferred that new findings be released to the public at the time they were published. Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis, the journal's top editor, said that in making the change she was simply detailing what has been a working but largely unwritten policy in recent years. Dr. DeAngelis said the clarification was necessary so that "people understand" the rules. The journal is one of a group of publications owned by the American Medical Association, the largest doctors' organization in the country.
Dr. George D. Lundberg, Dr. DeAngelis's predecessor, who was dismissed as editor of the journal, said in an interview that "the use of the word 'must' in this context sounds far more proscriptive than the practice we maintained at JAMA in the 1990's." Dr. Lundberg, who wrote the 1991 policy, also said that "this seems heavy handed and could intimidate authors, especially younger investigators."
There are four exceptions to the journal's new policy, which are rarely needed, Dr. DeAngelis said in an interview. They are: presentations at scientific meetings; testimony before government agencies; clinical alerts issued by the National Institutes of Health; and urgent public health information.
Many scientists who submit manuscripts believe "they are on to something that is the most important thing since sliced bread, and they want it out there," Dr. DeAngelis said.
"Fine," she added, "put it out there, but don't submit it to JAMA."
JAMA and a few other journals have begun to post such articles on their Web site. Dr. DeAngelis said she was "very confident" that her policy would "never hurt the public."
Referring to journals that restricted what scientists could say before their papers were published, Dr. Edward J. Huth, a former editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, said that he had long felt that such journals "were basically looking after economic self-interest."
Indeed, such restrictions have helped vastly increase profits for journal owners that include professional organizations like the American Medical Association. The restrictions are often referred to as the Ingelfinger rule after Dr. Franz Ingelfinger, who imposed them when he was editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Ingelfinger said that he imposed restrictions to protect his journal's newsworthiness and economic self-interest. Many journals that have adopted the rule do not disclose their profits or what they do with them.
JAMA's new policy contrasts sharply with two editorials the journal published in 1981 that criticized the Ingelfinger rule and the "buttoned-lip syndrome" that reporters encountered at scientific meetings. The 1981 editorials were not cited in the new policy.
The journal's new policy appears in the same issue as a paper from a team headed by Dr. Cary P. Gross of Yale that analyzed the use of a stroke-preventing operation for patients in seven states after the release of information about the procedure in clinical alerts, scientific meetings and published reports. The surgery rates increased significantly and inappropriately after the alert's release but slowed after the publication of the studies. Among the possible reasons cited for the pattern was that one published study contained caveats not included in the alert.
However, the scientific leader of one of the studies declined to answer questions at a news conference in 1994 because his team was submitting a paper to JAMA.
"It does not make sense to do this halfway," Dr. Gross said in an interview.
"We need to find more effective ways to disseminate information, because the current system is not working efficiently," he said, to allow patients and doctors quick access to full details.

HEADLINE: Navy Sets Referendum for 2001 on Puerto Rican Test Range

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Dec. 12

 BODY:
Residents of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques will vote on Nov. 6, 2001, on whether to oust the United States Navy from their island, which has been used for decades as a bombing range and base for war games, officials said today.
Navy Secretary Richard Danzig set the date for the long-promised referendum in a letter to Gov. Pedro Rossello on Monday. For the first time, the Navy will ask the 9,300 residents of Vieques whether they want the Navy base on the island. 
 The Vieques bombing range became the object of protests after a civilian security guard was killed in a botched bombing run there in April 1999.
Dozens of protesters occupied the Vieques Navy base for more than a year, forcing a halt to live-fire training. The federal authorities forcibly removed them last May, and the Navy resumed war games in October.
Residents say more than a half-century of military exercises on the island have threatened their health, stunted the island's economic growth and damaged marine life and air quality.
The Navy has argued that the hilly, 33,000-acre island off Puerto Rico's east coast is the only place it can properly conduct simultaneous land, sea and air exercises and is essential to battle readiness.
Under a deal between Governor Rossello and the White House, the Navy was allowed to continue training with inert ammunition on Vieques for three years, and residents would hold a referendum to decide if they wanted the Navy to leave the island by May 1, 2003.
In his letter to Governor Rossello, Mr. Danzig said that at least 90 days before the November referendum, the Navy would submit the language to be used on a second option, which would permit indefinite Navy training with live fire.
The second option carries with it a $50 million incentive through economic development projects in the community.
An additional $40 million is being spent before the vote, under the accord brokered with the White House.
Mr. Danzig also sent a letter to Gov.-elect Sila Calderon of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, warning that unless her administration supported the White House agreement, the Navy would not be obliged to follow it.
In her campaign for governor, Ms. Calderon promised to quickly enact tougher noise regulations that would ban Navy shelling of Vieques. The regulations would become effective six months after passage.
"The transfer of land and many of the projects cannot go forward without your assurance that your administration will fully support the agreement," Mr. Danzig wrote to Ms. Calderon.
The governor-elect, who takes office in January, was on vacation and could not be reached for immediate comment today.
The letter was made public today by Governor Rossello at a news conference.
"This should come as no surprise to anyone," Governor Rossello said of Mr. Danzig's letter. "If she doesn't abide by the agreement, then in essence there is no agreement."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
The Modern Master In the Art Of the Deal

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In the long unwinding of Scott Boras's life, from California farm boy to the most successful player agent in sports history, one constant has been his deep yearning to play an important role in professional baseball, the world that obsessed him as a young man and later eluded him as a player.
Though he never made it to the major leagues swinging a bat, Boras sits astride the sport today like a giant, one of the most feared men in the business. Beginning in 1984, when he won a startling $7.5 million, five-year contract for a former minor league teammate, Bill Caudill, Boras has again and again shown a talent for pushing the price of elite players to unprecedented heights. 
 Boras's greatest triumph came this week, when he negotiated a 10-year deal with the Texas Rangers for Alex Rodriguez, the talented young shortstop, worth $252 million, the most lucrative contract ever in American professional sports.
The agreement was the latest in a string of market-busting contracts Boras has won for the 55 major leaguers and 35 minor league players he represents. In November 1998, he persuaded the Yankees to pay $87.5 million for Bernie Williams's services in center field, nearly 50 percent more than the team had wanted to spend. Three weeks later, Boras negotiated for pitcher Kevin Brown a $105 million contract with the Dodgers.
To his detractors, Boras is a single-minded negotiator whose mission is to extract as much money as possible from franchises for his players, no matter the consequences for the economics of the game.
Many fans and some baseball officials worry that his hard-nosed tactics are driving salaries so high that only a few teams are in a position to bid for elite players. Sandy Alderson, the major leagues' vice president for baseball operations, called the Rodriguez contract "stupefying" and noted that many franchises could be bought for less money.
Few general managers or owners speak ill of Boras in public, in part because they might have to make a deal with him in the future. But many baseball officials privately suggest that he is a master at playing teams against one another, keeping all sides guessing about competing offers. Some owners, including George Steinbrenner of the Yankees, and some executives, like Larry Lucchino of the San Diego Padres, have publicly accused Boras of bluffing about rival offers to push up the price of a player, a charge he denies.
"He really pushes the envelope as far as representing his players," said Ronald Dick, a professor of sports management at the University of New Haven. "He's prepared to bite the bullet and have a guy sit out a whole year just to sign for more money."
 
One of Most Powerful
His defenders say that Boras, who is 48, is a principled, hard-working lawyer who drives a tough bargain, but always comes ready to back up his demands with facts. For instance, Boras argued, not without merit, that Rodriguez has the potential to be the best shortstop ever.
"He doesn't throw a number out there and not attempt to justify it," Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said. "I would rank him as one of the most powerful people in the game of baseball. His negotiations are difficult, but at the end of the day he hasn't made the Yankees do anything that we were ultimately unwilling to do."
At baseball's winter meetings in Dallas this week, Boras was seldom seen in the lobby of the Wyndham Anatole Hotel, but his presence and the bidding war over Rodriguez hung heavy over the proceedings. Boras and his aides met behind closed doors with representatives from several teams, among them the Rangers, the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago White Sox, who were courting the 25-year-old infielder.
During a rare break from these meetings, Boras talked about his lifelong obsession with baseball and dismissed the notion that the big contracts he has won could undermine the sport. He said many teams were making more money than ever, and he pointed out that no franchise had ever gone bankrupt or been sold for a loss.
 
Multiple Roles
To hear Boras tell it, his main mission is not merely to get his clients more money, but to help them develop into mature stars. He sees himself playing the role of lawyer, big brother, counselor and coach.
Boras said he provides players with everything from psychologists to strength-conditioning experts to fatherly advice about the importance of getting an education. He proudly lists the young prospects he persuaded to go to college instead of straight to the minor leagues. He said he even dispenses advice about improving their play.
"The best thing to understand about me is that, being a former ballplayer, I have a different way of looking at things when you do things for your clients," Boras said. "I love the game of baseball. Seventy percent of what I do is not related to money. It's related to the game."
But some critics contend that Boras uses his professed love for the game to rationalize his real agenda: besting his adversaries at the negotiating table. Some have even suggested that Boras holds a grudge against baseball because he was forced in 1978 to give up his dream of playing in the big leagues, after three operations on his knee.
Boras scoffs at the suggestion, saying he knew early on that he was "never major league caliber." But he acknowledged that no one in the modern game of baseball, including himself, is working purely for the love of the sport. "This is not a charitable institution," he said.
"People talk about Scott Boras for one reason and one reason only -- it's because we represent very talented players who have great character," he said. "They are people that teams will invest in."
 
Down on the Farm, Literally
Boras was reared on a farm near Elk Grove, Calif., 40 miles south of Sacramento. He remembers his childhood as backbreaking dirty work that began at 5 a.m. He devoted his evenings to baseball.
"My life was milking cows, spending hours on a tractor and listening to the Giants' ballgames," he said. "My whole day was motivated around making sure I got done at a quarter to five, so I could make that glorious ride to the ballpark."
Boras played center field in high school and at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif., where he studied to become a pharmacist. He was a good hitter, but he ripped tendons in his knee two weeks before the 1973 draft in a collision with another fielder.
Still, the St. Louis Cardinals signed him to play Class AA, and he began going to college in the winter and playing professionally in the summer. Though he could hit, his fielding suffered because of the knee injury and he was moved to the infield. But by his own admission he was a miserable infielder, making 40 errors one season.
Boras said his experience in the minor leagues convinced him of the unfairness of baseball's draft. "When a 21-year-old kid is signed at 18 and gets released, he has nothing," he said. "Watch those kids crying in the parking lot. This is about a cheap labor pool."
After graduating from college in 1977, Boras played two more seasons in the minor leagues, but finally gave up the game in the fall of 1978 after a third knee operation did nothing to help his mobility.
Boras cried for two days and then entered law school in Sacramento, paying his own way with a night job at a hospital. After passing the bar, he went to work with a large Chicago law firm that specialized in medical malpractice. "There was never any intention in my mind to be a sports agent," he said.
But Mike Fischlin, a pitcher who had gone to Boras's high school, asked him to renegotiate his contract with the Houston Astros. Then Caudill, a pitcher Boras had played with in the minors, asked for his help. Boras drove such a hard bargain that Caudill ended up with one of the richest contracts in baseball at the time. That attracted other players, and soon Boras went into business for himself. He had found his niche.
"For a time in my life, I represented buildings, companies, pieces of paper," he said. "Now I represent people close to my heart: ballplayers."
Boras has become a power broker in baseball. He aggressively scouts and seeks out the best young talent and convinces their families that his methods work. He often seeks legal loopholes to gain free-agent status for players selected in the amateur draft, driving up their value. In a few cases, he persuaded young clients to refuse to sign with the team that drafted them and to hold out for more money.
In 1998, he persuaded J. D. Drew, an outstanding college player, to sit out for a year instead of signing with the Philadelphia Phillies, who had selected him in the first round. The next year, Drew signed a four-year contract with the Cardinals worth as much as $8.5 million.
"I get hammered because of this supposedly acrimonious relationship with teams," Boras said. "You know what the core of that is? The draft."
With veteran major leaguers, Boras has repeatedly pushed the outer envelope of what a free agent is worth, ratcheting up the entire market with each deal. For three years running, he negotiated the largest contract ever for pitchers: a $35 million deal for Alex Fernandez with the Marlins in 1996, a $57.5 million contract for Greg Maddux with the Braves in 1997 and Brown's $105 million deal with the Dodgers in 1998.
 
'I Keep Confidences'
General managers say that in negotiations Boras almost never tells them what other teams have offered to his star free agents. This approach has led to grumbling among general managers and owners that he sometimes pretends to have offers that do not exist, an allegation he vehemently denies.
"I keep confidences," he said. "Teams will call me and say, 'What did you have from the other team?' I'm not going to tell them. It's like poker. When you fold, you don't get that information."
A measure of the mistrust that some owners and general managers have for Boras is that the White Sox wanted Rodriguez to be present when they made their offer over the weekend in Dallas; some baseball officials said the White Sox were concerned about whether Boras would relay their offer accurately. Boras turned down the request.
Boras's tactics have made him a wealthy man. He makes a 5 percent commission from the contracts and is a partner in an Atlanta company that handles his clients' endorsement deals. He, his wife, Jeanette, and their three children live in Newport Beach, Calif.
Family members say Boras works long days and is often on the telephone until after midnight. When his mother, Betty Jones Boras, died two years ago, it caught him by surprise.
"I honestly wish I spent more time with her," he said, his flinty eyes softening for a moment. "My passion for my job kept me away."
Boras said he could care less about the complaint that he is a danger to baseball. He said what matters to him is what his clients think. The emotional payoff for Boras comes when he calls a client like Rodriguez to tell him he just became the highest-paid athlete in baseball.
"It's really elating, because you certainly know what it means to the client," he said, emotion filling his voice. "The telephone call with Rodriguez is something I will never forget."

HEADLINE: India, Beauty Superpower, Is Becoming Jaded

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Exceptionally sexy in swimwear, stunningly elegant in evening gowns, oh-so-earnest in their admiration for the good works of Mother Teresa, Indian pinup girls have been sashaying across the globe like some juggernaut in high heels, making this country the world's beauty pageant superpower.
Two weeks ago it furthered its boast to leggy hegemony, with Priyanka Chopra winning the Miss World title just months after Lara Dutta became Miss Universe. 
 It is the second time in six years that India has swept the two major international competitions in feminine comeliness. Indeed, the Miss World crown may as well be displayed atop the jeweled inlays of the Taj Mahal. India also won it in 1994, 1997 and 1999.
But while this latest victory received the customary front-page treatment here, there has also been a bit of self-consciousness, as if many Indians suddenly realized that all this time they had been watching a spoof and thinking it a drama.
"India Breasts Tape Again in the World's Great Bimbo Race" was the banner headline in The Indian Express, an example of the sarcasm that has been rubbing shoulders with the usual adoration.
Several commentators noted derisively that the Miss World pageant was now largely a third-world event. The show was not televised in the United States, and it was carried only by a down-market channel in Britain. The host was the less-than-dignified Jerry Springer. He asked a bewildered Miss Turkey, "Tell me, what do you eat on Thanksgiving?"
Ms. Chopra, the planet's new Miss World, is an 18-year-old who, before the competition, said she aspired to be a clinical psychologist "to understand why people turn demented." Afterward, she allowed that her true calling might be movie stardom.
On the night of Nov. 30, she walked flawlessly down the ramp in her peach strapless gown. But at crunch time, she made a slight flub when five finalists -- including Miss Kazakhstan, Miss Italy, Miss Turkey and Miss Uruguay -- were each challenged with a weighty question that called for introspection: "Who do you consider to be the most successful woman living today and why?"
Ms. Chopra, who had been groomed for months by a team of tutors, beauticians and fashion designers, seemed to switch to auto pilot. She named Mother Teresa, dead since 1997: "I admire her from the bottom of my heart for being so passionate and kind -- to give up her life to put smiles on people's faces."
For some, the slip-up was a telltale sign of societal rot. "We Indians send out some bimbo and she returns with the prize, and we act like we've conquered the world," scoffed the writer Khushwant Singh, an avowed lecher not usually so mocking of bimbo-osity. "This one is singularly stupid. She didn't even know whether Mother Teresa is alive or dead."
Many news accounts dwelled on the faux pas. An editorial in The Hindustan Times said that "perhaps Ms. Chopra had taken the convent school line about the Holy Ghost a little too seriously."
The new Miss World was also given bad marks in demographic study, having said India is home to two billion people, which is twice the correct number.
Other accounts were far more forgiving, concluding that Ms. Chopra's poise and charm were so extraordinary that the judges simply chose to overlook her mistake.
But naysayers offered a more cynical explanation: that Indian beauties so often win these contests because India is one of the few countries that actually cares. There were insinuations that the contest might even be fixed.
The Miss World competition was held in London, but it was an Indian network that sponsored the show worldwide. Indian designers did the costumes. An Indian was among the judges. Indians made up a large portion of the live audience.
India, in fact, has been gaga over beauty contests since 1994, the year of that first astonishing Miss World-Miss Universe twin triumph. Awakened was something that might be called patriotic vanity. Contests multiplied.
There are now queens of this city and that city: monsoon queens, summer queens, married queens and junior queens. Indian women, many say, are discovering their sexuality; some are also discovering bulimia and anorexia.
"What wins these international contests is not the traditional Indian conception of beauty," said Patricia Uberoi, a sociologist. "Here, height has not been so much a criterion. It's a more rounded look, wide hips, plenty of bosom. Ten years ago it would have been hard to imagine how many women would be going to slimming parlors."
India, of course, is a big and varied place -- home to about one in every six of the world's people. Beauty contests are more likely to appeal to the urban middle class, the same segment of the population that has the extra rupees to spend on herbal skin creams.
Even then, the flaunting of well-proportioned flesh does not fall within every Indian's idea of propriety.
In 1996, when the Miss World pageant was held in the Indian city of Bangalore, the numerous protests included self-immolation. Strange bedfellows found themselves entwined in their mutual outrage -- feminists who found such contests degrading to women and Hindu nationalists who saw the show as an invasion of Western degeneracy. The swimsuit competition had to be moved to the nearby and more hospitable Seychelles Islands.
But for most Indians the victories of Indian beauties were a needed boost. The national self-image had been in a droop. In the early 90's, with its economy a mess, India finally veered from Nehru-era socialism and began to open its markets to the world. In came hair tonics, toothpaste and satellite television with titillating soap operas like "Santa Barbara."
Indians did not approve of everything that was entering their living rooms, but they did enjoy the televised rivalry of radiant women from every nation.
Worldwide, more than one billion people were said to watch the annual extravaganza. And there was India, able to show off females judged as incomparably beautiful and brainy. Merely to be chosen to compete was to become an instant celebrity here; to be a winner was to become an icon.
"For so long we've considered ourselves to be losers and second-raters," said the novelist Shobe De. "We crave success at anything at all in the international arena."
Vir Sanghvi, the editor of The Hindustan Times, said Indians especially longed for recognition from the West, anything showing that they are major players in the world, whether with nuclear weapons, a seat on the United Nations Security Council, Western book prizes, movie deals with Hollywood or top jobs with multinational corporations.
"There is a sense that we can be a contender," he said. "At least we certainly want to be. That's why we became obsessed with these beauty contests. We thought they brought us a victory over the world. But now fatigue and cynicism are setting in."
Mr. Sanghvi and others actually view this disdain as a sign of maturity.
"We shouldn't kid ourselves anymore that our women are exceptionally beautiful, that our women are exceptionally bright," said Mary John, a senior fellow at a women's research center here in New Delhi. "We're so desperate to make it in the globalized world that we'll fall for any con job.
"Winning beauty contests doesn't deserve national fervor. A beauty queen should not be held in the same esteem as a prime minister. I mean, really now."

HEADLINE: Clinton Rouses the Irish With a Plea to Cherish the Peace

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: DUNDALK, Ireland, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Tens of thousands of people crowded into the central square of this small border town halfway between Dublin and Belfast tonight to hear President Clinton make the final pitch of his presidency for continued peace in the land of his ancestors.
"As I prepare to leave my office, a large part of my heart will always be in Ireland, for all the days of my life," said the president, who traces his mother's family to Fermanagh County in Northern Ireland. 
 Drawing from an old Irish blessing, the president added: "And let me say, I will pray: May the road of peace rise up to meet you. May the wind of prosperity be always at your back. And may the God of St. Patrick hold you in the hollow of his hand."
On this his third presidential trip to Ireland, Mr. Clinton delighted his guests by pledging to continue working for reconciliation here long after he hands over the White House to his successor. But he came with a more immediate message -- encouraging words that he hoped would be enough to prevent the fragile Good Friday Accord from unraveling and the violence that has so torn this region from returning.
"I come here near the end of my eight years of service as president of the United States to ask you to protect this progress, to cherish it, and to build on it," the president said. "Unionists and Nationalists, native-born Irish and immigrants, to all of you, I say again, you cannot win by making your neighbor lose."
Administration officials said they selected this remote town a few miles from the border for Mr. Clinton's major speech of the day because it had suffered the scourge of violence and then rebounded with both peace and prosperity. Dundalk has been used as a staging area by members of the Irish Republican Army in their battle with British soldiers in the north. It now attracts high-tech companies, part of a major economic boom in the country.
"You in Dundalk know what it's like to face fear and isolation, with unemployment rising, the economy stalling and hope failing," the president said. "We know violence suffocates opportunity. Today, you are the proof of the truth and wisdom of peace. The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is now more a bridge than a barrier."
Soon after touching down in Dublin early today, Mr. Clinton began making the rounds, greeting government officials ranging from Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A.
He also toured the factory where Guinness beer is produced and shopped for wool sweaters with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea, delighting the crowds on the route.
At the Guinness plant, the president, who has said he is allergic to beer, abstained from the dark brew that has been produced there since 1759 and was once touted by the company as being richer in carbohydrates than a glass of milk. Later, however, he stopped at Fagin's pub with Prime Minister Ahern and, with scores of delighted patrons looking on, stood at the wooden bar and took a few sips of Bass.
"When in Ireland. . ." said the White House spokeswoman, Christine Anderson, her voice drifting off. Local television carried the presidential sips in close-up.
"The president only had a mouthful," the disapproving announcer said.
The president's much-publicized three-day visit -- which he continues in Belfast on Wednesday and London on Thursday -- comes at a delicate time in the peace effort, with a showdown looming between Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists, the dominant Protestant party. The political solution that Mr. Clinton helped negotiate in 1998 is in danger of faltering as the parties grapple with issues like the demilitarization of the I.R.A. and reform of the heavily Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary.
During his visit, Mr. Clinton was hailed as a peacemaker. "Peace can never be the product of just one man but, Mr. President, your leadership, your vision and your commitment have made an incredible difference," Joan McGuinness, a local businesswoman, told him. "We know it would not have happened without you."
Peter Flynn, 49, an electrician who huddled with many others in the cold night for a glimpse of Mr. Clinton, was eager to have him return.
"Hopefully, we'll see him back here when he's on his holidays in a couple of weeks," Mr. Flynn said.
After heading to Belfast tonight, Mr. Clinton will address the Northern Ireland Assembly, the power-sharing government in danger of collapse, on Wednesday. He will also hold a meeting with David Trimble, the first minister, who is under pressure by fellow Ulster Unionists to pull out of the Assembly to protest the I.R.A. failure to disarm.
Aides denied reports in local newspapers that Mr. Clinton had already decided to become a special envoy in Northern Ireland after he leaves office. But the president has said repeatedly that he intends to remain active in the world's trouble spots, albeit in a way that does not interfere with his successor.
"I think the new president, whoever it may be, will want to have a new team in place, and I will support that," the president told reporters in Dublin. "I want to support whatever decisions the new administration makes on foreign policy. And if I can be a resource, I will. If I can ever help the Irish, of course I will."

HEADLINE: Putin, Nurturing Friendships of Soviet Era, Tosses a Wide Net

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq was in town doing some lobbying on behalf of President Saddam Hussein last month, and while he was here, he took the opportunity to say on national television what several former Soviet client states may have been wanting to say for a long time.
"For the last 10 years, some people have held jobs in the Russian government without knowing the country's history of relations" with its Soviet-era friends, Mr. Aziz said. "Many of them viewed the West as the sole way to resolve Russia's problems." 
 But under President Vladimir V. Putin that is beginning to change, he said. "Now Russian authorities can feel the traditions extending over the centuries of good relations with the East, with Iraq, the Arab world, India and China."
He could have also listed North Korea, Iran, Libya, Angola and, this week, Cuba, where Mr. Putin will touch down on Wednesday as the first Russian leader since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union to visit the island that radiates so much history of cold war tension for Russians and Americans alike.
Just nine months into office, the 48-year-old Russian president has cast Russia's relations with the world as a much broader net than his predecessor, rebuilding Moscow's ties with traditional client states of the Soviet era, including some of the so-called "rogue states" that have been accused of supporting terrorism or building weapons of mass destruction or both. But in a significant step beyond the Soviet era, Mr. Putin has presented himself like a foreign policy businessman on the landscape of the old Soviet bloc, now rife with newly emerging democratic states, market economies and not a few stragglers like Cuba that have yet to make the transition to new economies since the Soviet subsidies disappeared a decade ago.
On this old terrain, Mr. Putin has been searching for opportunities, both for Russia's beleaguered national industries and for a more self-assured profile for Russian foreign policy, at once more constructive on issues of war and peace, but also more assertive when Russia's security and trade interests are in the balance.
"Putin's foreign policy looks like a red-star cocktail to me," said Andrei V. Kozyrev, foreign minister when Boris N. Yeltsin was president. "It's the old stuff of anti-Americanism spiced by the support of rogue regimes from Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein, with the addition of narrowly defined commercial interests." Still, Mr. Kozyrev has great hopes for Mr. Putin. He argues that the Russian leader is trying to satisfy a broad array of domestic constituencies by coddling old dictators on the one hand and moving closer to the West on the other.
"Keeping this balance is an absolute prerequisite to keeping the market-reform effort going, and I have to congratulate him," Mr. Kozyrev said, adding that he fears that because of this internal balancing act, Mr. Putin has failed to present a coherent Russian view to the world.
"There is an ambition to be independent and self-assertive, but without an overall strategy." he said. "That boils down to awkward moves that make you look different just to be different, and that may be a reflection of our national inferiority complex."
Whatever the underlying motivation, Mr. Putin "has changed the dynamic of U.S.-Russian relations," said Michael McFaul of the Carnegie Moscow Center, who discussed Mr. Putin's foreign policy with several Kremlin officials last month. "For a number of years under Yeltsin, we would always come to him with the list of things we wanted to do, and it was always a task of trying to get him to cooperate," Mr. McFaul said. "Putin has changed that dynamic. Suddenly we are responding to him, and frankly some people don't like that."
Much of Mr. Putin's diplomacy seems pragmatic and constructive, experts said, as when the Russian leader visited North Korea in the summer and warned its leader, Kim Jong Il, that North Korea's ballistic missile program was posing a threat to stability in Asia. In the Middle East, Mr. Putin has taken every opportunity to keep the peace process moving forward and to quell the violence, even getting Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel on the telephone when the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, visited the Kremlin last month. But he has also challenged Washington's proposal to build ballistic missile defenses and has suggested an alternative that would extend the protection to Europe and preserve a crucial 1972 treaty that bans the development of national missile defenses.
When Mr. Putin was elected in March, experts predicted that he would be a domestic policy president. But he has ranged near and far abroad to reacquire old customers and markets for Russian industries -- oil, weapons, metallurgy and civilian nuclear power -- and to collect billions of dollars in debt still owed Moscow by clients of the Soviet era.
Russia has signed agreements to build nuclear power plants in China, India and Iran, and Mr. Putin is expected to discuss with President Fidel Castro of Cuba this week whether the one-time allies might restart work on an atomic station abandoned there in 1992. The two might also discuss Russian investment in Cuba's extensive nickel reserves.
This fall, Mr. Putin visited New Delhi, the first Russian leader to do so in eight years, and he signed multibillion-dollar contracts to provide supersonic fighters, tanks and other battlefield weapons for the Indian army. In India and China, Russia is after a larger share of the international arms market. And in Angola, where Soviet and Cuban forces once aligned themselves against Western-backed forces, Moscow is trying to pick up business in oil and diamonds. Moscow might also sell some weapons to government forces that trying to put down the 25-year-old revolt of Jonas Savimbi.
In taking these steps, Mr. Putin is connecting Russia's interests with those of the Soviet past -- but without the old ideological content. The best that Mr. Putin could say about Mr. Castro in advance of his visit was that "Cuba is our traditional partner" and that "Cuba has been great and extremely important for us because it always had an independent position." His comments were not exactly the rousing rhetoric of old.
This fall, Mr. Putin abrogated an agreement to end Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran under an agreement signed in 1995 between Vice President Al Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who was prime minister. Though several Russian foreign policy experts disagree with Mr. Putin's reversal on Iran, they have been defending his act.
"Just as Russia does not consider the United States its enemy, Iran is not our enemy either, and Iran is paying in hard currency for all its weapons," said Aleksei Arbatov, a liberal Parliament deputy who sits on the Defense Committee.
Mr. Kozyrev, the former foreign minister, disagrees with Mr. Putin's tilt toward Iran, but argues that Russia has security concerns that only Iran can help address.
Mr. Putin has been seeking to bind Russia's foreign policy closer to Europe and to secure for Russia a permanent seat at the table among industrial nations and in the global trading system.
"He is first and foremost a Europeanist," Mr. McFaul of the Carnegie Moscow Center said. "He sees that at the end of the day Russia's future is best served if it is integrated as part of Europe."

Project Picks Up Where It Left Off a Decade Ago

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Soon after architectural plans were drawn up a decade ago for a 55-story limestone tower at 745 Seventh Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets, the economy went into a tailspin. The owners of the site eventually had to settle for a parking lot instead of a skyscraper.
But with office space in Manhattan at a premium, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation are using the site to develop a 32-story building. Morgan Stanley is expected to begin moving in next November. 
 The building will feature retail shops on the ground floor along Seventh Avenue. Pedestrians will be able to make their way between Seventh and Fifth Avenues through a new concourse that will connect with the existing concourse under Rockefeller Center. The concourse at Seventh Avenue will be accessible from the new building and from the N and R subway station at 49th Street.
The 32-story building, along with the 41-story tower a block away at 1585 Broadway bearing the financial services company's name, is "part of Morgan Stanley's strategy to create a Midtown urban campus," said Tommy Craig, a senior vice president of Hines Interests Limited Partnership, who is overseeing the building development for Morgan Stanley. In addition to occupying all of the office space in the new building, and the tower at 1585 Broadway, Morgan Stanley will continue to occupy space in its former headquarters at 750 Seventh Avenue across the avenue from its new building, as well as in nearby Rockefeller Center buildings.
Under the arrangement with the Rockefeller Group, a subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Estate Company, Morgan Stanley will own the new building, and the Rockefeller Group will continue to own the land. Eventually -- neither party will say when -- the two companies will be equal partners in the building and the land.
Hines, which manages the Morgan Stanley building at 1585 Broadway, recently bought Morgan Stanley's building at 750 Seventh Avenue, in partnership with the General Motors Pension Trust.
The tower is being built by the Tishman Construction Corporation of New York, whose imprint is all over Times Square. It built the Morgan Stanley building on Broadway as well as its former building at 750 Seventh Avenue. It built the 48-story Conde Nast building at 42nd Street and Broadway.
It is putting the finishing touches on the 32-story Reuters building at 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue and it is building the 45-story Westin New York at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue.
After ticking off those projects, and alluding to the new building's location at the northern edge of Times Square, Daniel R. Tishman, the president of Tishman Construction, said, "This one is being built in a quieter part of town."
To reduce congestion around the construction site, Tishman has built a drive-through and loading dock behind the building, through what had been Exxon Park. The arrangement is temporary, and the park will not only be restored but also, Tishman executives say, enhanced. Meanwhile, the passageway allows delivery trucks to enter from the west on 50th Street, unload their cargo and depart on 49th Street heading west.
The building has been designed to have high visibility even at ground level. Built into the glass-and-aluminum facade at its base will be an area dedicated to a 200-foot-long, 40-foot-high display made up of high resolution, computer-programmed L.E.D.'s. The sign will also wrap around the corners of the building at both 49th and 50th Streets. In the setback directly above the display will be a map of the world almost 50 feet tall and 150 feet wide. In both sections, tenants will still be able to see out of the building.
"Our thought was that rather than having a billboard applied to the building, we should integrate the display right into the building," said Gregory Clement of Kohn Pedersen Fox, who with Kevin Kennon was the lead architect for the building.
Soon after Kohn Pedersen Fox designed what was proposed as a 55-story building back in 1990, the project became embroiled in a question of development rights, according to Jonathan D. Green, the president of the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation. Then the economy soured.
When Morgan Stanley and the Rockefeller Group got together two years ago, Kohn Pedersen Fox returned to the drawing board. But in many ways that interim, during which the Internet, e-mail and other technological innovations gained widespread use, seemed like a lifetime.
"That 55-story building was a speculative office building; this is built specifically for Morgan Stanley," Mr. Clement said. "So its technical requirements, space requirements and other needs have been apparent from the beginning."
Rob Blackman, the executive vice president in charge of the project for Tishman, said that every floor was being raised to accommodate the miles of cables and wires necessary for Morgan Stanley to operate smoothly now and in the foreseeable future. In addition to six trading floors, from the 2nd floor to the 7th, the building will contain a large cafeteria on the 9th floor and a fitness center on the 21st.
The contract requires that Tishman complete the project in 25 months. Fourteen of those months have already passed, but the project is on track.
Six weeks ago, for example, representatives of the various companies involved with the building and some 500 trade union members celebrated the "topping out" -- that is, they celebrated having erected the 12,000 pieces of structural steel in the building, a job completed in less than eight months.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. and White House Are Near Accord on Immigrants

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans said today that they were nearing agreement with the White House on legislation that would grant legal status to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants.
After resisting the idea for months, the Republicans have submitted an amnesty proposal to the White House, and they said they were inching toward an agreement that could be included in a comprehensive budget deal, clearing the way for adjournment of the 106th Congress. 
 The agreement falls far short of the comprehensive amnesty sought by President Clinton, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, immigration lawyers and civil rights groups. But the proposal goes further than most Republicans were willing to go before the Nov. 7 election, offering benefits to tens of thousands of additional immigrants.
Republicans said two factors contributed to their new stance. They want to be in tune with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, their party's presidential nominee, who has tried to cultivate good relations with Hispanic Americans. And the Republicans have been deluged with pleas from employers, who say they want to hire immigrants because, with the unemployment rate at a 30-year low, they cannot find the workers they need.
In assessing the latest Republican proposals, the White House has been consulting Hispanic groups.
Cecilia Munoz, vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights group, said: "The president's proposal would have helped 800,000 people. This deal will help fewer than 400,000. That is probably better than nothing. But there's real anger in the Latino and immigrant community that it has been whittled down so far."
Representative Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, a Democrat who is chairman of the Hispanic Caucus's study panel on immigration, said the budget bill would include some assistance for immigrants, but not enough.
"Unfortunately," Mr. Gutierrez said in an interview, "our bargaining position is weakened. You have a recalcitrant Republican Congress that wants to provide a paltry amount of justice for immigrants. And you have a president who, I believe, does not really think immigrants are as important as Medicare, school construction and other federal programs."
The emerging deal, which builds on legislation offered by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, includes these provisions:
*The government would grant a new type of visa to the spouses and minor children of certain lawful permanent resident aliens. This would help people who have been waiting for visas for three years or more. They would be allowed to come to the United States or to remain here, with the right to work, until they became permanent residents, as most eventually would.
*Immigrant spouses and minor children of permanent residents and immigrant spouses of United States citizens already living here would be allowed to apply for the new visas without returning to their homelands, as they must do under current law. The government would ignore the fact that many had illegally entered the United States or had overstayed their visas.
*The government would reopen the cases of tens of thousands of immigrants seeking amnesty in several large class-action lawsuits. These immigrants have been here for more than 18 years and would have qualified for amnesty under a 1986 law but for errors by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Congress and the White House may also grant a special dispensation to certain immigrants who are subject to deportation because they committed relatively minor crimes before 1996. Under this proposal, lawful permanent residents who have lived in the United States at least seven years could go before an immigration judge to show why they should be allowed to stay here. Under a 1996 law, a large number of offenses, including misdemeanors, were retroactively defined as aggravated felonies requiring deportation.
Republicans said they had rejected Mr. Clinton's effort to grant legal status, under a separate proposal, to tens of thousands of Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians. Supporters of this proposal said it would give these immigrants the same treatment authorized in 1997 for Nicaraguans and Cubans.
But Republicans resisted the idea. Mr. Hatch said, "It would grant a blanket amnesty to undocumented aliens and pick out specific groups of immigrants -- Central Americans -- for special treatment."
The Republicans also refused to renew a provision of immigration law that allowed large numbers of people eligible for family and employment visas to get their green cards in this country by paying a $1,000 fee. Employers, including hotels, restaurants and other service industries, lobbied for reinstatement of this provision, section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
"If all the aliens working in these industries were forced to leave, the economy would crash," said Bonnie B. Lanza, an immigration consultant in Boston.
Already, lawyers say, some immigrants have been forced to leave their jobs and their relatives in this country while pursuing their visa applications. Elliot J. Diringer, a White House spokesman, said, "We want to make sure that individuals can remain with their families in this country while their immigration status is resolved."
Congress passed a stopgap spending bill on Monday that provides money to operate much of the government through Friday. By then, Congressional leaders said, they hope to have reached agreement with Mr. Clinton on a budget for the rest of the fiscal year, which runs through through Sept. 30, 2001.

HEADLINE: Marketers Turn to a Simple Tool: E-Mail

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
SETH GODIN remembers when the dot-com people laughed at him. Mr. Godin had formed Yoyodyne, one of the early companies trying to promote Internet start-ups through the online equivalent of direct mail, which is usually referred to as junk mail.
A lack of glamour and a stench of spam -- the dreaded mass-e-mailed sucker bait of get-rich-quick schemes and online nostrums -- have long accorded e-mail declasse status among the technoids. Mr. Godin recalled that when he pitched professionally written and targeted e-mail as a low-cost, efficient and effective way to reach the online audience, the response was less than enthusiastic. E-mail is boring, he was told. 
 But guess what: now it's Mr. Godin who is laughing, along with other champions of lowly e-mail, who have watched as Internet advertising companies have flamed out after spending millions of dollars on Super Bowl commercials and spectacular multimedia online advertisements.
That is because in these times of dot-com belt-tightening, e-mail looks like a bargain. Sending out a catalog mailing can cost $1 a customer, while a personalized e-mail is 5 cents, according to a report issued earlier this year by Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. What's more, while the rate at which consumers "click through" to read banner advertisements has plummeted in the last year to less than 1 percent, the response to e-mail messages was measured in the January Forrester survey at about 10 percent, with a quarter of those actually buying something. (Because this was a one-time survey, Forrester could not determine whether the response rates are rising or declining -- but more on that later.) Direct e-mail marketers see these as positive numbers.
So, apparently, do advertisers. A Forrester survey of 50 e-mail marketing managers found that they planned to triple their e-mail spending by 2004, the year that the analysts predicted that American marketers would send almost 210 billion e-mail messages.
For consumers, such a blitz could be hellish or heavenly. To those who feel inundated by unbidden electrons and try to guard their privacy against the commercial world, no amount of online coupons will seem anything but menacing.
But for those who enjoy receiving bargain tips, who zip through their morning e-mail messages without complaint, the new age of personalized, targeted messages promises to bring information and deals they want, when they want them and where it is most convenient -- be it a home PC, hand-held organizer or squint-inducing cell-phone screen.
Most of these messages will not be spam, according to Forrester, though the onslaught of unwanted e-mails may never go away. Four years from now, Forrester predicts, most e-mail will go to consumers who agree explicitly to receive it. Most of it will be intended to hold on to current customers -- the most economical use of the medium.
The rise in the fortunes of e-mail -- now being used by retailers and e-tailers like Amazon.com, Eddiebauer.com, Barnes & Noble.com, Borders.com and Victoriasecret.com -- comes after several developments in the e-commerce universe, not least of which is the realization that money really does matter. At first, as new enterprises crowded the Internet, one significant question was hardly ever asked, and even less frequently answered: namely, who would pay for it?
Some predicted that Web companies would follow the example of newspaper publishers, who sell their product for little or nothing and make their profits from advertising sales.
BUT Internet companies have also learned an old rule of advertising, which is that even the best commercials cannot make a business successful if the business does not make sense in the first place. An online advertisement can do only so much, however refined, powerful or entertaining it may be. On the other hand, e-mail, even if it's homely, gets the job done, especially when coupled with time-tested principles of the direct-marketing industry, which boil down to "test, test, test, measure, measure, measure," said H. Robert Wientzen, the chief executive of the Direct Marketing Association.
Those who are among the best at formulating and directing e-mail are the people who are good at sending regular direct mail, old-economy types like Mr. Wientzen, who gleefully say they have beaten many new-economy people at their own game.
A recent survey for the Direct Marketing Association found that nearly all the group's members were on the Internet; 69 percent reported that their online operations were profitable, with 20 percent reporting profits of more than $1 million a year. These figures are especially hearty at a time when some of the best-financed dot-coms are circling the drain. The profitability figure, though unverified, is up from 49 percent a year ago.
"The guys who know how to do it are the ones who are going to come out ahead," Mr. Wientzen said. "I don't think that's brain surgery." The difference is the attention to detail that may make the direct marketer a bore at parties but a winner at the bank.
E-mail works precisely because its success can be calculated so extensively, William Park, the chief executive of Digital Impact, said in an e-mail interview. "It's the most measurable marketing vehicle of all time," said Mr. Park, whose company, in San Mateo, Calif., helps the Hewlett-Packard Company and other businesses reach customers through personalized e-mail and other media. "You know exactly who you are sending e-mails to, you know how they are responding -- did they click, did they buy?"
The speed of e-mail revolutionizes direct marketing, Mr. Park said. "People respond to their e-mails in a matter of days or they won't respond at all," he said. "So marketers can determine if their campaign was a success in 48 hours versus the four to six weeks it might take for a direct-mail campaign."
The combination of lower cost and greater effectiveness has made believers out of many online merchants, including Jon Nordmark, a co-founder of E-bags, which sells luggage and accessories. In the last year, he said, judicious use of e-mail has helped him lower advertising costs by two-thirds, while sales have more than doubled. Last December, the company sold 18,000 bags online; this December he said he expected to sell 43,000.
Mr. Nordmark said that his company had tried to economize from the start, while other companies spent their venture capital and stock money wildly. "Too much money makes you stupid," he said. While the flashier dot-coms are still trying to figure out how to get people to pay for something they already receive free, like online news, direct marketers are building on decades of experience in sending consumers mail they don't think they want. They are then making sales from a small but profitable fraction of the recipients. And they don't sulk that their contribution to the new economy is going unrecognized. Profits are a powerful consolation.
Along with the testing, measuring and datamongering that Mr. Park speaks of, classic direct marketing means providing the kind of customer service that puts workers on the telephone to answer questions and puts armies in the warehouses to ship products and manage the inevitable returned goods.
Mr. Wientzen recalled a recent visit to the luxurious offices of a lowerManhattan online retailer that was trying to to pull itself toward profitability. With wonder in his voice, he recalled that the first thing the company wanted to show him was its sophisticated Web site.
"They kept using the term 'storefront,' " Mr. Wientzen recalled. "I kept thinking of it as a movie set without much behind it."
Hans Peter Brondmo, the author of "The Engaged Customer: The New Rules of Internet Direct Marketing," said that gradual understanding -- that there is more to e-commerce than designing a cool Web site -- was leading to a broad change in how online companies do business.
"Marketers are having to shift their thinking into being service providers," he said, as opposed to what he calls simply telling and selling.
One company that Mr. Brondmo works with, Palm Computing, uses e-mail messages to alert customers about new software for their hand-held devices, tying the messages directly to the kind of device the customers own, as well as to their line of work. The customers reply by e-mail with questions and complaints.
The key to making e-mail effective, enthusiasts say, is getting personal, which strengthens bonds with current customers.
"If a person buys red wine, send offers related to red wine rather than discounts on white wine," Mr. Park said. "Your customer has given you permission to e-mail them; you have an obligation and an urgency to send them relevant e-mails, because if you don't, your customers will begin to ignore your messages much like they ignore banner ads."
West Shell III, the chief executive of Netcentives, a San Francisco company that helps other companies operate their e-mail marketing programs, agreed. "Relevancy drives response," he said. "If you're not relevant, you're gone." Companies like Petopia, which sells pet products, build on their knowledge of the customer with each successive e-mail by asking questions -- What is your dog's breed? What is his name? -- that are worked into future messages.
This lesson is taken to heart at LifeMinders, a company in Herndon, Va., that sends regular, personalized e-mail that includes advertising and offers of bargains to 20 million consumers. Its customers supply personal information in exchange for more accurately targeted offers, which range from discounted subscriptions to Sports Illustrated to pitches for dog food.
"If I put something as simple as the name of your dog in the subject line of your e-mail, the e-mail is opened about six times more frequently than if it were not there," said Stephen R. Chapin Jr., the chief executive of LifeMinders.
LifeMinders now helps other companies manage their e-mail marketing. Mr. Chapin came to the Internet from direct marketing, where he sold credit cards by mail. "The same thing we did in direct marketing we do in online advertising," he said.
ANOTHER lesson emerging from the e-commerce shakeout is that the Internet works better as one element of a company's marketing strategy than it does as the only way to reach consumers. Kenneth Weil, the vice president for new media at Victoria's Secret, which features supermodels wearing sexy underwear in its advertisements and in its e-mail, said his company sends e-mail to 3.3 million people, encouraging them not only to go to the Victoria's Secret Web site but also to call or visit such a store nearby.
"It's part of a greater strategy," he said, a strategy that totals $145 million in advertising and marketing expenses each year. About half the e-mail messages contain images and links to Web pages and the rest are simple text messages sent to customers whose computers can't receive more complex mail. Privacy advocates have warned that the picture-laden e-mails, because they use much of the technology from Web pages, open consumers to the same kinds of surreptitious monitoring that online sites engage in. But the use of the e-mail with pictures and Web links is sure to grow, since industry analysts estimate that those messages are about two and a half times as effective as e-mails that use plain text alone.
This being the ephemeral Web universe, there are those who detect chinks in the electronic armor of online direct mail. One is Donna Hoffman, a business professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, who studies marketing on the Internet. "Things seem good now, but, in fact, the signs are already coming," she said, that the success of e-mail marketing has led to a glut, and that "the overuse has already reduced its effectiveness."
Professor Hoffman said she had seen other industry figures that indicate the 10 percent click-through rate in the Forrester study has slipped to 5 percent. "I think it's going to go the same path as banner ads," she said. "The more of this stuff you get, the more likely you are to start deleting it. It's like, 'Enough already.' "
Several companies said they were aware of the pitfalls of overzealousness. Todd Simon, a senior vice president of Omaha Steaks and the vice chairman of Omahasteaks.com, said he wanted his companies to be known as purveyors of fine meats, not purveyors of spam. "We have to be very, very sensitive to the spamming issue," Mr. Simon said. "There's a chance if you just give them too much stuff, or they're not interested, they're going to say bye-bye."
For his part, Mr. Godin of Yoyodyne said his new passion was viral marketing, in which companies try to adapt the notion of word of mouth to the Web. Viral marketing has been praised as the next big thing; its promise, like so much in the online world, has not been borne out so far. But Mr. Godin says that is because people have not figured out how to do it right yet. He said viral marketing can take many forms, including Web pages and banner advertisements. Another one, unprepossessing as always, is e-mail.

How Much Am I Bid for This Imperfect Marketplace?

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
E-BUSINESS auctions are going, going . . . gone? Not exactly, but they are far less successful than expected. Half to two-thirds of all electronic auctions fail to result in a deal, researchers say. And instead of the predicted 10,000 or so business-to-business exchanges, with Web sites conducting countless "reverse" auctions on behalf of buyers in which the lowest price wins, at most several dozen such operations will survive.
What went wrong? It wasn't just that the pool of venture capital dried up. More important, analysts say, is that what was once seen as the electronic pathway to the perfect market -- a cyberspace buzzing with flexible prices and competitive auctions -- has turned out to have only limited applicability to most real-world business transactions. 
 "Initially, Internet technology was used to try to build marketplaces that conformed to the simple model of a public auction," said Hal R. Varian, dean of the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley. "But real markets are much messier."
Conducting an auction is an efficient way to determine the price that best balances supply and demand, but it requires assembling all potential bidders in one setting. "The challenge is to make the Net serve the variety of ways people conduct transactions," Professor Varian said, "rather than force people to conform to one model that happens to be easy to do on the Net."
Moreover, price-driven auctions are most useful for either one-of-a-kind items or standardized commodities traded in large volume. Most business deals, however, involve differentiated goods and services, turning on factors like quality, convenience and reliability as well as price.
"Price isn't everything," said Paul Milgrom, an economics professor at Stanford University and co-founder of Perfect.com, a software company devoted to more fully automating the business purchasing process. "In fact, it's rarely the most important thing."
Perfect.com is one of several software start-ups trying to move the Internet beyond the basic supply-demand curves of Economics 101, with its idealized market of uniform products and well-informed participants. Many of them are being started by economists leaping from the ivory tower and into the fray of putting theories regarding so-called imperfect markets into practice.
"All this economic theory that once was dismissed as too esoteric," Professor Varian said, "is suddenly becoming the basis for a variety of promising new business models."
Many business transactions, for example, come down to individual negotiations. At the initial stages, few buyers want to reveal how much they are willing to pay for a specific product. Most suppliers do not want to say how low they will go to close the sale.
In a public auction, maintaining that kind of secrecy is impossible. In reaching a deal, not only do the participants learn each other's positions, so do their competitors. Even when negotiations are conducted in private, two-sided deal making takes time as each side tries to eke out a slight advantage.
A new company called SplitTheDifference (www.splitthedifference.com), based in New Haven, hopes to cut through these difficulties with an online negotiating tool that it plans to operate on its own and license to other companies. "Think about the typical business deal," said Barry Nalebuff, a management professor at Yale and a game theorist who is chairman of SplitTheDifference. "There's all this gamesmanship: 'You go first,' 'No, you go first.' Do I tip my hand or do I bluff? Well, we've acted strategically in designing the game so the players don't have to act strategically when they play it."
SplitTheDifference operates like a combination neutral mediator and escrow service while creating an environment that safeguards buyers' and sellers' confidential information: reserve prices, identities and willingness to sell.
Consider this simplified example. Suppose you, a fish wholesaler, are willing to pay as much as $5,000 to acquire a particular load of fresh salmon. The fisherman is prepared to sell his catch for as little as $4,000. Both sides disclose their secret positions to the computer agent.
The software program recognizes whether a deal is possible. If not, it tells the participants to give up, try cutting a deal with somebody else or come back with different offers. If it is and both sides agree ahead of time, one solution is to split the difference automatically and conduct the transaction at $4,500. Or the gap can be closed by a random amount, preventing either buyer or seller from knowing for sure how far the other side was prepared to go. That helps to preserve freedom of action in future deals.
"This approach promises to get people to resolution very quickly," Mr. Nalebuff said. "It also allows people to do transactions on the Web without posting prices and to put different prices to different players. You know, if you make markets too perfect, there's a good chance most people won't want to participate in them."
The theory behind the company's model, which allows for much more multifaceted deals than this basic example suggests, comes from research by two economists, Geoffrey Miller of New York University and Robert H. Gertner of the University of Chicago.
SplitTheDifference says it is in beta-testing, trying its software with two clients: an established e-commerce player in the aviation parts industry, and a business-to-business start-up that will rely exclusively on the company's automated negotiation technology to execute transactions.
In contrast to SplitTheDifference, which concentrates on private negotiations between businesses, other software makers are focusing on the fact that most transactions, particularly consumer purchases, continue to involve seller-set prices attached to specific items. But there is room for innovation within this time-tested formula. Most of it is geared to helping companies better use customer feedback to establish prices and change them in response to varying conditions.
The Optivo Corporation, for example, has received money from Norwest Venture Partners to start a software application service that would allow online merchants to test an array of prices at different times. The goal: calculating how best to maximize return.
Amazon.com experimented with posting different prices to individual customers, depending on their past buying patterns. But it dropped the trial after critics attacked it as discriminatory.
Andy Atherton, Optivo's co-founder and vice president for business development, said the company preferred to let its clients "test prices sequentially, so they can understand demand without annoying customers."
"Today, companies are used to applying rules to prices and depend on manual systems to keep track of price changes," said Robert Drescher, Optivo's chief executive. "But that's becoming humanly impossible. We offer a method that allows companies to automatically put up the right prices at the right time across the entire product line."
The application program, Mr. Drescher said, can be tweaked to maximize either profits or revenue, or to generate the highest level of sales consistent with a minimum gross profit margin set by the company.
Perhaps the most ambitious of the companies trying to bring greater economic efficiency to the Internet marketplace is Perfect.com, whose software is already being used by several online business-to-business exchanges. These include Bandwidth.com, which serves as a broker between companies shopping for long-term or temporary telecommunications services and carriers offering high-speed data capacity. It is a market where a number of variables, not just price, are important.
"With at least 50 carriers hawking their wares," said David Morken, president of Bandwidth, "what you had was cacophony, with everybody yelling at customers all at the same time. Now we've got it down to a conversation."
Perfect.com's technology was inspired by the government's "request-for-purchase" system, which allows agencies to specify on paper dozens of requirements for the things they buy. But the process is normally so expensive, time-consuming and complicated that it is useful in limited circumstances.
To overcome these limitations, Perfect.com has created a kind of automated request for purchase, in which buyers can spell out quickly what they want -- from speed of delivery and length of warranty to quality and reputation. As many as 100 variables are possible. Potential sellers also fill out Web forms that describe their wares and indicate ways in which they are willing to adjust their bids to satisfy requests. The technology ranks the best offers, based on the priorities established by the buyer.
"Almost all suppliers try to differentiate themselves on things other than price," said Kevin Surace, Perfect.com's chief executive. "We modeled this on the way business is really done."
Will these academically inspired markets work?
"The true test," Professor Varian of Berkeley said, "is the marketplace."

Or You Could Call It Schadenfreude.com

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
PHILIP KAPLAN is another of those annoyingly young dot-com successes that no one with a real job wants to hear another word about. Except that his Web site is so perversely satisfying.
Mr. Kaplan, a 25-year-old graduate of Syracuse University, is the creator of a dot-com deathwatch site that is irreverent, even sophomoric, about the travails of e-commerce start-ups. The site, which calls itself a dot-com dead pool, has become so popular in its six months of existence that it now has more than 100,000 registered users, Mr. Kaplan said. And it may -- or may not -- be for sale. Mr. Kaplan is coy on that point. 
 But on most other matters he shows little reticence, as evidenced by the name he gave his site, which begins with a vulgarity that will not be used in this article. The site can be located easily, though, with a Web search of Mr. Kaplan's name along with the word "deadpool."
The site is a guilty pleasure for the thousands who check in each day to see which highflying high-technology enterprise may be on the brink of collapse. There is a section for recent catastrophes, like the failure of Pets.com; a game that awards points for correctly predicting collapses; and a solicitation to readers for gossip and rumors about impending failures.
"Rumor has it," a recent item began, that a particular e-commerce company "has closed its office and forced remaining employees to work from a current employee's basement." The e-commerce company has been selling assets to pay employees, and cut health benefits, the item said.
It is the sort of information that has the ring of an employee with no loyalty to his employer, a kind of nomadic worker not uncommon in the Internet economy. Mr. Kaplan receives 500 such e-mail messages a day from people all over the country, so many that he does not have time to read them all. "I know everything," he said. If anything bad is happening, especially in New York, where he is based, "it goes right to me," he said.
Mr. Kaplan acknowledges that most of the information he puts on his site is rumor from subscribers and friends. He has no particular standards, he said, but insists he has not been wrong yet.
He started the site last June as a hobby and to amuse his friends, he said. He notified a handful of them about it at midnight, then left about 8 the next morning for Brazil. When he returned a week later, he checked to see whether his friends had bothered to look at it and found that 20,000 people had signed on.
"I said to myself, 'I should make this into something real,' " he said. Originally crudely done, the site now has a more professional look and has attracted advertisers in addition to the 100,000 or more who play Mr. Kaplan's game and the 40,000 who receive his electronic newsletter. "To this day, I've only ever told six people to check out the site," he said, with more than a little wonder.
Mr. Kaplan's timing could not have been better, coming just as many of the shakier e-commerce sites have begun to run out of the venture capital that propelled them and found it impossible to generate sufficient revenue. But two factors may get in the way of the continued success of the site and Mr. Kaplan's ability to sell it. First, the site's viability depends on a steady drumbeat of bad e-commerce news, and there is a limit to the number of companies that can fail. Once the shakeout is over, interest may wane. In addition, the site's salty name makes it difficult to advertise and promote and may put off potential buyers.
But Mr. Kaplan seems unconcerned. "I really write the site for myself," he said, adding that he spends only about two hours on it each day. His real job is operating his company, PK Interactive, which, he said, "builds back-end software solutions for Web sites." That business, which has five full-time employees, is doing well, he added.
Whatever happens, Mr. Kaplan takes comfort in the notion that he will be remembered as a player in the great e-commerce revolution. "I was a little scab," he said, "on the side of the whole thing."

Sure, It Would Be Easier on the Web -- but Let's Haggle!

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
THE advertising industry is a $200 billion annual business that prides itself on its sophistication, but this is how advertisers buy time or space for their ads, a process known as media buying:
They first scan thick, frequently outdated directories to find broadcast stations or periodicals whose viewers or readers seem to meet their needs. Then they send individually prepared "avail" (as in availability) requests. 
 Media sellers, like television stations, reply, often in writing. A flurry of faxes, phone calls and extensive negotiations ensue. Different deals for different customers may result, depending on many factors that can change at any time. If the parties have a personal relationship, it can mean a significantly lower advertising rate.
Once a deal is struck, there is the follow-up, with clerks typing invoices and agency representatives "trafficking," or monitoring each advertisement to make certain it runs when it should. If it does not (a relatively frequent occurrence), representatives find out why and follow up with "make good" rescheduling.
In short, media buying remains one of the most old-fashioned, time-consuming procedures performed in the world of commercial communication. It seems as if it is from the Dickens era rather than from the information age. Surely, if anything were destined for modernization courtesy of the Internet, this would have to be it.
Right?
Not necessarily.
"The Internet absolutely holds the potential to redefine the process by which media is bought and sold," said Christopher Todd, an analyst with Jupiter Research in New York. Mr. Todd studies the two dozen or so companies that over the last few years have been trying to apply the Internet's efficiency to the buying and selling of online and traditional offline media, like radio, television and print. "But up until now, they have had a lot of trouble."
That is because the sites have failed to "articulate a value proposition," Mr. Todd said. Besides, this is a field where "people are used to making deals while playing golf or being wined and dined."
More significant, the difficulty occurs because the idea of an advertising marketplace is fundamentally an oxymoron, said Jim Nail, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who specializes in online marketing and advertising.
"Marketplaces are all about transparent information, more choice and increased competition," Mr. Nail said. "But that's the last thing that media sellers want." He said they preferred to withhold information about inventory and price so that they could make different kinds of deals with different buyers, deals that are never knowingly revealed to competing advertisers.
Thus, while media buyers are presumably ready to embrace an open system that will give them more information, the owners of television and radio stations and periodicals can hardly be expected to share that enthusiasm. Indeed, because of seller resistance, none of the media-buying Internet sites are handling more than a small fraction of the media purchases made each year in the United States.
So what model can work? Adauction.com of San Francisco, one of the first such sites, tried a remnant inventory and auction model, but buyers did not go for it: the inventory was not particularly appealing -- and sellers were aghast at having their cards on the table. So Adauction changed its name -- it is now known as OneMedia Place -- and its approach.
"We now use an exchange model," said Les Margulis, a vice president at OneMedia Place. "Buyers can go to our site and send buy requests to any media, and media can respond."
Bowing to the realities of a business where individual contact is of paramount importance, the parties can also negotiate on the side.
Other sites use variations on a similar theme, "baking the same cake but using different frosting," Mr. Todd of Jupiter said. For example, emadison (www.emadison .com), in Fremont, Calif., and in New York, allows buyers or sellers to initiate transactions but makes provisions for people who want to "pick up the phone" to negotiate, said L. Donald Robinson, the vice chairman and chief marketing officer.
And recognizing that sellers are rarely interested in revealing their inventory or price to everyone, Adoutlet.com in New York allows media sellers to designate just what can be shown to whom and at what price, Alan Masarek, the chief executive, said.
The sites earn their revenue either from a fee for each transaction, generally levied on the media seller, or from licensing their software and systems. In this regard, they offer another powerful lure to buyers and sellers -- automation of the tedious back-office procedures like invoicing and trafficking that relegate much of the process to the technological Stone Age. This is especially true of BuyMedia Inc. (www.buy media.com), a Burlingame, Calif., company that this year acquired Marketron, TVScan and Cablescan, the offline, back-end processing systems that are the industry standard for radio, television and cable.
BuyMedia's president, Mike Jackson, contends that this gives his company, which is now testing its media-buying Web portal, an enormous advantage over competitors by providing access to and integration with the systems that sellers are already using, and to all the information they contain.
"We have the data," Mr. Jackson said. "And they don't."
Mr. Nail of Forrester credits BuyMedia for trying to "infiltrate" a hidebound industry through "existing buying and trafficking players and then remaking the processes around the Internet." Other companies' efforts to move media buying and planning to the Web may be too disruptive, he said.
But Mr. Nail added that even BuyMedia's incremental conversion process might not be enough. Some things just do not lend themselves sufficiently to automation to make them worthwhile, except as back-office systems, he said.
"There are the personal relationships in media buying," he said. "And there are the subtle, but important, differences in similar-seeming media," like various sports or fashion publications, which have nuances that are too fine for computers to grasp, but are critical to successful media buying.
As a result, analysts like Mr. Nail and Mr. Todd at Jupiter see continued industry resistance, and predict that only a few sites will survive.
And that is being optimistic.
"There may never be a market for this," Mr. Nail said.

The Internet Gives Corporate Banking a Do-It-Yourself Look

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE 

 BODY:
ANYONE can be a travel agent, stock trader or retailer, thanks to the Internet. Now companies are becoming their own bankers as well, turning to online transactions or Web marketplaces that limit, or even eliminate, a traditional banker's role between buyer and seller. That can cut into the services that have defined corporate banking for generations.
Automakers, large retailers and industrial companies have had banking or finance operations for years to help underwrite customer purchases, raise capital or support other credit functions. Analysts predict that other corporations will become their own banks, using outside institutions for only the most complex financial transactions. 
 Banking has never truly been about finance, say those who are remaking the staid world of corporate banking. It has been about access to information about finance. The Internet allows information to flow instantly between the parties in a transaction. Earlier systems had built-in delays because of mail, fax or phone delivery, and multiple levels of management needed to approve payment.
Using open Internet standards, participants can revise an invoice anywhere a Web connection exists. Invoices become a work-in-progress, subject to changes and, potentially, resolutions. On the Web, corporate controllers receive last-minute reports on dozens of accounts, which a decade ago might have required multiple phone calls.
The change allows controllers to reclaim "float," the interest on bills that have not been paid and that used to require weeks to collect. They can accumulate balances across a corporation's various divisions, to earn higher interest rates. And they have greater control about releasing payments.
"The typical treasury can save 25 or 30 percent in cross-border transactions that can cost a company anywhere from $15 to $30 each," said Octavio Lorente, the chief executive of Celent Communications, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. "And every dollar the company saves represents a dollar out of the bank's profits. It's strictly an information-based function that you really no longer have to pay for if you choose to create an internal, virtual bank."
Over the last few years, nonbank companies, like Ariba Inc., CommerceOne Inc. and BankServ have devised alternative ways for companies to make transactions. Companies can use their software to send transactions through the Automated Clearing House network in North America or the Swift system in Europe, both of which process electronic payments. Other companies are performing functions handled previously by banks, including credit checks, foreign currency trading and credit card and check processing.
In late 1998, Hamilton Sundstrand, the aerospace manufacturing division of the United Technologies Corporation, began a program using NetTransact -- a Web-based system that allows companies to present billing information and receive payments electronically -- to send secure invoices to clients. The company used the system to share and monitor invoices with clients instantly around the world. Other corporations like Nabisco and Frito-Lay used the system, which was initially developed by the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
"We can capture savings in invoicing, accounts receivable, collections and cash flow all at the same time," said Thomas Rogan, the chief financial officer of Hamilton Sundstrand, based in Windsor Locks, Conn. "In the aerospace industry, we have relatively few customers -- these are companies like Boeing Corporation or American Airlines -- and they don't hold up payments because they're short of cash. But they won't pay if they don't get the right part and the right paper in the right place at the right time."
Instead of waiting 30 to 60 days to learn about problems with an invoice, Mr. Rogan added, the company can get a response, fix the problem and collect payment before it becomes delinquent. That has repercussions for logistics, finance, manufacturing and departments working together, said Barbara Macy, the manager of financial electronic commerce at Hamilton Sundstrand.
The company has not yet identified the total savings from its online initiatives, but in the two years the company has used NetTransact, it reported a 10 percent reduction in its daily outstanding sales, a measure of corporate receivables. Hamilton Sundstrand has a small number of invoices compared with other firms, Mr. Rogan said, with average sales of $5,000 to $10,000. He predicted that if only 20 percent of customers participated, the company could speed up collection of as much as 80 percent of its receivables. Another benefit was the opportunity to convert a paper trail, confirming delivery of the company's goods, to an electronic platform because many of its buyers and suppliers already exchange data electronically.
"Our customers seem more willing to contact us, and the communications channels have widened," Ms. Macy said. "Many of our international customers pay by wire transfer, and that can cost $35 or $45 per transaction. Plus our customers can print out the paperwork and get processed for customs payments or transportation. That represents both a cost saving and time saving."
Turning the presentation of billing information and payment into an interactive process is changing a system that has relied on trust since its beginnings. Ninety percent of the estimated 12 billion business-to-business billing transactions in North America are done on paper, with about 10 percent handled electronically, said Joseph Mullen, the chief operating officer at Bottomline Technologies Inc., a company in Portsmouth, N.H., that acquired NetTransact from Northern Trust.
Mr. Mullen said the online invoice system was comparable to programs that allow packages to be tracked online. Using NetTransact, both parties can discuss discounts or changes. United Technologies invested $10 million in Bottomline Technologies and has expanded its system to other operations.
"We estimate that 30 percent of invoicing is incorrect," Mr. Mullen said. "If clients say, 'There's a mistake, I'm not paying until you correct it,' then an astute executive knows this system is about getting paid faster. Companies don't keep money in a safe within their offices. Instead of competing with a trusted financial institution, they want to find ways to cooperate with them. The bank may lose its lockbox business, but will find new services to provide."
Banking services are becoming a commodity, said Stephen Franco, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, an equities research firm in San Francisco. Conservative bankers, reluctant to adapt to new technology, are being forced to reckon with the Net and its ability to speed up processes, cut costs and improve services.
"The bank's role as a gatekeeper is ending," Mr. Franco said. "Right now, there are different companies working on escrow services, credit, authentication and other services. Banks have won their clients' trust over the past 100 years. And large corporations have multiple banks for the same reasons they have multiple suppliers -- they don't want to be held captive. Today's banks will be marginalized if they let it happen."

HEADLINE: Mississippi Urged to Drop Stars and Bars From Its Flag

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., Dec. 12

 BODY:
A state commission recommended today that Mississippi hold a referendum next year and vote to eliminate a Confederate symbol from the state's flag.
The 17-member biracial commission, appointed by Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, said the state could heal old wounds by eliminating the Confederate battle flag from the state flag's top left corner. The recommendation will be forwarded to the Legislature, which convenes on Jan. 2. 
 "I'm elated this day has finally arrived," said State Senator David L. Jordan, a civil rights leader. "We don't need to draw lines and be polarized over an emblem."
But John Thomas Cripps, who plans to run for governor in three years on a Southern heritage platform, described the commission's recommendation as "political correctness" that was "at the expense of history."
Governor Musgrove, a first-term Democrat, appointed the commission this summer to consider new flag designs. Mr. Musgrove acted after the State Supreme Court ruled that, technically, the current state flag had no official standing, because the 1894 law so designating it was repealed in 1906, although apparently inadvertently.
The commission held a series of hearings characterized by death threats against several members and bitter disputes between blacks and whites in attendance.
In the end, the commissioners proposed a design in which the Confederate symbol would be replaced by a red box bearing 20 stars, representing, in part, Mississippi's admission to the Union as the 20th state. But they also recommended that the matter be put to a referendum, a compromise intended to accommodate backers of the current flag, who expect large numbers of Mississippi's white majority to turn out in support.
The recommendation was adopted today by voice vote. The only dissent among the 17 commissioners came from a black member who opposed the referendum.
Only one other state has the Confederate battle flag in the design of its state flag. That is Georgia, where black political and civic leaders have pushed for a similar change.
In South Carolina, the Legislature agreed this year to remove the Confederate battle flag from atop the Statehouse. But that state remains under an economic boycott led by the N.A.A.C.P., because rather than removing the battle flag entirely, the lawmakers, in a compromise, repositioned it to a spot in front of the Statehouse.
Here in Jackson, supporters of a new flag design hinted that the boycott being waged in South Carolina could be duplicated in Mississippi.
One black member of the commission, Representative Edward Blackmon Jr., said that if Mississippi voters defeated the new flag, "the economic and public relations consequences will be disastrous."

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA;
A Glass Half Full: The Potter as Prodigious Pragmatist

BYLINE: By Jo Thomas 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
When Eleanor Roosevelt first saw Viktor Schreckengost's "Jazz" bowl, a ceramic punch bowl in an electric shade of turquoise that celebrates and pokes fun at night life in New York, she was so delighted that she commissioned two more.
Since then millions of Americans have seen and used Mr. Schreckengost's designs without ever knowing his name: bicycles, dinnerware, riding mowers, lawn chairs and those small cars and fire engines children pedaled on the sidewalk in the 1940's and 50's. 
 The work of Mr. Schreckengost, a pioneer in industrial design, went on display at the Cleveland Museum of Art on Nov. 12 in an exhibition that will continue through Feb. 4.
Shortly before the show opened, Mr. Schreckengost, who is now 94, arrived to see how the installation was going. "I think people will ask, 'Why did you do so many different things?' " he said as he gazed at the profusion of objects. "But, why not?"
Most of his relatives were potters, with some exceptions like Ossee Schreckengost, who was a catcher for the old Philadelphia Athletics and was mentioned in the Frank Sinatra movie "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." His father worked for the French China Company in Sebring, Ohio, and Viktor, who worked there through high school, decided never to become a potter, enrolling instead at the Cleveland Institute of Art to study cartooning. But when he saw modern Viennese ceramics in 1929 he decided to make ceramic sculpture his life's work.
After graduation he went to Vienna to study with Michael Powolny, then returned to Cleveland as the youngest teacher at the Institute of Art and as a designer for Cowan Pottery, where he made the "Jazz" bowl, now an Art Deco classic, in 1930.
For inspiration he drew on memories of a stroll uptown from Times Square to the Cotton Club in Harlem then down to Radio City Music Hall, and the bowl depicts skyscrapers awash with stars, bubbles, bottles and blue light. Its revelers are oblivious to Prohibition and half expecting a hangover.
He sent the bowl and a bill for $50 to the company that ordered it. Then Mrs. Roosevelt sent a check and an order for two more bowls, one for her home in Hyde Park and one for the White House. She was certain that her husband would win the presidency in the 1932 election.
In December 1931 Cowan Pottery folded and Mr. Schreckengost began to design dinnerware for restaurants. The lower-priced restaurants wanted cups in which coffee cooled rapidly, allowing a quicker turnover. Nightclubs wanted cups that would keep the coffee hot, so paying customers would linger. The Statler Hotel chain, which was selling beer for five cents a glass, wanted mugs that did not hold much, so Mr. Schreckengost designed one with a bottom that extended halfway up the mug.
In 1932 he designed what was perhaps the first line of modern dinnerware for American hotels and restaurants, "Econo-Rim," for Onandaga Pottery in Syracuse. He reduced the width of the rim on the plates and increased the capacity of the well, making it possible to serve what appeared to be a larger meal on a smaller plate.
In the same year Mr. Schreckengost also changed the look of the American truck. Ray Spiller, chief engineer of the White Motor Company in Cleveland and the husband of one of his students, asked him to design a truck in which the engine would sit under the cab.
Back then the length of a truck was limited by law to 42 feet. Mr. Schreckengost's final design took five feet off the front of the truck and added five feet to the hauling area. With the money to be earned with extra cargo space, the entire truck could be paid for in a single year.
Later Mr. Schreckengost designed toy vehicles that children could actually drive: pedal cars and trucks, fire engines and racing cars, all made to fit the proportions of children measured in homes, hospitals and playgrounds, long before the age of ergonomics.
Later Mr. Schreckengost reasoned that the appeal of pedal toys could be extended to lawn mowers, and in 1969 he began to design riding lawn mowers for both the Murray Ohio Company and the Craftsman brand of Sears, one like a tractor and one like a golf cart.
He also designed bicycles for Murray, which sold millions of them under as many as 108 different labels for Sears, Roebuck and Company, Western Auto and later Kmart and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. His first bicycle, the Mercury, streamlined with sculptured chrome, was exhibited at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.
Henry Adams, the curator of American painting at the Cleveland Museum, writes in the catalogue for this exhibition that the phrase "industrial design" was not coined until 1927. That was the year Henry Ford abruptly shut down production of the Model T to retool for the more visually appealing Model A at a cost of $18 million in what one observer called "the most expensive art lesson in history."
"An amazing number of objects that we handle every day did not exist until about a century ago," Mr. Adams says. "Other things, while they existed, are utterly different from those used for most of human history. Few changes in human history have been so far-reaching and momentous as this change in 'ordinary objects.' "
Mr. Schreckengost founded the design department at the Cleveland Institute of Art in the 1920's and taught several famous automotive designers, including Joe Oros, designer of the 1965 Ford Mustang.
One morning recently before going to see the current show, Mr. Schreckengost offered a critique to students who were designing tables and chairs. "Instead of getting it up to scale," he said, "they were down to a quarter-size. There is no way anybody could determine whether a table's worth a damn down at that size."
One of his best-known designs is the metal Beverly Hills lawn chair of 1941. In preparation he cut a barrel down to the right height, put a mound of soft clay covered with plastic on top, and, he said, "stood outside the dining room and offered everyone a chit for a drink if they'd sit down on it."
"I had 428 fannies sit on that. Then I took it right in and made a mold off of it. If you sit on it, it's wonderful."

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Germanys;
Gunter Grass on His New Book and His 'Strenuous Homeland'

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: CASAIS, Portugal

 BODY:
As a late autumn sun warms the red tiles of Gunter Grass's getaway here, northern Germany could not seem farther away. Yet even in this isolated corner of southern Portugal, where the author escaped a year ago to prepare his Nobel address to the Swedish Academy, where he vacations every summer with his grandchildren, where he now fills his afternoons painting watercolors, Mr. Grass never quite leaves Germany.
His "strenuous homeland," as he likes to call it, is the principal theme of his literature. It is his favorite topic of conversation. It is also the frequent target of his wrath. 
 Germany, of course, is no less haunted by Mr. Grass. Since the publication of "The Tin Drum" in 1959 turned him into a household name at the age of 32, he has gone out of his way to lecture, even hector, his fellow Germans on their past and present failings. He has done so in novels, plays and essays as well as in political speeches and newspaper articles. And all too often he has said what many people did not want to hear.
When his latest novel, "Ein Weites Feld," was published in German in 1995, he provoked a fresh scandal by portraying German unification in 1990 as West Germany's de facto occupation of East Germany. Naturally, Mr. Grass was unrepentant. Indeed, attacks on the book -- including a photograph on the cover of Der Spiegel, the mass circulation news weekly, showing a well-known literary critic tearing up the novel -- helped sales reach 350,000 in one year.
Five years later, with the book finally appearing in the United States under the title "Too Far Afield" (Harcourt), this 1999 Nobel laureate in literature feels further vindicated: he believes that time has proved him right.
"The reality is much darker than I presented it," said Mr. Grass, 73, peering over half-moon glasses and puffing on his trademark pipe. "The wall has gone, but Germany is still divided. People in the East were happy in 1989 when the wall came down, but then the West Germans arrived like colonizers. They didn't accept that the East Germans had a different biography, that they had gone from Hitler to Stalin, that they had never had a democratic experience."
"They had to live their own lives," he went on. "But West Germans said: 'Forget about it. It was all a mistake. Now do as we did in the West and you will be happy.' But we didn't know each other and we still don't know each other. The ignorance in the West makes it very difficult. Further, West Germany now owns East Germany. This is a terrible kind of colonization, and it will go on. So what I try to show in my novel is how it began, its criminal beginnings."
In its central political message, the 658-page book targets Treuhand, the government body charged with privatizing or shutting down thousands of East German companies after unification. Translated in English as the Handover Trust, it is presented in "Too Far Afield" as a heartless instrument of capitalism that put millions of East Germans out of work and handed over the economic remnants of the Communist regime to avaricious West German investors.
"Treuhand worked for four years without any democratic control," Mr. Grass said.
The novel's literary embrace, however, is far wider. At one level, it tells its story through two former East German government workers: Theo Wuttke, erudite, eccentric and dreamy, who had been a guide and a lecturer at the Cultural Union; and Ludwig Hoftaller, Wuttke's "day-and-night shadow," who had worked as a spy for the Stasi. Both now 70, they end up with jobs in the Handover Trust.
But the novel also works on other levels. Wuttke, for instance, is not only an expert on the 19th-century historian and novelist Theodor Fontane (who is referred to here only as "The Immortal"), but he also identifies with Fontane to the point of being known as Fonty and of frequently reliving this writer's life. Hoftaller's personality, on the other hand, merges with that of Tallhover, a 19th-century spy for the Prussian empire and its successor, the Second Reich.
Mr. Grass, in turn, uses Fontane-Wuttke and Tallhover-Hoftaller and their collective memories to lead readers through Germany's convulsed history from its first unification in 1871 to its second unification in 1990. Some of this is symbolized by the Treuhand headquarters in former East Berlin. Built for the Nazis' Air Ministry, it was called the House of Ministries under Communism and, after Treuhand had done its work, it became the country's new Finance Ministry.
Reviewing "Too Far Afield" in The New York Times Book Review on Nov. 5, James J. Sheehan described it as "a quieter, gentler book" than "The Tin Drum" and "far more interesting and accessible" than Mr. Grass's "self-indulgent" novels of the 1970's and 80's. "It is the work of a seasoned craftsman," he wrote, "certain of what he wants to do, completely in control of his gifts."
At center stage throughout the book is Berlin, a city that was home to Mr. Grass for 35 years until he moved to Lubeck, a northern city, in 1995. During his long years in West Berlin, he rarely visited the East: he was declared persona non grata there after the publication of his 1966 play, "The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising," about the 1956 workers' revolt in East Berlin. Then, when the wall came down, he immediately began traveling in East Germany.
"I had always believed in the possibility of unification, but from the beginning, I said we have to go slowly and carefully," he recalled. "But Helmut Kohl was interested only in winning the 1990 election. East Germany had paid more for the lost war than West Germany. We had the Marshall Plan, freedom, a mild occupation. They had the Soviet Union. We had to share the burden. But Kohl was afraid of raising taxes. So we destroyed the East German economy."
Even here, sipping white wine on the shaded terrace of his Portuguese home overlooking an empty valley 10 miles from the Atlantic coast, this writer never lets go. He denounces Germany for turning away asylum-seekers. He accuses mainstream German politicians of encouraging the extreme right by criticizing immigration from the third world. He also worries that younger German writers do not speak out.
"The line for young writers is, 'Don't touch politics,' " he said. " 'Only tell your story. Look to American literature.' Many young writers are influenced by American writers, not always the best. And they are afraid to touch political problems. Then they are astonished when they are victims of political developments. For me, politics is a terribly important part of reality. If I ignore it, that is also a political action."
Unlike many younger writers, of course, Mr. Grass has had his own life shaped -- or rather misshapen -- by politics. Born in 1927 in the port of Danzig (now Gdansk in Poland), he was 12 when the city was incorporated into the Third Reich in 1939. Like other children, he was a member of the Hitler Youth and, at 16, was recruited into the army, only to be captured in 1945 and held prisoner for almost a year. He was then released into a devastated Germany.
His first dream was to become a sculptor, but when he sought entry into the fine arts academy in Dusseldorf, a friendly professor told him to return a year or two later. "The school had no coal for heating, so he told me to find a job as a stone mason," Mr. Grass recalled. "It was very good advice: not to begin with artwork but with gravestones. They are always needed. Also, the farmers would pay for the gravestones with potatoes or half a pig, so we had food."
Finally he was able to study art, first in Dusseldorf, then in Berlin, where he joined an avant-garde circle known as Gruppe 47. It was also in Berlin that Mr. Grass first tried his hand at poetry.
"Then one of the older writers of Group 47 said to me, 'You have to stop playing the artist, you have to be confronted with some resistance to find what you really have to write about,' " he said. "I told him about my background in Danzig and he said, 'Write about it.' I had never thought about writing a novel. It will be my first and last novel, I presumed."
The result was the picaresque "Tin Drum," which with his subsequent "Cat and Mouse" and "Dog Years" became known as the Danzig Trilogy and established Mr. Grass as the foremost German writer of his generation. No less significantly, in "The Tin Drum," through the testimony of 3-year-old Oskar Matzerah, who stopped growing, Mr. Grass revived the specter of the Nazi years in a Germany that was eager to forget.
Since then, Mr. Grass's life has consisted of a long battle against political amnesia. He accepts his own guilt for the past ("I belonged to the Hitler Youth and I believed in its aims up to the end of the war") but recognizes that a problem arises with many young Germans. "I see this with my own children and grandchildren," he said. "I tell them, 'You are not guilty, but you have to take care that things like that never happen again.' That's all. And that's enough. They have the memory."
In the angry debate that preceded the recent decision to build a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, unsurprisingly, Mr. Grass also had an opinion: he was opposed to a memorial dedicated only to Hitler's Jewish victims.
"They are separating the Jews, just as the Nazis did," he said. "It is a mistake. There should be a memorial to all the victims of the Nazis; Jews, of course, but also 500,000 Gypsies, hundreds of thousands of Poles and Russians, everyone."
Ever the maverick, always the outsider, Mr. Grass is, of course, used to being impugned. "It's fun for some critics to attack me," he said with a chuckle. Indeed, when he finally won the Nobel Prize in literature (he had long been a contender), it was also read as an endorsement of his political bluntness. "In public debate, he is a source of strength and of irritation," the Swedish Academy noted admiringly.
For Mr. Grass, though, the Nobel Prize was a reward for a lifetime of writing, from "The Tin Drum" to "Too Far Afield." Further, he observed, he has always firmly rejected the idea that a writer can serve as a nation's conscience.
"You cannot delegate your conscience to writers or anyone else," he said. "I don't speak out because I am a writer. My profession is a writer, but I speak out because I am a citizen. I think the Weimar Republic collapsed and the Nazis took over in 1933 because there were not enough citizens. That's the lesson I have learned. Citizens cannot leave politics just to politicians."

HEADLINE: Irish Peat Company Adapts to Change

BYLINE: By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Of all the economic changes taking place in Ireland, few are as dramatic as the ones occurring at the national institution known for supplying peat.
For 50 years, Bord na Mona has provided bricks of the dried plant matter, cut from the ground of Irish bogs, to power plants that burn it to generate electricity. 
 Despite the opening of a $110 million peat-fired plant late last month, however, peat may soon lose its age-old status as Ireland's favorite fuel. Such operations are losing ground to cheaper and more efficient alternatives, like gas-fired power plants and wind farms. Only a handful of other peat companies operate in Ireland, and they serve small local markets.
Bord na Mona, a state-owned company once reviled by conservationists for destroying ecologically sensitive bogs, has responded by reducing costs sharply; cutting its work force in half, to 2,000; and reorienting itself toward what it says are environmentally friendly peat products.
One traditional product, sphagnum peat moss, sold under the Shamrock brand by the Scotts Company, already makes Bord na Mona Ireland's largest exporter by volume. Each year, it ships 15,000 containers, each 40 feet long, to supply gardens in countries like Britain, France, the Netherlands and the United States.
But it is also exploring new uses for peat, including soaking up offensive factory odors and filtering residential sewage from North Carolina to California. Revenues from environmental products rose 25 percent, to 12.3 million euros ($10.9 million), in the company's last fiscal year.
Still, environmental products accounted for only 9 percent of revenues from peat sales in the year to March 2000, up from 2.3 percent in the 1996 fiscal year. That increase was also partly a result of a decline in sales of other products.
"The big challenge is to grow the environmental business in the U.S.," said Donal Clarke, a Bord na Mona spokesman. "It could be enormous for us."
Bord na Mona recently received regulatory approval for its residential sewage filter, called Puraflo, in several states. Licenses are pending in other states.
Puraflo, which is designed to supplement or replace septic-tank systems, uses peat fiber rather than the soft brown peat bricks sometimes seen blazing in Irish pubs. Peat fiber, from the roots and stems of bog cotton plants, contains microbes that help to clean wastewater.
The market for such systems has just begun to grow, said Martin Hally, president of Bord na Mona's environmental products unit in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency said in September that peat appears to be more efficient in treating effluent in septic systems than traditional sand filters, though long-term data is not yet available.
Puraflo's advantages over traditional septic systems include a smaller drain field and minimal maintenance, Mr. Hally said.
United States revenues from Puraflo will hit $2.5 million this year. Bord na Mona expects them to pass $4 million in 2001. "We are a very significant player in the market over here," Mr. Hally said.
Bord na Mona already sells environmental products, including Puraflo, in Ireland. In England, it sells peat-based air filters to chemical manufacturers to let them capture odors from their production plants.
Bord na Mona's new interest in the environment is cautiously welcomed by some Irish conservationists. For decades, Bord na Mona acted like an arrogant landowner, with minimal regard for the environment, said Peter Foss, chairman of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council.
But during its restructuring in the early 1990's, Bord na Mona promised not to excavate new bogs, and sold several fragile sites to conservation agencies. It also pledged to rehabilitate bogs into farmland or forest after harvesting the peat.
For some environmentalists, almost anything is better than using peat for fuel. "Taking peat and burning it is the most unecological thing you can do with it," said Dr. Foss.
Diversification has improved Bord na Mona's bottom line as well as its image. The company said in March that its annual profit had increased 35 percent, to a record $12.4 million, on total sales of $174 million. (Bord na Mona also deals in oil and coal.)
European Union rules and the desire for greater competition are pushing the Irish government to privatize most of its companies, This is typically done through a stock market offering.
While Bord na Mona became a public limited company, comparable to a corporation in the United States, in January 1999 to prepare for eventual sale to the public, the government does not intend to sell shares soon, said a government press officer, Richard Moore.
Company officials say they are not worried about stock sales. "We are not concerned as to who our shareholder is," said Mr. Clarke, the Bord na Mona spokesman. "We know which way the wind's blowing."

HEADLINE: Artists vs. Dot-Coms: Fighting San Francisco's Gold Rush

BYLINE: By BILL HAYES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
ON the evening of Dec. 2, AK Press, an anarchist book publisher, held an eviction party, an increasingly common occasion here. Four years after moving into an unheated warehouse in the Mission District, it had fallen victim to spiraling rents. "Dress warm," the invitation warned. A few blocks away, on newly fashionable Valencia Street, restaurants offered valet parking. But AK Press's guests -- a mix of graying bohemians and magenta-haired young activists -- arrived mostly by bike or by bus.
"We need to live in a neighborhood of political writers, activists and artists," said Craig Gilmore, 50, an AK editor in a waist-length braid and a "Class War!" T-shirt. "Until now, that's been the Mission District. But when our lease is up, our rent will triple, which makes it impossible to stay." 
 When AK Press moved into the warehouse in 1996, the Mission was still a predominantly Latino and working-class neighborhood, dotted with tacquerias and auto-body shops. Today, more than 400 Internet firms are based there and in the adjacent South of Market district, an area which, along with nearby Potrero Hill, has come to be known as Multimedia Gulch.
The dot-com gold rush is blamed for introducing Manhattan-style traffic jams and unwanted development into San Francisco's famously picturesque neighborhoods, while skyrocketing rents drive out artists, cultural groups and working-class families. According to the California Association of Realtors, the median price of a single-family home in San Francisco is now $463,990, a 25.9 percent increase since October 1999. Meanwhile, there are 7.5 evictions a day, according to the San Francisco Tenants Union, an advocacy group.
During the summer, a citywide coalition of artists, activists and nonprofit groups collected 30,000 signatures, 10,000 more than was required, to place an antidevelopment referendum called Proposition L on the November ballot. While the measure would have actually increased the amount of new office space that could be built in the city, it would have banned such development from the Mission and other largely residential neighborhoods. It would also have closed a loophole that allows Internet companies to occupy and construct "live/work lofts," meant for artists, that are exempt from certain development taxes.
Proposition L was defeated by a paper-thin margin of 0.4 percent. A less restrictive slow-growth measure backed by Mayor Willie Brown also failed, leaving San Francisco's current regulations unchanged.
Antidevelopment activists staged more than three dozen rallies in the days leading up to the Nov. 7 election. In one of the campaign's more enduring images, a group of demonstrators calling themselves Art Strikes Back smashed a computer with a baseball bat outside city hall. Oddly enough, many supporters of Proposition L work for dot-coms, and their campaign relied heavily on the Internet to organize meetings and reach voters and the news media.
Mara Brazer, the president of the San Francisco Partnership, a pro-business nonprofit group, defended the dot-com industry, saying that the slow-growth advocates unfairly vilify an industry that helped pull San Francisco out of a punishing recession in the 1990's and created some 40,000 local jobs. "The Internet industry has become a scapegoat," she said, "partly due to a mythology that's built up about young, latte-swilling, S.U.V.-driving dot-com millionaires."
Ms. Brazer predicted that the slowdown in the nation's economy and deflation of the dot-com boom that appear already to be under way will curb city growth. Across the country, dot-com layoffs in November were up 55 percent from October, according to a survey conducted by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a national employment service.
The slow-growth movement is particularly ardent in San Francisco, Ms. Brazer said, because of its geography. The city is just 47 square miles, and it is bordered on three sides by water, so there is limited room for growth. "Everybody wants to see the city preserved just as it was when they fell in love with it," she said.
Proposition L's defeat does not appear to have ended the movement. Organizers of the measure have been working with sympathetic members of the Board of Supervisors to draft legislation that would accomplish what Proposition L had proposed. "And if that all fails," said Debra Walker, a Mission District painter and co-chairwoman of the "Yes on L" committee, "we're ready to get new signatures and go back as soon as we can on a special election."
On the night of AK Press's eviction party, Susan Schwartzenberg, 49, a photographer, stood on its warehouse's back patio, projecting her photographs of demolished neighborhood landmarks and artists' studios on a cement wall. The images illustrated the book "Hollow City" (Verso), written by Rebecca Solnit. Ms. Schwartzenberg has been evicted twice in the last two years. In 1998, she lost her work studio when an Internet firm leased the entire building. Next month, she will vacate her studio at Market and Seventh Streets -- "the last vestige of skid row," she calls it. The eight-story building was bought by a Michigan-based real-estate development firm.
"The whole flavor of San Francisco is changing so drastically," Ms. Schwartzenberg said. "New condominiums spring up overnight. I remember old bookstores or some curmudgeonly writer who used to live up there and I think: What happened to him? What happened to that bookstore?"

HEADLINE: Honey, They Blew Up The Housewares

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AS Edwin Perez described it, he might have been helping an untrained rider onto a stamping horse.
"She was frightened," Mr. Perez, a salesman at Gracious Home on the Upper East Side, said of a recent customer who was looking at a 13-quart Le Creuset enameled cast-iron pot. "By the weight." 
 Mr. Perez's client walked in looking for a pot to make rice in. The French oven, which weighs 23 pounds empty and 49 pounds when topped off with liquid, is the largest piece Le Creuset makes. It might have been designed for potluck at Versailles. "Most people think it's too big," Mr. Perez said. "But where are you going to go with this? A few feet, stove to table. You're not going up stairs with it."
The woman left the store, listing like a boat -- the sink-size pot in a shopping bag.
During the last few years of economic balance, there has been a strange kind of inflation at work in and around the home. Things are getting bigger, and more powerful: houses, cars, furniture . . . toothbrushes. Throughout the local domestic ecology, more is more.
"We do big and bigger; we never do small," said Scott Ballard, a vice president for merchandising at Henredon Furniture Industries, the North Carolina manufacturer that led the parade for furniture's ballooning scale. Its Visage collection includes 4-by-5-foot coffee tables and canopy beds that are nine and a half feet high -- living large, sleeping large.
The American appliance is pumping up. Dumbo -- the new national bird -- has landed. Houses themselves are increasing in size. Last year, 16 percent included three-car garages.
Sports utility vehicles have seized the high road in high-income households. General Motors' Hummer, to be introduced in 2002, will require a commercial truck's running lights because of its width: more than six and a half feet.
Indoors, 14-foot ceilings are increasingly standard, even in the bedroom. And furniture is inflating as fast as it can to close the gap.
"We're following the trend in the construction industry," Mr. Ballard said. "People want these giant places to cocoon -- building up, scaling up. The economy's been good, and people want to show off what they've got." What the cocoon produces -- Henredon's 8-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide silver floor mirror, for instance -- might make a plausible plot development for "Alien 4."
This year, entertainment went big at home too. Pushed by the popularity of newly inexpensive DVD players, the television and the stereo system are transmogrifying quickly into the home theater. Your own personal uniplex -- now appearing in a room near you. What was a 13-inch screen and a boombox is likely to be instead a wide-screen television with a surround-sound 5.1 "home theater in a box" -- a separate audio receiver, five speakers and a sub-woofer.
"The sub-woofer is a low-frequency effects channel," said Maureen Jenson, editor of Home Theater magazine. "You hear the thump, thump, thump of dinosaur feet in 'Jurassic Park.' " You might also think your neighbors are clog-dancing with sofas strapped to their shoes.
"A lot of people buy these systems because they want them to be loud," Ms. Jenson said. "Powerful explosions -- 'Terminator' types. They love home theater."
NPD Intelect, a technology and electronics industry market analyst, reports that $1.3 billion worth of DVD players have been sold in the United States in the last 12 months, and close to $300 million in home theaters in boxes to go with them. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
Appliances in other parts of the house, like the kitchen, are showing bigger biceps too. The new Cuisinart DLC-X Plus is a 20-cup food processor -- that's "soup's on" for a typical family of 14 -- with a one-and-a-half-horsepower motor. Chain saws have two to four horsepower. In a test this week, the Cuisinart chipped a carrot into dust in two seconds.
"Horsepower sells," said Jack Switzer, a manager for the lawn mower division at John Deere. Walk-behind lawn mowers have doubled in horsepower since 1987.
The Cuisinart, six cups larger than the company's largest consumer model, was developed for the food service industry, but is being sold at stores like Bloomingdale's because of its immediate appeal to nonprofessional cooks.
"Retailers see these products at trade shows and say, 'Oh, I can sell that,' " said Mary Rodgers, senior manager of marketing and communications at Cuisinart. "Clients are putting in super-duper kitchens, and they want the super-duper small appliances to go with them."
Popular at Broadway Panhandler is the Waring Mega Pro bartender's blender, which operates at 27,000 rpm -- 10,000 more than a household unit. Making the margaritas will make you dizzier than drinking them. Williams-Sonoma's new item -- a Kenwood standing mixer -- has a seven-quart capacity and a 725-watt motor. Most models have 350 watts. The company also has in the stores a commercial Italian panini grill that heats up to 575 degrees -- that's serious fried bologna.
"People are desperate for power," said Deanna Magrane, a buyer at Broadway Panhandler. "They see it as, 'This is what the professionals use.' They watch the Food Network or Emeril Lagasse or Martha Stewart, and they upgrade to more specialized things." Ms. Magrane said that customers come into the store with tape measures, to be sure cookware like Le Creuset's 13-quarter will fit into their ovens.
Gillette's Braun Oral-B 3D Excel toothbrush, when it arrives in this country from Europe next year, will rest conveniently in conventional American medicine cabinets. But it is not until you turn it on that you will understand its magnitude.
With a brush head that makes 40,000 pulsations a minute (hovering hummingbirds' wings beat 3,000 times during the same minute) and 7,600 simultaneous side-to-side oscillations, the $79.99 plastic speed stick is being positioned as the BMW of the bathroom. Nothing on the market goes faster. Gillette's oral care products represented $16 million in sales last year. "Power brushing" is the fastest-growing segment in the company's portfolio.
Ever hear the expression, "wipe that smile off your face"? It could happen.
The escalation into the bigger, more powerful home could end more quickly than it began. A national recession not withstanding, the beginnings of a revolt might be here.
"There's been a plea for moderation on the part of furniture retailers this season," said Powell Slaughter, an editor at Furniture Today, a trade weekly, speaking of the trend toward larger lifestyles. "They're telling manufacturers, 'At least give us the option of having something normal size.' People in condos, with eight-foot ceilings, can't fit this stuff in the room." Ten-foot-tall beds don't play well in towns like New York.
But Ahn Le, of Lawrenceville, Ga., outside Atlanta, loves her newly installed nine-and-a-half-foot-tall Henredon bed -- even after two days of attempted delivery this week. The first truck wasn't large enough; the second crew was too small. Three struggling men, including Ms. Le's son, who pitched in, finally got it upstairs, but couldn't get it through the door of the 13-foot-tall bedroom.
"My son's girlfriend said, 'It's a huge bed,' " Ms. Le, who is five feet tall, said. "I had just seen it in a catalog.
"I like it even more now," she explained. "It's beautiful. It's king-size."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fall as Consumers Turn Cautious

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Retail sales fell in November for the first time in seven months as car sales slumped and demand slowed for many retailers at the start of the holiday shopping season, government figures showed today.
"Retail sales have suddenly fizzled out as worries over heating costs this winter and a stock market decline have suddenly made Americans very cautious," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in New York. 
 Sales decreased 0.4 percent in November after being unchanged in October, the Commerce Department said. Excluding automobiles, sales rose 0.2 percent, the smallest gain in three months, after a 0.4 percent increase in October.
Personal spending in the fourth quarter is shaping up to be the weakest in a year and a half, prompting General Motors and Whirlpool to cut production and lay off workers. Since November, sales at Wal-Mart Stores have fallen below expectations. And specialty clothing chains like Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch have reduced prices to lure shoppers.
Separate figures from the Labor Department showed that the costs of imported goods are contained. That is impeding the ability of United States companies to raise prices as they strive to stay competitive. Import prices rose 0.2 percent in November after falling 0.5 percent in October. Excluding petroleum, import prices fell 0.1 percent after showing no change a month earlier.
Import prices are 0.5 percent higher over the last 12 months, when the cost of petroleum is excluded. That compares with a 0.2 percent decline for the 12 months ended November 1999.
Sales at auto dealers fell 2.2 percent in November -- the biggest decrease since a 4.9 percent slump in July 1998. In October, auto sales fell 1 percent.
Automakers sold 16.6 million vehicles at an annual rate last month, the slowest pace in a year, even as G.M. lowered prices. That was down from a pace of 16.9 million units in October and the slowest since a 16.6-million-unit pace in October 1999.
Sales at general merchandise stores, which include department stores, fell 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent a month earlier. The drop in sales at general merchandise outlets was the largest since a 0.4 percent decrease in May 1999.

HEADLINE: U.S. Panel to Weigh Auction Certificates

 BODY:
A federal judge named two experts yesterday to study a provision allowing Sotheby's Holdings and Christie's to pay $100 million of a $512 million civil antitrust settlement in the form of discount certificates to future auction sellers.
The rest would be paid in cash to about 100,000 auction customers who have sued the two auction houses on charges of price-fixing and other collusion. 
 Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, in United States District Court in Manhattan, said he was appointing the experts to advise the court on the two auctioneers' plan for valuation of the certificates and the competitive consequences of issuing such certificates.
The experts he named are Kenneth G. Elzinga, a professor of economics at the University of Virginia, and Denise Martin of National Economic Research Associates in White Plains. Judge Kaplan asked them to file their report by Jan. 16 and told Sotheby's and Christie's to provide the information they request.
He set Professor Elzinga's fee at $450 an hour and Dr. Martin's fee at $375 an hour, plus expenses.

HEADLINE: In China, MSG Is No Headache, It's a New Treat

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 8

 BODY:
At the upscale market on Wangfujing Street, the can stands proudly, unapologetically on its shelf, beautifully displayed in a clear-fronted white gift box festooned with gold seals, roses and red ribbon. And why not? It is, after all, "the king of Chinese seasonings," the box proclaims.
Soy sauce? Ginger? The spicy pepper that gives Sichuan cooking its zing? Guess again. It is monosodium glutamate, MSG. And in China its popularity is booming. 
 "Recently, consumption has been going up every year," said Wang Jiaqin, vice president of the China Fermentation Industry Association, which tracks MSG use. "Chinese people have gained more understanding of how to use it. They are comfortable with it. And that's why it is now in every home and market."
MSG is a cultural Rorschach test. Mention it to Americans and their minds jump immediately to "Chinese restaurant syndrome," a malady of after-dinner headaches, flushing and dizziness for which MSG has long been blamed. But for Chinese it conjures up different images: mouth-watering stir-fried spinach or the perfect shark's fin soup.
The average Chinese person now eats an estimated 1.3 pounds of MSG a year, Ms. Wang said, six times as much as just a decade ago. And while most people use it as a flavor enhancer, in recent years some have even been touting its healthful effects: some food scientists here say it improves mental alertness, and it is sold in little red packets carrying images of playing children -- as a drink to fight childhood constipation.
Zhang Chen, a senior chef who has worked in some of Beijing fanciest hotels, estimated that more than 95 percent of restaurants and 70 percent of households now use MSG daily, a sign, he said, of China's economic prosperity. And what about the holdouts?
"In poor areas in the countryside, they can't use it because of their low living standard -- I mean they can't even afford meat," he said, sadly shaking his head. "But if the economy develops, they'll be able to try it and see how delicious it makes food, and then they'll surely use it too."
Adding to the allure, MSG is known in Chinese as wei jing, which literally means flavor essence.
Although MSG and Chinese restaurants are inextricably linked in the American psyche, the chemical was actually invented in Japan, where per capita consumption still outstrips that in China. It was first brought to China about a century ago but has only started gaining popularity in the last decade, during China's era of economic reform, since a growing number of Chinese can now afford it.
A derivative of an amino acid already present in the human body, MSG is manufactured by fermenting a variety of grains, including corn, potatoes and rice.
In 1987 the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, placed MSG in the safest category of food ingredients, along with salt, vinegar and the like. In 1995 the United States Food and Drug Administration concluded that "MSG and related substances are safe food ingredients for most people when eaten at the customary level," although the report acknowledged that some people, especially those with asthma, might have transient symptoms if very large quantities were consumed.
China is today the world's leading producer of MSG, which is mostly sold for cooking. But Chinese factories also use it to make medicine and even a hard candy with a salty taste that is popular in West Africa, Ms. Wang said.
Chefs and other experts here are generally perplexed about the concern that has surrounded MSG in the West. They note that the United Nations removed restrictions on the use of the additive in 1987 and that the F.D.A. labels it as "generally safe."
Mr. Zhang, the chef, who teaches cooking at the Beijing Service and Management School, said that when he worked in Switzerland for a year, he was forbidden to use MSG after a customer fainted at her table. His boss explained that a very small number of Europeans are allergic to MSG, but he remains unconvinced that such an allergy is real.
"I've worked in restaurants since 1963 in China, and I've never heard of such a problem," he said, adding: "Look, this is a very big country, and people eat a lot of MSG. I think if people were getting sick it would be obvious.
"The government researches these things, and a lot of dangerous food additives, colorings and sweeteners are forbidden. But MSG is not among them."
Ms. Wang, 60, an earnest engineer with close-cropped hair, says she has eaten "lots of MSG" for decades without ill effect. "The more you use it, the more you want to add," she said. She falls backs on a conspiracy theory to explain why MSG got its bad reputation in the West.
"I think some restaurant owners were jealous of the good business of Chinese restaurants," she said, "so they started this rumor about MSG."
If people react badly to MSG, she added, it is only because their bodies are not accustomed to it -- noting that most new foods take some getting used to. "Like me, I can't even look at mutton, much less eat it," she said, expressing a common aversion to a meat more associated here with Mongols and other sheepherding minorities than with traditional Chinese fare.
Although there have been occasional articles in the Chinese press concerning possible side effects of MSG -- hair loss has been a big worry -- in recent months a spate of magazine articles and promotional events have touted not only its safety but also its health benefits.
During "MSG Nutrition Promotion Week" this September, an article in the China Light Industry News said: "Chinese pharmaceutical food scholars believe it has health-enhancing and brain-supplementing effects."
"It can strengthen the appetite of the old, the physically feeble, pregnant women and children with poor appetite," the article said, "thereby enhancing nutrition and encouraging improved health."
But experts emphasize that for maximum effect, MSG must be used properly. Mr. Zhang said it should not be eaten by nursing mothers or infants under 3 months old. Ms. Wang said that under age 1, consumption should be "limited a bit."
But she added that for older children, "you can put it in vegetable juice to make it tastier."
"Kids have a very sensitive palate," she said, "so they'll appreciate it."
For now almost all of the 650,000 tons of MSG produced in China is sold domestically for use in cooking. But look out: the China Fermentation Industry Association is holding more promotional activities, and its manual suggests myriad uses -- in food processing, pharmaceuticals, industry and agriculture. (Feed it to pigs -- it will make them grow fatter, quicker!)
"I know that not too many people now use it in America," said Ms. Wang, noting that China hopes to enter the World Trade Organization soon. "We certainly hope to open the American market."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
New Bush Status Does Little To Fuel Sustained Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Although investors awoke yesterday morning with the apparent certainty that the next president had finally been chosen five weeks after the election, there was no celebration for Gov. George W. Bush in the stock market.
While all three major gauges shot higher after trading began, they quickly gave up their gains, with the Nasdaq composite index falling quickly into negative territory. Only the Dow Jones industrial average remained, barely, in the plus column, even though there were reports early in the day that Vice President Al Gore would make a speech in the evening. 
 At the close, the Dow was up 26.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,794.44, after surging 147 points in the morning. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 109.00 points, or 3.7 percent, to 2,822.77. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 11.19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,359.99.
There was no immediate Bush rally because investors have been concentrating more on the fact that economic and corporate earnings growth is slowing more sharply than many of them had expected.
That theme was emphasized again yesterday morning when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales dropped an unexpected 0.4 percent in November, the first decline in seven months.
In addition, as the court battles over the Florida vote had continued, it appeared more and more likely that Mr. Bush would win, especially after the Supreme Court stopped the hand-counting of ballots in Florida on Saturday. So many investors had already factored in a Bush victory.
"There are four nagging issues for the stock market," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Politics, profits, telecom spending and semiconductor inventories. Now I only have an answer on one and the other three will not be quickly resolved. The political crisis was nothing more than a sideshow that created a distraction from a deteriorating economic picture."
Several so-called Bush stocks did rally. These stocks, which include oil, drug and tobacco shares and Microsoft, are expected to do better under a Bush administration than a Gore administration. Pfizer, which rose $1.81, to $45.81, helped curb the loss in the S.& P. 500. Exxon Mobil, up $1.13, to $87.69, and Philip Morris, up $2.50, to $40.81, helped lift the Dow. Mr. Galvin argued that the drug and tobacco stocks were probably helped more by being good defensive plays on a day of new data showing that the economy was slowing.
The Nasdaq was held back by declines in Cisco Systems, Veritas Software, Siebel Systems and Ciena. A late sell-off of Microsoft, whose antitrust battle is expected to fare better under a Bush administration, added to the swoon of the Nasdaq, Dow and S.& P. 500 in the afternoon. After climbing $2.13 early, Microsoft finished down $1.13, to $57.25.
Investors' concerns about the slowing economy were heightened by the retail sales decline and reinforced by disappointing earnings warnings from several companies.
Whirlpool, the appliance maker, said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of about 98 cents a share, roughly 30 percent less than Wall Street estimates, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial. Shares of Whirlpool dropped $2.75, to $41.44.
Compaq Computer's shares were down $2.67, to $18.10. After the stock market closed on Tuesday, Compaq said that it would miss fourth-quarter sales projections by 8 percent to 10 percent while per-share earnings would fall about 8 cents below current projections of 36 cents a share.
And Charles Schwab, the leading online broker, said that it might miss its fourth-quarter earnings forecast of 14 cents a share because of a decline in trading volume and a fall in the value of assets under management.
One measure of the effect of the economic and corporate earnings slowdown versus the uncertainty of the election is how far the three main gauges are still below where they were on Election Day. The Nasdaq is still down the most, off 17 percent since Nov. 7. The S.& P. 500 index is down 5 percent since then and the Dow is off 1 percent.
For investors, the issue going forward is how much slower the economy and corporate earnings might grow and how soon the Federal Reserve will step in to lower interest rates to stem the decline. Fed policy makers next meet on Tuesday. Currently, analysts expect the Fed to change only its so-called bias to neutral from leaning toward higher interest rates. A rate cut is not expected until the first quarter of next year.
Since Oct. 1, Wall Street forecasts for earnings growth for the S.& P. 500 in the fourth quarter have fallen to 12.7 percent on Nov. 7 from 14.8 percent and to 10.4 percent since then, according to First Call. The estimate for earnings growth for technology companies has gone from 29 percent on Oct. 1 to 17 percent on Nov. 7, and to 10 percent now.
Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call, said that he expected growth forecasts to fall even further, based on the recently reduced earnings forecasts made by Compaq, General Motors, Eastman Kodak and others.
He also expects that earnings forecasts will dwindle as the holidays approach, only to be followed by a new burst of corporate warnings in the first weeks of the new year. "When we come to the first weeks of January, we will see some subsequent downgradings," Mr. Hill said.

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Bond prices rose yesterday after a report showing a drop in retail sales in November reinforced bond market hopes that a slowing economy will soon spur the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
Fixed-income investors, weary after five weeks of political and legal wrangling over the presidential election, turned their attention back to economic fundamentals, which remain very supportive of government bonds.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 23/32, to 103 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.34 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond rose 14/32, to 111 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.46 percent from 5.53 percent.

HEADLINE: In Downturn, An Overhaul For Whirlpool

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In yet another sign the economy may be slowing, the Whirlpool Corporation announced a major reorganization today and said that it would cut up to 6,300 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force, because of weakening demand for its products.
The company, the nation's biggest maker of home appliances, also warned that its fourth-quarter profit would be lower than expected. Whirlpool attributed its troubles to a sagging economy and stiff price competition in the appliance industry. 
 "There are lots of uncertainties impacting consumers today," said David R. Whitwam, the chairman and chief executive of Whirlpool, who noted that a drop in stock prices, among other things, has weakened consumer confidence. "Our products after all are postponable; they can decide to fix a washer and not buy one."
The profit warning was the second in three months for Whirlpool, which in late August projected sharply lower earnings for the second half of this year, saying that higher interest rates, a weaker housing market and a drop in consumer confidence have helped soften demand for its washers, dryers, ovens, microwaves and other appliances.
Shares of Whirlpool fell $2.75, to $41.44 on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping the stock nearly 50 percent below its price in August 1999, when it topped $77 a share.
Whirlpool is not alone, of course. Nearly every major appliance maker is suffering a steep downturn. Maytag, Electrolux and GE Appliances are also reporting weaker demand for their products, particularly in the United States and Europe, where price wars have raged and production costs have risen.
Wall Street analysts say the entire industry is being rocked, and investors are beginning to wonder about profit forecasts, particularly at Whirlpool, which has gone through several revampings over the last decade.
"People are obviously skeptical given that Whirlpool went through this a few years ago," said Justin Maurer, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "But this is a tough business right now, and they're doing everything they can to get through it."
Whirlpool, which is based in Benton Harbor, Mich., offered few details today about what plants might be closed or what jobs might be cut, but the company said it would take a series of charges for the reorganization next year totaling about $300 million to $350 million.
The company said the revamping should result in savings of $225 million to $250 million a year once fully carried out.
The company's slide has been huge. Wall Street analysts had forecast profits of $7 a share early in the year but dropped their estimates to about $5.58 a share after the August profit warning. Now, they are reducing their expectations to $5.18 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Whirlpool executives said the sharpest drop in demand had occurred this quarter. The company, which has about 36 percent of the United States appliance market, had projected industrywide sales to drop 2 percent to 3 percent in North America this quarter, but early figures show that industrywide demand has fallen about 8 percent, and there has been no letup in pricing pressure, something the company factored into its earlier projections.
"That's a precipitous drop and quite unexpected," Mr. Whitwam said. "That's a faster drop than we usually get in a down cycle."
Whirlpool is also coping with a tougher retail environment and changes that favor lower-cost models and direct selling and delivery to homes.
Earlier this year, Circuit City decided to stop selling appliances at its retail outlets, dealing a blow to several appliance makers. And Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores recently entered the home appliance market. General Electric has made deals with these companies to ship directly to customers' homes, using its own logistics service. The changes mean reduced inventories and smaller retail staffs to ship, deliver and install home appliances. Whirlpool does not sell at either outlet.
So while Whirlpool and Maytag are suffering through a particularly sharp downturn, GE Appliances says it has gained market share. "We're gaining in a soft market," said Terry Dunn, a spokesman for GE Appliances. "I don't believe our competitors can say the same thing."
Next year, however, Whirlpool says it expects the early part of the year to be rough, with improving prospects in the second half. The company said it was forecasting profits of 15 percent next year, even though the industry will be flat.
Wall Street's reaction? "Well, they're not buying it," said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, noting that two analysts had revised their numbers to show a profit gain of just 1 percent next year.

HEADLINE: Mexico Chief Pushes New Border Policy: Free and Easy Does It

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Irma Anzures was driving back to Juarez this afternoon over the Free Bridge, after a little shopping in El Paso, when Mexican customs officials pulled her over for a routine inspection.
Then the president of Mexico stuck his head in the window. 
 "How's it going?" President Vicente Fox asked Ms. Anzures, 43, who runs three fast-food restaurants in Juarez with her husband. "How are the people treating you? Everything O.K.?"
A million Mexicans who live and work in the United States are coming home for Christmas, and Mr. Fox, as their new president, wants to welcome them back to a changed country.
The Free Bridge is not always free. On the United States side, in El Paso, officials take pains to stop suspicious people, routinely backing up traffic a mile or more. On the Mexican side, in Juarez, officials sometimes take money for nothing. "People have a lot of complaints, especially about bribes disguised as fines or fees," said Lizbeth Vela, a 21-year-old business administration student.
Mr. Fox dropped in at the Free Bridge on a two-day tour of border posts and stations, part of a campaign he began with his inauguration speech 12 days ago. He wants the millions of Mexicans crossing the border in both directions each year to travel freer and easier, possessing more visas from the United States to work legally, and facing fewer shakedowns from Mexican border officials when they come home. He also wants Mexican-Americans to enjoy full dual citizenship, including the right to vote from the United States by absentee ballots.
All this is part of his larger vision: that in 20 years' time, maybe less, maybe more, the border will no longer be a barrier, fortified by armed guards, but a mere line on a map dividing two partners in a common market, and with much more in common than what divides the United States and Mexico today.
It was that way once and it will be again, said Jose Posada Pompa, 80, a citizen of Juarez since 1933 and a loyal member of Mr. Fox's National Action Party since 1941.
"In those days, you walked to El Paso and back freely," said Mr. Posada, a retired mining businessman who turned out at the bridge for a glimpse of Mr. Fox. "I went to school in El Paso as a child. The two cities were like one family. You were free to go as you pleased. It was beautiful.
"It all changed when the cities grew in population, when the peso kept falling, and of course, we were ruled by a dictatorship for so many years, without the possibility of change, and we were able to develop nothing," he said.
For generations, Mexico regarded people who left for the United States as turncoats who would sell their patrimony for a fistful of dollars. That began to change more than a decade ago. The Mexican government, anticipating the advent of free-trade pacts with the United States and the closer ties that billions in new commerce would create, began quietly reaching out to Mexican-Americans through consulates, community organizations and public relations campaigns.
Mr. Fox, as is his style, has turned up the volume.
He sees the millions who have left for the United States as courageous and creative souls who "want to dream the American Dream."
"We want to salute these heroes, these kids leaving their homes, their communities, leaving with tears in their eyes, saying goodbye to their families, to set out on a difficult, sometimes painful search for a job, an opportunity they can't find at home, their community or their own country," he said on Tuesday during a stop at a border post just south of the Arizona border in Nogales.
The economic power of Mexicans in the United States is huge in Mexico.
Their remittances -- the money that the migrants send back home -- can be a huge boon to poor villages and towns in a nation where perhaps half of the nearly 100 million people are dirt poor.
Though estimates vary, the best guess is that the workers among the roughly eight million Mexicans living in the United States send between $6 billion and $8 billion back to their families every year, making them at least the third-biggest legitimate force in the Mexican economy, after oil and tourism. (Figures for the underground economy, led by drug trafficking, are notoriously unreliable, but certainly are measured in billions).
Mr. Fox wants his heroes to come home, eventually, but first he says he has to create the economic conditions that will draw them back. He has said over and over that illegal immigration from Mexico will not cease until the Mexican economy can provide more jobs and better pay, offsetting the demand for Mexican labor in the United States.
Roughly 1.5 million Mexicans are arrested annually trying to cross the border illegally. The migrants are dying at a rate of one a day in the process -- 369 deaths in the year ending Oct. 1. -- mostly from heat, thirst or exhaustion, but increasingly under fire from United States border officials or citizens defending their land from intruders. Mr. Fox has appointed a cabinet-level official, Ernesto Ruffo, to a newly created post overseeing the border and the plight of migrants.
The United States should see legal migrants in a different light, said Isela Arrendondo, 24, who works for the Chihuahua state convention bureau in Juarez. "I know the United States is worried about drugs, illegals, contraband and such things," she said. "But legal travel, with passports and visas -- there's a human right to travel freely, and not be regarded as a criminal."
Mr. Fox may have little power to change the way the United States regards Mexican migrants, legal and illegal. But on this tour -- a campaign, really, exhorting officials to clean up their acts, in much the same way that he sought votes during his three-year campaign for president -- he is trying to make the border a better place for a homecoming.
"We've got to build in this delicate terrain," he told a group of customs officials. "On one hand, to comply with the law, and on the other, to have the heart and the desire to embrace our fellow countrymen and brothers."

HEADLINE: Congress Revives Bill On Investment In Poor Areas

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans and White House officials, locked in a bitter political standoff for much of the year, said today that they had reached a bipartisan agreement reviving legislation to provide tax credits and other incentives for investment in economically depressed areas.
The agreement resulted from months of negotiations between President Clinton and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois. It is one of the few bills on which they collaborated. 
 Mr. Clinton championed the initiative in trips to some of the most destitute corners of America, including the Mississippi Delta, East St. Louis, Ill., Appalachia and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.
The proposed tax breaks, Mr. Clinton said recently, are not just another antipoverty program, but a way "to open new markets to American investors here at home, to bring prosperity to people and places who've been left behind" in the longest economic expansion in American history.
John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Mr. Hastert, said, "The 'new markets' community renewal bill is in the final package of legislation" negotiated this week by Congress and the White House.
Mr. Feehery said the bill, worth $25 billion over 10 years, "could serve as a model of bipartisan cooperation for the next Congress," which convenes on Jan. 3.
The legislation to revitalize poor neighborhoods will probably be added to a bill providing money for the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services. Mr. Clinton and Congressional leaders have agreed to provide $108.9 billion for those agencies.
Negotiators from Congress and the White House said they worked out most of the details today, clearing the way for final adjournment of the 106th Congress within a week.
Republicans, including Mr. Hastert and Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference, embraced the antipoverty bill out of a conviction that slashing taxes would stimulate investment and economic growth.
The bill encourages investment in depressed urban and rural areas by abolishing the tax on certain capital gains. Individuals would pay no capital gains taxes on the sale of businesses or business assets held in such neighborhoods for more than five years.
"The zero capital gains rate is something conservatives can be proud of," Mr. Feehery said. At the same time, he added, Mr. Hastert "feels good" because he worked on the bill with members of the Congressional Black Caucus including Democrats like Charles B. Rangel of New York and Bobby L. Rush and Danny K. Davis, both of Illinois.
The bill would provide tax credits to subsidize the wages of workers in depressed areas and would establish venture capital funds to invest in such neighborhoods. It also would offer tax credits to banks and other financial institutions that make investments and loans in low-income areas. These credits, proposed by Mr. Clinton, are meant to enhance the return on such investments.
The antipoverty legislation was included in a tax bill that was pronounced dead last week by Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. But the Republicans and White House officials said today that they had rescued the parts of the bill intended to revitalize poor communities.
In an interview today, Mr. Watts, who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Eufaula, Okla., said: "Last week I thought this legislation was on its last ounce of oxygen, was beyond the reach of the 106th Congress. But the speaker called this morning and said, 'We will be able to do the community renewal bill.' "
Gene Sperling, the president's economic policy adviser, said: "The 'new markets' legislation has broad bipartisan support. The president reached out early to Speaker Hastert. They've made it a joint effort."
The measure builds on the concept of enterprise zones and similar ideas devised more than 15 years ago by two New Yorkers, Mr. Rangel, a Democrat, and Jack F. Kemp, a Republican who served as secretary of housing and urban development under President George Bush.
Under the new legislation, poor areas across the country would apply to the federal government for designation as "renewal communities," and 40 would be chosen.
"In underserved communities, capital formation is always a challenge," Mr. Watts said. "This bill offers a way to create capital by wiping out the capital gains tax."
Owners of retail clothing stores, theaters, supermarkets and other shops -- small businesses and big corporations alike -- could qualify for the tax breaks if they invest in depressed communities.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action Plan Is Upheld at Michigan

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
A federal judge upheld the University of Michigan's affirmative action program yesterday, ruling that diversity is a critical component of higher education and that colleges and universities can continue to consider race and ethnicity in admissions decisions.
The judge, Patrick J. Duggan of Federal District Court in Detroit, said the university had violated the United States Constitution from 1995 to 1998 with a two-tiered admissions system that admitted white and minority applicants under different criteria. But he said Michigan's current policy, in which black and Hispanic applicants are given a 20-point boost on a 150-point scale, was perfectly legal. 
 "A racially and ethnically diverse student body produces significant educational benefits such that diversity, in the context of higher education, constitutes a compelling governmental interest," wrote Judge Duggan, a 1986 Reagan appointee. "Although fixed racial quotas and racial balancing are not necessary to achieving that goal, the consideration of an applicant's race during the admissions process necessarily is.
"In situations such as this," he added, "it is often a thin line that divides the permissible from the impermissible."
Most selective colleges and universities use race as a factor in admissions, a practice that has been under attack in recent years. Michigan's system was seen as vulnerable because it is explicit, whereas other institutions use more subtle and subjective approaches.
The case galvanized affirmative action advocates who produced sociological studies documenting how a diverse campus enhances the educational and long-term life experiences for all students. While many conservatives considered that evidence to be soft and inconclusive, Judge Duggan embraced it in his opinion.
The 50-page ruling, which preempted a trial by granting summary judgment motions, comes just 10 days after a federal appeals court in California upheld a now-defunct affirmative action program at the University of Washington. The twin opinions contradict a 1996 appellate decision that eliminated affirmative action at the University of Texas Law School, laying the groundwork for review of the issue -- and, most likely, the Michigan case -- by the United States Supreme Court.
A separate case aimed at the University of Michigan Law School is scheduled for trial Jan. 16.
"This is the opening innings of a very long ball game here," said Terence J. Pell, chief executive officer of the Center for Individual Rights, the Washington group that challenged the programs at Michigan. "This game is far from over, and it's not clear that the Michigan system will survive judicial scrutiny."
Mr. Pell and one of his clients, Jennifer Gratz -- a 23-year-old white woman who was rejected from the university in 1995 -- welcomed the fact that the old admissions program, which was scrapped after the lawsuit was filed, was declared discriminatory. They will likely appeal the other aspects of the ruling, arguing that the current admission system is only cosmetically different from the one rebuffed by the judge, and may yet ask for monetary or other relief for those who were denied admission from 1995 to 1998.
"I'm excited that they were wrong and they're being told that they were wrong," said Ms. Gratz, who attended the university's less-prestigious Dearborn campus instead of the flagship at Ann Arbor. She now works for a software company and lives in San Diego.
Even as the plaintiffs declared victory, it was clear that the real celebration was reverberating throughout the higher education and in civil rights organizations.
"I am deeply gratified, but not just for the University of Michigan, really for higher education and for the country, broadly," said the university president, Lee C. Bollinger.
"Admissions is not and should not be a linear process of lining up applicants according to their grades and test scores and then drawing a line through the list," added Mr. Bollinger, a constitutional lawyer who replaced the now-illegal grids with the point system after he arrived in 1997. "It shows the importance of seeing racial and ethnic diversity in a broader context of diversity, which is geographic and international and socio-economic and athletic and all the various forms of differences, complementary differences, that we draw on to compose classes year after year."
Theodore M. Shaw, a lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said: "To the extent that the conservatives, the anti-affirmative action crowd, has been sounding the death knell for affirmative action, not only were they premature, they were dead wrong.
"The slow and painful and halting progress that has been made over the last 30 years with and through affirmative action policies," he added, "will not come to a screeching halt."
But Stephan Thernstrom, a Harvard historian and co-author of a book that argues against the use of racial preferences in college admissions, said the ruling only heightened the confusion over the prevailing Supreme Court opinion on affirmative action, in the 1978 case, University of California Regents v. Bakke.
"I think the present court would be very dubious about the use of race used by the University of Michigan in its admissions standards," Mr. Thernstrom said.
Of Michigan's 24,000 undergraduates, 8.2 percent are African-American and 4.3 percent are Hispanic.
The admissions system that was upheld gives applicants up to 80 points for a perfect grade-point average and 12 for top scores on standardized tests. Black, Hispanic and American Indian students then get a 20-point bonus, as do those from poor families and recruited athletes. Michigan residents get 10 extra points, and children of alumni get 4, while an outstanding essay, leadership or personal achievement are each worth 3 points.
Praising this approach, Judge Duggan said "a university must carefully design its system to fall between" one "that completely fails to achieve a meaningful degree of diversity" and "a rigid quota." At Michigan, he said, "there are many factors that might entitle an applicant to a preference, thereby making the results of any one factor less predictable."
He went further, saying, "the need for diversity lives on perpetually," and suggesting that affirmative action could continue until the "day when universities are able to achieve the desired diversity without resort to racial preferences."
Jessica Curtin, a graduate student in the school of education who is a leading voice in support of affirmative action on Michigan's campus, said the decision "stands as a bar to the resegregation of higher education" and shows the strength of "the new civil rights movement born from these cases."

Election Developments Fail To Give Stocks a Bounce
Although investors awoke with the apparent certainty that the next president had finally been chosen five weeks after the election, there was no celebration for Gov. George W. Bush in the stock market as investors concentrated more on the slowing growth of the economy and corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrials rose 26.17 points, to 10,794.44. The Nasdaq composite index fell 109 points, or 3.7 percent, to 2,822.77. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,359.99. Page C10. 

Perelman Makes Big Bet on Revlon
Ronald O. Perelman has made a large, contrarian bet on Revlon, the ailing cosmetics company he controls, spending perhaps as much as $250 million to buy back zero-coupon junk bonds secured by nearly half of his 83.5 percent stake in Revlon, according to an executive briefed on Mr. Perelman's plans. The investment amounts to a big bet that Revlon, which has lost money the last eight quarters, will return to profitability. Based on Revlon's share price of $4.95, Mr. Perelman's take in the company has fallen 91 percent since April 1998, to $212 million from $2.4 billion. C6.

Plant's Gene Sequence Is Mapped

Palm, whose hand-held computers became an icon for the popular technology boom, is gradually retooling its business model to focus on licensing the Palm operating system and by accelerating wireless Internet services. C4.

Power Crisis Worsens in California
California's power crisis deepened as some big electricity generating companies refused to sell power to the state's ailing utilities, prompting Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to invoke rarely used emergency powers to force them to ship the needed power. A16.
 
November Retail Sales Fell 0.4%
Retail sales fell 0.4 percent in November, the first time in seven months, as car sales slumped and demand slowed for many retailers at the start of the holiday shopping season, government figures showed. C6.

Enron Names a New Chief Executive
Enron named Jeffrey Skilling, left, as its chief executive, promoting a manager who helped make the company into the largest competitor in the energy-trading business. Mr. Skilling, who was president and chief operating officer, succeeds Ken Lay, who will continue as chairman. Enron's revenue will more than double this year, possibly topping $90 billion, largely because of Mr. Lay's and Mr. Skilling's efforts to exploit deregulation of natural gas and power markets. C6.

Questions Raised About Book Deal
A multimillion-dollar book deal being negotiated by Hillary Rodham Clinton has raised concerns among some watchdog groups that she may be taking part in a sweetheart deal or feel beholden to her publisher after she assumes her Senate seat next month.

HEADLINE: New Haven Drops Mall Plan After 5 Years

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Dec. 13

 BODY:
A grand plan to build a $500 million shopping mall to revive this city's economy has been shelved after nearly five years of talk and millions of dollars in marketing and environmental studies.
Until this week, New Haven's mayor, John DeStefano, had spent a significant chunk of political capital defending the plan to build a "super-regional" shopping center just west of downtown on Long Island Sound, a project that he said would breathe some economic life back into a city whose downtown has been dormant for years. 
 But in disclosing his decision about the mall to The New Haven Register on Tuesday, the mayor sounded more like the mall's worst critics, comparing it to a quagmire like the Vietnam War.
Backers of the project, which was to have been known as the Galleria at Long Wharf, envisioned constructing 1.2 million square feet of retail space and eventually adding $7 million in annual property taxes and 3,000 jobs to New Haven's economy. But its opponents, including 130 downtown merchants, said the mall would pulverize local retailers and turn the city into a suburb of the mall itself.
Today, Mr. DeStefano, who did not respond to several calls seeking comment, publicly cited several reasons for the decision, including the $1 billion in investments the city has gained from biotechnology companies.
Andrea Comer, Mr. DeStefano's spokeswoman, said those investments were "something we didn't have when we first put our support behind the project."
The mayor also tried to assure residents that the city had other major development plans for downtown, plans that in time would reduce the project to little more than a forgettable distraction.
He said New Haven would be focusing its development efforts on increasing the number of high-tech and other new companies that have opened in the downtown area in recent months.
Those new companies have created optimism among City Hall and business leaders, and the view that after years of decline, New Haven may be poised to take advantage of the digital age.
By contrast, building a shopping mall seemed an old idea tied to the 1980's, less economically promising and decidely less glamorous, city officials said. "It was easier to let that go knowing we had this tremendous direction for the city," Ms. Comer said.
The mayor said he began thinking of dropping the mall project in recent weeks after reading newspaper reports that one of the mall's anchor stores, Nordstrom's, might pull out. Such a move, he said, could easily have caused withdrawals by other retail anchors, including Filene's, Macy's and Lord & Taylor, and cause the entire project to unravel.
Last week, Mr. DeStefano met with top executives of the company that was planning to build the mall, New England Development Corporation, based in Newton, Mass., and told them that the city wanted out.
"I don't think that the city would have gotten out of the project," Ms. Comer said about the mall, "if we had felt there was something sustainable for us."
The conciliatory words and the quick retreat from the project, however, contrast greatly with New Haven's aggressive defense of the mall project in recent months against a legal and public relations barrage from its opponents, including some state legislators and a mall developer that controls an existing mall in nearby Milford.
When a state representative, James A. Amann, of Milford, where Westfield America has a mall, denounced New Haven's project during a floor debate in the State House in March, Mr. DeStefano was waiting outside the chamber afterward to tell reporters why the New Haven mall deserved public support.
When Westfield America, the competing mall developer, filed more than a dozen legal challenges to the mall earlier this year, Mr. DeStefano fired back, suing Westfield in State Superior Court and accusing it of using the courts to try to kill the project.
But today all that appeared to be in the past, as delighted downtown merchants and the mayor focused on the city's dream of using biotechnology and eager high-tech entrepreneurs to fire its economy.
"I'm extremely pleased the mayor pulled the plug on this project," Mr. Amann said today, citing the $28 million in tax subsidies that the state had agreed to give New England Development to build the mall. "This was a bad project for the region."
Gov. John G. Rowland said he spoke to Mr. DeStefano by telephone Tuesday about the demise of the project and said he supported the mayor's plans to redirect the city's efforts away from retail shopping and toward fostering more high-tech business.
"The bottom line is, the mall has been a very difficult project to bring to finality," Mr. Rowland told reporters in his office today, citing the legal headaches and some critics' predictions of traffic gridlock. "I think at this juncture, now with all the lawsuits, the focus can and should be on the biomedical research possibilities."
Referring to the 19.5-acre site where the mall was to be built, he added, "I'm certain that that piece of property is conducive to research and development."
Westfield America, based in Los Angeles, has offered to buy the site from its two owners, New England Development and Fusco Corporation of New Haven, and to drop all court actions against them, a spokeswoman said today.

HEADLINE: THE TWO SIDES: The Counting Is Over, but Moving Vans Are Needed More Than Ever;
A President of Their Own Draws Exiled Job Seekers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Gen. Colin L. Powell does not need to fax his resume to Bush-Cheney transition headquarters.
But for all except the party's chosen few, today was the day when Republicans shifted from fantasizing about sweeping back into power to figuring out how best to land a job in a new administration. 
 Preferably with a window.
A few of the big jobs are spoken for. General Powell is all but certain to become secretary of state. Condoleezza Rice will be national security adviser. Karen P. Hughes, Gov. George W. Bush's communications director, will no doubt hold a similar post at the White House.
Nearly every other job -- and there are about 7,000 political appointments to be made -- is up for grabs. Having spent eight years without an executive branch portfolio, a good many registered Republicans seem interested in the posts.
As of Tuesday night, before it was even certain that Mr. Bush would become president, his skeletal transition operation here had received 20,177 job applications. Most came through the operation's Web site, with a growing number arriving by mail and fax. All are being sorted by a staff of 16 personnel assistants.
"My big concern is that the flood of resumes from Republicans seeking positions will clog up the Postal Service and block on-time delivery of Christmas packages," said Paul C. Light, the director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
Of course, the maneuvering had begun long before the United States Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday, even for the politically titled and entitled.
"Why was Christine Todd Whitman examining chad?" said Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute who was a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services in President George Bush's administration. "She was on a job search.
"The Miami-Dade 'riot'?" Mr. Wittmann continued, only half-jokingly referring to the protest organized by Republicans at a critical moment during the Florida recount. "All those people will get nice jobs in the Bush administration."
There is a long list of names floating around for the top few dozen jobs -- not just what are known in Washington lexicon as the plums, the full list of appointive posts in the executive branch, but the prunes, or posts for the more seasoned plums.
A few of Mr. Bush's closest confidants will get their pick. Donald L. Evans, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, is often mentioned as a possible commerce secretary.
Many White House jobs will go to people who have been working for the Bush campaign. Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, appears headed for a similar job in the West Wing. Ditto for Josh Bolten, who coordinated domestic policy for the campaign.
For defense secretary, most of the speculation has been about former Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, although there are nearly a dozen other Republicans with military and foreign policy experience whose names also come up regularly for top Pentagon jobs. There is still talk in the Bush camp of appointing a Democrat to the job.
Wall Street executives dominate the list of names under consideration for treasury secretary. The three mentioned most often are Walter V. Shipley, the former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Corporation; Donald B. Marron, the chairman of the PaineWebber Group, and John M. Hennessy, the former chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston. Other possibilities are Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the departing chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Gerald L. Parsky, a former treasury official.
Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma appears to be the leading candidate for attorney general. Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, who became a leading spokesman for Mr. Bush during the battle over the Florida recount, could be rewarded with an appointment as interior secretary.
Republicans, especially conservatives, have mixed feelings about jobs in cabinet agencies they see as representing the excesses of the federal government: Health and Human Services, for example, or Housing and Urban Development.
Yet there is no shortage of candidates. The housing job could go to Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis. Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin is assumed to be a top contender for secretary of health and human services, despite his failure to deliver his state to Mr. Bush on Election Day.
Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the departing chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a possibility for director of the Office of Management and Budget. Robert B. Zoellick, a former Treasury and State Department official, is likely to get a top job, perhaps United States trade representative. Michael Powell, the son of General Powell, is a candidate to lead the Federal Communications Commission.
Much maneuvering will go on under the radar, where 500 deputy assistant secretary jobs and many appointments to agencies, boards and commissions are at stake.
"The trump, of course, is to be a close associate of a cabinet secretary," Mr. Wittmann said. "If a Tommy Thompson gets a job, he will bring his staff. Texas will have a certain patina, but that is trumped by Pioneer lineage -- not someone who went west in the Gold Rush, but one of those people who raised $100,000 for Bush."

HEADLINE: M. B. Gottlieb, 83, Leader in Fusion Energy

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
Dr. Melvin B. Gottlieb, who led an expansion of America's search for fusion energy as the director of a Princeton laboratory in the 1960's and 1970's while promoting international cooperation in scientific research, died on Dec. 1, in Haverford, Pa. He was 83 and lived in Haverford on the outskirts of Philadelphia.
Fusion reactions power the sun and stars. The process occurs when atomic nuclei in hot gases collide and fuse, or merge, a reaction that releases large amounts of energy. On earth, scientists and engineers have made progress in building vessels that contain those hot, electrified gases, called plasmas, and in generating increasing amounts of fusion energy. 
 The task has turned out to be so difficult, however, that such devices still use more energy than they produce, and fusion power has never been used commercially. But from 1961 to 1980, during Dr. Gottlieb's tenure as director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, which was then the center of the American fusion effort, progress often came at such a breathtaking pace that scientists dreamed of building fusion power plants before the century's end.
"This was a tremendously exciting time," said Dr. Sam Cohen, a longtime physicist at the laboratory, who also is director of Princeton's program in plasma science and technology. "Things were happening at an incredible rate. One week things would be good and the next week they would be twice as good."
Taking advantage of those successes, the laboratory built a series of larger and larger devices, culminating in the $300 million Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor. Construction of the test reactor began under Dr. Gottlieb and it started operations on Dec. 24, 1982.
"Going from a laboratory where you have a lot of free spirits, even as teams, to doing the kind of thing that T.F.T.R. did was quite an achievement," said Dr. John F. Clarke, a former head of the fusion program at the Department of Energy and now chief scientist on the global climate change project at Battelle, in Washington.
In 1994, the test reactor broke all records by producing 11 megawatts of fusion energy, but it was shut down for budgetary reasons in 1997.
Melvin Burt Gottlieb was born on May 25, 1917, in Chicago. He received a bachelor's degree in 1940 and a doctorate in 1950 from the University of Chicago. During the war, he worked on radar countermeasures at Harvard.
In the early 1950's, he was working with Dr. James A. Van Allen, an astronomer at the University of Iowa who would later discover the belts of intense radiation above earth's atmosphere that now carry his name. Much of the work with Dr. Van Allen involved "rockoons," or small rockets that were launched from balloons to more economically extend their altitude.
The rockoons were released from ships "because it was too hazardous to do over inhabited areas," Dr. Van Allen said in an interview. In 1953 -- while Dr. Van Allen was working at what was then a secret fusion program at Princeton -- Dr. Gottlieb led such a cruise to the Arctic, during which the rockets picked up an unexpected form of radiation over the polar region, caused by electrons from space bombarding the upper atmosphere.
"That was a new and pioneering discovery of that effect," Dr. Van Allen said. More powerful ground-launched rockets later placed in orbit the satellites that discovered major concentrations of radiation much higher above the earth that became known as the Van Allen Belts.
When Dr. Van Allen returned to Iowa, he recommended Dr. Gottlieb as his replacement in the fusion program, which was classified because the same process powers hydrogen bombs. But the goal of the program, then led by an astrophysicist named Dr. Lyman Spitzer Jr., was the controlled release of energy for peaceful purposes.
The program was declassified in 1958, and American and Soviet physicists immediately began exchanging information.
That same year, Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Edward A. Frieman, who was then a theoretical physicist and is now director emeritus of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, were among the first Westerners to inspect the fusion energy program in the Soviet Union. Those visits began decades of cooperation, and competition, between the Western and the Soviet programs.
The visits sparked what would become Dr. Gottlieb's longtime commitment to promoting cooperation in scientific research, as he served on international commissions, helped plan joint projects and spoke about the subject extensively.
Referring to Dr. Gottlieb's work with Soviet scientists, Dr. Clarke said that "he believed that if we could work scientifically with them, that would contribute to breaking down the walls."
Dr. Gottleib succeeded Dr. Spitzer as director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 1961. For most of that decade, fusion research focused on a device for confining hot plasma that Dr. Spitzer had invented, but in 1969 the Soviets stunned the West by announcing that they had found improved results in an invention of their own, called a tokamak.
Over the objections of several scientists at the laboratory, some of whom would later charge that the laboratory had drifted too far from basic research, Dr. Gottlieb shifted priorities, building a series of tokamaks and related machines, which made advances that made headlines throughout the 1970's.
In 1977, as ground was broken for the tokamak reactor, Dr. Gottlieb said, "This new reactor represents the culmination of 25 years of work here and around the world."
He is survived by his wife, Golda, whom he married in 1948; a daughter, Paula Bastian, of Cedar Run, N.J.; and two grandchildren. Another daughter, Martha Gottlieb, died in 1987.
Dr. Clarke said that for all Dr. Gottlieb's involvement in research, he was more interested in practical benefits than abstract scientific results. "He wanted to learn about plasma physics because he wanted to see it put to work someday."

HEADLINE: THE TWO SIDES: The Counting Is Over, but Moving Vans Are Needed More Than Ever;
For Democrats, It's Time To Send Out Resumes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
For 20 years, through Al Gore's time in the House of Representatives, the Senate and the vice presidency, Leon S. Fuerth has been his chief foreign policy adviser.
Had Mr. Gore become president, Mr. Fuerth would have become the national security adviser in the White House, a job he has long coveted. But now at 61, with neither a law degree nor a Ph.D. and a resume that includes nothing but government service, Mr. Fuerth will soon be out of a job. 
 He is one of thousands of people who until today thought, or at least hoped, that they would be working in a Gore administration.
Some of these people will land solidly on their feet. Lawrence H. Summers, for example, has been treasury secretary only since last year and made no secret that he wanted to stay in the post longer. As Mr. Gore's chief economic adviser during the campaign, he had every reason to believe he could keep the job if Mr. Gore was elected president.
But Mr. Summers, 46, will doubtless have a wide variety of alternatives available to him outside the government. He is one of the most brilliant economists of his generation, one of the youngest academics (28) to receive tenure at Harvard and the 1993 winner of the John Bates Clark Medal, the highest award in economics short of the Nobel Prize.
Mr. Summers could earn millions on Wall Street or join the faculty of virtually any university. There is even talk that he is in the running to be president of Harvard.
"I don't know what I'm going to do next," he said in an interview today.
He said he intended to spend "some interval" at one or another of the Washington research institutes while he pondered his options.
While he has not looked for a job for himself, Mr. Summers said, he has been helping others at the Treasury find positions in the private sector.
Mr. Fuerth declined to be interviewed today. An associate said that Mr. Fuerth's thoughts today were with Mr. Gore and that he would "worry about his own future later."
Some top people in the Clinton administration announced some time ago that they did not intend to stay in the government and have already lined up new jobs.
For instance, Donna E. Shalala, secretary of health and human services for the last eight years, is to be president of the University of Miami. Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, is working on a book about relations between the United States and Russia. And on July 1, Mr. Talbott will become director of the new Yale University Center for the Study of Globalization.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is expected to write a book.
Others like Stuart E. Eizenstat, the deputy treasury secretary, planned to leave the government even if Mr. Gore was elected but had not decided on a job. Mr. Eizenstat, associates said, is weighing offers from law firms.
Roy Neel, who took a leave of absence from his job as president of the United States Telephone Association to run Mr. Gore's transition operation, will go back to lobbying for independent telephone companies like the Baby Bells.
Former Representative Thomas J. Downey, a close friend of the vice president who probably would have been offered a cabinet post or a top position in the Gore White House, has also an established lobbying practice.
One of the most disappointed Gore advisers must be Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States representative to the United Nations. Mr. Holbrooke, 59, has clearly dreamed of being secretary of state, and he had good prospects of getting that position in a Gore administration. He declined today to be interviewed.
Mr. Holbrooke, trained as a Foreign Service officer, and has experience in academic life and on Wall Street.
Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, and Bruce N. Reed, President Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser, worked on the 1992 Clinton presidential campaign and have worked in the White House ever since. Both were active in the Gore campaign this year.
They thrive on the politics and pressure of Washington and had reason to believe they would be offered senior positions if Mr. Gore won. Neither has lined up a new job.
"You don't want to call people about a job and have them say, 'Oh, they're losing faith in their guy,' " Mr. Sperling said today.
But Mr. Sperling said he was philosophical about the position he finds himself in.
"You've seen your guy win and then you've seen him win a second time and then you lose the third time, you recognize that you've had a great run and much more good fortune than any one person deserves," he said.
Another Democrat who has been in government for nearly a quarter of a century and is about to be out of a job is Vice President Gore himself. Even his closest aides say they have absolutely no idea what Mr. Gore, 52, plans to do next.

HEADLINE: When Good Drugs Go Gray;
Booming Underground Market Raises Safety Concerns

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
The price spikes and shortages of flu vaccine this year have exposed a dark corner of the drug industry, a booming gray market where medications obtained illegally are repeatedly resold, bouncing from warehouse to warehouse like so many pinballs.
The Office of Criminal Investigation at the Food and Drug Administration has opened an inquiry recently into how small drug distributors obtained thousands of vials of this year's flu vaccine and whether any laws were broken as the vaccine was diverted into this gray market, according to officials informed about the investigation. 
 The small distributors offered the flu vaccine to hospitals and clinics at as much as five times the normal price. But even more disconcerting to regulators and health officials is the possibility that the gray market vaccine was ruined as it was repeatedly shipped. Flu vaccine is supposed to be refrigerated and shipped on dry ice.
Prosecutors have won some recent cases, but gray market pharmacies and wholesalers have operated on the fringes of the drug industry for years, despite federal lawmakers' attempts to shut them down. Most often, the gray marketers get their product by setting up a pharmacy that says it is buying discounted drugs for nursing homes. Drug companies have long given deep discounts to nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions. But instead of sending the drugs to such institutions, the gray market pharmacy sells the drugs to a small wholesaler at a profit.
One small wholesaler may sell to another, who sells to another, each taking a profit and sometimes violating federal and state laws that restrict the reselling of prescription drugs.
Government investigators and prosecutors say the drugs that flow through this underground market could be valued at more than $1 billion -- roughly 1 percent of last year's total prescription drug sales.
For consumers, the gray market means greater risks that drugs will be spoiled by improper handling, and an increased chance that the drugs they buy are counterfeit. And, if a drug is recalled, it may be impossible to find those that have traveled through the gray market.
In the case of the flu vaccine, the federal investigators believe that gray market distributors may have obtained the medication after some pharmacies promised to use it in nursing homes, the sources said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had asked manufacturers to try to get the vaccine to elderly and other at-risk patients first. But instead, these pharmacies may have sold the vaccine to a small distributor, who then sold it to another, starting a string of sales.
"Is it being properly packaged and shipped as it travels these routes?" asked Joseph H. Deffenbaugh, a professional practice associate at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in Bethesda, Md. "You just don't know."
In addition to raising safety questions, the gray market can increase the price of some drugs. Some small distributors have offered flu vaccine to hospitals at prices as high as $15 a dose. The hospitals say they normally buy the vaccine for $2 or $3 a dose.
Congress passed a law in 1987, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, that tried to eliminate the gray market for all drugs. But regulators and other experts say it has had little effect. "The law and regulations are just fraught with loopholes," said Stephen J. Haynes, who retired last year from his job as special agent in charge of the investigative operations division of the F.D.A.'s Office of Criminal Investigation. "Something needs to be done."
Mr. Haynes said that while he was at the F.D.A., he investigated cases of manufacturers selling a drug to a major wholesaler, which then sold it to a gray market pharmacy, after which it passed through three or four secondary distributors before finally reaching pharmacy shelves. Some drugs make a full circle, returning to the large wholesaler who first received the drug, experts say. And it can all take place in a few days.
"It becomes hard to know where the drug originated," Mr. Haynes said, "and whose hands it has passed through."
In the simplest terms, the gray marketers make their money by buying low and selling high. "This is incredibly lucrative," said Marc N. Garber, an assistant United States attorney in Las Vegas, who has prosecuted many cases involving illegal drug diversion, including one against Bindley Western Industries, one of the five largest national drug wholesalers. That company pleaded guilty in August and agreed to pay $20 million to settle the charges.
Mr. Garber said that in a separate case, one man who was convicted of illegally diverting drugs through his wholesale business was able to move medicines worth $100 million in just two years.
In another case, federal prosecutors say that Darin D. Asay and Wendy E. Almanza, a married couple, made $5 million to $10 million in illegal profits by setting up pharmacies across the West that said they were buying drugs for nursing homes. The two, who lived in Evergreen, Colo., have each pleaded guilty to fraud and are awaiting sentencing. Claiming that the young couple obtained most of their wealth illegally, the government seized their $6 million mountain home, $1.4 million in savings, artwork and a new $63,000 Range Rover.
John S. Tatum, a lawyer in Aurora, Colo., who represents Ms. Almanza, confirmed the particulars of the case but declined to make his client available for an interview.
Many of the gray marketers thrive in Sun Belt areas like Southern California and Nevada.
Keith W. Macdonald, executive secretary of the Nevada Pharmacy Board, said investigators had found that some of the pharmacies that diverted drugs were just storefronts or vacant warehouses without shelves. And even as some of the diverters are prosecuted, he said, many have found ways to keep operating, changing the name and location of their business and finding people willing to sign state licensing papers for them.
"There are people," Mr. Macdonald said, "who have been in this market for years."
Martin Paul Rubin of Las Vegas, who has two prior convictions relating to fraud on drug companies, was indicted in September in Los Angeles for helping to operate what prosecutors said was a sophisticated ring that illegally obtained drugs at greatly reduced prices and then resold them in the gray market.
Kenneth I. Kahn, Mr. Rubin's lawyer, denied the charges, saying the government had no evidence that Mr. Rubin had broken any laws.
Such cases are often very difficult to prosecute. In May, a federal judge said that Wilbur Swift, who operates a distribution business in California, and his three partners could not be charged criminally in a federal case in Kansas City, Mo. Prosecutors said the four men had participated in a scheme involving pharmacies buying discounted drugs, saying they were for nursing homes, and then reselling them.
Judge Scott O. Wright, in United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, said the drug companies appeared to be engaging in illegal pricing practices by having different prices for different customers. Therefore, Judge Wright said, Mr. Swift and his partners could not be held criminally liable for defrauding the companies. The government has appealed.
Bruce C. Houdek, Mr. Swift's lawyer, said the drug companies appeared to know that Mr. Swift and his fellow defendants were reselling drugs. If the companies have a slow-selling drug, he said, "they open up the gates and sell their drugs cheaper."
"They cast a blind eye," he said.
Mr. Tatum, Ms. Almanza's lawyer, agreed. "It is hard for me to believe that the drug companies do not know what is going on," he said.
But the drug companies say that is not true. Some have even hired investigators to track wholesalers that may be violating the law. Other drug companies send auditors to wholesalers and pharmacies, and cut off those that raise suspicions.
The Schering-Plough Corporation, for example, conducts reviews of any person or business that it has questions about, said William J. O'Donnell, a company spokesman. "We make sure people are who they say they are," he said.
But it is clear, Mr. Haynes and other experts say, that if the drug companies did not use a tiered pricing system, much of the gray market would disappear.
The price differences can be substantial. In Mr. Swift's case, prosecutors found that Parke-Davis, a unit of Pfizer and the maker of Accupril, a blood pressure drug, was selling the medicine to a retail pharmacy for $73.75, while charging the pharmacy that was allegedly buying for nursing homes $38.18.
The problem is made worse, prosecutors say, when the big wholesalers, the first stop in the distribution system for most drugs, are not vigilant about trying to stop the illegal activity if they grow suspicious. Indeed, some investigations have found the big distributors doing substantial business with the gray marketers.
In August, Bindley Western Industries pleaded guilty to conspiracy for its involvement with distributors that were buying and reselling discounted drugs. According to court papers, Bindley Western shipped discounted drugs to pharmacies even though company managers knew the drugs would be illegally resold. One manager at Bindley's warehouse in San Dimas, Calif., received $500,000 from some of the small wholesalers in exchange for information on which pharmacies would sell them discounted drugs, according to the settlement agreement that the company signed. The wholesalers were not named in the case.
Michael D. McCormick, the company's general counsel, said Bindley Western, which agreed this month to be acquired by Cardinal Health, had strengthened its programs aimed at stopping diversion. Mr. McCormick said he could not comment further because the government was continuing its investigation and could file charges against other businesses or individuals. All charges against Bindley, he said, have been settled.

HEADLINE: THE 43rd PRESIDENT: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
BUSH PLEDGES TO BE PRESIDENT FOR 'ONE NATION,' NOT ONE PARTY; GORE, CONCEDING, URGES UNITY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 13

 BODY:
George W. Bush spoke to the nation for the first time as president-elect tonight, declaring that the "nation must rise above a house divided" after one of the closest and most disputed presidential elections in United States history.
Speaking from the podium of the Texas House of Representatives, precisely 24 hours after the United State Supreme Court ended a five-week-long dispute by halting a recount of Florida's disputed votes, and thus preserving Mr. Bush's razor-thin lead, the 54-year-old governor devoted his entire speech to themes of reconciliation. 
 "I was not elected to serve one party, but to serve one nation," Mr. Bush said.
"Whether you voted for me or not, I will do my best to serve your interests," he said, "and I will work to earn your respect." Transcript, Page A24.
A little more than an hour before, Vice President Al Gore called Mr. Bush to say he was withdrawing from the 17-month-long presidential race, and congratulated the Texas governor, who was first elected to office here only six years ago, on being elected the 43rd president of the United States.
Minutes later, in his own speech from his ceremonial office next door to the White House, Mr. Gore said that while he disagreed with the court's ruling "I offer my concession."
Mr. Bush appeared by turns relaxed and slightly nervous, licking his upper lip as he looked around the large chamber, dominated by a huge Christmas tree and filled with his supporters and staff. "I have a lot to be thankful for," he said in a speech that emphasized only common ground between Democrats and Republicans, and made only glancing references to the disputes that punctuated the campaign and its often bitter aftermath. "I am thankful for America, and thankful that we are able to resolve our electoral differences in a peaceful way."
The choice of locale for his speech underscored the theme: The Texas House is under Democratic control. Mr. Bush used the moment to reiterate some of his campaign themes, talking of making "all our public schools excellent," strengthening Medicare and creating a prescription drug benefit for "all of our seniors." He talked of a "broad, fair and fiscally responsible tax relief" a phrase so vague that it could embrace many varieties of tax cuts -- and like Mr. Gore an hour before him, talked of "common ground."
"During the fall campaign, we differed about details of these proposals but there was remarkable consensus about the important issues before us." He spoke of serving "every race and every background," aware that minorities voted overwhelmingly against him in last month's election.
It was not the kind of speech Mr. Bush would have delivered had he won the large victory his aides were predicting on election night. He offered nothing to the conservative wing of his party, and evoked none of the cultural issues that often divide the two parties.
Mr. Bush is expected to travel to Washington next Tuesday, aides said, and meet both President Clinton and Vice President Gore. But his transition is already under way, and with tonight's concession by Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush will now have use of the $5 million transition budget and a large office blocks from the White House. Within days, he is expected to start naming his senior staff and cabinet members, probably starting with Gen. Colin L. Powell as secretary of state.
Though he briefly invoked the words of Abraham Lincoln at the opening of his speech, Mr. Bush referred directly to only one of his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson, who took office in a disputed election in 1800.
"I will be guided by President Jefferson's sense of purpose," he said, "to stand for principle, to be reasonable in manner, and, above all, to do great good for the cause of freedom and harmony."
"The presidency is more than an honor. It is more than an office," he concluded.
"It is a charge to keep." The last phrase was also the title of a book he published at the beginning of the campaign to introduce himself to the American people.
Mr. Bush's speech to the nation tonight was no ordinary victory address. After weeks of legal maneuvering and two rapid-fire decisions by the Supreme Court which effectively ended Mr. Gore's hopes for a recount on Tuesday night, Mr. Bush had much more to accomplish tonight than declaring himself the victor on a typical Election Day.
A man who is at his most uncomfortable with formal addresses in formal settings was called on to give one that he knew would set the tone of his first term. It was a night for perfect pitch and appropriate symbolism, "chiefly the olive branch," one aide said.
His words were simple, his rhetoric not as lofty as the speech Mr. Gore gave an hour before. In discussions leading up to the drafting of the speech, aides said he had to be humble, while making it clear that other nations and his political opponents at home should not question his command of the office. It is unclear whether he accomplished that goal; his only reference to America's role in the world was a call for bipartisan foreign policy and "a military equal to every challenge, and superior to every adversary."
He had to appeal to those who, despite a nearly year-and-a-half-long campaign and a five-week recount, still question whether he comes to the job adequately prepared, or risks becoming captive to a talented set of advisers.
The Bush camp is acutely aware that the Republican majority in the House of Representatives is so small as to be virtually useless. That creates a far larger challenge than Mr. Clinton had in 1993, when he enjoyed a substantial Democratic majority -- before losing it, for the rest of his presidency, in the 1994 midterm elections. Moreover, the Senate is now divided 50-50, though the vice president elect, Dick Cheney, will cast the deciding vote if there is a tie.
So it was no surprise that Mr. Bush chose his setting with bipartisan care: he was introduced by the Democratic speaker of the Texas House, Pete Laney, who praised Mr. Bush effusively as a leader and a partner. Though the Legislature is not in session, many of its members attended.
But even such a show of bipartisan comity could not overcome some of the bitterness of today's events. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, angry at the Supreme Court's decision, declared that while Mr. Bush would legally serve as president, he had no "moral authority." Perhaps that is why Mr. Bush chose to paraphrase Lincoln.
"There were also questions about Lincoln's legitimacy," David Donald, a Lincoln biographer, noted recently. "Those dissipated, and I hope these questions will dissipate too."
Nonetheless, Mr. Bush is the first president to take office in an election that was for all practical purposes settled by Supreme Court. And not since 1888, when Benjamin Harrison won the presidential election, has anyone assumed the presidency after losing the popular vote but winning the electoral vote.
Mr. Bush also shares that dubious electoral distinction with two others: Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 and John Quincy Adams in 1824. Mr. Adams was also the only other son of a president to win the presidency.
Under very different circumstances, other presidents have faced tasks similar to Mr. Bush's tonight. Another politician who learned his political skills in the chamber where Mr. Bush spoke tonight, Lyndon B. Johnson, faced a similar challenge of unifying the nation after he was thrust into the presidency by the assassination of his predecessor, John F. Kennedy. But the tragic circumstances of his ascendancy created a well of sympathy that Mr. Bush does not enjoy.
Gerald R. Ford had a more analogous job of reunifying the nation after a bitter and partisan division, and hours after President Richard M. Nixon resigned he declared that "our long national nightmare is over."
"Both Johnson and Ford were far more successful in sending out unifying messages than anyone thought at the time they could be," said Michael Beschloss, a historian who has focused on Mr. Johnson's term.
But both men, he noted, were thrown into the Oval Office by fate; Mr. Bush must overcome suspicions among many of his political opponents that he took office by obstructing a reliable recount of the Florida vote. And both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Ford were creatures of Congress and understood how it operated; Mr. Bush, like Mr. Clinton before him, must learn that territory on the job.
Tonight Mr. Bush also had to take firm command of a national agenda, when many suggest that the manner of his election may impose limitations on his powers. He did not refer to that problem, though Mr. Gore, in his speech, addressed the question head-on. He said that while many believed Mr. Bush would be hampered, "I do not believe it need be so." In some ways, Mr. Gore's speech was a more passionate call for the nation to rally around the new president than Mr. Bush's was.
Many of Mr. Bush's advisers say that in the next few months, he must focus on common ground with his Democratic opponents, and win bipartisan passage of some major piece of legislation to show that he is willing to come to the middle. But there is still debate within the Bush camp about what that piece of legislation should be.
He also faces an array of immediate challenges, at home and abroad, that will not wait for Senate confirmations or the selection of roughly 800 senior White House staff.
The economy is clearly slowing, and while Mr. Cheney has warned of an impending recession born in the Clinton administration, it will be up to a Bush administration to keep it from happening. Privately some of his advisers worry that Mr. Bush's economic bench is not as deep as his national security bench.
His chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, is a respected former member of the Federal Reserve Board, but the search for a treasury secretary has focused on Wall Street.
Whoever gets the job will have to help decide whether to pursue the kind of deep tax cuts that Mr. Bush talked about as a candidate. Many Republicans believe that Mr. Bush's plans will have to be dramatically scaled back given the composition of Congress, though most believe some reductions in estate taxes and the elimination of the marriage penalty could prove low-hanging fruit for Mr. Bush's first few months in office.
A man who has traveled abroad only three times, with the exception of many trips to Mexico, must now handle an increasingly assertive Russia, a Middle East in crisis, and enormous division in his own party about how to deal with China.
He also faces increasing suspicion of America's economic, military and cultural power, and the resentments it has engendered. None of these issues were discussed tonight, but they cannot be avoided in coming days.
"That will be a key test for him," said Joseph S. Nye, the dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and an official in the C.I.A. and the Defense Department in Mr. Clinton's first term. "He has said he will not tolerate isolationism. What isn't clear is what his position is on unilateralism."

HEADLINE: THE 43rd PRESIDENT: THE VOTERS;
Some Americans Seem Ready to Move On, but Others Aren't So Sure

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

DATELINE: ORANGE, Calif., Dec. 13

 BODY:
As the longtime owner of the local barbershop, Hank Mascolo keeps his finger on the pulse of the political sentiments here.
"Bush won it fair, and I think Gore is a sore loser and can't accept the fact that he lost," Mr. Mascolo, 76, said as he brushed the hair off the neck of Bob Reed, a caterer seated in his barber's chair. 
 "I can speak on behalf of a lot of people who come in this shop and say the same thing," he continued. "I think even Democrats here have had enough. The counting and recouting, the lower courts and upper courts."
Mr. Reed, who joked that he was a Democrat until Mr. Mascolo shaved his head, vacillated between joking about the subject and reflecting on what was next for the country. "We've got a recession to fight now that Clinton's leaving," he said.
Most residents interviewed today in downtown Orange, a conservative Republican stronghold in Orange County, talked about moving forward. But conversations here and across the nation invariably returned to vote counting and court actions as dozens of voters reacted to, and reflected on, the marathon presidential election that finally came to an end with a ruling from the United States Supreme Court on Tuesday.
Here in Orange, there was plenty of animosity toward Vice President Al Gore for prolonging the election, with some residents going so far as to speculate that he would never truly concede.
"They keep saying the votes weren't counted," said Grace Callahan, who was chatting with Ann and Hollis Collins in the Christian Science reading room. "The votes were counted. They were counted several times."
She suggested that Mr. Gore should have followed in the footsteps of Richard M. Nixon after he lost a close race against John F. Kennedy, and conceded gracefully weeks ago.
"We don't have a perfect voting system and we'll never have a perfect voting system, and that's what people need to know," Ms. Callahan said. "You know what this could all lead to is revolution. They're stirring people up who are ignorant. The voter has a responsibility to do it right."
But Mr. Collins, a volunteer at the reading room, said he did not fault Mr. Gore for trying. "You can't blame the guy for going this way," he said. "I think I'd do the same thing."
In fact, he said, he thought some good could come out of it if the country ended up with new, uniform voting equipment.
Although Ms. Callahan worried that the issue would continue to divide the country along political lines, Mr. Collins predicted that people would forget after a year because "Bush would do such a good job."
Ms. Callahan cited Mr. Bush's successes in crossing political lines in Texas as evidence that he would be able to do the same across the United States, and said it was now up to Mr. Gore to allow him to do so.
Several Orange residents said that although they tried to follow the events closely, they were still not sure what lessons they had learned in the weeks of court battles and arguments about the election.
"Half the things the court said I didn't understand," Mr. Mascolo said.
Mr. Reed added, "I followed it for a while, but I got so tired of it I didn't give a darn anymore."
As Mr. Reed and Mr. Mascolo chatted, a new occupant took the chair, but he seemed more guarded in his comments.
"I've always thought that Gore was a fair person," said Don Hutchinson, a retiree.
"Hank give him my haircut," Mr. Reed joked.
But rather than argue about the election, Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Mascolo said that they had agreed to stick to arguments regarding brickwork in the public circle.
But Mr. Hutchinson, the lone voice for Mr. Gore, had one final thought.
"There are so many questions all of us have, and all you have to do is listen to the people's voices," he said. "Understanding the course of events will take years and years. Whether the effect will be good or bad, even if it's what we think it is today, is going to be a long time coming."

NEW JERSEY ECONOMIC FORECAST

BYLINE: By Allison Fass 

 BODY:
New Jersey's economy will be moderate through 2005 without a serious threat of recession, according to an economic forecast released yesterday by the director of the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service. Nancy H. Mantell, the director, said she expected the average growth rate for personal income to remain about double the growth of consumer prices throughout the forecast period. For example, the report said, personal income in New Jersey increased by 5.4 percent this year, with consumer prices increasing about 3 percent. The report predicted a personal income growth rate average of 5.1 percent from 2002 to 2005, with consumer prices increasing on average by 2.6 percent. Allison Fass (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE 43rd PRESIDENT: MAN IN THE NEWS;
The 43rd President -- George Walker Bush

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 13

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush cast his quest for the presidency as a stand against poisonous Washington -- its gridlock, its scandals, its bruising partisanship -- and in the very last week of his campaign he was barnstorming under bright banners that promised, "Bringing America Together."
But as Mr. Bush was finally able to claim a belated and minuscule victory over Vice President Al Gore, after a debilitating month of bare-knuckled court fighting, it was as if he had somehow crossed through the looking glass. 
 In the contested aftermath of Election Day, the man who presented himself as a Texas outsider turned to the ultimate Washington insiders to secure his victory. James A. Baker III, Dick Cheney and Andrew H. Card, all from Mr. Bush's father's administration, became the faces of the Bush presidency in waiting, and Theodore B. Olson, the capital's reigning conservative litigator, argued the case at the Supreme Court.
Far from calming the flames of partisanship, Mr. Bush's struggle for victory against Mr. Gore fanned them to an intensity not seen since President Clinton's impeachment. And suddenly Mr. Bush seemed lassoed to the Congressional leaders whom he had once kept so carefully at a distance, as they thundered on his behalf against the "unelected judges" of Florida who were rendering verdicts about the vote.
Now George Walker Bush, 54, comes into office as only the fourth man in history -- and the first in more than a century -- to assume the presidency without winning the popular vote. Like the only other son of a president to win the office himself, John Quincy Adams in 1824 (who had fewer popular votes than Andrew Jackson), Mr. Bush lost the popular vote in a disputed election to a Tennessean. Indeed, Mr. Bush won office with 271 electoral votes, just one more than the minimum.
Mr. Bush is not facing personal scandal, as President Clinton did. But his situation may be just as searing politically, for Mr. Bush ultimately won through a bruising legal battle over the 25 electoral votes in a state run by his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. It was a fight that was finally decided by nine Supreme Court justices, who split bitterly over the issue.
With his speech tonight from the Texas House of Representatives, Mr. Bush began trying to pull the nation together after this grueling ordeal, choosing the House because it is a chamber where the Democrats have a majority. He quoted the words of Thomas Jefferson who won the presidency in 1800 only after 36 ballots in the House of Representatives.
And he said that the rancor and strange circumstances of his election could lead to healing and help him bring the warring Congressional leaders together.
"I am optimistic that we can change the tone in Washington, D.C.," Mr. Bush said. "I believe things happen for a reason, and I hope the long wait of the last five weeks will heighten a desire to move beyond the bitterness and partisanship of the past."
Republicans say Mr. Bush's quick instincts about people and his years of reaching across the aisle in Texas have prepared him for this moment.
"It will take extraordinary effort, but you know, he's known for that," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who was one of Mr. Bush's Republican primary opponents. "When he took over in Texas it wasn't exactly a Republican paradise. He's worked well with Democrats."
But on Capitol Hill, Democratic partisans suggest that the bitterness will not evaporate overnight.
"There will always be this sense that there was some larceny involved in this election," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.
Indeed, it is hard to see how Mr. Bush can claim any mandate at all, a blow to his once confident prediction that his disciplined repetition of a campaign agenda would allow him to say: "This is what the American people have heard. This is what the American people want."
The extraordinary political divide in Congress only magnifies Mr. Bush's problems, with the Senate split 50-50 and the House lineup of 221 Republicans, 210 Democrats, 2 independents and a vacancy, giving the majority party one of the smallest margins in a century.
Under these circumstances, and with the economy showing signs of slowing, even members of Congress from Mr. Bush's own party say the next few years will be a time for incremental compromise -- not for his grand plans for a sweeping tax cut or for diverting some Social Security payroll taxes into private investment accounts.
Yet Republicans from the conservative wing of the party are practically bursting with pent-up desires to pass a conservative agenda. "The things we have been dreaming about we can now do unfettered," Representative Tom DeLay, the hard-driving House majority whip from Texas said recently, though he added, "hopefully with bipartisan Democratic support."
 
A Leader Lacking Definition
Mr. Bush's path to the Oval Office has left him with only a small reserve of governing experience to draw upon as he tries to navigate these shoals.
Born on July 6, 1946, Mr. Bush drifted through much of his adult life, from oil ventures to partial ownership of a baseball team, until he won his first political office six years ago. Though he was himself the son of a president, his own mother did not expect him to win that race, against a formidable Texas governor, Ann Richards.
Mr. Bush may well prove again -- as he did in that Texas race and in this year's presidential debates -- that people underestimate him. But because of the partisan animosities that have hardened over the past five weeks no one in Washington is expecting Mr. Bush to have any honeymoon. He will quickly be forced to define who he is, how flexible he is, whether he will be an ideologue, a pragmatist of something in between.
Whatever he does will be revealing because even after almost 17 months on the campaign trail before the inconclusive Election Day, the amiable Mr. Bush remained something of a political Rorschach test, rounding off the edges of ideology and image enough for voters to see in him what they wanted to see. And even after this postelection interval the picture became no clearer. He kept such a low profile, at his Texas ranch or in the Texas Capitol, that his running mate, Mr. Cheney, was forced to fend off questions about whether he was really the one in charge.
At times during the campaign, Mr. Bush simply seemed to be selling his infectious optimism to the point that it almost did not seem to matter how much he tortured the English language or what he was really trying to say. The cheers did not stop at one Wisconsin rally even as Mr. Bush twisted a sentence into a sunny but nonsensical knot, proclaiming, "Families is where our nation takes hope, where wings take dream."
Is he a principled conservative or a pragmatic deal-maker? A brash and politically savvy Texas outsider or a privileged Ivy Leaguer plugged into his father's old-boy network? A clever politician tapping into the nation's anti-elitism or a defiant anti-intellectual uninterested in the fine points of policy and ideas?
In some ways the lack of definition might be a blessing now, allowing him to adjust to the divided nation.
Over the course of his campaign, Mr. Bush created a new Republican synthesis; he ran against Bill Clinton and sounded like him at the same time.
At one moment he was raising his right hand high and making his signature pledge to restore "honor and integrity" to the White House, a slap at Mr. Clinton's behavior in office. In the next breath, he was speaking about being a president "willing to reach across the partisan divide and to unite this nation" -- a paraphrase of Mr. Clinton's own vow four years ago in the final days of his re-election bid, "to get away from the politics of division and embrace the politics of union."
Mr. Bush said he would be a "compassionate conservative" who cared about the less well-off in society. His declaration that "I do not believe that government is the enemy, but I do not believe it is always the answer" was a gentle half-turn away from Ronald Reagan's blunt assertion that "government is the problem."
Mr. Bush so played down divisive social issues that abortion opponents could trust his pledge to name "strict constructionists" to the Supreme Court, while Republicans on the other side of the issue could argue that he would do nothing to overturn the decision that legalized abortion.
Yet at the same time Mr. Bush never shied away from forthrightly calling himself a conservative. Indeed, it could be argued that his agenda was as conservative as Mr. Reagan's: a tax cut larger than Congressional Republicans had ever dreamed of, a robust missile defense shield and sweeping overhauls of those two Democratic pillars, Social Security and Medicare.
Indeed, Mr. Bush's anti-government tones became more pronounced as he tried to fire up his partisans in the closing weeks of the campaign, deriding his opponent as being "of Washington, D.C., by Washington, D.C., for Washington, D.C." He thundered that Mr. Gore "trusts government, which stands in stark contrast to our view."
"We trust people," Mr. Bush said.
 
A Test of His Easy Charm
Mr. Bush now faces the test of his drive, his leadership abilities, his way with people.
To push anything through the bitterly divided Congress, Mr. Bush will have to build coalitions that reach across party lines. In this, he is counting on the easy charm that served him so well, as a cheerleader at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., as a businessman wooing investors for his oil ventures or to build a baseball stadium or a presidential candidate courting the journalists in the back of his campaign plane.
More than six years ago, Mr. Bush was still weeks away from victory in his first campaign for governor, when he paid a secret visit to Bob Bullock, the Democrat who was the lieutenant governor of Texas and the most powerful person in state politics.
"You may not think I'm going to win," Mr. Bush told Mr. Bullock. "But when I do I want to work with you."
Mr. Bush has made some overtures to Democrats already. He spoke recently to Senator John B. Breaux, the centrist Louisiana Democrat who broke with his party to promote an overhaul of Medicare much like the one Mr. Bush later came to endorse. He also reached out to Representative Gene Taylor, the Mississippi Democrat who said he would support Mr. Bush if the election were thrown into the House.
Mr. Bush's advisers insist that the efforts to reach out will only intensify, and that Mr. Bush will quickly meet with Congressional leaders of both parties.
"Look at this guy's record," said Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who is a close adviser to Mr. Bush. "He is going to reach out to get things done. People have talked about the Clinton-Gore administration as a permanent campaign. That's not going to happen with George Bush. His style's to reach out across party lines."
Some of Mr. Bush's hopes of putting prominent Democrats in his cabinet have been made far more difficult by the 50-50 split in the Senate which has made Democrats loath to desert their party and give up their seats. But aides say Mr. Bush would still like to see at least one Democrat in a high-ranking or cabinet position.
Advisers predict that he will also move to form commissions on Social Security and Medicare that would include Democrats like Bob Kerrey and Daniel P. Moynihan, two retiring senators who broke with their party to support the introduction of individual investment accounts into Social Security.
Will such gestures work? Mr. Bush may well find that his skill at dealing with like-minded conservative Democrats in Texas will not be as transferable to Washington as he believes, particularly after the acrimony over Florida.
Mr. Bush's advisers believe he can draw support from the Blue-Dog Democrats, a conservative Democratic caucus. But for this to work in these partisan times it will require more than just asking for their votes.
"We're not going to be charmed by whoever the president is," said Representative Gary A. Condit, a California Democrat and one of the founders of the group. "We're not going to be browbeaten by who the leadership is. We're there to be equal partners in the drafting of public policy."
If the Democrats are warning that they will not be pliant, Mr. Bush has to hope that his efforts to reach out do not cause a rebellion from conservatives like Mr. DeLay who recently proclaimed triumphantly: "We have the House. We have the Senate. We have the White House. Which means we have the agenda."
One adviser to Mr. Bush acknowledges, "One of the challenges will be the relationship with some of the more conservative or partisan Republicans on the Hill." The adviser added, "I think they will need to adjust to a president who is more interested in results than in politics, and that in the end may be a larger challenge than to get Democrats to sit down and roll up their sleeves and work."
Mr. Bush has said that one of his earliest priorities will be to win passage of his education agenda. He also wants to move fast to give states help in assisting the neediest elderly with prescription drugs until a more far-reaching overhaul of the federal Medicare program could be put in place.
Other decisions are more difficult. Mr. Bush will have to decide soon whether to try for his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut all at once or try to enact it piecemeal. Democrats and even many Republicans argue that a push for the full tax cut would immediately polarize the Congress.
They say Mr. Bush would be better off signing some smaller tax cuts, to repeal the estate tax and reduce taxes on married couples. These proposals drew some Democratic support but were vetoed by President Clinton.
But one senior adviser to Mr. Bush said that the slowing economy made Mr. Bush ever more intent on trying to enact broad tax relief.
Mr. Bush also must decide when and how to try to push through his most politically charged proposal -- to divert some Social Security payroll taxes to individual investment accounts. Back when his advisers once thought he would have a decisive victory, they were predicting that he would try to act in the first six months of his administration, when a new president's power is at its peak.
But aides say such decisions were put off as Mr. Bush's advisers turned all their attention to the legal and public relations battle over Florida.
 
Too Reaganesque?
Another question about Mr. Bush is whether his Reaganesque management style will work in such divided times. He made no secret that he is a delegator, frequently telling his audiences that they were electing not just a president but also an administration.
"I don't think you can expect any president to know all things about all subjects," Mr. Bush said earlier this year, adding that one of the roles of a leader was "to surround himself with excellent folks."
And he scoffed at Mr. Gore's well-known attention to the fine points of policy, saying dismissively one day, "I think if he's memorized the budget, I'd kind of wonder out loud about how he spends his time."
But when Mr. Bush pushed Mr. Cheney to the forefront of the transition during the past month, it only seemed to diminish Mr. Bush himself.
His confident public assertions last month about Mr. Cheney's health, which failed to include any information about the medical procedures that doctors had used to treat what turned out to be a mild heart attack -- raised the question of whether Mr. Bush was on top of events at all.
During the campaign, some Republicans saw the governor as too detached and complained that the "Iron Triangle" of Texans who ran his campaign -- Joseph Allbaugh, Karen P. Hughes and Karl Rove -- were not open enough to outside advice or responsive enough to events.
But the hierarchy he created as governor of Texas was less rigid. And his advisers say Mr. Bush has already learned a lesson from a mistake his father made as president: he will avoid having one all-powerful chief of staff, like John H. Sununu, as the only aide funneling information to him.
While Mr. Bush delegates authority, his aides contend that he keeps his eye on the big picture, is more involved in decision-making than Mr. Reagan ever was and is not afraid to overrule his advisers, seeking progress reports and keeping staff discussions focused with penetrating and sometimes surprisingly simple but provocative questions.
It was Mr. Bush himself, staff members say, who insisted on making the creation of individual investment accounts in Social Security a pivotal plank of his campaign. (His political advisers had objected, and panicked Republicans from Capitol Hill begged him to avoid the issue.) "He's willing to overrule the majority of his advisers if he thinks it's important," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser.
And Mr. Bush, according to several aides, brought a briefing on military policy to a screeching halt in the spring of 1999 by interrupting one of his national security advisers to ask, "What's the military for?" This began a long, thoughtful discussion about the purposes and goals of military spending.
Mr. Bush has already named one of his father's former aides, Mr. Card, a lobbyist for the auto industry, as his White House chief of staff. Several Republican officials affiliated with the Bush campaign said Mr. Bush had already decided that retired Gen. Colin L. Powell would be his secretary of state and that Condoleezza Rice, who helped his campaign formulate its foreign policy positions, would be his national security adviser.
With Mr. Cheney also down the hall, the administration is beginning to look a little like a Bush restoration, though many of the Texans from the campaign are also expected to hold prominent positions. And it is hard to imagine that Mr. Bush will not occasionally want his father on the other end of the telephone giving advice.
In his musings along the campaign trail, Mr. Bush often suggested that at the end of four years he would dearly like to have solved one of the biggest problems of the coming decades: keeping Social Security and Medicare solvent as the baby boom generation retires.
Mr. Bush has not always been in step with his generation, staying distant from the political upheavals of the 1960's that fueled the civil rights movement, the protests against the Vietnam War and the counterculture. His aides say that he now considers the overhaul of the retirement systems a final test of whether his generation will rise above selfishness.
Whether he can still harbor such grand hopes now is not clear. But he is likely to give it a try. "Why run for office if you are not going to try something like entitlement reform?" Mr. Bush said to reporters one summer day on his plane. "Why run?"

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:

 A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"GIORGIO ARMANI," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 17). The Guggenheim has served up another plateau of urban history: a retrospective of the Milanese fashion designer Giorgio Armani. What it lacks in depth it makes up for with sparkle, and Robert Wilson's architectural transformation of the museum's rotunda may be the best yet. In an inverted version of a life class, instead of the undraped body, the show offers just the drapes. The mannequins have been pared down to the edges of the costumes, and they cluster in groups in the building's structural bays, spatial modules with the proportions of shop windows. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 students and the elderly (Herbert Muschamp). 

* "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with handwritten words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an icebreaking introduction to an art that to anyone who doesn't know Chinese can seem unapproachable. Hours: Sundays, and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students 12 and older and the elderly (Holland Cotter).
 
 LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
 
 * "SOL LEWITT: A RETROSPECTIVE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 25). Unexpectedly, the most beautiful exhibition by a living artist in a New York museum in a long time and an antidote to the nonsense in several other museums around town. Just about every other wall is covered with wall drawings, alternately eye-popping and gossamer. Those out there (you know who you are) who run from any artist linked to Conceptualism may want to stop and re-evaluate your views after seeing what's here. The master of chaste white cubes has undergone a transformation since his last retrospective in the late 70's. Now opulence emerges from the same seemingly prosaic instructions he came up with years ago. The appeal is still to patient observation, a lesson for everyone, delivered elegantly. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).
 
 * "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000" covers 1960 to the present and fills nearly the entire museum with almost a dozen different theme shows. "White" is one theme. Memorial art is another. Childhood and lost innocence is yet another. Like previous installments in this year-and-a-half-long navel-gazing reconsideration by the museum of how to present its permanent collection in anticipation of its future home, the show has the effect of being clever and a little too solipsistic: it's about smart curators making occasionally vivid and previously unseen connections among disparate works without making particularly fresh sense of the period as a whole. It's artistic game playing, highly pleasurable up to a point. The themes are always arguable, which is part of the game. This also becomes an occasion for the museum to parade acquisitions during the last decade, which include Gerhard Richter's series of paintings based on the Baader-Meinhof gang, occupying an entire room and probably the exhibition's high point. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * "RAIN OF THE MOON: SILVER IN ANCIENT PERU," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through April 22). Symbols of power and prestige in ancient Peru, gold and silver were equally revered, and Peruvian metalsmiths acquired great skill in the techniques of working them. This show deals with silver, harder to capture and preserve than gold, dating from the late first millennium B.C. to the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. The objects range from nose ornaments and ear pieces, some of them amazingly large, to human and animal figures, like a famous Inka llama whose hanging fleece is evoked by the rippled, crumpled sheet of silver that covers its body. As most gold and silver objects in Peru were melted down by the Spanish conquistadors, this show -- half from the Met's collection and half from loans -- amounts to a bonanza. It is the first devoted to the subject of pre-Columbian Peruvian silver. Hours and admission: See above (Grace Glueck).
 
 * BRIDGET RILEY, "Reconnaissance," Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566 (through June 17). Once overly identified with Op Art, this British abstract painter never got her due in anti-Op New York, but a beautifully installed show of 40 paintings from 1961 to 1984 should change things. Concentrating on the early black-and-white paintings that made Ms. Riley famous, it presents stringently pure yet accessible works that have, at their best, extended the optical potential implicit in the work of Mondrian, Josef Albers and Ad Reinhardt. At their weakest, their meticulously calibrated patterns can be so aggressive that they virtually kidnap the eye, take it on a joy ride and leave it in a crumpled heap. Either way, the overall effect is of an artist of unusual dedication who has remained loyal to the original premises of her art and yet steadfastly refused to repeat herself. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).
 
 * SCYTHIAN GOLD. "The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4). "Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot "In the Land of the Scythians" of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 * "JOHN WESLEY: PAINTINGS 1961-2000," P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Jan. 14). For 40 years Mr. Wesley's paintings have maintained the same mild form of constructive lunacy. The art world has a handful of indispensable visionaries like Mr. Wesley, who help to keep everyone else honest. You may not enjoy his show, the first full-dress local retrospective, only because simple pleasure is not the intended effect. The images are borrowed from magazines and comics: Blondie and Dagwood, Donald Duck and young naked women, painted flat, like coloring-book designs, with delicate black outlines and off-key colors. The style alludes to Matisse, Hokusai, Greek vase painting, Art Nouveau, Toulouse-Lautrec. Emotion is there below the comic exterior, and it is pathos, mostly. Mr. Wesley offers up sex as unquenchable desire and woeful male inadequacy, a black comedy of men chasing after women they can only dream about. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Kimmelman).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
LYONEL FEININGER, "From the Gelmeroda Cycle," Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500 (through Jan. 26). The painter of misty yet precisely gridded Cubist cityscapes was always an excellent and versatile draftsman. In this fine exhibition of small drawings, mostly from the teens and all focused on a single church in the village of Gelmeroda near Weimar, Germany, we see the artist working with an exquisitely sensitive touch in styles ranging from sketchy naturalism to vigorously gestural Expressionism to crystalline abstraction (Johnson).
 
 * "FROM THE ARTIST'S STUDIO: UNKNOWN PRINTS AND DRAWINGS BY MARY CASSATT," Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6800 (through Dec. 22). This extraordinary exhibition presents 120 prints and drawings from a heretofore privately held collection. Covering the entire course of Cassatt's printmaking career, it features multiple states of many of the great color etchings that she produced after seeing a show of Japanese woodcuts in Paris in 1890. These intimate images of women in private domestic moments or tending children are as striking for their abstract structure as for their incipiently erotic sensuality (Johnson).
 
 LASZLO MOHOLY-NAGY, Ubu, 16 East 78th Street, (212) 794-4444 (through Dec. 22). Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946), the once hugely influential Modernist and Bauhaus educator, is today only hazily remembered. This extensive and diverse sampling of small works on paper shows why. The show is like a hall of mirrors that palely reflect many more interesting artists: Rodchenko, Mondrian, Man Ray and others. Moholy-Nagy's dream of fusion among art, science and industry shows in a Constructivist formalism that, while not unplayful, has a bland, corporate impersonality (Johnson).
 
 ERNEST LAWSON, Gerald Peters Gallery, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760 (through Dec. 22). Although a member of the gritty realists known as the Ashcan School, Lawson (1873-1939) is better known today as a landscapist whose loosely brushed Impressionist-style canvases had little to do with Ashcan urban concerns. His palette was generally on the low-key side, which served him well in the quiet, brooding landscapes -- particularly of Manhattan's upper reaches, like Inwood and the Harlem River -- that were his strength. His handling of white could be lyrical, as demonstrated in wonderful scenes of snow, beaches and atmospheric effects (Glueck).
 
 JAUME PLENSA, "Twin Shadows," Richard Gray, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 472-8787, and Galerie Lelong, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 315-0470 (through Dec. 22). This 45-year-old Catalan, who lives in Paris and Barcelona, has an impressive flair for theater. At Gray, video-projected, God-like eyes survey a broad table covered in red velvet that bears engraved glass balls spelling out elemental dualities like "semen-blood" and "night-day." At Lelong, recorded sounds of lovemaking issue from below a wooden deck; glass ball works mounted on opposite walls spell out the themes: "dream" and "desire" (Johnson).
 
 LAURIE SIMMONS, "Tourism, 1984," Skarstedt Fine Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 737-2060 (through Dec. 23). Known for her photography of constructed miniscale scenes, Ms. Simmons concocted "Tourism, 1984" after a harried visit to the Acropolis that year. She decided that such glamour destinations might be better experienced in reproduction, the way most of us know and remember them anyway. So she photographed her doll-size "Teenettes" against sites blown up from bad slides: Las Vegas, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal and other cliche attractions. The 60-by-40-inch Cibachromes play up the nostalgia-knowledge foisted on us by reproductions. To make it more fantastical, the stiff little mannequins that stand agape at the backdrops take on the coloration of the slides. It's enough to deter you from world travel for quite some time (Glueck).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
MATTHEW BARNEY, JENNIFER PASTOR, CHARLES RAY, Barbara Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300 (through Dec. 22). Mr. Ray recreates to surprisingly elegant effect a 1971 work based on fundamental principles of sculptural abstraction. Ms. Pastor presents a towering representation of a monstrous wedding cake. Mr. Barney's elaborate assemblage with honeycomb-cocooned car seats encased in octagonal cabinets relates mystifyingly to his latest film, "Cremaster 2." The shift from Mr. Ray's early formalism to Mr. Barney's obscure symbolism speaks volumes about the evolution of art over the last three decades (Johnson).
 
 MEL BOCHNER, Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 (through Dec. 22). Mr. Bochner's new paintings give fresh immediacy to his enduring preoccupation with the tension between perceptual and conceptual experience. Contemplating a series of near-Minimalist red-and-white works with 12-inch dimensions graphically indicated, your mind oscillates between mathematical abstraction and the vibrant punch of color and shape. For some viewers, this may prove too dryly self-reflexive; for analytical philosophy buffs, it may be deeply absorbing (Johnson).
 
 MEL CHIN, Frederieke Taylor, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-0992 (through Dec. 23). The avant-garde environmentalist Mr. Chin presents a virtual reality video game called "Knowmad," produced in collaboration with a group called the Knowmad Confederacy. Viewers-as-players drive through a series of nomadic, desert tents with lush kaleidoscopic interiors based on traditional rug patterns. Whether or not one's geopolitical consciousness regarding Middle Eastern tribal society will be raised, as the artist hopes, the game is fun to play (Johnson).
 
 SPENCER FINCH, "Up," Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323 (through Dec. 23). This clever Conceptualist offers a variety of works inspired by the idea of looking or being "up," including pictures of a stain on his bedroom ceiling, a glowing watercolor representing the smell in an airplane at 35,000 feet, views of the Milky Way painted with Tang and a dazzling installation of suspended lights configured according to the molecular structure of blue pigment that matches the sky over Los Alamos (Johnson).
 
 BERNARD FRIZE, Cohan Leslie and Browne, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 206-8710 (through Dec. 23). In his first New York solo Mr. Frize, a French painter who has exhibited widely in Europe, presents resinous abstract paintings that suggest what Morris Louis might be doing today. Mr. Frize is oriented more to process than form, however; excepting one lovely striated veil painting, the interest is more in his inventively matter-of-fact ways with materials and procedures than his pictorial effects (Johnson).
 
 LIAM GILLICK, Casey Kaplan, 416 West 14th Street, (212) 645-7335, Chelsea, (through Dec. 23). This English sculptor and writer combines Minimalism and interior design to suave but dryly intellectual effect. Colored Plexiglas and aluminum "Platforms" suspended overhead, a large aluminum and white Plexiglas partition, an oak and aluminum floorpiece, soothing electronic music and a Sol LeWitt-like mural may prompt deep thoughts about modern, institutionalized society. But the modular decor is not so rich as to stand on its own as a compelling esthetic experience (Johnson).
 
 * "THE IMPERIAL GAZE," Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444 (through Dec. 30). The British photographer Samuel Bourne was in India for only seven years (1863-70), but he took thousands of pictures, established a lucrative business and became well known for his cityscapes and pictures of architectural monuments. The pictures that resulted are part of one of the richest bodies of photographic work to emerge from British India (Cotter).
 
 JILL LEVINE, Art Resources Transfer, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 691-5956 (through Dec. 31). All three of this gallery's project spaces are devoted to a survey of Ms. Levine's buoyantly quirky wall-sculpture. Since the late 1980's the artist has been assembling standardized plastic foam parts -- balls, rings, cones, cubes -- into funky configurations painted in various ways: Constructivist-style, intricate patterns or trompe l'oeil. Most recently, she has covered them with Hindu imagery, setting up a Pop-brokered marriage of East and West (Johnson).
 
 "MODERNISM DEFINED: JULIUS SHULMAN AND RICHARD NEUTRA," Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 343-1255 (through Jan. 6). Now 90, Mr. Shulman began photographing the buildings of the modernist architect Richard Neutra in 1936. His black-and-white images of clean, airy, minimally furnished houses from the 1940's and 50's are more than just lucid documents; each glowing miniature conveys a heavenly vision of modern serenity (Johnson).
 
 "PROCESS/REPROCESS: JAPAN AND THE WEST," Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450 (through Dec. 23). This disconnected but highly suggestive show mixes Western artists who have been influenced by Japanese traditions (like Richard Serra, James Lee Byars and Richard Tuttle) with Japanese artists who have been oriented to Western avant-gardisms (like Yayoi Kusama, Yoko Ono and Nikki S. Lee). What is most remarkable is how many different modes of artmaking are thus embraced, from Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism to Fluxus to the latest kinds of photographic and video performance (Johnson).
 
 LORDY RODRIGUEZ, "States," Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937 (through Dec. 23). Mr. Rodriguez's extraordinarily detailed, beautifully handmade ink-on-paper maps look normal from a distance, but up close you discover they are totally zany. Following a systematically reimagined United States geography, New York has been moved to Michigan; Connecticut occupies a western coast and is engulfed by Montana; the capital of Kansas is Miami. These plausibly rendered yet fantastic revisions of reality are oddly exhilarating (Johnson).
 
 * CINDY SHERMAN, Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, (through Jan. 6). With her latest untitled series Ms. Sherman is back in front of the camera lens again, disguised as women who, you might say, used to be somebody, maybe. They grin at the camera in clownish make-up, wobbly wigs and discount blouses, proud, valiantly oblivious to, or simply defiant of, our condescension, like the beauty pageant queen who drops her baton in the talent contest but keeps beaming. Formal devices by Ms. Sherman get overlooked because of the human element: the pattern of pigtails against plaid shirt; the purplish freckled face of a woman with purple shirt and purple cap. This formal order becomes a rational structure that gives to the work its mix of frigidity and heat, a perfectly ambiguous cocktail for an ambiguous moment and an antidote to the weary sophistication of which there is too much in art now (Kimmelman).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
KIM DINGLE, "Never in School," Sperone Westwater, 121 Greene Street, (212) 431-3685 (through Dec. 22). In dainty dresses and Mary Jane shoes, two small troublemakers, Fatty and Fudge, use classroom and playground for their subversive antics: fighting, taking off their clothes, writing dirty words on a blackboard and generally mess-making. What brings it all off is Ms. Dingle's chronicling of their cartoony doings in a satirical painting mode usually reserved for high-art subjects. Velazquez, meet Fatty and Fudge (Glueck).
 
 KEVIN LARMON, Curt Marcus, 578 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 226-3200 (through Jan. 6). Mr. Larmon, who has been exhibiting regularly in New York since 1984, updates the old Surrealist-Abstract Expressionist connection. Working toward the centers of raw plywood panels, he layers grisaille glazes over loose, swirling pencil lines, creating murky depths, serpentine biomorphic forms and tension between illusory dream space and the raw immediacy of paint and wood (Johnson).
 
 "A NEW YORK CIRCLE," Susan Teller, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-7335 (through Dec. 30). Selected by a veteran New York modernist painter, Fannie Hillsmith, this exhibition of works by friends and acquaintances evokes a mid-century period when the progressive art world was far smaller and more intimate than today and the common language was Cubism. Besides Ms. Hill smith's own robust Cubist still lifes, the show includes fine small works by such luminaries of American art as Louise Nevelson, Suzy Frelinghuysen, A. E. Gallatin, Alice Trumbull Mason and Charles Shaw (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
ANDREW FORGE, New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6466 (through Jan. 6). A Pointillist-derived system of colored dots has for years been the lyrical basis of painting by Andrew Forge, the English-born painter, critic and teacher. Worked on the canvas in dense but nuanced arrangements made from close observation of "places, seasons, times of day, conditions of light," the dots usually can't be read as specific imagery. But sometimes they hover on the edge of representation, evoking trees, a pond and other aspects of nature. To be savored rather than looked at hurriedly, they resonate in the mind (Glueck).
 
 * "HARD PRESSED: 600 YEARS OF PRINTS AND PROCESS," AXA Gallery, 787 Fifth Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 554-4818 (through Jan. 13). A thumbnail history of exploration in the field of fine art prints, from earliest woodcuts to digital technology, running from Durer to Kiki Smith, from Rembrandt to Robert Rauschenberg and beyond. Woodcuts, intaglio prints, drypoint etchings, lithography and newer techniques are carefully explained and illustrated, with notable early examples like Rembrandt's drypoint "Three Crosses" and more current events like Peter Halley's unlimited edition "Superdream Mutation" (1993), which existed only on a computer screen (Glueck).
 
Last Chance
 
CARL CHENG, "Nature Observed/Art Tool 2000," Sculpture Center, 167 East 69th Street, (212) 879-3500 (through tomorrow). The long-overdue New York debut of this California artist has as its centerpiece an extraterrestrial landscape made entirely of sand and spread out across the gallery floor. Its topographic features -- hills, canals and cryptic pictograph patterns -- were shaped by a computer-driven metal cylinder that resembles a player-piano roll but is as sensitive to the touch as a drafting pencil. Mr. Cheng has been inventing such "art tools" for more than 30 years, and he is definitely on to something worth knowing a lot more about (Cotter).
 
 DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111 (through tomorrow). The Damien Hirst Universe is a big, shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
 SUSANNE KUHN, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-3318 (through Thursday). Applying black ink to parchment-like pages, Ms. Kuhn, a German painter, makes haunting primordial wilderness scenes in an intricately linear cartoon style. Her images of towering pines, craggy cliffs, dismal swamps and radiant skies call to mind Caspar David Friedrich, while her graphic vocabulary evokes traditional Japanese landscape painting, Art Nouveau, German Expressionist woodcuts and contemporary comic books. Though satirically hyper-romantic, her pictures nevertheless exude a genuinely affecting spirituality (Johnson).
 
 HENRI MICHAUX, Zabriskie, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through tomorrow). This is a good complement to the Michaux exhibition at the Drawing Center through Wednesday. Here semi-abstract watercolors and gouaches by the French artist-writer, who died in 1984, display his quietly playful ways with luminous color, dreamy human and animal figuration and calligraphic mark-making. (Johnson).
 
 "PASTORAL POP!," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through today). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's "Grande Jatte," Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stone wall planter, Katrin Asbury's diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).
 
 * "UNTITLED PASSAGES BY HENRI MICHAUX," Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through Wednesday). The books of the Belgian-born French poet and writer Henri Michaux are not exactly unknown on these shores, but his considerable achievement as a visual artist -- a self-taught one -- has yet to gain a solid foothold. This show of more than 100 works on paper should change things. Spanning the late 1920's to the late 1970's, it includes examples of his finely textured "mescaline" drawings, his raucous inkscapes and his animated, often preening calligraphies. It reveals an artist profoundly influenced by Asian art who mined the fault line between language and sign, text and drawing, image and abstraction, manifesting the flow of human thought and energy in different, often hypnotic ways. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Smith).
 
 * SUE WILLIAMS, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1121 (through tomorrow). A decade ago Sue Williams was making rage-filled, clotted, sometimes outrageously funny works about the tribulations of women. Now she's painting like late de Kooning: confetti splashes of red, yellow and blue, calligraphic pirouettes, sweeping curves and minor skirmishes, mostly spare on big, bare white canvases. It is as if she were seeing how far she could push this sort of elegant abstraction before alienating her old audience, which, in terms of approach, is not so different from her button-pushing early work (Kimmelman).

EASTWARD TO TARTARY
Travels in the Balkans, the Middle East and the Caucasus
By Robert D. Kaplan
367 pages. Random House. $26.95.
President-elect George W. Bush could do a lot worse in preparing for the foreign affairs part of his job than to read "Eastward to Tartary" by Robert D. Kaplan, a scholarly and adventurous journalist who roams the less-traveled regions of the globe and writes about them knowledgeably and with sophistication. 
 Mr. Kaplan is the author, among other books, of "Balkan Ghosts," which achieved a certain notoriety when it was reported to have influenced the American decision not to intervene in the Balkans on the ground that savage ethnic violence there was inevitable and unstoppable. Mr. Kaplan replied that he had never intended that conclusion to be drawn.
He calls "Eastward to Tartary" a sequel to "Balkan Ghosts." Like that book, it is an effort to "anticipate the problems" that loom in an important region of the world, what he calls the Greater Middle East, where he traveled in 1998 and 1999. Mr. Kaplan took a trip from Hungary to Israel, via Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan; and another trip from Turkey to Turkmenistan, passing through the former Soviet republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
As always, Mr. Kaplan is intellectually bold and confident in his judgments. He is not the kind of writer to plunge by bus or train across desert and mountain and find himself perplexed by the human panorama he witnesses. He draws attention to longterm trends that other writers have little noted, like the growing power and influence of Turkey in the Middle East and Central Europe and the importance of the alliance between Israel and Turkey -- "a seismic shift," he calls it. This entire book is illuminated by an unillusioned intelligence and a steady sort of attention to deeper, longer-range trends rather than what might be called headline-news ephemera.
In at least one instance, this focus on the geostrategic reality risks ignoring another reality, that something can be of decisive importance simply because everybody thinks it is. Writing before the latest Palestinian uprising on the West Bank, Mr. Kaplan says that "the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks" is "predictable and therefore uninteresting." Still, Mr. Kaplan may be right in his longer-range vision of the Middle East, where the fate of ethnically divided countries like Syria, Iraq and Jordan may prove of more enduring significance than the fate of the Palestinian state.
"For decades I have heard that there would either be a Greater Israel or a Palestinian state," Mr. Kaplan writes near the end of the Israeli-Arab portion of his book. "It turns out that there will be both: a Palestinian ministate -- without control over its skies or main highways -- situated within a dynamic Israel that will continue to attract workers from across the border, making it the stabilizing force of historic Greater Syria, even as the current Syrian state weakens after decades of Soviet-style calcification."
Throughout, Mr. Kaplan talks to intellectuals, political leaders and people on the street; he makes observations on material conditions -- the degree of dilapidation, the stylishness of dress, the quantities of briefcases and cell phones. He stays keenly attuned to the parallels between present and past and to the influence of what might be called the deep culture, the patterns of belief and behavior that go back hundreds, or even thousands, of years.
The impression here and there is less that Mr. Kaplan makes discoveries and more that he confirms what he already knows from his previous trips, his wide reading and the bracing realpolitik philosophy that he carries along with him like volumes of law in his saddle bags.
Here is Mr. Kaplan ruminating about Stalin during a journey to Georgia, the dictator's birthplace: "To say that the Oriental influence was merely incidental to his character is to ignore its essentials. The monumental use of terror, the very grandeur of his personality cult, and the use of prison labor for gigantic public-works projects echo the ancient Assyrian and Mesopotamian tyrannies. The liturgical nature of Stalin's diatribes, which became the standard for official Communist discourse, bore the influence of the Eastern Orthodox Church, in one of whose Georgian seminaries Stalin studied as a youth."
This is a fascinating comment, and it relates to one of Mr. Kaplan's underlying themes: of civilizations dividing on either side of the Carpathian Mountains. On one side is the Enlightenment-Reformation West, with its stress on laws, institutions and the individual. On the other is the Ottoman-Byzantine East, prone to caliph-style despotism, to tribal ties and obedience to the chief. Mr. Kaplan invokes the importance of this scheme numerous times. He uses it, for example, to explain the reasons for Hungary's relative economic success and the stagnation of Romania and Bulgaria.
But Mr. Kaplan is never guilty of simplified thinking. He has his themes -- among them the Communist heritage of poverty, organized criminality and squalor; the slow, sad substitution of narrow nationalism for the multi-ethnic cosmopolitanism of the defunct empires -- but he also appreciates the role of the individual in history, the fact that, given the individual, nothing is inevitable. His portraits of relatively unknown leaders like Emil Constantinescu of Romania, Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria and Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan are shrewdly succinct, and he has a good eye for the telling detail: the look of the young men he notices hanging around with their elders at the office of a nationalist Bulgarian organization.
"It was a combustible mix," Mr. Kaplan remarks. "Bitter old men and impressionable young thugs, the mix from which Romanian fascism had emerged."
Near the end of his journey -- by bus and by trans-Caspian freighter to Turkmenistan -- Mr. Kaplan reaches Tartary itself, the historic Turkish regions of Asia. His stress is on the wild-west oil-producing areas that have been much in the news. "What Vietnam was to the 1960's and 1970's, what Lebanon and Afghanistan were to the 1980's, and what the Balkans were to the 1990's, the Caspian region might be to the first decade of the new century: an explosive region that draws in the Great Powers."
In other words, the recommendation to the next head of the greatest power of them all: read this book. If there is a better, more sophisticated and informed primer to the emerging powers and problems of the Greater Middle East, I don't know what it is.

Launching That Small Steel Missile, Hoping Not to Hit the Bar Stool

BYLINE: By PETER DeMARCO 

 BODY:
How I wasn't getting slaughtered in the first darts competition of my life, I still can't explain.
Maybe the beer I downed with my new teammates had steadied my nerves, as many players claim. Maybe those pointers that the champion chucker Roger Herbert had given me were paying off. Maybe I was just plain lucky. 
 Whatever the reason, the Magic Marker scoreboard propped against the bar wall showed I needed 34 points to win our game of "501," in which rival players start with 501 points apiece and subtract the numbers they hit on the board in a race to reach zero. My opponent, a quiet but slick-shooting 20-something named Anwar, needed a scant 14 points for victory. But it was my turn to shoot.
The wedges on a dart board are numbered from 1 to 20, but there are paper-clip-size strips of green and red that are worth a double or triple score, like Scrabble squares. Nikki, Austin, Pat and the rest of my teammates from Bar East, a team in the C division of the New York Dart Organization, huddled around and told me to hit the double 17 strip and "double off" to win the game.
Pinching the six-inch sliver of tungsten and steel between my fingertips, I stepped to the shooting line, about eight feet from the wall, and squinted to locate No. 17 on the board's perimeter, finding it where the 5 would be on a clock. The target looked very small and very far away, but my teammates were cheering for me, a good Sting song was playing on the jukebox, the bar was alive with chatter and, with a full tank of gas, I was on a roll.
I shot, and my dart whizzed through the air, miraculously landing on double-17 real estate, as if it had been scripted. My teammates went into a frenzy, offering me congratulatory fist taps and a victory beer. Needless to say, I was pumped, and could barely wait for my next game to begin. "It's a dart rush you've got," the team's captain, Megan Mitchell, a bartender, told me. She was right. In just one night, the game had completely seduced me.
A pleasing mix of strategy, skill, etiquette and, as mentioned, luck, darts is easy for a beginner to pick up, yet so difficult to master that the best of players usually go their whole lives without shooting a perfect game. It is eminently open and accessible, as there are men's, women's and mixed teams. It usually costs nothing to play, and it is extremely economical in terms of equipment and space requirements.
The game dates back to the 12th century, when the British began throwing foot-long spears at wooden targets like felled trees and beer kegs when they weren't in battle. Over the years a circular dart board emerged, and bird feathers were attached to the spears (and later, fancier darts) for better flying. The sport hit its stride around 1900, when paper fins or "flights" replaced feathers, and a Lancashire carpenter invented the numbering system, according to Patrick Chaplin, an Englishman with the rare distinction of being a dart history Ph.D. candidate.
British soldiers carried dart boards with them in World War II, helping spread the game to 45 countries, but England remained the mecca, with professional players there today earning upward of $300,000 a year. Some 4.5 million Americans play darts, according to one study, and there are leagues in every major city, including seven within New York's five boroughs and Westchester County. There are also regional tournaments with $10,000 prizes and a National Darts Hall of Fame in Martinsburg, W.Va.
Most players, though, seek enjoyment, not enshrinement. League nights are big social events, with plenty of food (one Bronx player I met raved for five minutes about the meatballs served at a Crotona Avenue pub) and camaraderie. "You make a lot of friends," said Nikki Lumpress, a Bar East player and a development assistant for New York Theater Workshop. "It's the best thing in the world outside college."
Unfortunately, my earlier forays into darts had been anything but enjoyable. Few friends played, and the handful of times I tried shooting, my darts flailed in the air, sometimes missing the board completely. Embarrassed, I stuck to shooting pool.
Those not-so-fond memories made me a bit anxious as I waited at Nathan Hale's, an after-work watering hole near City Hall, one Friday afternoon for my first darts lesson to begin. My teacher, Roger Herbert, an assistant vice president with Salomon Smith Barney Inc., is both president and singles champion of the New York Dart Organization, the city's biggest league with 1,000 players and 60 sponsoring bars. When he arrived, he reviewed the rules of "501" and "cricket," a game in which players vie to be the first to make three tallies on each number from 20 to 15, as well as the bull's-eye, plus finish ahead in total points.
We moved to the shooting line and, with rapid-fire instruction, Roger told me his secrets, advising me to align my shooting arm with the target and to let my forearm and wrist do all the work. The throwing motion should resemble a karate chop, he said, with my wrist and forearm pointing straight at the ceiling to start and straight at the board when finished. Finally, he said, aim slightly above the target, as gravity will drag down the dart.
As I shot away, he occasionally barked out commands like "Look board! Look board!" and "Zen! Be the dart!" and reminding me, above all, not to drink a beer with my shooting hand, as glass moisture can affect grip. Thirty minutes later, I hadn't noticed much improvement, but my guru was ebullient, predicting that with a few more hours of practice, my shot would begin to click.
Following his advice, a few days later I meandered down to the Dart Shoppe at 30 East 20th Street near Gramercy Park to buy my own set of darts. There were dozens of models in the window cases, so I asked the proprietor, Jim Birmingham, for advice. "There's no dart out there that will make you a better player," he said. "It doesn't matter if the dart costs $6 or $60. It's what you feel comfortable with." I told him my budget was $25, and he outfitted me with a set of three 24-gram darts, a fairly standard weight, for $22.50.
I then flipped through a book with hundreds of "flights," some with sports logos, some with half-naked women on them, and picked out a nifty blue-and-white checkerboard pattern.
The next week I stopped by my local bar, Tap-a-Keg on Broadway near 105th Street, for daily workouts, sometimes bringing my friend Nathan or my girlfriend, Kristi, along. At first, my shooting was miserable, with an upholstered bar stool absorbing the brunt of my misses. Eventually I settled into a comfortable stance, remembering to keep my throwing arm straight and to hold the dart gingerly with all five fingers. From there, it was a matter of refining my eye-hand coordination, and by the night of my league debut I was landing about a third of my shots -- not great, but a big improvement.
Through my travels I met some players from Bar East, and they invited me to join them on their league night. I arrived at Sam Beckets on First Avenue about 7:15 p.m., expecting to find my teammates engrossed in pregame drills. Instead, they were sitting around the bar, munching on Cheddar Goldfish crackers and playing computer poker. "Practice?" scoffed Austin Gurney, a plywood distributor. "There is no practice." Division C teams, unlike those in the higher A and B tiers of the league, are laid back, I was informed.
Dart teams typically have 6 to 10 players. On a league night, half a dozen members of each team play singles 501 games; then pairs of players from each squad play doubles cricket and doubles 501 games. All told, the two teams play 24 games in three to four hours. I was scheduled to play one game of singles 501 and two games of doubles cricket. As mentioned, I won my first game, recording 96 points in one three-dart round by hitting a double 20, a double 18 and a single 20. The score was so good it earned me a mention in the league newsletter.
My cricket partner was our team's other Austin, Austin Dooley, a former merchant mariner who took up darts because "on a ship, you can't play pool." And truth be told, he carried us. In quick order, he made three tallies on Nos. 20, 19, 18 and 17, thereby "closing them out," while I struggled just to close out the 15. My lone contribution was a round where I hit the 17 wedge with all three darts, earning us some valuable points.
Austin eventually nailed a bull's-eye for the win, and, following tradition, we shook hands with our opponents first, then with each other. Our second game, not quite as contested, also ended in a win for us. Bar East was leading in overall points, so Captain Megan bought drinks for everyone, and there were toasts to all, including a certain hot-shot rookie.
"Good darts," Megan said to me. "You're on the roster, buddy. We expect you here next week." That would be great, I replied. And with my nonshooting hand, I finished my drink.
 
Being the Dart
Dart boards can be found in hundreds of bars across the city, and rarely does it cost anything to play, though you may be obliged to buy a drink or two. There are seven leagues in the five boroughs and Westchester County, and most have both fall and spring seasons. For a listing of more than 100 Manhattan bars with boards, visit the New York Dart Organization Web site at www.nydo.com. The group is the largest of the leagues in the metropolitan area, with more than 1,000 players. Call (212) 374-9529.
The Gotham City Darts League, based in Brooklyn, has all-female teams as well as a summer season. Call (718) 258-4944; Web site:

HEADLINE: Favorable Lease Deals May Be Fading Fast

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
THE boom in leasing that propelled the auto market to sales records shows signs of fizzling out, as auto companies' finance subsidiaries and other lenders confront some discouraging financial facts.
Fast disappearing are the short-term discount leases that made cars affordable for many consumers who could not handle high monthly payments. Big banks and finance companies are backing out of the lease business, burned by lower-than-expected values for vehicles returned by customers when their leases are up. 
 Those projected values, called residuals, have often been set higher than the actual value of the cars and trucks returned when the leases end. High residuals are commonly used to make leases more affordable, since the monthly payment is typically calculated on the difference between the residual and the purchase price. The higher the residual, the lower the payments.
Artificially high residuals pose no risk to consumers, but they can be costly to financial institutions that write leases and that must sell vehicles, when they are returned, for less than they are valued on the books.
 "The market has fundamentally changed," said George Borst, chief executive of Toyota Financial Services. "The free ride on leasing has come to an end."
Leasing for personal use has dropped to 29 percent of the car market this year, from 32.5 percent last year, according to CNW Marketing Research of Bandon, Ore.
Collectively, lenders will lose an estimated $10.4 billion this year because they overestimated how much cars and trucks would be worth at the end of their lease terms. That figure could climb to $11.1 billion in 2001, CNW's president, Art Spinella, said.
In 1999, lenders lost money on 84 percent of the formerly leased cars when they were subsequently sold as used cars at auction or by dealers, according to the Consumer Bankers Association. The average loss was $1,920 a car, the association estimated.
Those losses are scaring off some big lessors, including two just this month. GE Capital Auto Financial Services stopped accepting lease applications as of Dec. 1. One of DaimlerChrysler's financing units, Debis, told dealers last week that it would no longer write leases and that they would instead have to go to the auto-finance divisions of Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler. First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank company, quit the lease business almost 18 months ago. Bank of America and the Bank One Corporation have also scaled back leasing.
David Littmann, chief economist at Comerica Bank, predicted that those banks' retreat, plus auto companies' growing skittishness, would make leasing less popular. He said he expected the leasing business, which has hovered around 30 percent of the market for five years, to drop as low as 18 percent next year.
Though leasing has long been available, its popularity is relatively new. Until the mid-1990's, only about 5 percent of consumers leased cars.
Everything changed in 1995, when a wave of sticker shock prompted Mercedes-Benz and the Ford Motor Company to offer attractive discount-leasing plans, hoping to persuade buyers to concentrate on low monthly payments instead of on high sticker prices. Consumers quickly took to the deals, and banks and other lenders jumped in.
"The customer demand was like a snowball," Mr. Spinella said. "People were coming in and saying, 'I want a lease and I don't want to pay more than $300 a month.' "
The deals helped automakers to sustain an unprecedented sales streak, culminating in last year's record of 17.3 million units. Leasing contributed to the rise of sport utilities; many consumers who could not afford loan payments on $30,000-plus trucks found they could handle monthly lease payments that were hundreds of dollars less.
But now, tools like inflated residuals, which sparked record sales in the late 1990's, have come back to bite the automakers. In trying to back away, companies are finding how addicted consumers have become to low-cost lease offers. In an effort to cut its expensive inducements, Chrysler halted lease deals on Jeep Grand Cherokees in May, and sales of that model collapsed.
"It was like the rug had been pulled out from under us," said John Vermillion of Wolfchase Chrysler-Jeep in Bartlett, Tenn. He estimates that 99 percent of his Grand Cherokee customers lease, not buy.
Mr. Vermillion said he had not had trouble arranging leases for customers since then. But he said Chrysler's approach had changed; instead of setting a high residual value for Grand Cherokees, the company is giving dealers an incentive of $2,750 per vehicle, which he is using to cut the price from an average of $35,000 to around $32,000. That reduces a customer's lease payment without inflating the residual value.
With banks pulling back, it will be harder for consumers to comparison-shop, since they have fewer choices to scout. The typical lease customer compares deals from four financial institutions before choosing a package, according to Consumer Reports, which explores the intricacies of leasing in its January issue. Car shoppers have also used the Internet to find lease deals they otherwise might not know about.
A spokesman for Ford Motor Credit, Dan Jarvis, contends that moves by banks to stop writing leases actually help customers, because auto company financing arms are better equipped to assist them. Banks, he contends, rely primarily on residual values set by the Automotive Lease Guide.
Ford takes that guide's numbers into account, but also collects data from its dealers, who play a big role in clearing out formerly leased vehicles from their lots and can give the company snap information on the prices that customers are willing to pay.
"We have the experience and the expertise when residuals become a question," Mr. Jarvis said. Ford Motor Credit finances roughly a million leases a year, about a quarter of Ford's American sales. Its leasing business is up slightly this year, according to CNW, and Mr. Jarvis said he did not expect the numbers to drop next year.
But leasing has declined significantly at other companies, particularly Toyota. Two years ago, 60 percent of Lexus luxury vehicles and 35 percent of Toyotas were leased. This year, that has dropped to 35 percent for Lexus and 22 percent for Toyota. Even so, Mr. Borst said there would always be deals available for the most desirable customers, especially in the luxury market.
And if demand becomes too sluggish, discount deals are likely to return in some form, most likely for short-term periods in regions where the offers are most needed to spur sales. Mr. Vermillion, the Tennessee dealer, said: "The bottom line is that the manufacturer still has to move the product. They're not going to say, 'Whoops, we aren't going to lease anymore.' "

HEADLINE: Gucci Posts Strong Growth, But Share Price Declines

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: MILAN, Italy, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The Gucci Group N.V., the luxury goods giant that has been on an aggressive acquisition spree, reported strong revenue and profit growth in the third quarter, largely thanks to the performance of its flagship Gucci division.
But investors, apparently troubled by cautions about a challenging period next year, reacted by pushing the share price down almost 6 percent. 
 Gucci said group operating income rose 92 percent, to $133 million, on a 101 percent increase in revenue, to $615 million. Gucci said fully diluted net income per share rose to $1.12, against 97 cents in the third quarter last year.
Gucci said it expected diluted earnings per share to rise next year to $3.40. That is more than the $2.10 it estimates for this year, but below the 1999 level of $3.48.
Gucci operates out of Italy but its shares trade on the Amsterdam exchange, where they dropped 5.6 percent to close at 98.80 euros today.
The caution in Gucci's forecast was attributed in part to the prospect of a slowdown in the United States economy, Gucci's biggest market. But it was also linked to continuing heavy costs related to the task of turning around Yves Saint Laurent, the fashion house that Gucci acquired last year as part of its acquisition drive.
Gucci, which has emerged in recent years as the No. 3 global luxury goods group, has been pushing to compete with the market leaders, LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France and Compagnie Financiere Richemont of Switzerland, which controls such brands as Cartier.
In talks with analysts today, Gucci executives attributed their cautious forecast for 2001 to the prospect of lower interest income on liquid assets, because of reduced United States interest rates; a $20 million one-time charge related to the purchase of a maker of branded Gucci clothing; and a projected $50 million loss at Yves Saint Laurent.
Gucci expects the pressure on earnings because of lower licensing royalties as it draws distribution from licensees to itself, and because of heavy spending to develop new products and refurbish and open exclusive Yves Saint Laurent boutiques.
But Domenico De Sole, Gucci's chief executive, said he expected "significant improvement" in Yves Saint Laurent's performance in 2002, as the stores run directly by the unit perform well.
Gucci's strong results came despite continuing legal battles with LVMH, a major shareholder. Last year, LVMH lost a battle for control of Gucci, after Gucci thwarted overtures by the LVMH owner Bernard Arnault and sold a controlling stake to the big French retail group controlled by the French investor Francois Pinault, a rival of Mr. Arnault. In recent months, Gucci and LVMH have been caught up in mutual recriminations and court suits.
In part at least Gucci's response appears to be a headhunting campaign in the ranks of Mr. Arnault's talent. On Tuesday, Gucci announced it had hired a senior LVMH executive, Thierry Andretta. Earlier this month, Gucci shocked the fashion world with the news that it had lured Alexander McQueen, the iconoclastic Scottish designer for Givenchy, an LVMH property, into Gucci's ranks. Today Gucci said it was hiring Giacomo Santucci, a senior executive at Prada, the Italian fashion house that is another LVMH ally.
Last year, Gucci also acquired Sergio Rossi, an exclusive Italian maker of women's shoes, and Boucheron, the jewelry and perfumes house that is a fixture of the Place Vendome in Paris. Thanks to the sale of shares to Mr. Pinault, Gucci has a war chest of about $2.5 billion, and Mr. De Sole made clear that he was continuing to hunt for acquisitions.
Today, Gucci said it had acquired an 85 percent controlling stake in the exclusive Swiss watchmaker Bedat & Company, whose timepieces can sell for up to $30,000. Bedat's founders, Simone and Christian Bedat, are expected to help run Gucci's luxury watch interests.

HEADLINE: Run to the Right, Not the Middle

BYLINE: By Gary Bauer; Gary Bauer, a domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan, is chairman of the Campaign for Working Families.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
Now that George W. Bush has just prevailed over Al Gore in a long, costly, vitriolic struggle over the presidency, he is getting plenty of advice. Pundits, political consultants and Republican advisers are telling the president-elect that he must go slow, run to the middle, avoid controversial issues and share power. As is often the case when there is a Washington consensus -- the advice is wrong.
Certainly, the new president should be agreeable whenever possible and try to rise above petty personality differences that poison Washington. But when it comes to the fundamental policy differences between the two parties -- those cannot, nor should not, be swept under the rug. 
 It is always political suicide to forsake your base and crush its hopes and dreams. Mr. Bush will need the continued loyalty and passionate support of millions of traditional conservative voters to weather the inevitable political firestorms of the next four years. And conventional wisdom nothwithstanding, he could never move left enough for the liberals to be satisfied.
By taking the advice to do little and accomplish it slowly, he would find himself leading no one, building nothing and disappointing his best friends. It is a path destined to end in four years.
Of course Mr. Bush will have to seek the support of Democrats in a closely divided Congress. But the coalitions he should seek are not in some mythical "center." Instead, Mr. Bush should move boldly ahead on a conservative governing vision -- the same one that he emphasized during the better moments of his campaign and that he touched on in his gracious acceptance speech on Wednesday night. On each initiative he will find significant numbers of Democrats willing to vote with him.
Even before taking office, Mr. Bush can send a strong message with his appointments. For example, he should name a pro-life attorney general who believes all our children should be protected by the law. Mr. Bush should also nominate Supreme Court justices who believe the same.
Once in office, Mr. Bush should immediately repeal a long list of executive orders President Clinton issued over eight years. These fiats have hurt economic growth, by overregulating small businesses, worsened our energy crises by stopping drilling for oil and natural gas, and promoted a radical social agenda including financing international family planning groups that provide abortions abroad. Will liberals object? Of course they will. But Jesse Jackson, Barney Frank and Ted Kennedy will never support him no matter what he does.
Next, Mr. Bush should send four bills to Capitol Hill: a tax cut that combines marginal rate tax relief with an easing of the marriage penalty and an increase in the child tax credit; an immediate ban on partial-birth abortions; an education reform bill with a strong voucher provision; a new budget that rebuilds the American military and speeds work on a missile defense system. These initiatives will rally the people who voted for him, and significant numbers of Democrats in Congress are likely to support them as well.
Finally, Mr. Bush can surprise his critics by proposing campaign finance reform. He should support a bill equally tough on the big union and big business soft money contributions that are corrupting our politics.
Liberal leaders and special interest groups will resist these actions, and pundits will criticize them. Yet sizable majorities of the American people will support Mr. Bush. More importantly, Mr. Bush will show the rest of the country that he is a man of his word and a man of action.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid to Producers Go Up Slightly as Business Inventories Rise

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Prices paid to producers in November showed the smallest gain in three months and business inventories rose in October, government figures showed today, indicating that companies have little latitude to raise prices.
The Producer Price Index rose 0.1 percent in November, reflecting declining computer costs and tame prices for automobiles, after rising 0.4 percent in October, the Labor Department said. Stockpiles of unsold goods rose 0.6 percent in October, according to the Commerce Department. 
 The report on producer prices suggests that inflation is becoming less of a threat to a record economic expansion that is about to enter its 11th year. The report on the index, a measure of prices received by producers for their goods, also raised investor hopes on Wall Street that Federal Reserve policy makers were closer to cutting interest rates.
The November increase in producer prices was the smallest since a decline of 0.4 percent in August. The core rate, which excludes energy and food, was unchanged after falling 0.1 percent a month earlier.
Through November, the overall index has increased at a 3.9 percent annual rate, compared with a 3 percent pace of increase in the corresponding 11 months last year. The core Producer Price Index has increased at a 1 percent annual rate, compared with a 0.8 percent pace in the period a year earlier.
The Fed's efforts to slow the economy and control inflation seem to be taking hold. A separate Labor Department report showed initial jobless claims declined 32,000, to a level of 320,000 for the week ended Dec. 9 from 352,000 the previous week.
The four-week moving average of claims, a less volatile indicator, fell to a level of 343,250 last week from 345,250, which was the highest in almost two and a half years.
"There's a clear weakening in the labor market; it's just not losing momentum very rapidly," said Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
The costs of goods, other than rising energy prices, have been tame.
Energy prices rose 0.4 percent in November after rising 1.4 percent in October as declines in the costs of residential power and heating oil partly offset an increase in natural gas and gasoline.
Still, consumers probably will not see relief on energy costs in coming months. The Labor Department will release its Consumer Price Index statistics on Friday. Analysts expect a 0.2 percent increase in November, the same as a month earlier.
Business inventories rose in October after rising 0.2 percent a month earlier, the Commerce Department report showed. The rise in inventories was attributed to a 0.2 percent fall in business sales.
Slower job growth, declining stock prices and higher costs for energy have eroded consumer willingness to spend. This pushed up the inventory-sales ratio -- a measure of how long it would take to clear out current inventories at the current sales pace -- to 1.35 months, the highest since May 1999.
Retailer inventories rose 0.9 percent in October, reflecting increased stockpiles at auto dealers, department stores and other businesses except for building materials outlets.

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: THE TECHNOLOGY;
2 University Presidents Will Try to Improve Voting

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 14

 BODY:
Like many other Americans, Dr. David Baltimore, the president of the California Institute of Technology, found the technological snarls involved in the presidential election a national embarrassment. Unlike most others, he was in a position to do something.
He called Dr. Charles M. Vest, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Technological problems must have technological solutions, they concurred. 
 Today, the two presidents of the two science-and-engineering universities announced that they were channeling some of the brainpower of their institutions into solving the riddle of how to improve the United States' voting system.
Their idea is not unique. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has said he will propose a bill allotting $10 million for the study of voting methods to the Federal Election Commission and an additional $250 million as matching funds to help states adopt improved systems.
But Dr. Baltimore said in a bicoastal news conference today that he concluded that "the institutions in America that best understand technology had a responsibility to help to repair the voting process so that we wouldn't see anything like this again."
"It's too late to do anything about this year," he said, "but this is a project to look out for the future."
The two universities said Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation, had agreed to recommend that the corporation's board finance the project's first phase with a grant of $250,000.
That phase, tentatively scheduled to last about six months, will be used to define the criteria of an acceptable system and evaluate the technologies in use, from paper ballots to optical scanners to Internet voting; the project will then either recommend existing systems or design a new one.
"The idea," Dr. Baltimore said, "is to produce a system that is foolproof, secure, simple to operate and affordable so that it can be in every precinct in America. The system should also give everyone a record of their vote, so they know exactly what they have done at the polls."
The project, which is in the planning stages, will bring together professors of political science, cognitive science, design, computer science and engineering.
Actually putting a uniform polling system into place will probably cost billions of dollars, said Thomas Palfrey, a Caltech political science and economics professor, but, he argued, that seems "a small price to pay for modernizing our democracy."
The two university presidents said they had not broached the idea yet to anyone in government; they received word only Wednesday that financing was probably on the way.
Though the project could theoretically conclude that paper ballots were the best system, it seemed likelier that it would favor more modern technology.
"We are at a technological point where the probability of finding a somewhat radical solution to this using recent advances in information technology is highly likely," Dr. Vest said.
It is also much more likely, he said, to be doable in a simple and cheap way than it would have been even five years ago.
Neither he nor others discussed specifics of a possible solution. But Prof. Nicholas Negroponte of the Media Laboratory at M.I.T. offered an example of an area for improvement. There should be a system of feedback when a person votes, Professor Negroponte said, much as a person pushing an elevator button gets the feedback of seeing it light up when pushed.
Those undertaking the project did not promise perfection.
"In engineering there is no such thing as 100 percent fail-safe," said Stephen D. Ansolabehere, a political science professor at M.I.T.
But they seemed compelled to try.
As Dr. Vest put it, "A nation that can send a man to the moon, that can put a reliable A.T.M. machine on every corner, has no excuse not to deploy a reliable, affordable, easy-to-use voting system."

HEADLINE: Nemuro Journal;
The Russians Have Come, and They're Welcome

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: NEMURO, Japan

 BODY:
With its rolling, barren bluffs and rocky coastline, and its migratory white whooper swans outnumbering people here each winter, this frigid crab-fishing town is about as deep into the backwater as one can get in this heavily urbanized and modernity-crazed country.
The modest grid of streets and unfussy manners of its residents give this small town the feel of Down East Maine -- 20 years ago that is. When a foreigner checked into one of the two hotels, a request for a room with an Internet-friendly phone drew a puzzled stare. Moments later came the discovery that cable television and CNN had not reached the northeastern tip of Japan either. 
 But if globalization's electronic forms have made scant inroads here, that has not stopped this town from showing Japan, a country whose self-image is of an island nation unto itself, that internationalization begins with both hearty and heartfelt neighborliness.
Street signs throughout this town are in Russian, residents study the language in high school and in adult night class, and Russians mill about in the shops downtown -- not just accepted, but eagerly welcomed, and increasingly served by Russian-speaking staff.
This is a far cry from many other places on Japan's northernmost island. In Otaru, for instance, a famous spa town, Russians and all other foreigners are officially unwelcome at local hot springs and watering holes. Of course, with Russian-held territory -- four islands vigorously claimed by Japan that were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II -- easily visible from here on a clear day the people of this town appreciate better than most that you cannot choose your neighbors.
But the fact that they went one step further and chose to embrace neighbors from a country long regarded with suspicion and hostility in Japan owes itself to a handful of townspeople, mostly business people, with a keen sense of enlightened self-interest. Many, in fact, point to Kinichiro Suzuki, the owner of a clock shop who, scratching his head for ways to boost his business about five years ago, decided to try to attract Russians.
"We wanted to expand our business, but when we looked at the situation of Nemuro, we realized that things were pretty stagnant," Mr. Suzuki said. "Everywhere else in Hokkaido was restricting the docking of Russian ships, but we decided to open up. There are no secrets to what we did; our policy was a customer is a customer, and we tried to provide them with good products at reasonable price."
The decision paid off with enough new customers to justify expanding his business to include a range of goods, from compact discs to eyeglasses. And the economic life of the town has been changed in much the same way, as the annual number of Russian visitors has far outstripped the town's population of 34,000. But convincing people at first seemed like a long shot.
"The reason those other towns are barring Russians from baths and snack bars is because Japanese don't like being around Russians," Mr. Suzuki said. "When we began targeting the Russians, we feared that our customers would feel the same way. But we found that the people of Nemuro don't harbor any revulsion for Russians. We want to have good relations with them. Who knows, one day it may even help us recover our lands."
Russians here readily attest to the fact that relations are exceptionally good in this town.
"I really like it here, and the people are very friendly," said Tatyana Vurkova, a young woman from Vladivostok who works in a downtown shop mostly assisting Russian customers. "The only problem is that it is really cold!"
Just outside the port, where Russian ships bring 40 tons of crab to market most days, hangs a large billboard that reads: "Return of the Four Islands Will Strengthen Friendship Between Nations. They are traditionally Japanese territory."
But along the frigid docks, a friendly if linguistically hobbled banter prevails between Japanese buyers and the Russian crews. After unloading their catch, many of these workers catch buses to town to shop for new and used refrigerators and ovens, bicycles and televisions, which they cart back to towns in Sakhalin and Kamchatka.
"There are some hard feelings among some people around town about the lost territory, and for some people, the idea of Russians shoplifting or getting drunk around town creates a bad impression," said Takashi Inoue, head of the Nemuro Fishermen's Association. "But for those of us in business with the Russians, things are great. They are really contributing to the economy, and plus, their behavior is not so strange after all."
At Nemuro High School, there are more signs of the growing links between this town and its northern neighbor. In addition to offering Russian to students, the language is taught to adults in heavily subscribed night classes.
"I was very surprised and impressed by the interest of the people here in our language," said Natalya Boyko, a Russian professor recruited from the University of Vladivostok to teach here for one year. "Moreover, the people are really fascinated with our culture and ways. I am constantly being invited by people to demonstrate Russian cuisine for them."
The school principal, Fuminori Sato, said: "In Nemuro we have a perception that foreigners are our neighbors. Unlike other Japanese people, we don't feel any strange feeling toward them. Instead, we want to build friendships with them, and are starting with their language."
Although they speak of the issue guardedly, given the years of frustrated diplomacy aimed at recovering the northern islands, many here say they hope this friendship will help ease the vexed questions of shared history between the countries, which have fought two bitter wars in the last century.
"The Russians have not yet said they are ready to return our islands, but they are learning to live with us," said Mr. Suzuki, the clock shop owner. "Together, we are building up a sort of mutual faith. The Russians who visit Japan will see our advanced facilities and our hospitality and come to respect. Regardless of race or ideology, respect is something people can learn to share."

HEADLINE: Putin Feels Whiff of Soviet Era in Cuba

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: HAVANA, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Russia and Cuba, two battered allies who fell out a decade ago when the Soviet Union fell apart, officially got back together today when President Vladimir V. Putin and President Fidel Castro pledged to reinvent the relationship based on a modest agenda of trade and commerce and an equally modest smattering of ideological alignment.
The Russian leader wore a business suit -- he is here mostly to talk business about the billions of dollars in Soviet-era investments in Cuba that have come to naught, and for which debts are owed. 
 And the Cuban leader, looking fit and animated at 74, wore the trademark olive fatigues of his revolution -- reflecting his own preoccupation with the evils of globalization, the poverty of many nations in a world of great wealth and the "repression" that Cuba continues to suffer under four decades of an American economic blockade.
Mr. Castro and Mr. Putin found some common language in complaining about the advent of a world dominated by the United States. Mr. Castro claimed seniority in the struggle by asking, "Who knows better than the country situated only 90 miles from the biggest superpower of the world?"
Mr. Putin, without mentioning the United States, agreed that such "unipolarity" allows one country to "monopolize international relationships and to dominate them." He said the last time this occurred, "we all know how it ended," apparently a reference to Nazi Germany and World War II.
Both leaders condemned the continuing American economic embargo of Cuba.
But Mr. Putin signaled in other ways that the world has changed and that Russia is not looking to return to the era of confrontation with the United States. As he arrived in Cuba late Wednesday, the Kremlin acted on his decree and released Edmond Pope, the American businessman convicted of espionage by a Moscow court a week ago and sentenced to 20 years in jail.
And in a telegram to President-elect George W. Bush, Mr. Putin sent good wishes for "success in this important and responsible post," adding, "I am counting on an intensive and constructive dialogue with you and your administration" with a goal of "further deepening of the productive and mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and the United States" and a "strengthening of international security and strategic stability."
Mr. Castro was less effusive. A government statement today said, "It seems that the empire finally has a new leader" and "from the new boss, we expect little."
Mr. Castro, seated next to Mr. Putin at a news conference, challenged Washington's "preoccupation" with increasing its military spending after the cold war and criticized Mr. Bush's support for erecting an antimissile shield over the United States.
In the Palace of the Revolution, the two leaders signed minor accords to cooperate in medical research, reopen a $50 million line of credit for Cuba and lay the groundwork for future trade, but they have yet to announce agreement on how Cuba might repay its estimated $20 billion in debts accumulated over three decades during which Moscow subsidized Cuban agriculture, industry and a significant military buildup.
Mr. Putin pointed out that even though the Russian and Cuban economies have contracted by a third or more in the past decade, the two countries still carry on nearly $1 billion in trade a year, mostly in barter by which Cuba receives Russian oil and sends much of its annual sugar output to Russia.
"This level of trade is not bad," Mr. Putin said. "But there are still some problems that have accumulated in the last 10 years, and they demand especially close attention. The Soviet Union has invested a lot in Cuba's economy. This is worth billions of dollars, and we have to understand what to do about this."
Russian officials traveling with Mr. Putin said Moscow is most concerned that if it does not re-establish strong trade ties with Cuba, Europe, Canada and eventually the United States will move in and capitalize on abandoned Soviet-era investments and equipment, which still form much of the island's industrial base.
These officials said Moscow had presented to Mr. Castro several proposals for swapping Cuba's debt for Russian stakes in potentially profitable Cuban enterprises in oil refining, nickel production and other sectors. But Cuban officials are looking for debt forgiveness as part of the bargain, pressing Cuba's standing grievance that aid was withdrawn by Moscow so abruptly that Cuba's economy suffered billions of dollars in damage and has yet to recover.
Mr. Castro indicated that Cuba, as a charter member of the World Trade Organization, which Russia would like to enter, has leverage that might be of use to Moscow, but he has yet to publicly specify his price.
Mr. Putin also brought along his defense minister, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, for discussions that appeared to be related to the degraded state of the Cuban armed forces since Soviet advisers were withdrawn and spare parts for Soviet equipment left in Cuba dried up.
Mr. Putin and Mr. Castro toured the secret intelligence base that Russia inherited at Lourdes, outside Havana, where a huge array of antennas allows Russian military technicians to monitor civilian and military communications in the United States and Latin America. Russia still pays rent for the facility with oil shipments, Western officials say.
Western journalists covering Mr. Putin's visit were barred from the tour.
Also unresolved at this stage of Mr. Putin's visit is whether the two countries can find the financing that would allow Russia to complete a large nuclear power station near Cienfuegos. The electricity plant, with most of its foundations complete and about 40 percent of its reactor and generating equipment delivered, requires an estimated $600 million in additional investment.
Neither Russia nor Cuba is able to finance the completion, and efforts over the past decade to find financing elsewhere have failed. The plant's design is not the Chernobyl-style graphite-core reactor that is of greatest concern to Western governments, but is based on pressurized-water reactors within a containment building. Still, the plant's location -- 180 miles southwest of Key West, Fla. -- has prompted American officials to express concern about Cuba's ability to operate it safely should it be completed.
For ordinary Cubans, Mr. Putin's visit carries much less excitement than that of the last leader from Moscow, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who came here in 1989 at the peak of perestroika and glasnost. Those Soviet reforms emboldened a generation of Cuban dissidents to challenge Mr. Castro's authoritarian lock on the country.
"Cuban intellectuals used to read with great interest the materials that would come from Russia about reform," said Elizardo Sanchez, a leading dissident. "But in the last four to five years, we have not received much material from Russia, and there is no clear picture here of who Putin is, except that people realize that he comes from the K.G.B. and that he is governing a different country" than the Soviet one.
"For this reason, we don't expect a great deal from this visit," Mr. Sanchez said, noting that Russia and Cuba today harmonize their opposition to human rights programs at the United Nations.
"On the contrary," he added, "we expect the alliance between these two countries to reinforce each other's positions on human rights."

HEADLINE: A Hero of the Celtic Renaissance

BYLINE: By Thomas Lynch; Thomas Lynch is author of "Bodies in Motion and at Rest."

DATELINE: MILFORD, Mich.

 BODY:
From the cottage I keep in West Clare, I sometimes look across the Shannon Estuary to the Kerry Hills. From the end of the peninsula, I can make out Ballybunion, where Bill Clinton golfed in September 1998, in the midst of the Monica Lewinsky imbroglio. Back in Washington, Senator Joseph Lieberman was calling Mr. Clinton's behavior "immoral," which, of course, it was. But in Ireland a beauty parlor named Monica's on the road to the famous golf course had its sign removed lest it embarrass the motorcadians. The Irish know what's in a name. They also know that words can hurt or heal old wounds.
Is it Derry, then? Or Londonderry? Is it the North of Ireland or Northern Ireland? Is it Sean or Sidney? Mabel or Maeve? Are the violently conflicting views of the Six Counties of the North rooted in race or sect, language or doctrine, poverty or pride or power lust? "Whatever you say," wrote Seamus Heaney famously of the painful case of Ulster, "say nothing." 
 Whatever history says of William Jefferson Clinton, let it say he did the right and difficult thing by Ireland.
A writerly friend from one of the border townlands once told me that when asked he always claimed to be an atheist. "Of course, here the question always is, 'Are ye a Catholic or a Protestant atheist?' "
But the question of Protestant or Catholic is giving way to new ones: Visa or MasterCard? Cash or charge? Expanding markets and lines of credit breed good will toward men in ways that God on Our Side or the Others' never did. And Ireland's lively new economy -- the Celtic Tiger purring in the Republic -- trumps the old begrudgers and hateful rhetoric.
In Belfast this month, the shoppers come and go without opening their bags or standing for the old inspections. The worry over bombs has given way to the welcome extended to coin of the realm. Dublin is bulging at its seams with cars, computer wares, trendy bars and multinationals. It is one of the dividends of even a fragile peace: the marketplaces thrive. And though there are growing pains, more, it turns out, is merrier than less. If Mr. Clinton did not invent this truth, he had the courage nonetheless to come and preach it in these contentious parishes.
Equal access to a promising future, investments in jobs and education, forsaking of the old tribal alliances and wars in pursuit of peace and creature comforts -- these things took root in this ancient, rocky place. In the three decades of the Troubles, Bill Clinton was the first, the only American president to take the Irish predicament to heart. Campaigning in New York in April 1992, he promised to do something about it, and then he did. From the granting of a visa to Gerry Adams in 1994 to the appointment of George Mitchell as a peace envoy disguised as an economic adviser -- all done against the odds -- Mr. Clinton has deftly handled the dicey relations between London and Belfast and Dublin and Washington. By bringing the weight of his office and intellect and charm to bear on both sides of the divide, he has opened the dialogue of cooperation, if not conciliation.
And in Ireland they know it. They have forgiven him everything -- every moral failing, every political duplicity, every personal foible -- in trade, in thanks, for the moral high ground he helped to clear, where no side wins but none is vanquished. For the first time in 200 years, the young of this country may go or stay as they please, and people are trying to get into Ireland for its opportunities. For the first time the Irish have to contend with the perils of too much rather than too little.
Little wonder, then, that our president finds, in the ever shortening days of his watch, the comfort and commiseration of home fires among people who, like himself, are known for their enigmas -- their excesses and abuses, suffering and kindnesses, their gifts of gab and blatherments, their poets and politicos, their shame and guilt, their hunger for forgiveness and for the deeper gifts of history: peace on earth, good will toward men -- even if they are their own worst enemies.

HEADLINE: What Mr. Bush Can Do

 BODY:
One of the more poignant moments in Vice President Al Gore's memorable concession speech was his expression of regret that he would not be able to stay and fight for people "who need burdens lifted and barriers removed." Mr. Gore's dedication to social justice and his commitment on issues such as health care were the noblest part of his campaign. We were struck therefore by the intersecting sentiments in President-elect George W. Bush's speech. He spoke of improving health care and retirement security and a determination to "address some of society's deepest problems one person at a time." Republicans and Democrats can use the same words to mean different things, of course. But in using the word "bipartisan" three times and "together" 12 times, Mr. Bush seemed determined to reintroduce himself as someone who would come up with social and economic policies that draw support from both sides of the Capitol.
Mr. Bush also spoke of his record of reaching across the aisle in Texas. We concede that Washington does not play by the rules of Austin, where Democrats are often as conservative as Republicans. To make deals with the Democratic leadership in Washington, the president-elect is going to have to bridge some ideological gaps. But this seems to us a time to take Mr. Bush at his harmonious word. With such an approach, it is not hard to sketch out some areas where a shrewdly negotiating chief executive could put together a bipartisan legislative agenda. 
 Education. Even in the currently bitter environment, renewal of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act could easily become the focus for developing a consensus over more money for the nation's schools and clearer standards for achievement. Mr. Bush's idea of cutting off federal aid to non-performing states and using the money for vouchers is not likely to fly, even among Republicans. But there could be progress on tougher standards and in some cases more choice within the context of the public school system.
Health. There is also a consensus in Congress in favor of a patients' bill of rights. Mr. Bush has cited a law in Texas containing a partial right to sue as a model for what he would propose as president. An early agreement could easily be obtained if the spirit is right. On the much tougher issue of enacting a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, the problem is that many Republicans and Democrats are leery of enacting an additional benefit without some sort of overhaul introducing more competition among health care providers. During the campaign, however, Mr. Bush repeatedly praised Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, a Democrat, for his ideas on Medicare. If Mr. Bush does not choose Senator Breaux for his cabinet, he would do well to ask his help in forging a new consensus to introduce more choice and competition in the Medicare system, without eroding care for the elderly poor.
Campaign Finance and Electoral Reform. Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold have told Trent Lott, the majority leader, that they will attach their campaign reform bill to the first legislative vehicle that comes along in the new session. Whether he likes it or not, Mr. Bush is going to have to deal with that fact quickly. He says he opposes the McCain-Feingold bill, but support for it has grown to outsized majorities in the House and Senate. There is the possibility of progress in the fact that the president-elect has also said he would support a ban on unlimited soft-money donations by unions and corporations, though not individuals. Mr. Bush may find himself able to negotiate a new bill on this all-important issue, and along with ballot reforms growing out of the Florida vote-counting debacle, a victory in this area could put an early and welcome stamp of reform on his administration.
Taxes. It is always hard for any candidate to abandon a centerpiece of his campaign, but in truth there is not that much support even among Republicans for the sweeping $1.3 trillion tax cut Mr. Bush proposed. The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, a Republican, wants something more limited. By negotiating with both parties, Mr. Bush could easily craft a limited and progressive tax bill to ease the estate tax and the so-called marriage penalty tax while reducing rates for taxpayers at the lower end of the scale. The president-elect is said to be looking at a number of Wall Street executives for his Treasury secretary. He will find that Wall Street is the place where opposition is strongest to a gigantic tax cut that would risk deficits down the road.
In coming days we will see Mr. Bush's receptivity to such moves in the cabinet and sub-cabinet choices he makes. There are many who are skeptical of the president-elect's words embracing bipartisanship. They have a right to be skeptical. But the better tactic would be to meet Mr. Bush in the middle where this can be done without violating core principles. Out of such gestures, words can be translated into legislative reality, and a presidency that starts out under a cloud of doubt can transform itself into a success at the vital center of politics, where most Americans would want it to be.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Microsoft Cuts Its Projections For 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Echoing recent warnings from the computer makers that are its most prominent customers, Microsoft said yesterday that earnings and revenue in the current quarter would be lower than previously projected because of weakening economic conditions.
Microsoft attributed its reassessment to a slowdown in personal computer sales, a slight softening in corporate purchases of information technology and weaker-than-expected growth in demand for online advertising and its Internet service, MSN. 
"We are seeing slowing global economic conditions, particularly in the U.S.," John Connors, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. He noted that the slowdown in the United States was coming on top of an already gloomy outlook in Europe, where business has been dragging since the spring.
Microsoft's new projections for the quarter ending Dec. 31, are for earnings per share of 46 cents or 47 cents, 2 or 3 cents below most analysts' estimates, and revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.5 billion, a reduction of 5 to 6 percent from the guidance it provided in October. At that time, Mr. Connors was exulting over Microsoft's return to double-digit growth in the previous quarter and projecting revenue growth in the "low to mid-teens" for the rest of the fiscal year ending next June 30.
With yesterday's projections, Microsoft expects growth to slow to about 6 percent in the current quarter, compared with a year earlier. Mr. Connors also said the company expected revenue for the fiscal year of $25.2 billion to $25.4 billion, a gain of 10 percent at best from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share should be in the range of $1.80 to $1.82, up from $1.70 last year but down from a previous consensus of $1.91.
Coming after downward revisions from other computer industry stalwarts like Intel, Dell and Compaq, Microsoft's warning was no surprise. Indeed, many analysts had been telling clients to expect it. Still, because Microsoft's Windows operating system is delivered with 90 percent of all personal computers and the company's software is so widely used by consumers and businesses, the downgrading of expectations was hard for investors to shrug off.
Shares of Microsoft, which had ended the trading day before the announcement at $55.50, down $1.75, fell as low as $51.75 in after-hours trading. And some other computer stocks like Intel and Dell fell as well.
Mr. Connors said that the timing of Microsoft's announcement reflected its position toward the end of the computer supply chain. The market softness noticed by chip makers like Intel and hardware vendors did not become clear-cut at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., until several weeks after computer manufacturers had been shipping fewer units, Mr. Connors said.
Microsoft said that the softness in business sales had been largely in desktop software programs that go with desktop computers, like its Windows Office suite. He said that Microsoft had not experienced businesses' cutting back on purchases of computers with its NT operating system, which act as servers for a wide variety of business activities.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Price Protection Move
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Paul Allen , a billionaire who was a co-founder of Microsoft, sought price protection last month for almost half of his remaining stake in Microsoft, entering into securities agreements known as collars for $3.5 billion worth of stock in the company.
 The collars, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, essentially lock in prices for 66.8 million Microsoft shares owned by Mr. Allen.
In return, he will surrender some gains if Microsoft shares double or in some cases triple during the next several years.
Mr. Allen's moves preceded by more than five weeks yesterday's Microsoft announcement that revenue and earnings would not meet the company's earlier estimates. Microsoft shares have lost about a quarter of their value since Nov. 8, when Mr. Allen arranged the last of the collars.
"Smart guy," said Martin Averbuch, chief executive of Adirondack Trading Partners L.L.C. in Centerport, N.Y. Mr. Averbuch helped found the International Securities Exchange, which developed the first electronic auction market for listed equity options in the United States.

HEADLINE: Workers Bid Ill-Fated Chernobyl a Bitter Farewell

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: PRIPYAT, Ukraine, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Fourteen years and seven months after an experiment here went unimaginably awry, spewing the radiation of dozens of Hiroshimas across Europe, workers at the Chernobyl nuclear complex gathered today to bid the site's last working nuclear reactor -- and many of their jobs -- a bitter goodbye.
Standing outdoors before a jet-black statue of Prometheus, the Greek of myth who stole fire from the gods, they watched President Leonid Kuchma lay a wreath in memory of the dead and dying of the world's worst nuclear power disaster and then assure them that they would not be forgotten, either. 
 "I want you to know from me and the government that nobody will be ignored," Mr. Kuchma told workers in a brief speech.
Many of them are nevertheless disbelieving.
"We're hearing a lot of promises, but they're not backed up by finances," said Yevgeny Lobtsov, 43, an electrician who began working at Chernobyl two months after the accident. "I don't know what will be done for my children now."
On Friday, Mr. Kuchma will send an order from his presidential palace in Kiev to shut Unit 3, the lone remaining working part of the Chernobyl complex.
That reactor is separated by only a wall from Unit 4, which exploded in a ball of flame and dust on April 26, 1986.
Thirty-one workers died in the immediate aftermath of the blast. Thousands of Ukrainians have since died or contracted thyroid cancer or leukemia directly associated with the spread of radioactivity after the explosion.
The shutdown order for Friday arrives after a decade of intense pressure by Western nations, led by the United States, that fear that the ancient Soviet-design reactor at Unit 3 is another Chernobyl disaster in waiting.
But to Ukrainians, the principal effect of the command will be to begin a process already destined to lead within two years to the layoff of 2,200 of the plant's 5,600 operators and 3,000 support workers.
Many additional workers are widely expected to be gone by 2008, when the last of the reactor's fuel is to be unloaded and what once was the world's mightiest atomic power station will officially become its biggest and most infamous nuclear graveyard.
Ukrainians are no less horrified by the disaster than others. But they have a huge economic dependence on the complex -- and no small fear that closing the last reactor will remove their best lever to pry loose international aid vital to maintaining the site.
The closing of Unit 3 will cut off 5 percent of the electricity supply in a nation already deeply in hock to Russia for natural gas and dogged by shortages in its shoddily run power grid.
The closing will also gradually eliminate the jobs of thousands of Ukrainians whose work depends, directly or indirectly, on Chernobyl's continued operation as a power plant. Beyond the layoffs at the plant itself, thousands of Ukrainians provide goods or services to Chernobyl workers.
Ukraine also faces immense costs in the future -- $750 million to cover the disaster site with a new dome-shaped sarcophagus, hundreds of additional millions of dollars to remove 180 tons of lethal melted fuel and steel from the damaged core of Unit 4 and to store it safely, millions to build a new heating system and other necessities for the crews that will permanently care for the idle reactor site and millions for solid and liquid waste-processing plants to handle the fuel from the closing of Unit 3.
The wealthiest industrial nations have pledged much of the money needed to build the new dome and help construct other projects. But they have been reluctant to commit more money, given Ukraine's history of pervasive corruption and mismanagement since the Soviet collapse.
One key to assuring the shutdown fell into place this month, when Ukraine obtained a $215 million international loan to complete the construction of two long-idled reactor sites that will make up for the loss of Unit 3.
Mr. Kuchma sought to today to put a good face on the shutdown, traveling to the reactor to honor the dead workers and the Ukrainians sickened by radiation.
Later, he spoke to workers in Slavutich, a trim city of 30,000 built in the late 1980's for Chernobyl workers who lost their houses in the disaster.
In both places, he encountered signs of resistance. Some workers at Chernobyl signaled their opposition to the shutdown by wearing black ribbons on their jumpsuits. In Slavutich, knots of workers unfurled banners that called the shutdown a tragedy and declared, "No!" to the closing.
Slavutich residents have been rewarded for their Chernobyl labors with far higher pay and more amenities than most Ukrainians, from more modern apartments to free cable television. The town's future is cast into doubt by closing the plant.
In the dreams of Soviet planners, Chernobyl was to have been a mammoth array of eight reactors, a wellspring of cheap power for Ukraine and neighboring Belarus. The disaster changed that.
Today, the unfinished hulk of a fifth reactor -- the last attempted -- sits a few hundred yards from the explosion site. The two other undamaged reactors, Units 1 and 2, were closed years ago.
Officials have declared everything within 18 miles of the reactor an irradiated no man's land of decaying ghost towns and burial pits for thousands of bulldozers and trucks used in the cleanup and now too radioactive to touch.
An extensive decontamination effort has rendered the reactor complex itself comparatively secure for workers and visitors, officials insist.
"It's safe where we are," Sergei Saversky, deputy chief of the agency that manages the no man's land, said today. "Just don't walk where you're not supposed to."
In the ghost city of Pripyat about a mile from the disaster site, a city of 50,000 that the publicity-wary Soviets did not evacuate until 36 hours after the explosion, that means staying on streets blacktopped after the disaster and avoiding the grass. Most safe areas have been paved over or bulldozed, removing the top 40 inches of radioactive soil.
In a Pripyat scene straight from the apocalyptic novel "On the Beach," blocks of deserted apartment houses faced gardens grown wild and sidewalks cracked by sprouting weeds. Journalists who sought to visit a surreally silent amusement park, its yellow Ferris wheel parked dead still a few hundred yards away, were told that it was too dangerous.
Although Geiger counter readings that flash around the reactor complex suggest that all is well -- the radiation exposure for visitors today was said to equal that of a two-hour airplane ride -- outside experts are skeptical.
In particular, they say the hulking steel-and-concrete sarcophagus erected over the blown-apart Unit 4 -- 10,000 tons of material thrown together by remote-control cranes and helicopters -- may be rusting inside and is increasingly vulnerable to collapse.
Hazards continue to pop up. Last month, a sweep detected a red-hot chunk of melted reactor core eight inches long atop the steel roof of the sarcophagus. How it arrived outside the reactor is unclear. Experts said they suspected that it was somehow spewed upward through the 250-foot smokestack in the initial explosion and went undetected until it fell from atop the stack a few weeks ago.
Workers are studying how to remove the lethal piece of metal.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. and FedEx Cut Their Forecasts on Profits

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 14

 BODY:
United Parcel Service and the FedEx Corporation both said today that they had cut their profit forecasts because of softness in consumers' holiday spending and a reduction in shipment volume.
"Both FedEx and U.P.S. appear to have hit a wall in December," said Gregory Burns, an analyst at Lazard Freres & Company. "We expected some moderation for both, but it appears the holiday season is really flat right now." 
 United Parcel said shipments in the first two weeks of the holiday season were unchanged from the corresponding period in 1999 and warned that fourth-quarter profits would be only 7 percent to 10 percent higher than last year's 56 cents a share. The average forecast in a First Call/Thomson Financial survey of analysts was for 14 percent growth, to 64 cents a share.
FedEx said it expected growth rates for its FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services in the United States this month to be unchanged to slightly lower than last year. Earnings for its fiscal year, which will end in May, are now expected to be $2.50 to $2.60 a share, the company said; analysts had forecast $2.68. FedEx mentioned severe weather as well as a slowing economy for the deterioration in its results.
Most of the companies' shipments are between businesses. U.P.S. said its volume of such shipments began slowing in October and November, followed by stagnant shipments at the start of the holiday season.
On the retail side, a general decline in retail sales in November, based on seasonally adjusted figures, and a tempering of the previously meteoric growth in retail spending done over the Internet have reduced shipment volume.
U.P.S. delivers more than half the goods bought online. And a decline in personal computer sales to consumers and small businesses is hurting both U.P.S. and FedEx.
"Many of our customers are technology customers," said William Margaritis, a FedEx spokesman. "They are experiencing the same sort of effect the general economy is. They're part of this slowing growth."
Shipping companies often feel the effect of an economic slowdown a bit later than other industries, because their customers typically begin making smaller and more frequent shipments to avoid accumulating inventory when business is cooling.

More Bad Earnings News Pulls Stock Prices Lower
Stocks slumped on more bad earnings news, including disappointments from Chase Manhattan, J. P. Morgan, United Parcel Service and FedEx. The earnings picture became more muddled after the market closed when Microsoft said that it would post lower-than-expected earnings, which could dampen stocks today. But Oracle, a rival software maker, posted results that beat analysts' forecasts.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 119.45 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,674.99. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 94.26 points, or 3.3 percent, to 2,728.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 19.06 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,340.93. Page C9. 

Hastert to Seek Narrower Tax Cuts
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said that he did not favor President-elect George W. Bush's $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut, a centerpiece of his campaign, but would instead push for the House to act on tax cuts aimed more narrowly at married couples and heirs. A1.
 
DuPont to Shed Its Drug Business
DuPont said that it would separate its prescription drug business from the rest of its operations with the hope of selling it, swapping it for another company's business or spinning it off.

HEADLINE: Clinton, Winding Up Trip, Tells Developed Nations Not to Forget the World's Poor

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: COVENTRY, England, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Laying out some of the challenges that will face the world after he leaves office, President Clinton today wound up what may be his final overseas trip as president with a plea to developed countries not to forget the poor in this era of high technology and globalization.
"No generation has ever had the opportunity that all of us now have to build a global economy that leaves no one behind and, in the process, to create a new century of peace and prosperity in a world that is more constructively and truly independent," Mr. Clinton told several hundred people at the University of Warwick. The university has a special institute that specializes in global issues. 
 "It is a wonderful opportunity," Mr. Clinton said of the spread of trade, communications and computer technology throughout the globe. "It is also a profound responsibility."
Mr. Clinton, who was to fly back to Washington late tonight, spent the morning in London, where he and Hillary Rodham Clinton had tea, coffee and cookies for about 20 minutes with Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.
Mr. Clinton, who has met the royal family before, joked to the queen that after he leaves office he wants a golf rematch with her second son, Prince Andrew, who trounced him when the two last hit the links.
Presidential aides are still mulling whether Mr. Clinton ought to make a trip to North Korea, but that visit grows more unlikely by the day as his term runs out. So this may have been the final trip beyond the United States borders by a president who has traveled more than any other. It was Mr. Clinton's seventh trip to Britain, where he has established a close bond with Prime Minister Tony Blair.
"Bill Clinton has been a true leader of the Western world," Mr. Blair said in introducing the president, not long after he telephoned congratulations to the next one, President-elect George W. Bush. The prime minister noted that Mr. Clinton had been "a friend and confidant to me and leaders around the world.
In his foreign policy speech today, Mr. Clinton urged wealthy countries to consider forgiving the debts of nations in the developing world and to ensure that the "digital divide" is reduced between countries connected to computers and those left behind in the computer age.
"It's fair to ask, I suppose, are computers really an answer for people who are starving or can't yet read?" Mr. Clinton asked. "Is e-commerce an answer for villages that don't even have electricity? Of course, I wouldn't say that.
"We have to begin with the basics. But there should not be a choice between Pentium and penicillin."
The president, who often touts rosy statistics showing prosperity spreading throughout the world, focused today on the many problems that will outlast his presidency. He said half the world's people are struggling to survive on less than $2 a day, that nearly one billion live in chronic hunger, that half the children in the poorest countries are not in school and almost a billion adults have never learned to read.
Mr. Clinton has made globalization a foreign policy mantra, pursuing a free-trade agenda resisted by many. That resistance, he said, does not point out flaws in globalization itself but in a thoughtless approach to breaking down barriers among nations.
"The great question before us is not whether globalization will proceed, but how," the president said. "And what is our responsibility in the developed world to try to shape this process so that it lifts people in all nations."
Mr. Clinton largely steered clear of many high-profile issues the world will face in the years to come: the spread of terrorism, the effects of a missile shield, the role of peacekeepers stationed throughout the globe. Today, he focused on matters that often fall below the radar screens of foreign ministries, like the dangers of climate change, the national security threat that AIDS presents, and the importance that education and school lunches can play in stabilizing a country.
White House aides said that the president's speech was aimed at leaders the world over, not at Mr. Clinton's successor, who comes to the job with modest credentials in foreign affairs.
"President Clinton made the transition from governor to world leader, and it will be up to President-elect Bush to make that same transition," said P. J. Crowley, the president's national security spokesman. "He will, because the president of the United States has a unique mantle as a world leader. I don't think anyone will question that the United States will stay engaged. The question is how do you handle the challenges we all face?"

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: TEXAS POLITICS;
Texas's Bipartisanship May Differ From Capital's

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 14

 BODY:
If President-elect George W. Bush's central message on Wednesday night was to promote healing and conciliation, the tonic he offered was bipartisanship, Texas-style.
"Here, in a place where Democrats have the majority," Mr. Bush said from the podium of the Texas House of Representatives, "Republicans and Democrats have worked together to do what is right for the people we represent." 
 The bipartisanship that Mr. Bush put on display Wednesday night when he chose the state's most powerful Democrat, Speaker Pete Laney, is indeed genuine in the Texas Legislature. Mr. Bush enjoyed good relations with many Democratic legislators, some of whom even campaigned for him across the country. In part, he succeeded because his political style, built in part upon schmoozing and personal contact, played well in the backslapping culture of the Capitol.
But academics and even many lawmakers agree that bipartisanship is something of a misnomer in Texas if it is meant to suggest compromise and cooperation between two warring parties. The tenor of the Texas Capitol hardly resembles the divisiveness in Congress, where gridlock over issues like gun control and taxes exposes deep rifts between the parties.
In fact, many Republicans and Democrats in the Texas Legislature are fairly similar in ideology and are bound by a shared conservatism centering on limited government and low taxes. Many of the policies that Vice President Al Gore cited in criticizing Mr. Bush's record in Texas were approved with the help of Democratic lawmakers.
"A liberal agenda in Texas would be a mainstream agenda anywhere else," said Samantha Smoot, executive director of Texas Freedom Network, a group that monitors the religious right and that is one of the liberal organizations often frustrated with the status quo here.
Given Mr. Bush's narrow and protracted victory, and the nearly even political split in Congress, the president-elect has been urged to select some prominent Democrats for his administration to help forge a bipartisan spirit. Representative Charles W. Stenholm, a conservative Texas Democrat, has been mentioned as a possible secretary of agriculture. Mr. Bush also has other potential Democratic allies in Congress. Representative Ralph M. Hall, a conservative Democrat from East Texas, formally endorsed Mr. Bush in the campaign. And the governor called Representative Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi, after Mr. Taylor said he would vote for Mr. Bush if the fate of the presidential race ended up in Congress.
In Texas, that sort of cross-pollination is common. A leading apostle was the late Bob Bullock, the former Democratic lieutenant governor who became Mr. Bush's political mentor and who helped smooth Mr. Bush's friendship with many Democrats.
Mr. Laney has appointed Republicans as chairmen of several House committees, while Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Democrat-turned-Republican who serves as presiding officer of the State Senate, has appointed Democrats to leadership positions there.
"He didn't invent bipartisanship in Texas," State Representative Paul Sadler, a Democrat, said of Mr. Bush. "It kind of developed over the years because of the nature of the system."
The structure of Texas government alone, some have noted, lends itself to an atmosphere of cooperation. The Legislature meets every other year for a 140-day session in which all the business of the nation's second-most-populous state must be completed.
"Someone described it as trying to take a sip of water from a fire hydrant," State Representative Steven D. Wolens, a Dallas Democrat, said of the pace of a session. He noted that there was not enough time to "try to one-up the other party so we can get an advantage."
Another Democrat, State Representative Patricia Gray of Galveston, said the political structure in Washington that has placed so much power in the hands of conservative Congressional Republicans like Representative Tom DeLay and Senator Trent Lott does not exist in Texas.
"We don't have a minority and majority leader, or party whips, as they do in Congress and in many state legislatures," Ms. Gray said. "Bush doesn't have these party structures to go through to get to the right Democrat."
The few vocal critics of this Texas way of governing are those on the liberal and conservative extremes of both parties, who feel marginalized by the shared middle. Tom Pauken, a former chairman of the Texas Republican Party who was often critical of Mr. Bush, bristled when the governor defended Democrats whom he and other party officials hoped to unseat. Mr. Pauken also helped defeat Mr. Bush's proposed tax overhaul in 1997, which many Democrats supported and many Republicans ultimately voted against.
Mr. Pauken said this style served mostly to preserve the status quo and frustrated factions of the Republican Party that wanted sharp change.
"The problem is in Washington you don't have people like Bullock," Mr. Pauken said, predicting a more difficult environment for Mr. Bush. "He's in for much tougher sledding trying to compromise in Washington. It will mean he will have to move a lot farther to the left than he did in Texas."
State Representative Garnet Coleman, a Democrat from Houston, said the shared conservatism of lawmakers was often an impediment to progressive change.
"Even if something is bipartisan, it still often doesn't solve the problems of certain groups of people in Texas," Mr. Coleman said. "They would be people who don't have health insurance, working families, the vulnerable in our society."
During the campaign, Vice President Al Gore repeatedly criticized Mr. Bush's record in Texas, pointing to the state's large number of uninsured children and environmental policy that allowed companies operating outdated, heavily polluting industrial plants to decide whether or not they wanted to voluntarily come into state compliance, rather than mandating that they do. The bill sailed through the Legislature.
"It's that type of thing we often end up with," said Ken Kramer, executive director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club. "A less-than-satisfactory and less-than-effective approach."
Bruce Buchanan, a professor of government at the University of Texas, said the state's political culture was directly connected to its business culture. In fact, Mr. Buchanan said, the boldest examples of progressive change in Texas, like education reform in the 1980's, have come only with the support of business.
"It has always been sold as economic development," Mr. Buchanan said of such initiatives.
In all, he said, the ethic of Texas bipartisanship is pretty basic: "Government shouldn't be activist. The less government, the better."

HEADLINE: Levy Enraged Over Aid Plan For Schools

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy angrily denounced a $14.5 billion school aid proposal put forth by the State Board of Regents yesterday, calling it "grossly unjust" because other cities in the state would receive more per pupil than New York City.
The discrepancy, based on a formula that favors cities with less income and property wealth than New York, is nothing new. But in unusually vitriolic comments, Mr. Levy said that he had expected the Regents and Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, to address the gap this year. He assailed Mr. Mills in particular, for "putting forward a proposal that in my judgment is not educationally sound." 
 Some officials expressed surprise at Mr. Levy's fury, given that the proposal included a record $608 million increase for New York City. That represents 41 percent of the total $1.45 billion proposed increase over this year's $13 billion state education budget. But Mr. Levy described the increase as "crumbs on the edge of the table," saying that the whole aid package needed to be redistributed so that New York City got at least as much per pupil as Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers.
"For the commissioner not to urge the Legislature to redirect the vast bulk of state aid to this city is irresponsible," Mr. Levy said, his voice shaking. "This is absolutely the same old, worn-out, indefensible formula that's been around for many years, and that's what is so disappointing. The Regents have slowly made progress in the direction of fairness, but with high standards kicking in and with the number of failing schools growing, the idea that there will be no fundamental, dramatic shift is inexcusable."
Mr. Levy and Mr. Mills, once allies during Mr. Levy's tenure on the Board of Regents, have tangled this year over state education policy. Most notably, Mr. Mills successfully sued the chancellor to stop him from hiring uncertified teachers for the city's most troubled schools. Mr. Levy has loudly begrudged the resulting court order requiring those schools to hire certified teachers, saying it robbed other schools of qualified applicants.
The Regents' proposal -- which will almost certainly be reduced by Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature when they adopt the new budget next year -- includes nearly $7,000 per pupil for Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers, compared with just over $5,000 per pupil for New York City.
In an interview that he requested, Mr. Levy said that he had decided to speak out against the proposal yesterday -- in a heated conversation with Mr. Mills, in comments to reporters and in a frosty letter to the Board of Regents -- because he was "incredulous."
In particular, Mr. Levy said the proposal was unfair given that Mr. Mills placed an additional 18 New York City schools on the state's list of failing schools this week. With 98 of the state's 114 failing schools, New York City needs far more money per pupil than other urban school systems, he said.
"Right now it's indefensible to have upstate communities that don't have our problems getting more state aid per pupil," Mr. Levy said.
Mr. Mills said in an interview that Mr. Levy's criticism was "unfortunate," because the four other cities have considerably less property and income wealth, making it harder for them to pad their school budgets with tax revenues.
"The critical point is that those four cities over all are very poor," Mr. Mills said. "It's important to remember that this is not a New York City formula, but a New York State education formula. We cannot create dramatic volatility for other school districts. We have to make changes based on need and changes that are equitable and reflect a long-term strategy to close the gap in student achievement."
Under the proposal, the four other cities would receive a total increase of $126 million, compared with $608 million for New York City. But while New York's increase would be far larger, it averages out to about $600 for each of the city's 1.1 million students. In comparison, the total increase for the other four cities averages out to about $942 for each of their total 133,700 students.
The state's formula for determining school aid has long been the subject of fierce debate, and it is now the subject of a lawsuit pending in State Supreme Court. In the suit, a coalition of advocacy groups has charged that the formula has deprived urban students of their right to the "sound, basic education" guaranteed by the state Constitution.
Mr. Levy said yesterday that property wealth should not factor into the state's school aid formula as much as the various needs of each school system's students. Instead, he said, the formula should be based on factors like the number of failing schools each system has, the number of students not proficient in English and the number of students reading below grade level.
In fact, New York City students performed slightly better this year on statewide reading and math tests than their counterparts in the four other cities. One of those cities, Buffalo, had six schools placed on the state's failing list this year -- about 8 percent of its schools. Only slightly more of New York City's schools -- about 9 percent -- are on the list.
Assemblyman Steven Sanders of Manhattan, who heads the Assembly Education Committee, said he was surprised by Mr. Levy's complaints and pleased with the school aid proposal. He said that New York City would be lucky to receive 41 percent of the total increase next year, given that it has received 38 to 39 percent of the increase recently.
"Those other districts have less ability to finance education by their own wherewithal," Mr. Sanders said. "I think this is the right way to go, even if it doesn't always work out perfectly."
Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Mills pointed out that, historically, the Legislature and the governor have not allotted nearly as much state aid in the final budget as the Regents proposed. "To get this kind of increase," Mr. Mills said, "people need to lock arms and fight on the same side."
But Mr. Levy said that given the strong economy and the tough new graduation requirements that Mr. Mills has imposed, the Regents should be joining him in fighting for a radically different aid formula. "If I can't persuade the commissioner and the Regents to be on the right side and lock arms on this issue," he said, "what hope will I have of persuading the Legislature?"

HEADLINE: MEDIA MEGADEAL: THE NEW COMPANY;
Two Become One, and Then What?

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
With the tough restrictions imposed by the Federal Trade Commission, falling stock prices and the clouded economic outlook, America Online and Time Warner face some significant speed bumps as they try to achieve their grand visions of being the media company for the new century.
But while these impediments may slow the companies, they do not fundamentally alter the ability of the unified AOL Time Warner to take advantage of its combined power in broadcasting, publishing, film, music and the Internet, analysts and executives said yesterday. 
 To be sure, a slowing economy will certainly hurt the company, especially its advertising sales. And Time Warner employees have been told to prepare for cutbacks and possibly layoffs. But analysts say that AOL Time Warner and other media behemoths like Viacom, Disney and the News Corporation, will be better able to weather a storm than smaller companies.
"Everybody is challenged by a weaker market, but the biggest companies have the best ability to cut costs and create new businesses," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "If you look at the scale and scope of Time Warner, they have the industry-leading consumer brands and the leading Internet platform, so their ability to reach consumers in all demographic groups is awesome."
It was just that sort of power that concerned the Federal Trade Commission, some consumer groups and AOL Time Warner's competitors.
They worried that the deal would create a media octopus with such strong tentacles in so many areas that it could have undue influence over the provision of information and entertainment.
That concern led to a much longer and tougher antitrust review than America Online and Time Warner expected. But in the end, the agreement they forged with the trade commission substantially restricts only one of the octopus's arms: high-speed Internet access over cable systems. The rest are largely free to exert their strength.
The commission insisted that Time Warner's cable unit, which has about 20 percent of the national market, could not give preferential treatment to America Online's high-speed service. Rather, it must let cable subscribers choose among several Internet options, and even the smallest Internet service provider is guaranteed a deal as good as AOL gets.
The main beneficiaries of the restrictions are Earthlink, Microsoft's MSN service and smaller Internet providers that will be able to provide service over Time Warner's cable systems on particularly attractive terms. Time Warner, as a result, may not be able to charge them as much as it otherwise would have.
"AOL Time Warner has lost the ability to extract favorable pricing because it is such a big gorilla," said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Chase H&Q.
Analysts said they could not yet assess how much revenue the company was forgoing by giving up its ability to extract the best deal it can -- and both Time Warner and AOL have reputations for driving hard bargains. But in a deal with Earthlink announced two weeks ago, Time Warner is charging $27 a month per subscriber for access to its network. That is $3 a month less than Time Warner charges Road Runner, the high-speed Internet service that it controls and that has been the exclusive Internet offering on Time Warner systems so far.
Time Warner says that it will make up on volume what it loses on price.
Moreover, as much as Time Warner cable may be hurt, the agreement with the trade commission may indirectly provide great benefit for AOL's online service. Though it does not directly apply to other cable companies, both AOL and consumer groups hope it will become a template for the industry. The cable companies argue that they should not be under such a strict regime. But in any case, since the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, several -- including AT&T, the largest -- have said they will open their systems to competing Internet offerings. AOL, as the largest Internet provider, could well be in the best position to benefit from this shift.
"Even without being a monopoly, they can still emerge as the dominant player in broadband access," Mr. Noglows said.
But beyond high-speed Internet service, the terms announced yesterday do little to impede AOL Time Warner.
For example, there is nothing that explicitly prevents a repeat of the dispute last spring in which Time Warner cut off Disney's ABC network from its cable systems for almost two days in a contract dispute. Nor would AOL be prevented from similarly cutting off ABCnews.com from its Internet service or from any future interactive television service.
Some commissioners wanted to impose restrictions on the company's ability to give preferential treatment to its content, like CNN or Warner Brothers cartoons, on its Internet and interactive TV services.
The deal prevents Time Warner Cable from blocking an Internet service, like Earthlink, from transmitting a video signal like a movie or a cable station. The technology to do that is still shaky, but the prospect of an end run around the cable company's lucrative premium channel and pay-per-view business caused other cable operators to ban high-speed services from streaming video longer than 10 minutes.
But the trade commission did not impose any rules on the sort of interactive television that combines an existing cable station with Internet information, like a chat room superimposed over a football game. Wary of regulating such an embryonic business, the commission ultimately decided to keep an eye on the issue. AOL Time Warner is required to inform the commission of any complaints it receives from companies that feel their programming has been unfairly blocked. But if it finds antitrust violations, the trade commission or the Justice Department would have to take AOL Time Warner to court.
Barry Schuler, the chief executive of the AOL online service, said that while the company had the right to hoard Time Warner's content, it did not see much reason to do so.
"Over the years, exclusive content has not proven to be a driver of our business," he said. "People buy the Internet because they want access to everything."
The biggest opportunity for the combined companies to use their power is in putting together advertising packages. Any company that wants to appear on the opening screen of America Online's service, its most prominent position, might well be required to buy commercials on some of the lesser-rated programs on the WB network, for example. Of course, that is hardly a new practice for media companies.
Still, the company's ability to be tough with advertisers will fall off sharply if the economy declines. Already, advertising from what is left of the dot-com economy has slowed significantly.
But while AOL and Time Warner executives have said they hope that advertising will be the fastest-growing portion of their business, today it represents about 20 percent of their revenue, said Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.
"They are better able to weather an economic downturn than other media companies," Mr. Wolzein said. "At Disney, 30 percent of the revenue comes from advertising; at Viacom it's 40 percent, and at Yahoo it's 100 percent."
Beyond that, much of the rest of Time Warner's business, like cable subscriptions and movie sales, are historically not hurt in recessions.
Executives in some Time Warner divisions say they have been told to expect cutbacks, at least in some support areas like the legal and information technology departments and human resources. And Mr. Wolzein said he would not be surprised to see broader cuts if the economy soured.
"Time Warner has done some trimming over the years, but it's a company that could use another look," he said. An AOL spokesman declined to comment on any potential layoffs. The combined companies have 85,000 employees.
Time Inc. executives said bonus packages, an important component of their compensation, would be radically changed under America Online management. The company will phase in the award of stock options, not cash, as a year-end bonus.
More important, bonuses will no longer be based on one division's importance, but will be hinged on the performance of AOL Time Warner as a whole, to encourage integration.

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: THE CONGRESS;
House Leader Differs With Bush On Across-the-Board Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said today that he did not favor President-elect George W. Bush's $1.3 trillion across-the-board tax cut, a position that could threaten a centerpiece of his campaign.
Instead, Mr. Hastert said he would push for the House to act on tax cuts aimed more narrowly at married couples and heirs, an approach that drew bipartisan support this year in Congress but was rejected by President Clinton. Mr. Hastert, an Illinois Republican, has the backing of Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas. 
 "I would think that the first few pieces of tax relief that we attempt will be incremental," Mr. Hastert said. "But we haven't really sat down and talked about this in any depth.
"We are most successful, especially in tax policy, when we start to take tax ideas and do them a piece at a time," he added.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the future chairman of the Finance Committee, which oversees tax legislation, also advocated the step-by-step approach. Mr. Grassley said the political reality of a 50-50 split in the Senate would make the more ambitious plan difficult to pass, at least so long as the economy stays strong.
In his campaign, Mr. Bush turned a $1.3 trillion tax relief plan into his hallmark issue, promising to deliver tax relief to all Americans.
Today, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said Mr. Bush would push his plan but had not broached the subject with Congressional leaders.
"It was right when he announced it," Mr. Fleischer said. "And he believes it is even more right in the economic downturn. And he hopes to work with the Congress in bipartisan spirit to implement it."
As for Mr. Hastert's view that smaller tax cuts would work best, Mr. Fleischer said: "Any such decision is somewhat down the road. We will review all options."
Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, who has been making the rounds on Capitol Hill, has not pushed for the large tax-cut plan, choosing to listen more than lobby in his meetings with Republicans. But Republicans made it clear that they would be walking a delicate fault line this year.
While the desire for tax cuts has not waned among Republicans, they say the size and shape of the cuts will determine their success in Congress.
"Several of us emphasized the need for a balanced tax plan," Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, said of his meeting with Mr. Cheney on Wednesday. "It always seems the tax plans we've had are aimed at wealthier people."
One House Republican familiar with Mr. Bush's plans said Mr. Bush, who wants to reach common ground with Democrats, was considering sending his large-scale plan with the understanding that Congress would tinker with it to get it passed.
"Have it be the Bush proposal and let it be picked apart and massaged through the legislative process," the House member said.
But the member added that other options were being considered, including Mr. Hastert's proposal, as well as starting from scratch and asking Republicans and Democrats to participate.
Another factor in the decision will be the size of the projected surplus next year, which is expected to be larger when the next set of figures is released. Earlier estimates put the surplus over the next 10 years at $2.17 trillion. Some Republicans also say, enthusiastically, that an economic downturn could spur greater interest in a larger tax cut.
In the Senate, which has different parliamentary rules than the House, Republican leaders were less inclined to back Mr. Hastert's plan outright.
"We will get together and discuss, do we do this in one or two pieces, or four or five pieces," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the second-ranking Republican. "They are all good possibilities."
And Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, who is chairman of the Republican policy committee, said Mr. Bush's plan was a good starting point. "I do believe that President-elect Bush should bring his tax package to the Congress," Mr. Craig said. "That doesn't mean it should be passed letter-perfect."
In pushing for smaller cuts, at least initially, Mr. Hastert said he was opting for a proven recipe that drew widespread Democratic support last year.
This year, Congress passed bills with broad bipartisan support that provided tax cuts for some married couples and repealed the federal tax on large estates. The estate tax bill would have reduced federal revenue by $104 billion over the first 10 years. The marriage tax bill would have reduced taxes by $292 billion over the next decade. President Clinton vetoed the bills, which is one reason some Democrats voted for them in an election year, knowing they would not become law.
The Democratic alternatives, rejected by Republicans, were not so different from the final bills.
Urging caution, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said taking up the tax bills early might not be wise.
"It is very difficult to isolate a couple of provisions," Mr. Daschle said. "Most oftentime, when you take up a tax bill, it's taken up in a larger context. I don't know that we want to take up a bill in the larger context right off the bat."
While talk of bipartisanship is de rigeur in Washington, actual bipartisan accomplishments may prove difficult on Capitol Hill next year.
Members of Congress and Mr. Cheney have mentioned education as a starting point. But Democrats and Republicans, who are at loggerheads over how to fix the problem, have been fighting about education for years, including just this week, when education spending was still holding up next year's budget.
Republicans want more local control in school districts, and many advocate shifting tax dollars from failing public schools to private schools. Democrats are solidly against that idea.
The situation is further exacerbated by the anger of liberal Democrats and black House members over what they called election irregularities in Florida.
Mr. Hastert and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said they would like to improve the electoral process. "I think there will be huge bipartisan support for that effort," Mr. Gephardt said.
Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, said Mr. Bush should have mentioned electoral problems in his speech. "He should have assured the nation he is going to do everything he can to lend support to states to modernize their voting system," Ms. Waters said.
Other black caucus members said they were not sure that politics and hurt feelings could be readily transcended.
"It's going to be very difficult, almost impossible, for many of us to forget what happened," said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. "There are a lot of hurt feelings."
And even as he was talking about cooperation, Mr. Gephardt was also cautioning that Democrats had received mixed signals.
"We appeal to those who would remain committed to the 'my way or highway' agenda, unbending to compromise, uninterested in consensus, to reconsider the new spirit that President-elect Bush is wanting to bring to Washington," Mr. Gephardt said.

Officials for the Museum of the City of New York yesterday defended their sudden decision this week to move the institution from a city-owned building in Upper Manhattan to a city-owned building in Lower Manhattan, amid criticism that the Giuliani administration had engineered the move in secrecy and with arrogance.
The museum's officials said the move from its longtime home at 1220 Fifth Avenue, at East 103rd Street, to the Tweed Courthouse, a public building on Chambers Street, had many benefits for the museum and for the city's residents. For example, they said, the courthouse is more accessible to mass transit and has double the space to house and display the museum's collection of 1.5 million items. 
 There is also the added charm of location: the Tweed Courthouse is close to Wall Street and many court and municipal buildings. In fact, it is just a few steps from City Hall.
"It's always an issue when you relocate, but the museum will be able to do so much more," said Cristyne F. Lategano-Nicholas, who is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's nonvoting representative on the museum's board of trustees and is the president of NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau.
But Philip Reed, the City Council member whose Upper Manhattan district includes the museum's Fifth Avenue location, said that while there might be sound reasons for such a move, it comes at the expense of economically fragile communities nearby, like East Harlem. It also comes without a word of acknowledgment or understanding from the mayor or his aides, he added.
"It's the mayor's typical 'I-rule-the-world attitude,' " he said, his voice rising in anger. "I'd like to know from the mayor: What are you going to do for our community? You're just going to suck this out of our neighborhood and not say anything?"
The Giuliani administration yesterday continued to refrain from commenting on the Tweed Courthouse, which is undergoing an extensive renovation with an estimated cost that has risen to $89 million from $36 million in four years.
On Wednesday, Sunny Mindel, the mayor's communications director, briefly broke the silence in an interview, describing the move as a "perfect complement" to the $30 million restoration of City Hall Park. Yesterday, she and other mayoral aides did not return calls seeking comment, as did spokesmen for the Economic Development Corporation, the agency, controlled by the Giuliani administration, that is overseeing the courthouse restoration.
To a limited extent, the museum broke its own silence on the matter by issuing a press release yesterday evening confirming that its trustees had voted unanimously to make the move, which is expected to take up to two years. "The Museum of the City of New York at the Tweed will add a world-class museum -- whose subject is the city itself -- to this galaxy," said Robert R. Macdonald, the museum's director.
Mr. Macdonald would not comment further, but other officials associated with the museum acknowledged that many aspects of the relocation had yet to be worked out. For example, Ms. Lategano-Nicholas -- the mayor's former communications director who oversaw the courthouse project before leaving the administration last year -- said she did not know whether the plan still included converting part of the building into a visitors center.
They acknowledged that the future of the Fifth Avenue building, where the museum has been for more than 70 years, remained uncertain, but they chafed at the idea that the museum was the sole possession of the immediate neighborhood. It is a museum for the entire city, they said, and the Fifth Avenue building is too small and too difficult to reach.
Barbara Millstein, the curator of photographs at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, pointed out one possible factor that the museum's trustees did not. Although the museum is along Fifth Avenue's famed museum mile, it is at the very northern end of that stretch.
"It's pretty far uptown for them to get the crowds that they'd like to have," Ms. Millstein said.
A couple of trustees said that the museum planned to maintain its relationship with its soon-to-be-former neighbors. For example, they said, it will continue to help with the Stickball Hall of Fame and with the local historical society.
But the neighborhood's residents and local officials expressed frustration and sadness over the news that the museum was heading downtown. They said their community had been trying to jumpstart a revitalization of its own, and that the museum was routinely cited as a local gem to prospective investors and homebuyers.
If the city has to make such a decision, Mr. Reed said, "Then you pick up the phone that morning, you say, 'Mr. City Councilman, don't worry, we're going to sit down and do something for your neighborhood.' I don't hear that conversation."

HEADLINE: Congress Is Seen Clearing Way Today for Adjournment

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
More than 10 weeks after the start of the fiscal year, Congress and the Clinton administration are poised to finish the government's $600 billion annual spending plan, but the White House and a powerful Alaska senator squared off today for one more fight -- over sea lions.
House and Senate leaders said they expected to approve the final spending bill on Friday, clearing the way for adjournment of the 106th Congress. 
 Most of the disagreements melted away today. Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said, "We are pleased to have reached agreement with House and Senate Republicans and Democrats, as well as the administration, on a final appropriations package."
But the Alaska senator, Ted Stevens, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was holding out for legislation that would ease restrictions on how much pollock and cod could be harvested from Alaskan waters by commercial fishermen. White House officials said such fishing threatened the food supply of the Steller sea lion, an endangered species.
The sea lions, which can be 10 feet long and weigh up to a ton, need enormous amounts of food because they are so huge.
Mr. Stevens demanded that the final budget agreement block new restrictions on fishing proposed by the Clinton administration. In effect, he said, Alaskans need jobs on trawlers more than sea lions need a few more cod.
Angrily pounding his desk on the Senate floor, Mr. Stevens denounced the administration's plan. "The fishing limits," he said, "will put a considerable number of people out of work. Federal control of these magnificent fisheries is not going to be approved by this senator."
While such threats can be a negotiating tactic, the White House responded in kind, saying any budget bill that did not protect the endangered sea lions would be vetoed.
White House officials and Senate Democrats said the administration was negotiating a compromise with Mr. Stevens. "We'll work it out," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the assistant Democratic leader.
One other item still up in the air was a proposal to help Amtrak sell $10 billion worth of bonds to develop high-speed railways in the Northeast Corridor and elsewhere in the United States. Investors would receive a federal tax credit in place of the interest normally paid on such bonds.
Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, all Democrats, were fighting for the proposal, which could cost the government $3 billion over 10 years. But some Republicans, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Phil Gramm of Texas, resisted the proposal, saying Amtrak should first demonstrate that it could be profitable.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said Congress would not approve an increase in the minimum wage this year. Democrats had sought a $1 increase in the hourly minimum, now $5.15.
But the White House and Republican leaders of Congress did agree today to make big increases in spending on education and biomedical research. Both parties took credit for the increases, even though the numbers were slightly lower than those negotiated just before the Nov. 7 election.
Spending for the Education Department will rise $6.5 billion, or 17 percent, to $44.5 billion in the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1.
Mr. Clinton had wanted several billion dollars more, but Democrats said they decided to take the deal they could get now because they might not be able to get as much after George W. Bush becomes president next month.
Mr. Hastert, a former schoolteacher, said Congress had increased the budget for school and college programs by nearly 50 percent since Republicans took control of Congress in 1995.
Linda Ricci, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the final agreement provided "significant increases for President Clinton's priorities," including school repairs and smaller class sizes.
The budget for the National Institutes of Health will rise by $2.5 billion, or 14 percent, to $20.3 billion in the current fiscal year, from $17.8 billion last year.
Its budget has grown nearly 50 percent since 1998, an extraordinary increase reflecting excitement about scientific discoveries that promise new cures and treatments for dozens of deadly diseases.
"This is an extremely generous increase," said Anthony J. Mazzaschi, assistant vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges.
The budget for Pell grants, the most important form of federal aid to college students, would rise $1.1 billion, or 14 percent, to $8.8 billion. The maximum Pell grant, now $3,300, would be increased to $3,750.
Congress is providing $1.4 billion to help low-income families heat their homes, an increase of $300 million over the amount appropriated last year.
The bill also provides more than $30 billion over the next five years to increase Medicare payments to hospitals, home health agencies, health maintenance organizations and other health care providers.
Payments were cut in 1997, but the savings have far exceeded what Congress intended.
Senator Stevens spent much of the day haggling with the Clinton administration over the fate of the Steller sea lion, which breeds in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea.
The White House said that a legislative rider proposed by Mr. Stevens would undermine enforcement of environmental laws, particularly the Endangered Species Act.

Need for Emergency Aid Rises, City Study Shows

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Demand for emergency food and housing rose this year, and city officials expect the trend to continue in 2001 despite the country's strong economy, a survey released today by the United States Conference of Mayors found.
Requests for emergency food rose about 17 percent from last year, while requests for emergency shelter were up 15 percent, the survey of 25 cities found. 
 Demand for emergency food by families with children increased 16 percent.
Not all of the requests were filled. On average, 13 percent of the requests for emergency food were not met last year, as well as 23 percent of requests by homeless people for emergency shelter.
h The 16th annual survey covered mostly midsize and large cities from Providence, R.I., to Los Angeles, including Denver, Detroit, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego and Trenton.

HEADLINE: Meet Me At 60th And 60th;
Many Drivers Find Streets of Queens A Confusing Maze

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
The mission was simple: to find a coffee shop in Corona, Queens.
The man on the mission was equipped with a large and detailed Hagstrom map, a car with a full tank of gas, a master's degree in economics with a concentration in urban planning and an address from the telephone book. The Yellow Pages listed the coffee shop, El Pasillo, at 37-69 103, Corona. 
 The first problem for the man, Robert Wood, 34, a math guy from Manhattan who volunteered to try to not get lost in Queens, was the matter of the number 103. The possibilities in Queens for that number are 103rd Street, 103rd Avenue, 103rd Drive and 103rd Road. Ditto for 37 and 69, numbers that Mr. Wood deduced contained crucial information about a cross street (or avenue or drive or road).
In the scheme of things, Mr. Wood had it easy with 103 because other numbered streets in Queens can also be found in the form of places -- as in 65th Place -- as well as lanes, terraces, courts and crescents. Crescents are less common; one of the loveliest crescents, 246th, can be located (although not by Mr. Wood) looping through a fancy nook of northeast Queens, just off 57th Drive, which in that part of Queens is actually the continuation of 244th Street before it becomes 245th Place and then 62nd Avenue.
So at 2:09 p.m. on a recent Saturday, Mr. Wood, his palms only mildly sweaty at this stage, set out for the Corona coffee shop from points west. He got himself onto the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and exited soon after arriving in Queens, pulling over at 65th Place and Laurel Hill Boulevard in Woodside, about two miles from Corona.
Looking in the street index, Mr. Wood determined that he was, in fact, in search of 103rd Street because there is no 37-anything for 103rd Avenue, Drive or Road. "I'm going to do this in stages," he said confidently, adding that he planned to hop over to 69th Street, head north to 37th Avenue and then cruise over to 103rd Street.
One block later, Mr. Wood was lost. Five miles and 35 minutes later, Mr. Wood was more lost. "Welcome to Maspeth," read a sign that might as well have said "Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle" because even experienced navigators of Queens consider Maspeth difficult.
"Is there someone out there who's really proud of this system?" Mr. Wood said, shortly after zooming by the intersection of 65th Place, 62nd Street and 52nd Avenue and discovering that in Maspeth, some of the numbered avenues, like the one he was taking in the wrong direction, briefly change to named avenues.
The chances of Mr. Wood's finding the coffee shop seemed to grow slimmer with every passing street, road, avenue, drive, lane, place and terrace. More on this later.
Mr. Wood was flummoxed, but not alone. His deep sense of disorientation is shared by others who shop, visit, work and even reside somewhere in the 112 square miles that make up the vast borough of Queens. United Parcel Service drivers and florists making deliveries, social workers making home visits, reporters covering breaking news, cabdrivers, tourists, census takers -- all have been sucked into the vexing vortex of the Queens street system at one time or another.
"Even with a map, you don't know where you are going; you need a person," said Gigi Stone, who has covered Queens for New York 1 News for three years and who lives in the borough as well. "I'm shameless at this point. I just keep my window down and yell."
Laura Bell, a proofreader for a Manhattan advertising agency who has lived in Long Island City, Queens, for four years, said flustered people constantly stop her to ask for directions while she is walking her dog. She said she was usually too confused herself to help them out.
"They usually seem like they're at a point where they think they're never going to get out," she said. "Queens is a bit of a twilight zone."
Some lost souls may be surprised and even flabbergasted to know that there is a highly sophisticated logic to the whole thing, a rational, mathematical street-naming system with an inventor and fans. True, they may never understand the system, but it is regarded by historians and other experts who can grasp it as a stroke of masterly urban planning.
Some experts say the confusion most often occurs among people who spend little time in the borough or who have not taken the time to try to understand the street-naming system.
"Very often this arrives from the snobbery of Manhattan," said Vincent Seyfried, a Queens historian who grew up in Ridgewood, not far from the neighborhood where Mr. Wood wound up en route to Corona. He added that while Manhattan's rectangular grid system can be easily understood, Brooklyn and the Bronx have no real universal grid system.
"Queens is the easiest by far of all the boroughs," Mr. Seyfried said. "It's a very simple pattern."
This was a very interesting notion, one that required a visit to the topographical bureau at Queens Borough Hall, at 120-55 Queens Boulevard, the office responsible for naming and mapping the streets.
The task of explaining the pattern fell to Moghabhai Desai, the bureau's chief engineer, a gentle and patient man whose office is crammed with maps.
First, there was the matter of the jingle. Charles U. Powell, a chief engineer in the bureau who designed the street-naming system in 1911, modeling it after the Philadelphia grid system, was faced with staunch opposition to his plan from Queens residents. So he wrote a little jingle to clarify things and mailed it out.
In Queens, to find locations best
Avenues, roads and drives run west;
But ways to north or south 'tis plain
Are street or place or even lane.
The jingle was not helping.
So Mr. Desai went on. The street-naming pattern was used to gradually -- though never completely -- unify the streets of the 60 or so self-contained villages that existed in Queens when it was incorporated into New York City in 1898. It was clear to borough officials then that Queens needed a coherent system. There were 40 Washington Streets. Each village had its own house-numbering method. It was a mess.
So Mr. Powell came up with a plan to rename the streets according to the grid and impose a uniform system of numbering the houses. It took 17 years, and Mr. Powell faced so much resistance that some parts of the borough retained named streets. This is why there are no numbered streets in some neighborhoods and a mix of names and numbers in others.
The system works like this: avenues run east and west and streets run north and south, the opposite of Manhattan's system. The avenues were given consecutive numbers, but there were often additional parallel streets in between the avenues that needed names, so they were assigned the same numbers and called roads or drives, in that order.
So if there was a street between 65th and 66th Avenues, it would be called 65th Road. If there was another one, it would be called 65th Drive. But there is no uniformity. Sometimes there are roads and drives between the avenues, sometimes there is only a road. Sometimes the avenues run consecutively with nothing in between, depending on the neighborhood.
The same went for streets. If there were additional streets that needed naming between the consecutively numbered streets, they were called places and lanes, in that order. So between 71st Street and 72nd Street, there could be a 71st Place and a 71st Lane. Again, that depends on the neighborhood. In Glendale there is a 71st Street and a 71st Place, but in Middle Village, only a 71st Street.
Breathe. Crescents and hyphens are next.
Curved roads that were not parallel with either the avenues or the streets were assigned numbers and called crescents, courts or terraces. The longer roads, like Queens Boulevard, were called boulevards and not assigned numbers.
Mr. Desai was asked about the hyphenated addresses. He explained that the house-numbering system was designed to indicate the exact location of an address. The number before the hyphen is the cross street, and the number after the hyphen is the position on the block.
So 37-69 103rd Street would be on 103rd Street between 37th Avenue and 38th Avenue (unless there is a 37th Road or a 37th Drive before 38th Avenue), house No. 69 on the block.
The cross streets (or avenues, roads, drives, places or lanes) can tell you where in the borough -- east, west, north or south -- an address is. The streets, starting with First Street on the borough's western edge, increase as they go east. The avenues, starting with Second Avenue, increase as they go south. This is important because someone looking for 71st Street could be looking for an address in Jackson Heights or in Glendale, neighborhoods that are miles apart. If the cross street in the address is a low-numbered avenue, like 20th (that is low for Queens), the address is in the north, but a higher-numbered avenue, like 88th or 165th, would put the address in the south.
That about covers the system. Oh, but there are dozens of exceptions, like changing street angles, sudden bursts of named streets, dead-end streets and other interruptions in the grid that render the logic useless in some parts of the borough.
Still, said Mr. Desai at the conclusion of his explanation of the street-naming system, getting around "shouldn't be that difficult."
Mr. Wood might disagree. Granted, he was driving without an explanation, but he did have a map.
"The minute you veer off course, you can't be sure what's happened," he said as he pulled over at Perry Avenue and Hamilton Place in Maspeth to study the map yet again.
He devised a plan to get to Roosevelt Avenue, his ticket to Corona. He took Hamilton to 65th Place, and planned to take 51st Avenue east to Junction Boulevard, which would take him to Roosevelt. His plan went slightly awry when 51st Avenue changed into Garfield Avenue, but he stumbled onto 69th Street and, remembering his original plan, took that to Roosevelt, where he turned right and got into a major traffic jam.
He moved along Roosevelt, which is one block south of 37th Avenue, the cross street for the 103rd Street address he was searching for. He made his way slowly through Woodside into Corona, turning onto 37th Avenue. He began to see encouraging numbers, like 98 and 99.
He pulled up to 103rd Street. He was at the corner of 37th Avenue and 103rd Street; the coffee shop was just down the street -- either to the left or to the right on a one-way street. There was a rush of euphoria, and then another of self-doubt.
He was close enough, he decided, and did not want to take another wrong turn. "I'm going to count my blessings and declare victory," he said, continuing east along 37th Avenue in search of the next address: 111-01 111th Avenue.

HEADLINE: U.N. Economic Panel to Study Ways to Help World's Have-Nots

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan named a high-level advisory panel of international financial experts today and gave them five months to come up with concrete ideas to help poor countries that are falling farther and farther behind a global economic boom.
The panel will be led by Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico, who is an economist. Among its members are Robert E. Rubin, the former United States treasury secretary and now chairman of Citigroup's executive committee, and Jacques Delors, a former president of the European Commission and finance minister of France. Other members will include a labor expert and the head of a major private relief organization, Oxfam. 
 "Development has been the twin objective of the United Nations alongside international peace and security," Mr. Annan said at a news conference with Mr. Zedillo this morning. "Development cannot happen without resources, especially financial resources," he said, noting that official development assistance has been in steady decline for well over a decade. He said that poor countries are so far in debt that many of them are paying more in interest and loan payments to industrialized countries than they are receiving in aid from those countries.
"It is vital that we turn the situation around," he said. "But how?"
The naming of the panel on financing development is another unusual initiative by a secretary general who is willing to reach outside the United Nations for expertise and opinions. It is also a move to inject a dose of financial expertise and realism into the agenda of a United Nations conference on how to finance development that will be held in early 2002.
The panel will not approach the problem the usual way -- by looking primarily at traditional patterns of foreign aid for answers to the paradox of growing poverty amid plenty -- often in the same country. Instead, it will be expected to study the full range of economic factors affecting development, from trade, investment and debt relief to the failure of many nations to raise more of their own money domestically.
This year, according to United Nations figures, foreign direct investment around the world -- money invested in a country from outside -- will total more than $1.1 trillion, twice what it was three years ago. But less than a fifth of that total goes to developing nations, and most of that to 20 countries with already growing economies. The poorest nations attracted only about 0.5 percent of investments made abroad in 1999.
At the same time, foreign aid has been falling, especially from the United States, which during the Clinton administration slipped well behind all other industrial countries in the proportion of gross domestic product given in assistance. Over all, foreign aid to the poorest countries fell nearly 25 percent during the last part of the 1990's.
Also serving on the panel will be Abdulatif al-Hammad, president of the Arab Fund for Economic Development; David Bryer, director of Oxfam; Mary Chinery-Hesse, a former deputy director general of the International Labor Organization; Rebeca Grynspan, former vice president of Costa Rica; Majid Osman, a commercial banker who was formerly finance minister of Mozambique; and Manmohan Singh, former finance minister of India and a major architect of its economic liberalization policies.

An article on Dec. 6 about the revitalization of Stone Street in Lower Manhattan referred imprecisely to access through the Goldman, Sachs headquarters at 85 Broad Street, built on a closed section of Stone Street. Though a security turnstile was installed at each end of the lobby, the company said its policy was to let the public walk through.
A picture caption referred incorrectly to a new lamppost on Stone Street. It is an electric reproduction of the bishop's crook design, not a gas lamp.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Big Chemical Companies Reshuffling Units

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Today, it was the German chemical giant BASF A.G. On Thursday, it was DuPont of the United States. And last month it was Aventis S.A., the French pharmaceutical company.
Amid seemingly endless corporate reshufflings, the world's biggest chemical companies are facing a fundamental choice: chemicals or drugs? Except for a few holdouts, most have decided they can no longer do both. 
 Today, BASF announced that it would sell its drug business for $6.9 billion to Abbott Laboratories Inc. The sale ends three decades of effort by BASF to buy its way into the pharmaceutical industry, with its lure of higher profit margins and higher stock valuations.
DuPont reached a similar verdict a day earlier, when it announced plans to sell off its pharmaceutical business. With revenue of $1.9 billion, analysts say the operation is likely to be worth at least $5 billion.
Both companies will refocus their money on the older and dowdier chemical industry, where profit margins are lower but scales are much bigger. And they are not alone. In the last few years, chemical companies have been buying and selling units at a furious pace as they search for the perfect lineup of businesses that will allow them to be among the dominant producers in a few selected areas.
At the same time, companies like Aventis have put themselves through precisely the opposite transformation. Aventis, formed last year from the merger of Hoechst A.G. of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, has abandoned the chemical business entirely to focus on what it called "life sciences" pharmaceuticals and agricultural products like genetically modified seeds and pesticides.
Three weeks ago, Aventis decided that even this was too much of a spread. Executives are now trying to sell off Aventis Crop Sciences, apparently persuaded that there is not enough overlap with the drug business and worried that slow growth was putting a drag on the parent company's performance.
"If you look strategically, there is a difference in the cultures required for success in the pharma industry compared to what is required in the chemicals business," said Peter Blair, a chemical industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in London. "In pharma you need to be innovative and have strong research. In chemicals, you need to be the low-cost producer."
Indeed, only a handful of companies are still trying to push ahead in the two very different worlds. One is Bayer A.G., which will always be famous for its aspirin but which derives most of its profits and sales from chemical products. The other is Akzo Nobel N.V. of the Netherlands.
Last week, Bayer said it had hired two investment banks to evaluate its strategic options. That immediately produced speculation that Bayer might be thinking about a corporate overhaul, but that now appears unlikely. Company executives insist they are not looking for radical changes, and analysts say Bayer is merely looking for help in listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts say that Bayer and Akzo are different from most other chemical companies, because they derive a very large portion of their profits from pharmaceutical products. Where BASF and Du Pont receive only about 10 percent of their earnings from the drug business, the pharmaceutical share of earnings is 30 percent at Bayer and 45 percent at Akzo.
In general, however, experts say the traditional conglomerates are out of step. "The large chemical companies like BASF and DuPont have recognized that they can never reach the critical mass that they need in the pharmaceutical business," said Martin Stone, an analyst with HSBC Securities in London.
BASF's pharmaceutical business has a pretax profit margin of only 7 percent, Mr. Stone said. By contrast, the margin is about 30 percent at the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies.
The allure of pharmaceuticals has always been their extremely high profitability. But the industry has become increasingly concentrated through gigantic mergers, and companies need huge amounts of capital for research, development and marketing.
The chemical industry operates on much lower margins, and some of it is extremely vulnerable to cyclical swings in the industrial economy. But for companies that can build up enough scale, achieve top efficiency and dominate particular segments of the market, profits can be quite healthy.
In trying to sort themselves out, European chemical and drug producers have been trading businesses worth billions of dollars for the last three or four years. Those deciding to focus on chemical companies have been buying up rivals in segments where they can be dominant players.
Clariant A.G. of Switzerland, now the world's largest producer of specialty chemicals, was formed through the merger of businesses spun off in the mid-1990's from what was then Sandoz of Switzerland (which later merged with Ciba-Geigy) and Hoechst in Frankfurt.
More recently, the pharmaceutical companies Novartis and what is now Astra-Zeneca have spun off their crop-science businesses into a new company called Syngenta A.G., which has sales of more than $7 billion.
The mixing and matching reached nearly fever point today in Germany. Just as BASF was announcing the sale of its drug business to Abbott Laboratories, two German chemical companies made a $2 billion bid for a British rival -- all the while trying to wrap up their own merger.
Degussa-Huels A.G. and SKW Trostberg A.G., which are both controlled by the German utility conglomerate E.ON A.G., made a 1.3 billion bid ($1.9 billion) for the British rival, Laporte. Degussa and SKW have each been through a raft of mergers and takeovers. Now the two are merging, because their former parent companies Veba A.G. and RWE A.G. recently merged to form E.ON.
Even with that merger, the carousel is not ready to stop. Degussa and SKW have already announced their intention to sell off about $3 billion worth of businesses, in an attempt to simplify their combined company. But one thing they will certainly not use the money for is an acquisition in the drug business.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
After 8 Years, O'Neal adds College Degree to His Resume

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La., Dec. 15

 BODY:
The great poets are forever being quoted in earnest and solemn commencement addresses, but this undoubtedly was the first speech ever filigreed with the words of Keats, Coleridge, Frost and Shaq.
Shaquille O'Neal received his bachelor's degree from Louisiana State University today, eight years after he left early to pursue fame and fortune in professional basketball, movies and rap music. Even with an economic downturn on the horizon, job prospects appeared encouraging for the new graduate. 
 "I'd like to thank Mr. O'Neal for dramatically increasing the starting salary of this graduating class," Dr. Mark A. Emmert, the university chancellor, said to a spasm of laughter.
O'Neal is the most prominent of about 30 players -- including Allan Houston and Larry Johnson of the Knicks -- the National Basketball Association says have completed their degrees during their professional careers.
Their diplomas are seen as antidotes to statistics nationwide indicating that players in men's basketball and football graduate at rates significantly lower than the general student body.
"I'm very proud of him," Lucille Harrison, O'Neal's mother, said in an interview. "He made a promise to me, he set his goal and he achieved it."
If a degree in general studies ever seemed superfluous for anyone, it would seem so for O'Neal, who at 28 will earn more than $19 million this season with the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a seven-year contract extension worth $152 million. Still, he promised his mother that he would get his diploma, and today he did.
At a morning commencement, the playful O'Neal sat on the dais with university officials and enlivened a sober ceremony by proclaiming that L.S.U. now stood for Love Shaq University.
That's an improvement, at least, over his claim of previous years that it stood for Learn Slowly University.
"Can you dig it, can you dig it?" O'Neal said in a deep baritone, as if he were speaking to a Lakers crowd at a victory parade instead of an august gathering of caps and gowns.
And so what if he didn't qualify to wear the hoods bestowed on honors graduates. He commissioned his own, fashioning a golden scarf with the words "Shaq is finished" and "For you, Mom."
"For people who think money and fame are important, they are only a small piece of the pie," O'Neal said in a short speech to his fellow graduates in the same arena where he had once played basketball. "You need an education to feel secure." And, to much laughter, "I feel secure that I can get a real job now."
During this moment of dunk and circumstance, as the local newspaper called it, a member of the L.S.U. board of supervisors told the audience that O'Neal now truly deserved to be called by his self-administered honorific, the Big Aristotle.
And in delivering the commencement address, the university's provost quoted O'Neal's words along with those of the great poets, citing his remarks earlier this week that he could now do anything because "I am an educated man."
"You had it just right, sir," Daniel M. Fogel, the provost, said to O'Neal.
The 7-foot-1, 315-pound O'Neal joked to reporters that he was the class valedictorian, saying he had achieved a 4.6 grade-point average on a 4.0 scale. He has played down the rigor of his education, saying that he took his standardized test scores in high school by giving random answers to a rap beat in his head ("A to B, C to D"), and proclaiming that he would receive his degree in "crayon biology."
Yet, it was clear that he held graduating from college in the same esteem as he did winning an N.B.A. title last season, along with being named the league's most valuable player.
"With all I've accomplished, if I don't have an education to handle these things, nothing matters," said O'Neal, who with the Lakers' blessing missed tonight's game against Vancouver and will rejoin the team on Sunday in Toronto. "I have a lot of money, but I wouldn't be able to handle it without an education."
It was unclear whether O'Neal, who is heavily involved in charities, including a program to provide computers to inner-city children, had donated money to L.S.U. A spokesperson for the university said he had no knowledge of that.
O'Neal, the stepson of a former Army sergeant, met Dale Brown, then the L.S.U. coach, while living in Germany and came here on a scholarship after attending high school in San Antonio. He left for the N.B.A. after his junior season in 1992, promising his mother -- in writing, the story goes -- that he would complete the 28 credits he needed for a degree.
A year and a half ago, according to Emmert, the L.S.U. chancellor, O'Neal contacted him about completing his graduation requirements. A program of correspondence courses and independent study -- some on campus, much online -- was devised. "Thank God for the Internet," said O'Neal, who even ordered his size XXXL cap and gown through the World Wide Web.
Learning to concentrate on his studies while living the peripatetic life of a professional basketball player left him frustrated many times, said O'Neal, who added, "I had to reteach myself to study." He said he took such courses as geography, agronomy and kinesiology to complete his degree.
"We treated him like any other student," said Freddie Martin, the head of the L.S.U. agronomy department. "He had to do the work like everyone else."
When O'Neal hesitated to complete his courses last summer after winning an N.B.A. title and the league's M.V.P. award, his academic adviser, Mike Mallet, said he admonished him, "You're going to be a dumb M.V.P. if you don't put some time in the classroom."
O'Neal complied. And today he became a potent symbol of the value of pursuing and completing an education even after the accomplishment of great personal and professional success. This message, L.S.U. officials hoped, would be particularly resonant in Louisiana, where 21 percent of the population does not have a high school diploma and where only 69 percent of college freshmen return for their sophomore years. "When kids get blinded by things that are fleeting, this puts the focus on things that are lasting," said Charles Weems, a member of the L.S.U. board of supervisors. "It's a big statement to young people that whether you're successful or struggling, if you stay with it, you can do it."
Not every graduate believed that O'Neal deserved such prominent attention on the commencement dais. Scott McWhorter, who received his doctorate in chemistry, said that while he felt O'Neal's degree was legitimate, "It shows the power of the almighty dollar."
"He's sitting with the chancellor," McWhorter said. "What did he do that no one else did except make a lot of money for his athletic prowess? It kind of demeans the meaning of education, what we're here for."
Many of the graduates interviewed, however, said they were impressed that O'Neal had completed his degree even when he could afford to buy a large part of the university.
"I think he's a stand-up guy," said John Tiernan, who received a bachelor's degree in the college of arts and sciences. "He's obviously doing this because he values his education. That's a lot more than you can say about a lot of people in his position. If you gave me a million dollars, or $30 million, I'm not sure I'd have the same motivation. I'd like to say I would. I think it's pretty respectable."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Fall Sharply on Record Volume

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday on record trading volume, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to a new closing low for the year. Only a late-day rebound kept the Nasdaq composite index from ending just a few points from its low.
The decline was set off by a sell-off in Microsoft, which said after the market closed Thursday that it would miss Wall Street's forecasts for its fourth-quarter earnings. 
 The report follows similar announcements by Intel, Compaq Computer and others that confirm slowing economic growth and slower consumer spending, which is cutting into their sales.
It seems that as long as the stream of earnings disappointments continues, the stock market will have a hard time finding its feet. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.& P. 500 index have now given up the gains they made after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated on Dec. 5 that the central bank would cut interest rates if the economy showed signs of heading into a recession.
"The election is finally behind us, and we are back to business, and business stinks," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company. "In the first half of next year, you will be lucky to do 2 percent growth. But, more importantly, the profits are going to be very disappointing."
The Dow fell 240.03 points, or 2.3 percent, to 10,434.96. The technology-heavy Nasdaq dropped 75.24 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2,653.27, while the S.& P. 500 lost 28.78 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,312.15. Its previous closing low was 1,314.95 on Nov. 30. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.56 billion shares, just beating the 1.54 billion traded on Nov. 30.
Some of today's decline and volume was caused by the rapid buying and selling associated with the quarterly expiration of stock index futures, options on indexes and options on individual stocks.
Microsoft projected late Thursday that it would report earnings of 46 to 47 cents a share in the current quarter, 5 percent to 6 percent below analysts' estimates, and earnings of $1.80 to $1.82 a share for the fiscal year ending in June, about 5 percent below expectations. Microsoft's stock was down $6.31, to $49.19. It traded as low as $48.06, its lowest intraday trade in more than two years.
Other technology stocks also fell, including Intel, which was off $2.69, to $32.44. Among the other big technology losers were I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Qualcomm, EMC, Compaq Computer and JDS Uniphase.
Stocks that are hurt when the economy and consumer spending slows also declined. Among them were Home Depot, down $1.94, to $41.94, and Wal-Mart Stores, down $1.19, to $49.88. Morgan Stanley's index of so-called cyclical stocks was off 1.9 percent.
Shares of America Online, down $1.04, to $48.96, and Time Warner, off $1.78, to $72.72, dropped the day after the Federal Trade Commission approved their merger and cleared the way for the creation of the world's largest media company.
The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was at 5.17 percent, down from 5.21 percent on Thursday. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.42 percent, from 5.44 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Moses Abramovitz, 88; Led U.S. Economic Association

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Moses Abramovitz , a former president of the American Economic Association and a leading authority on the causes of growth and business cycles, died Dec. 1 at Stanford University Hospital. He was 88.
The cause was complications after he was admitted to the hospital with a gastroenterological condition, said Paul David, a fellow economic historian at Stanford University. 
 Mr. Abramovitz of Stanford, Calif., held the William Robertson Coe Professorship in American Economic History, taught at Stanford for 30 years and served as department chairman.
"He was one of the pioneers of the modern study of economic growth, and his discoveries and analysis shaped the thinking of the profession," said Prof. Gavin Wright, also an economic historian at Stanford. He also helped build Stanford's department into one of the world's best.
Mr. Abramovitz was not active in policy debates. But his careful, fact-based research was central to many of the most important policy decisions of his time.
A paper he published in 1956 made the argument, startling at the time, that rapid growth in living standards in the United States in the first half of the 20th century could not be fully explained, as had been widely assumed, by the growth of the labor force and capital equipment. Instead, about half of the rate of growth was attributable to productivity growth -- the ability of corporations to take given amounts of labor and equipment and turn out an ever increasing amount of output.
Citing the research by Mr. Abramovitz and by Robert Solow, Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, economists concluded that the economy would prosper by emphasizing spending on research and education, the keys to lifting productivity.
Mr. Abramovitz also studied convergence of productivity, finding that the further behind the United States the other industrialized countries were, the faster they were likely to close the gap. But when he extended his research to developing countries, the generalization broke down. He elaborated the notion of "social capability," arguing that poor economies would not develop automatically. They had to build legal, political and cultural institutions that would encourage growth.
But Mr. Abramovitz's most significant contribution in his field may have preceded his academic career. During World War II, he served on the War Production Board with Simon Kuznets, a creator of modern systems for measuring economic activity and an eventual Nobel laureate. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had created the board to help plan for war.
In 1942, President Roosevelt and the military proposed a huge armament program. The proposal started a "feasibility debate," as to whether the economy could churn out the planes, tanks and artillery that the military said it needed and yet have enough capacity left over to produce food, clothing and other civilian goods.
Mr. Abramovitz, with Mr. Kuznets and others, brought modern measures of economic capacity to bear, arguing that the military's plan was infeasible and if it was tried, would lead to shortages and economic dislocation. According to Prof. Michael Edelstein of Queens College the board's findings were influential in convincing the Roosevelt administration to cut back its demands and avoid severe wartime shortages.
Mr. Abramovitz was born in Brooklyn in 1912 and earned his bachelor's degree in economics summa cum laude from Harvard University in 1932 and his doctorate from Columbia University in 1939. He served as chief of the European industry and trade section of the Office of Strategic Services and, during 1945 and 1946, served as economic adviser to the United States representative on the Allied Reparations Commission.
Mr. Abramovitz is survived by his son, Joel,, and two granddaughters, Rachel and Sarah, all of Newtown, Mass. His wife, Carrie, died in 1999.
Mr. David, who was a co-author with Mr. Abramovitz on several papers, said, "He remained the least-ego-involved scholar among all the truly distinguished economists I have had the privilege of knowing."
Indeed, Mr. Abramovitz recounted with great modesty his role in the reparations debate during the waning days of World War II. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau had proposed a plan to deindustrialize the German economy. A research team at Office of Strategic Services, led by Mr. Abramovitz, wrote a memorandum arguing that the Morgenthau plan would destroy German's capacity to export and, therefore, leave it unable to pay for food and other essential imports. The memorandum outraged Mr. Morgenthau.
At a meeting with Ed Mason, the chief economist at O.S.S., Mr. Abramovitz, and another eminent economist, Emile Despres, Mr. Morgenthau angrily asked, "Who is responsible for this?" Mr. Abramovitz later recalled, "Mason looked at Despres, and Emile looked at me. I had no one else to look at. The buck stopped with me. So, rather meekly, I said I was responsible."

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: SECOND CAREERS;
Lucrative Lobbying Jobs Await Many Leaving Government Service

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Business is out shopping these days, and what it is looking for does not come cheap: former senators, retired and defeated congressmen and top officials leaving the White House. Washington may be in transition, but for business, all this changing of hands is a hiring opportunity -- creating a new crop of ex-officeholders leaving top positions and now being considered for new jobs as corporate lobbyists.
Need some help with financial services in Washington? What about Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, a Republican who just lost his re-election bid? He even has a major financial instrument -- the Roth I.R.A. named after him -- and he is considered a prime catch. So is departing Senator Connie Mack, an affable Florida Republican who retired, or Senator Spencer Abraham, a defeated Republican of Michigan, who not only has a law degree from Harvard, but also is considered an expert in high-tech issues. 
 While the mating dance between the newly unemployed officials and a lobbying industry hungering for new talent is nothing new, it is operating at a fever pitch this year. For starters, with a new House, a new Senate and a new Republican administration, there will be thousands of fresh faces and new issues to lobby. Moreover, with Congress so closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, there is an increasing demand by business for members from both sides of the aisle, especially on such issues as tax cuts, Social Security reform and Medicare.
"The lawmakers who will be making the biggest killings are those who were the biggest names and who sat on the most powerful committees," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit group in Washington. "Folks like that are potentially worth extraordinary amounts of money, and lobbying firms will shell out for them."
From a business standpoint, if there is any lesson from the last decade, it is that Washington is an increasingly important force to be reckoned with -- either for good, as the many telecommunications companies that benefited from government policies found, or as a force that can hurt, as Microsoft found when the government filed an antitrust suit against it. As a result, business is increasingly willing to pay for Washington expertise -- seven-figure salaries for brand-name senators and $200,000 to $400,000 for those lower in the pecking order.
The biggest names leaving the Hill, of course, are getting the most attention. Take Senator Roth, former chairman of the Senate finance committee, or Senator Mack.
"Senator Roth would be viewed as having essentially total access to other committee members of matters amounting to billions of dollars," said Wright Andrews, a lobbyist and former president of the American League of Lobbyists. "And Mack is well respected and a nice fellow. He's been on the banking committee, so that is his natural constituency."
A spokesman for Senator Abraham said that "many groups have contacted him with opportunities, and his record in the Senate brings a lot to the table." The spokesman, Joseph H. Davis, added, "There is a lot he is interested in, and he's worked on a broad range of issues and has been on a lot of committees."
As for Senator Mack, "He's been engaged in discussions with many different business groups," said Nancy Segerdahl, a spokeswoman. "His focus is medical research and biotech, and he is very much involved in conversations with many companies in this area."
Others who are frequently mentioned include Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, who headed Banking, Judiciary and Intelligence subcommittees; Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, the former House Commerce Committee chairman; Representative Bob Franks, the New Jersey Republican who failed in his Senate bid; departing Representative John Edward Porter of Illinois, who is considered an expert in Latin American affairs, and Representative Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who was on the International Relations Committee. And the list goes on.
From the Clinton administration, top prizes are Defense Secretary William S. Cohen; Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser; Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat; and two former lobbyists, John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, and his deputy, Steve Ricchetti. Just this week, the Boeing Company announced it was hiring Thomas R. Pickering, a departing under secretary of state, for its Washington office.
In making the trek from Congress to the lobbying firms clustered on K Street in downtown Washington, many of these departing officials will be following a well-trod path. Already such marquee names as former Senators George J. Mitchell and Bob Dole are employed by the lobbying powerhouse of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, which represents such giants as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Brown & Williamson Tobacco.
"Anyone who has been in the Congressional leadership or had high-profile positions in the administration and who have had experience working the business community are going to be very attractive," said Robert S. Walker, chief executive of the Wexler Group, a major lobbying firm and a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania.
Of course, Congressional ethics rules prohibit departing members from lobbying on the Hill in the first year after they leave office. The executive branch has similar restrictions. But these rules are easily skirted as the former lawmakers are hired as "strategic advisers," directing other lobbyists until they can make direct contacts.
A couple of factors make these ex-members of Congress and former White House officials such prize catches. Star-power names provide a comfort level for corporations lobbying in Washington.
"It's a lot easier to sell your board on the idea when they are getting assistance from someone they know," said Kenneth Feltman, a lobbyist and president of the American League of Lobbyists. "That's the value of a name like Dole or Mitchell."
Even more, many departing lawmakers have an intimate knowledge of complicated government policies affecting business, as well as how business issues will play politically.
"It is impossible to calculate the value in helping clients in having a person who is as intimately familiar with the legislative process and who has the depth and breadth of relationships as former members of Congress," said Elliott Portnoy, an attorney with Arent Fox Kintner Plotkin & Kahn, whose lobbying roster includes former Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and former Senator John Culver of Iowa.
On top of that, former congressmen have perks that ordinary lobbyists do not have -- access to the floor of the House and Senate and use of the Congressional Research Service and Library of Congress.
And, while some say that with a closely divided Congress, only gridlock will result, others say there will still be plenty of work for lawmakers-turned-lobbyists.
"Gridlock? That's ridiculous," said James J. Albertine, who heads his own lobbying firm. "Congress will still spend $2 trillion next year. And when you spend that kind of money, you get into all kinds of activities affecting business. That means your business needs lobbyists more than ever."

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: CONGRESS;
Speaker Clarifies Stand on Bush's Tax Plan

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Seeking to clarify his stance on tax cuts, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said today he supported President-elect George W. Bush's across-the-board tax cut but would prefer to start by passing smaller cuts piecemeal on the House floor.
Mr. Hastert insisted in a statement today that he is in lock step with Mr. Bush on tax policy but that the political reality of a narrowly divided House led him to prefer winning approval for smaller tax cuts one at a time, starting with two bills that have drawn bipartisan support: one cutting taxes for some married couples and the other repealing the federal tax on estates. 
 That approach is also supported by Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip from Texas and a hard-line conservative.
"I support across-the-board tax relief because I believe it is one of the fairest ways to cut taxes," Mr. Hastert said. "I also believe that across-the-board tax relief may help the economy avoid a recession."
"Because we had such success in passing bipartisan measures to end the marriage penalty and the death tax in this session of Congress, I believe that these two bills could quickly be enacted in the law at the beginning of next year," Mr. Hastert added. "That is why I advocate that we start with these two bills in the 107th Congress."
President-elect Bush reiterated today his desire to see his $1.3 trillion tax package clear Congress and become law and expressed optimism that that would occur.
"I haven't had a chance to talk to the speaker yet," Mr. Bush said at a news conference today. "But what I found to be positive is the speaker was recognizing that we need some tax relief. And I have made it clear to the speaker once before that, you know, I campaigned on a package that I thought was fair and fiscally sound and responsible, and I strongly believe that."
Mr. Hastert's press secretary, John P. Feehery, said "there was some miscommunication" on Thursday at Mr. Hastert's news conference.
On Thursday, Mr. Hastert was asked whether he would seek passage of an across-the-board tax cut like the one Mr. Bush has advocated or stick to smaller pieces of the overall proposal. He said he favored dealing with the tax package in smaller pieces, a remark that was taken as an effort to distance himself from Mr. Bush's plan.
Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's press secretary, said he called Mr. Hastert's staff this morning to ask about news reports on Mr. Hastert's remarks.
Representative Roy Blunt, the Missouri Republican who spearheads Mr. Bush's House liaison team, said Mr. Hastert's approach to tax cuts is best.
"We can pass anything in his tax package, as long as we pass it as a stand-alone item," Mr. Blunt said. "As you begin to package those together, it becomes more difficult."

HEADLINE: SUNY Hospitals Seek Loans, Not Subsidies, to Cover Gap

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The budget gap for the State University of New York's hospitals has ballooned to $230 million, about 13 percent of SUNY's operating budget, but the university is not asking for any state subsidies to close that gap, according to the university's budget request for next year, which was released yesterday.
The university plans to borrow from the state to cover the gap, as it has for the last two years, while it continues to try to solve the problem, university officials said. 
 H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, has expressed concern that if SUNY does not press the governor and the Legislature for money to close the gap, the university may have to raise tuition or reduce the amount of money spent on instruction. So far, however, the university has relied largely on borrowing to close the gap.
SUNY is seeking a $1.8 billion operating budget for its 30 state-operated and statutory colleges next year -- a $132 million increase, or 7.5 percent.
The university has turned to consultants at PriceWaterhouseCoopers for advice on how the gap might be closed. But the consultants concluded earlier this year that the gap could not be closed by the hospitals themselves.
Edward F. Cox, a SUNY trustee and chairman of the board's finance and administration committee, said that SUNY had sought to give its hospitals more flexibility to compete with private hospitals and bring in more revenue. "Unfortunately, there has been no reaction from the political community," he said, "so we have this problem. There is not much more we can do as trustees."
The rest of the budget message was generally more upbeat. Of the $132 million budget increase SUNY is seeking, $42 million is for contractual increases for faculty and staff. It is also asking for $50 million for new initiatives, including $40 million to improve quality and $5 million to help colleges that are struggling to shift their missions.
Brian T. Stenson, SUNY's vice chancellor for finance and business, said yesterday at a meeting of the finance and administration committee that SUNY would like to change its financial structure "so the operating budget of the university does not depend on the payments of the hospitals."
SUNY officials say their problems stem from the state's requirement that SUNY's medical centers in Stony Brook, Brooklyn and Syracuse pay $116 million a year to cover fringe benefits for their employees, a sum they were once able to pay but can no longer afford because of belt-tightening brought about by the growth of managed care. Instead of paying the money directly to the state, the hospitals are supposed to pay the money to SUNY. If the hospitals fall short, as they have for several years, SUNY must scramble to cover the shortfall in any way it can.
Two years ago, the hospitals paid $39 million of the $116 million assessment, leaving a $77 million gap. Last year they paid that $77 million plus $2 million of the next $116 million assessment. They entered the current fiscal year with a $114 million bill from last year on top of the $116 million they owe for this year.
Mr. Stenson said that SUNY did not know what the hospitals would be able to pay this year.
The state has not always asked the hospitals to cover employee benefits. In the 1980's, the state subsidized the hospitals, which serve as teaching hospitals for medical students and provide care for the indigent. In 1990, the state stopped paying the subsidy. Two years later it asked the hospitals, which then had financial surpluses, to share their bounty. But changes in the economics of health care in recent years have turned surpluses into red ink for many hospitals, including SUNY's.
John Clarkson, deputy director for fiscal research and policy analysis in the comptroller's office, said that the university could not continue to roll the obligation over year after year.
"Eventually they'll run out of room to borrow," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT;
Congress Finishes Its Work By Approving Spending Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Congress tonight finished its work for the year and approved a huge spending bill after President Clinton reached agreement with a powerful Alaska senator on a compromise to protect an endangered species of sea lion.
The House passed the omnibus spending bill by a vote of 292 to 60, and the Senate approved it by voice vote. This cleared the way for final adjournment of the 106th Congress, which began nearly two years ago with the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
 The $450 billion bill provides money to hire teachers, repair crumbling schools, finance biomedical research and increase Medicare payments to hospitals and health maintenance organizations. It also provides $25 billion worth of tax credits and other incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in some of the nation's poorest communities over the next 10 years.
In addition, the bill grants legal status to nearly 700,000 immigrants whose status is either illegal or questionable.
White House officials said they rejoiced at passage of the bill, which they believe will perpetuate President Clinton's priorities for the government long after he leaves office.
"I am pleased that Congress and I have reached agreement on a budget for the coming year," Mr. Clinton said. "It is a budget that is fiscally responsible, pays down the debt and makes vital investments in our nation's future. In education, health care and community renewal, this budget provides more opportunity for more Americans than ever before."
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois said the bill laid a good foundation for President-elect George W. Bush to build upon. "Republicans have boosted education spending by 50 percent since 1995," providing $44.5 billion in the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, Mr. Hastert said.
Today's action closes a long-running battle between Mr. Clinton and Congress over the federal budget.
Lawmakers spent much of the last two years debating big issues like taxes, patients' rights, prescription drugs and the financing of election campaigns.
The disputes that delayed adjournment today involved smaller issues of concern to a handful of senators, but passions ran just as deep. Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he would not let Congress adjourn until it allowed fishermen to continue harvesting pollock and cod off the coast of Alaska.
The Clinton administration plans to tighten restrictions on such fishing because, it says, the pollock and cod are essential food for an endangered species of sea lions. Senator Stevens said the new restrictions would devastate the fishing industry and "create ghost towns in my state along the shore from Kodiak all the way out the Aleutian chain."
Heather Weiner, a lawyer at the Earth Justice Legal Defense Fund, an environmental group, said the number of sea lions in western Alaska had declined sharply, to fewer than 20,000 today from 175,000 in 1960. In a scientific study issued on Dec. 1, the Clinton administration said that commercial fishing was a significant factor in the decline.
Sylvia M. Mathews, deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said the compromise would allow fishermen to continue fishing for pollock and cod, but would not suspend the Endangered Species Act, as Mr. Stevens had originally proposed.
"We will protect fishing incomes and harvesting at 1999 levels," Ms. Mathews said.
The bill, she said, will provide $50 million of economic assistance to Alaska. Of this sum, $20 million is for projects to protect the sea lions and to control whales, which Mr. Stevens says are killing the sea lions. The bill provides $30 million for direct payments to individuals and businesses to protect the livelihood of Alaska fishermen.
Senator Stevens said, "I can't say that we won this argument, but I can say that we have reached a conclusion that will allow approximately 90 percent of the fishermen to return to fishing in January."
Ms. Weiner said she was disappointed by the compromise. "The Endangered Species Act is not waived," she said. "It is intact. It remains to be seen if the sea lions will survive as well. Under this compromise, the fishing industry can put up roadblocks to delay conservation measures."
No compromise was reached on a separate issue that held up the adjournment of Congress. Senators from Northeastern states had threatened a filibuster in their efforts to secure more assistance for Amtrak.
They had offered a proposal to help Amtrak issue $10 billion worth of bonds to develop high-speed railways. The government would have indirectly subsidized the bonds by providing a tax credit to investors, in place of the interest normally paid on bonds.
Republican leaders of Congress blocked the proposal, saying Amtrak should first demonstrate that it could operate profitably. Supporters of Amtrak withdrew the threat of a filibuster after Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader, and several committee chairmen promised to consider similar legislation next year.
"That is good enough for me," said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, a strong supporter of Amtrak, who rides the train to and from Washington. "I will withdraw any attempt to delay consideration of this final bill."
Since the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, Congress has passed 20 stopgap spending bills, each lasting for several days at a time, and it passed another one today, financing the government until President Clinton signs the omnibus spending bill.
The bill passed tonight will temporarily revive a provision of immigration law that allowed large numbers of people to obtain green cards while residing in the United States. Since this provision of the law expired in 1998, some immigrants have been forced to leave this country and return to their homelands while pursuing their visa applications.
This provision, known as section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, will be reinstated for four months. Immigrants must apply by April 30, 2001.
However, Republican leaders of Congress killed another proposal that would have helped certain immigrants who are subject to deportation because they committed relatively minor crimes before 1996. Under a 1996 law, a large number of offenses, including misdemeanors, were retroactively defined as aggravated felonies requiring deportation.
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he was outraged that Congress had adjourned for the year without passing legislation to relieve the "blatant unfairness" of the 1996 law.
"A stunning piece of cruelty is left uncorrected," Mr. Frank said. "The 1996 law has ruined families, destroyed lives and inflicted pain on innocent children."
The legislation passed tonight provides $35 billion over five years to improve coverage for Medicare beneficiaries and to increase payments to hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes and managed care plans. Lawmakers of both parties said they hoped the higher payments would stem the exodus of H.M.O.'s from Medicare.
Under the bill, people with Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, could immediately qualify for Medicare coverage, without having to wait 24 months as required under current law.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said the bill included $1.6 billion over the next five years for health programs and providers in New York. That includes $751 million for New York hospitals, especially teaching hospitals and small rural hospitals; $800 million for children's health insurance; and $116 million for H.M.O.'s.
The bill will make it easier for children in low-income families to get health benefits through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, created by Congress in 1997. Many uninsured children are eligible for those programs but not enrolled. Under the bill, states could enroll children at schools, child support enforcement agencies, homeless shelters and other sites.
The measure guarantees that people leaving welfare for work will be able to keep their Medicaid coverage for 12 months. A law authorizing such coverage was due to expire on Sept. 30 next year.

HEADLINE: Oil Patch Is Coming Back to Life As Natural Gas Prices Set Record

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: WOODWARD, Okla.

 BODY:
No Lear jets are parked at the local airstrip anymore. The toys of the oil boom days disappeared when prices collapsed nearly two decades ago. Only the wild memories remain, like the time one oilman flew his friends to New Orleans for lunch because he wanted fresh oysters.
The bust destroyed every corner of the beleaguered oil patch, from West Texas through Oklahoma into southern Kansas, but it never quite killed the hope that the good times would come again. There was even a bumper sticker that pleaded, "Dear God, please give me another oil boom and I promise" not to blow it all this time around. 
 Their prayers may now be answered.
With winter approaching and natural gas prices hitting all-time highs in December, the oil patch is coming alive again. The rest of the country is probably not celebrating the rise in natural gas prices, since energy officials are predicting 50 percent increases in home heating bills. But many people here believe that the nation's growing appetite for natural gas is reviving an area once left for dead.
"I don't know how long it will last," said A. J. Jacques, whose company, Cheyenne Drilling, is operating at full capacity, "but it's the closest I've seen to a boom in 20 years."
Even as people here are daring to be optimistic, the memories of the bust temper any premature exuberance. The days of highflying, conspicuous consumption are remembered fondly, yet no one expects to see them again.
But the brick storefronts on Main Street are nearly all occupied. Many of the trucks and cars parked outside are new. For now, that is more than good enough.
"There have been some lessons learned," said Rodney Myers, a vice president with the Apache Corporation, one of the nation's largest independent oil companies, which is aggressively exploring for natural gas outside Woodward. "I don't think we're at a point in time where people are buying helicopters or ranches or taking big trips to Las Vegas with their 57 best friends."
No one is saying -- yet -- that this could rival the crazy boom days of the late 1970's and early 1980's, when a peak of more than 4,500 drilling rigs operated in the United States. Then, the derricks were searching primarily for oil. Now, many of those same derricks are drilling again, this time for natural gas. Since January, the price of natural gas has quadrupled, in part to meet the demands of a new generation of electrical plants that run on gas, which is considered a "clean" fuel.
Until recently, the price of natural gas was so cheap that companies could not justify drilling new wells. Now, with some experts predicting that production will need to increase by 25 percent to meet demand, the number of rotary rigs operating in the United States has more than doubled in the past 18 months, to 1,090, more than 800 of them in search of natural gas.
In Kansas, the number of drilling permits has nearly doubled in the past year. Employment in the Texas oil field town of Odessa has increased by almost 6 percent in the last three months. Here in Woodward, oil field equipment once sat rusting like junked cars. Now every drilling rig for miles is booked in advance. Roughnecks are in such demand that some companies have raised salaries from about $11 an hour to more than $16.
"I can't keep but thinking that we're going to have at least two to five years of good times," said Kerri D. Martin, president of Diamond Services Company, which has seen gross revenues nearly double in the past year. "I can't see any reason it's going to go south."
Bill Gilmer, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said the level of domestic activity was the highest in a decade. For the most part, huge multinational companies like Exxon Mobil have largely left the oil patch to concentrate on larger, more lucrative fields overseas. But rising gas prices have attracted independent producers like Apache and others.
"They are making a ton of money," Mr. Gilmer said. And the money is trickling down. Service companies in towns like Woodward or Elk City, Okla., or Perryton, Tex., are thriving.
Inside his shiny new pickup truck, Bobby Alexander drove through the huge, brown prairies of the Oklahoma panhandle last week. In the distance stood a derrick, then a mile or so later, there was another one and then another. Mr. Alexander began as a roughneck in the 1970's but left the oil business in 1986 at the very bottom of the bust.
In February, though, he bought into Cheyenne Drilling with Mr. Jacques, and his timing has been impeccable. All 12 of Cheyenne's drilling rigs are under lease by production companies. Only last year, the price of natural gas was less than $2 per million British thermal units. This month, the price went higher than $9 before falling slightly.
"We had no idea that prices were going to go like they are," Mr. Alexander said, smiling as he drove. He said companies were optimistic that they could be profitable even if prices fell to half the current level. "It looks like this could last a little bit longer."
In the late 1970's and the early 1980's, the high price of oil attracted thousands of people from Missouri and Louisiana, all looking for work. They slept under bridges or in tents at the nearby state park. Money seemed to be everywhere. At the height of the boom, more than 100 aircraft were based at the tiny local airstrip, quite a fleet for a town of less than 20,000 people.
"We had a pretty good Air Force for a while," Mr. Alexander said.
But everything began collapsing in 1983 when the combination of bad bank loans and plummeting prices crushed the oil economy. The migrants who had come to work in the oil fields disappeared, almost overnight. The town went years without issuing a permit for a new building or home.
"Our city budget went from about $10 million to about $3.5 million in four and a half years," said Dr. John Hawkins, an optometrist who serves as the town's part-time mayor. Now, he reports, local sales tax receipts have risen steadily all year, a reflection of improving times.
It is the memories of those hard times that are shaping the more restrained attitudes today toward the record natural gas prices. There is a stubborn pride shared by those who survived. For years, Mr. Jacques, of Cheyenne Drilling, scoured auctions and junkyards to piece together the equipment to build drilling rigs and stay in business.
Mr. Martin, 41, the president of Diamond Services, need only consult with his father, Kenneth (Buster) Martin, who once placed his last $25,000 on his banker's desk as collateral to keep the company running. The senior Mr. Martin cut wages, sold equipment for 20 cents on the dollar and recalled that his company survived literally week to week.
"No one knows what depressed is," the senior Mr. Martin recalled. "I got up depressed in the 80's. And I went to bed depressed."
The younger Mr. Martin added: "He keeps me pretty well grounded. I'm more of a go, go, go type. He keeps me in check."
The most immediate problem is finding enough workers. Many people are reluctant to return to the boom-and-bust oil economy, particularly at a time when jobs are plentiful in other sectors of the economy. "You almost feel like you're recruiting for a pro team," the younger Mr. Martin said of competition for new employees. "There are some companies I've heard that have a sign-on bonus."
One old-timer who may be unable to resist the promise of more good times is J. D. Hodges, now 63. Before the bust, Mr. Hodges owned a helicopter that he landed on a pad atop his office building. He also bought a Lear jet with a crew, and was known to take friends on impromptu trips to New Orleans and Las Vegas when the mood struck. He lost it all in the bust, then re-emerged in the trucking business. In recent days he bought a drilling rig.
He has not decided whether he will sell the rig for a profit or go back into business himself.
"Natural gas is in vogue and it will be for decades to come," he predicted.
As yet, everyone is optimistic but maybe not ready to buy a Lear. There is a custom-made motorcycle in the window of Cycle City, a local Harley Davidson store. It is painted orange and costs $60,000.
The buyer, by the way, is in the oil and gas industry.

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
TURKEY: OCALAN PLEA
The European Court of Human Rights will hear an appeal brought against Turkey by the jailed Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan, 51, and his lawyers said he would make a broad defense of his actions on historical and political grounds. The court said he would be tried next year before 17 judges. Douglas Frantz (NYT) 

NORTHERN IRELAND: PROTESTANT PACT
Protestant guerrillas signed a statement calling off an internal feud in the Belfast area that had taken seven lives and forced 200 families from their homes. Two paramilitary groups were pitted against each other in what the police said was a dispute involving drug-dealing, turf wars and bad feeling among leaders. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: SINN FEIN CASE
The High Court in Belfast said it would rule next month on a legal challenge by Sinn Fein, the political wing of the I.R.A., to a decision by the Assembly's first minister, David Trimble, to ban its ministers from meetings with their counterparts in the Irish government. Mr. Trimble acted to placate critics within his Ulster Unionist Party who want to pull out of government with Sinn Fein to protest the I.R.A.'s refusal to begin disarming. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: MOVE ON MEDIA TYCOON
Tax officials went to court to seize the media empire of Vladimir Gusinsky, the tycoon under arrest in Spain on what the Kremlin says are fraud charges and he says is a political vendetta. Tax officials said the Gusinsky empire is insolvent. Mr. Gusinsky called it another effort by President Vladimir V. Putin to silence powerful critics, including him. Michael Wines (NYT)
 
BOSNIA: YUGOSLAV TIES
Yugoslavia and Bosnia established diplomatic relations, ending eight years of enmity after the breakup of the Yugoslav federation and a three-year war in Bosnia. The countries' foreign ministers signed a protocol in Belgrade, declaring that the step would ensure that war would no longer be possible in the region. Carlotta Gall (NYT)
 
SPAIN: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT NUMBERS QUADRUPLE
The number of illegal immigrants detained while trying to enter Spain from Morocco has quadrupled this year compared with 1999, officials said. More than 3,500 people, mostly Moroccans and sub-Saharan Africans, were arrested last year in Spanish waters or on the southern coast, and almost 15,000 have been detained so far this year. Benjamin Jones (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
SAUDI ARABIA: AMERICAN NOT SOLE SUSPECT
An American citizen arrested last week is just one of several suspects in an explosion that killed a British man in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 17 and has not been firmly linked to the blast, the official news agency reported. An unidentified Interior Ministry official, quoted by the Saudi Press Agency, said earlier statements about a proven link between Michael Sedlak and the explosion were unfounded. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: PORNOGRAPHY RULING
The Supreme Court ruled that restrictions on importing hard-core pornography, including homosexual erotica, were constitutionally legitimate infringements on freedom of expression. But it also declared that customs officials had unfairly singled out homosexual pornography as opposed to heterosexual material, and it struck down one section of the Customs Act to put the onus of proof on the government, not the importer. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
KOREAS: CONTENTIOUS TALKS
South and North Korea agreed to open a high-level economic dialogue this month to discuss rebuilding the North's dilapidated economy and providing it with electricity. The last-minute agreement followed four days of talks, the most contentious discussions between the countries since their leaders agreed to work toward reconciliation. The two sides had argued over how the South should help ease the North's electricity shortages. (AP)
 
NORTH KOREA: TIES TO SPAIN
Madrid will establish diplomatic relations with North Korea in an effort to assist "the process of reconciliation and normalization on the Korean peninsula," officials said. The move follows a decision by a number of European nations, including Britain, Austria and Germany, to set up formal ties with the Communist state. Benjamin Jones (NYT)
 
PHILIPPINES: CONFLICTING TESTIMONY
President Joseph Estrada and his chief accuser made directly contradictory statements about a $100,000 check that is a key document in Mr. Estrada's impeachment trial. The president said that an American consultant working for him accepted the check but that he was unaware the money came from illegal gambling lords. But Luis Singson, a provincial governor, charged that he gave the check to Mr. Estrada and that the president knew it was gambling money. (AP)
 
INDIA: BEAUTY PAGEANTS BANNED
The head of Uttar Pradesh banned beauty contests, saying they violated traditional culture. His move follows a wave of success by Indian women in beauty pageants abroad, prompting dozens of competitions to spring up in India. "There is no place for vulgarity in our society," said Rajnath Singh of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. "We must uphold traditional social values, which do not permit this kind of vulgar display of beauty." (Reuters)
 
AFRICA
 
CONGO: KABILA AGREES TO TALKS
President Laurent Kabila of Congo has agreed to meet with his political opponents, armed and unarmed, in Libreville, Gabon, on Dec. 21 and 22, the Congolese foreign minister, Leonard She Okitundu, said at the United Nations. Mr. She Okitundu said the government had released all political prisoners in advance of the meeting, but did not give a number or the names of those freed. The Congolese are campaigning to keep the United Nations actively involved in Congo. Barbara Crossette (NYT)

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Climb a Bit As Factory Production Slows

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Declining costs of apparel and computers kept consumer prices from accelerating in November, while industrial production fell for a second consecutive month, government data showed today. The reports added to expectations that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates as early as next month.
"The inflation threat clearly seems to be fading as the economy cools," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston. 
 The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, matching the gain in October, the Labor Department said. The rise matched analysts' expectations.
A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that production at factories, mines and utilities fell 0.2 percent in November after a 0.1 percent decline in October, the first back-to-back declines since mid-1998, when a strike at General Motors forced automakers and parts suppliers to shut down for 54 days. Analysts had expected no change.
The core consumer price rate, which excludes energy and food, rose 0.3 percent in November after a 0.2 percent rise the previous month. Excluding the biggest rise in tobacco prices since April, the core rate would have risen 0.2 percent.
"There really wasn't any pressure anywhere except in tobacco prices," said Tim Rogers, chief economist at Briefing.com, a market analysis company in Boston. "The pressure down the road is weakening," he added. "Few expect inflation to accelerate here."
The primary inflation threat this year has been energy prices. Though crude oil costs are showing signs of falling, natural gas prices are close to a record. The Labor Department's statistics showed energy prices, which account for about a tenth of the index, rose 0.1 percent in November, the smallest increase since August. The price of crude oil, which in September rose to a 10-year high of $37.20 a barrel, has stayed below $30 a barrel for the last 10 days.
The price of clothing fell 0.4 percent in November after rising 0.3 percent in October. Personal computer prices fell 2.6 percent in November after falling 1.5 percent in each of the prior two months.
The industrial production report showed manufacturing output fell 0.5 percent in November, the steepest drop since June 1998. Capacity utilization, which measures how close to full output factories, mines and utilities are operating, fell to 81.6 percent from 82.1 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 43RD PRESIDENT: THE PRESIDENT-ELECT;
SAYING DOWNTURN IS POSSIBLE, BUSH TRUMPETS TAX CUT

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 15

 BODY:
George W. Bush said today that he was concerned about a "possible slowdown" in the economy and called the change in the economic outlook an argument for going forward next year with his campaign proposal for a sweeping, $1.3 trillion tax cut across a decade.
Mr. Bush, who is to be sworn into office in January as the 43rd president, touched on the economy as he sat next to Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, in front of a garland-bedecked fireplace in the Texas Governor's Mansion and before an array of cameras. 
 Mr. Bush said that Mr. Breaux had made clear that he did not want to leave the Senate to serve in the president-elect's new cabinet. But with Mr. Breaux's presence giving Mr. Bush an aura of bipartisanship, he went on to praise Mr. Breaux, who is known on Capitol Hill as a deal-maker who can swim against the partisan tides. "John Breaux has got the attitude that I have," Mr. Bush said, "that when you put your country ahead of party politics, it's amazing what can get done."
Mr. Bush also indicated that he would name his first cabinet nominee on Saturday at a school in Crawford, Tex., where he has a ranch. Members of Congress and Bush advisers said that the nominee would be retired Gen. Colin L. Powell as secretary of state.
Asked to confirm that Mr. Powell would be named, Mr. Bush smiled. "There's a lot of rumors," he said, "and there's going to be a lot of rumors between now and when I name my cabinet. I would hope people would give me the benefit of allowing me to name the person on our own timetable."
He added, "I think America will be pleased with the choice."
Mr. Bush spoke about the economy and his tax-cut proposal a day after the speaker of the House, Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, publicly counseled that tax relief would be better handled in small bites, with tax cuts passed step by step and piece by piece. Clarifying his comments today, Mr. Hastert said he supported Mr. Bush's sweeping plan, and merely felt it would be easier to enact a bit at a time.
While it is unusual for a president to speak about a slowdown for fear of rattling financial markets, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, have repeatedly struck similar themes for several weeks. Their outspokenness now not only helps to make the case for a tax cut, but could also inoculate them from responsibility for any possible recession by assigning it as the legacy of the Clinton administration.
Today, Mr. Bush cited troubles in manufacturing and automobile sales, high energy prices and jittery financial markets in explaining "my concerns about a possible slowdown." He said that such potential indicators of a robust economy running out of steam were "one of the reasons I feel so strongly about the need to reduce marginal rates in our tax cut." And he said, "I look forward to going to Washington to make the case that the plan that the people heard in America is the plan that I hope to get passed."
The staged appearances -- Mr. Breaux one day, Mr. Powell the next -- are being choreographed by the president-elect and his aides to send a message of reconciliation after a divisive election which he narrowly won in electoral votes while losing the popular vote.
One adviser to Mr. Bush said Mr. Powell, who was born in Harlem as the son of Jamaican immigrants and rose to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would be named first because his presence would send several important signals. The adviser said that Mr. Powell's appointment would be comforting to foreign leaders and would be a sign of inclusiveness to blacks who voted for Vice President Al Gore.
After his transition planning was slowed for five weeks by the dispute in resolving the presidential election, Mr. Bush is now racing to assemble his cabinet and determine his policy priorities, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill warn that the narrow margin of Republican control in the House and the 50-50 split in the Senate will require huge efforts to build coalitions.
The tax-cut proposal was one of the clear dividing lines in the campaign just ended. Mr. Gore proposed only $500 billion in tax cuts, most of them for specific needs, like a college education or retirement savings. Most Democrats oppose cuts of the magnitude proposed by Mr. Bush.
In Texas, when he first came into office as governor in 1995, Mr. Bush quickly struck up a relationship with Bob Bullock, then the Democratic lieutenant governor. Many have wondered who Mr. Bush's Bob Bullock might be in Washington. The signs today were that it could be Mr. Breaux, who thanked Mr. Bush "for the opportunity to have some real good discussions."
"I am so honored that he would come," Mr. Bush said. "He's a practical man and he's got common sense." He said the two men had discussed health care issues and education and that Mr. Breaux had given "his commitment to work with me."
Though Mr. Bush is aching to put at least one Democrat in his cabinet, it was not clear whether he had actually offered a job to Mr. Breaux. If Mr. Breaux left the Senate, Louisiana's Republican governor would most likely name a Republican in his place, ending the 50-50 split.
"The senator made it clear he wants to stay in the Senate," Mr. Bush said.
The president-elect, however, made progress on other fronts. One adviser said that Mr. Bush was prepared to name a justice of the Texas Supreme Court, Alberto Gonzales, to be his White House counsel, filing out his White House staff. Mr. Gonzales, 45, a former corporate lawyer with a degree from Harvard, served as general counsel early in Mr. Bush's governorship. Mr. Bush then named him as the Texas secretary of state and then to a vacancy on the court.
Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, confirmed that Mr. Bush had discussions with Mr. Gonzales, but said Mr. Bush had not made a final decision. Officials said Mr. Bush's announcement of a White House team -- including Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser -- was expected on Sunday.
Mr. Bush said he hoped to have his cabinet named within "a couple of weeks."
For the first time today, a senior Bush transition official said that as the president-elect searches for a Treasury secretary, he would not limit himself to Wall Street.
The official said, "President-elect Bush's approach is to look at a number of places. We're looking at Wall Street. We're looking at the Hill. We're looking at think tanks. We're looking at Wall Street, but it's certainly not limited to Wall Street."
Mr. Bush's appearance today was the first time he spoke to reporters since Mr. Gore conceded on Wednesday night.
Asked to describe how he felt, Mr. Bush said, "I didn't sleep that well that night." He then spoke almost in awe of the calls of congratulations coming in one after another on Wednesday from foreign leaders.
"The great responsibilities of the job," he said, "are, you know, very evident."

HEADLINE: Move Possible For Garden (But Where?)

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Even as New York City proposes to build an Olympic stadium over the West Side rail yards, quiet negotiations are under way to move Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers to a different site, on Ninth Avenue and 31st Street.
The proposal by Cablevision Systems, owner of the two New York teams, is only the latest example of how real estate developers and team owners are hungrily making plans for the manufacturing district and rail yards on the far West Side of Manhattan, as they have done for nearly 80 years, ever since Col. Jacob Ruppert sought unsuccessfully to build a stadium for the Yankees there. 
 Next door, at Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street, real estate executives say, the investor Harvey Schulweis and the developer Jerry I. Speyer are negotiating with the National Basketball Association to build a 1 million-square-foot office tower that would house the association's film studios, now in New Jersey.
And farther west, Robert Wood Johnson IV, who bought the New York Jets earlier this year for $635 million, wants to build a billion-dollar football stadium and annex to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center over the vast Long Island Rail Road yards. The project, said Jay Cross, president of Jets Development, makes sense either on its own, or as part of New York's bid to play host to the Summer Olympics in 2012.
It is unclear whether the Olympic proposal (which also includes a proposed Garden site), the Jets stadium, a rebuilt Garden on Ninth Avenue, the N.B.A. complex or any other development now in the planning stages will ever be built. But with the city's economy booming and vacant office space virtually nonexistent, the relatively low-scale far West Side of Manhattan from 42nd Street south to 28th Street is once again in play.
"It's clearly the next development zone in the city because of its proximity to a major transportation hub and the lack of major sites in Midtown," said Richard B. Clark, president of Brookfield Financial Properties, which owns a site at the northwest corner of Ninth Avenue and 31st Street.
The emerging issue is exactly how the development will take place -- willy-nilly, or as part of a master plan. The Olympic proposal includes rail links and an extension of the No. 7 subway line south from Times Square, a domed stadium that would be converted for use by the Jets, and a site for a relocated Madison Square Garden on 10th Avenue. The Olympic bid has the support of the mayor and the governor and dovetails with a proposal by New York's Department of City Planning to rezone the manufacturing district west of 10th Avenue, between 28th and 42nd Streets, to allow a forest of skyscrapers.
But members of the local community board and the South Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association complain that a highly subsidized stadium is of dubious economic value, while acknowledging that perhaps the convention center does need to expand to attract major conventions.
Ross Graham, a member of the community board, said she favored a more comprehensive planning effort that would include affordable housing, parks, some office development and the preservation of the area's light manufacturing companies.
Then there are builders who say that development will inevitably march onto the West Side, even if proposals for rezoning, the Garden and the Olympics fade away.
"The folks talking about stadiums and everything else are going to be out of office in a year," said Jules Demchick, president of J. D. Carlyle Development, which is building a large 43-story, mixed-use project between 33rd and 34th Streets, west of Eighth Avenue. "Government has to focus on public transportation over there and development will follow, without any additional help. There's nowhere else on the island to go."
According to several real estate brokers, the N.B.A. is talking to Mr. Schulweis about a development on his site, at Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street, which is already zoned for a 33-story tower. Mr. Schulweis would say only that "the city is rampant with rumors."
Mr. Clark of Brookfield Properties, whose site is next door to Mr. Schulweis's site, was equally taciturn. Although the Olympic plan includes a new site for Madison Square Garden, Cablevision is seriously considering the Brookfield site instead, according to real estate executives.
The site is opposite the James A. Farley General Post Office, which is to become a new version of the old Pennsylvania Station, torn down in the 1960's to make way for the current Garden. A rebuilt Garden on the Brookfield site would be a block from the hub of subways and commuter trains on Seventh Avenue, where the old Garden would be demolished to make way for two new skyscrapers.
Unlike the Olympic site between 10th and 12th Avenues, it would not require the building of a new subway line. Brookfield, however, would need to acquire Mr. Schulweis's parcel to create a new Garden.
A spokesman for the Garden said no decision had been made, but Cablevision has hired a consultant to explore whether to move to a new location or renovate the existing structure.
All of the proposals now surfacing are an echo of earlier schemes to develop over what was once known as New York Central Railroad's 30th Street Yard, a network of freight tracks that stretched north to 37th Street.
Ousted from the Polo Grounds by the New York Giants in 1922, the suddenly popular Yankees sought to cut a quick deal to build a new stadium over the rail lines. But Colonel Ruppert's plan was scuttled by the War Department, which had reserved the yards for antiaircraft gun emplacements. The Yankees headed to the Bronx.
Beginning in the 1930's, there were efforts to cover over most of the rail yards and build warehouses and factories on top. Richard Ravitch, a builder who later became chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, erected the Westyard Distribution Center in 1967 on 10th Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets. In the early 1980's, the state built the Javits center over another part of the yards.
When the M.T.A. took over the rail yards in the early 1980's, Mr. Ravitch said, he made sure that it was possible to build pillars between the newly reconfigured tracks for a platform that would support office towers, hotels and apartment buildings. "There was a lot of interest in those air rights," he said.
In 1982, Gulf and Western Industries came calling. The company, which then owned the Garden, was threatening to move the Rangers to New Jersey and the Knicks to Long Island, but wanted to know if it could build a smaller new arena at 12th Avenue. It ultimately agreed to stay put after Mayor Edward I. Koch granted a property tax break now worth more than $125 million.
The issue surfaced again in 1988 when Paul Reichman, the Canadian real estate tycoon who was then the largest commercial landlord in Manhattan, quietly put together a $2.5 billion plan to move the Garden to 12th Avenue and build eight million square feet of office space on Seventh and Ninth Avenues.
At the same time, Mr. Schulweis was planning his nearby office tower; Harry Macklowe, a developer, got approval to build an office building a block away; Julien J. Studley and Arthur Cohen wanted to build a 1,560-room hotel on a pier across from the convention center, and Arthur Imperatore proposed a residential tower on 36th Street. None of the projects survived the recession of the early 1990's.
But the M.T.A. did develop a master plan in 1989 that envisioned a seven-block development over the 30 acres of rail yards, with proceeds from the sale of development rights going to transit programs. The plan depicts a series of residential towers facing 12th Avenue and the Hudson River, with office towers on 11th Avenue and retail on 10th. In the 1990's, there was talk of the Yankees moving to a West Side stadium, but there was widespread opposition.
Still, the developers remain optimistic. "It's only a matter of time before the West Side opens up," Mr. Schulweis said.

Starks Thrives At Garden

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
Hearing his name in association with the new team still puzzles him sometimes.
" 'John Starks of the Utah Jazz' -- it does sound funny, doesn't it?" said the player who wanted to remain a Knick for life. 
 All last season, Starks campaigned to return to his former team. Whether he was asking to be waived by Chicago or playing for the league minimum, the most popular role player in franchise history would have loved to play one more game in orange and blue.
In retrospect, he understands now how a guard-dominated team did not need him. And perhaps showing he is no longer a few fries short of a Happy Meal, Starks's decision to join John Stockton and Karl Malone in the Western Conference has proved to be a stroke of brilliance.
Last night, showing the same heart that won the soul of Madison Square Garden for eight seasons, Starks also brought his streaky jump shot. He was on, dumping in a team-high 18 points on an economical 7-of-13 night from the field.
Gone was the shooter whose career seemed destined for a bad end at Golden State. Returning was the emotional player who put his index finger next to his lips, quieting a smiling and reflective Spike Lee after dropping in a 3-pointer from the right wing.
Sometimes locked in a one-on-one duel with his good friend Allan Houston, Starks found one of many sieves in New York's defense and contributed mightily to one of the worst Knick losses at home in recent memory, an 89-58 shellacking.
"I think I know a little bit about the Garden," Starks said after the Jazz improved to 17-6. "The shot felt good. The guys did a good job of finding me. I just had my mind clear to get up and shoot the basketball."
It is too early in the season for him to pass judgment on these Knicks, he said, adding that he thought Larry Johnson's absence because of injury hurt the team. Better than most people, Starks knew the feeling of playing poorly in front of a fed-up Garden crowd and did not want to rub salt on the Knicks' wound.
Asked about how Coach Jeff Van Gundy was coping, he said: "I know he's disappointed. He would like a little bit more out of that. To only score 58 points is kind of tough. But this team is going to bounce back."
In Salt Lake City, Starks has weathered the snow, the traffic lights that never seem to change and a town that closes down about 10 p.m. on Fridays.
Starks said he speaks to Patrick Ewing about once a week, offering him the same moral support that Ewing offered him when Starks was exiled to Golden State in the trade for Latrell Sprewell almost two years ago.
"I think about all the old Knicks," Starks said. "It's like, 'Where are they now?' I crack up about that all the time, especially when I see Patrick in that Seattle uniform. It just doesn't look right.
"He called me and talked about how it rained all the time. I told him, 'You better watch out, Big Fella, you're going to get depressed out there. You're going to take up drinking.' He just laughed."
An elderly woman who lives in the same Utah apartment complex as Starks leaves newspaper clippings on his doormat each morning. A Jazz loyalist approached him recently and said: "I hated you when you were on New York. But I love you now. You got so much heart."
His boyish features still make Starks, 35, look as if he is about to turn 20.
And on certain nights, he still has the energy of his youth, if not the vertical leap. When he is spotting up behind the arc as he did last night at the Garden, it seems as if Starks never grows old.

That Dazed Feeling on Insurance Prices

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
IS it time to renew your car insurance? Nowadays, the advice to comparison-shop makes more sense than ever.
Prices for the same coverage typically differ by as much as several hundred dollars from one company to the next. Now rates are rising in general, and many discounts are being discarded while new ones are being offered. And some major insurers have started adjusting prices based on the safety performance of vehicles. 
 Some drivers of big cars and sport utility vehicles that can heavily damage lighter cars in accidents can expect to pay more for liability coverage than drivers of smaller cars. However, owners of those large vehicles may pay less for personal injury and other medical coverage because their passengers are generally better protected.
"At no time in recent history have so many things been happening that can affect what you pay for auto insurance," said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, an insurance trade group based in New York.
By shopping, consumers can make the changes pay off. But it takes work -- in many cases, more work than most people put into pricing and buying a new car. There are hundreds of insurance companies and, even with the Internet, no single place, like the Kelley Blue Book for car values, to find the best deal among the myriad combinations of rates.
Consider a 35-year-old man in Brooklyn with a 2000-model four-door Ford Taurus LX and a good driving record. The state minimum required coverage, which includes liability and personal injury protection, can cost as much as $1,294 annually at Atlantic Mutual or as little as $787 at the Erie Insurance Group, according to the New York State Insurance Department. (State insurance departments are good places to start the shopping process.)
But when collision and comprehensive coverages are added -- mandatory for any vehicle bought on credit -- Atlantic Mutual's total annual cost rises to $3,634 and Erie's reaches $3,644. That gives Atlantic Mutual, which at first seemed to be more expensive, the better price by $10.
That is hardly the end of it. Liability and personal injury coverage are often increased as protection against lawsuits. To raise liability coverage for injuries to another car's occupants to, say, $300,000, from the $50,000 minimum, Atlantic Mutual adds $402 and Erie $219. Atlantic Mutual charges $22 to increase the liability coverage for damage to another driver's car to $50,000 -- from the $10,000 minimum -- while Erie charges $24. To increase personal injury coverage for the policyholder to $100,000 -- from the $50,000 minimum -- Atlantic Mutual charges $14 and Erie $11. For the whole package, Erie's coverage comes to $3,898, versus $4,072 for Atlantic's.
The prices published by state insurance departments, the regulators say, are merely intended as a rough guide.
The next step, experts suggest, is the Internet. At Web sites like Insweb.com and Quotesmith.com, consumers can receive comparative price quotations from about a half-dozen companies. Actual prices can vary, because Internet users often misunderstand or deliberately give false answers (like not disclosing a speeding ticket) to the questions used to calculate premium costs. Still, the Internet prices are generally more refined than the regulators' guides.
Insweb does not sell insurance directly on the Web but connects customers to an agent. Most insurance experts suggest that consumers contact two or three agents -- representatives of single companies and those who offer policies from several companies, before closing a deal.
Few people, though, shop so intently. In fact, experts estimate that the vast majority of auto insurance customers do no shopping at all. Many people assume that all auto insurance costs about the same, so they buy from the first agent they call. Indeed, since insurance is regulated, there is no bargaining in most states.
While price is important, most people also want a company that is fair, if not generous, with claims. A ranking of insurance companies by complaints is available from state insurance departments. Of course, friends and neighbors are often very willing to talk about their experiences, too.
What makes the latest pricing changes so tricky for a consumer is that they are not uniform. So far, the only major companies setting prices on safety performance by make and model are Allstate, the nation's second-largest auto insurer, and Progressive, which is fourth. Both companies, as well as State Farm, are using that approach for personal injury and other medical coverage.
Progressive led the way with this pricing years ago when it was a small company selling coverage for so-called nonstandard drivers who had been rejected or canceled by other insurers. Then, its pricing practices affected a small percentage of drivers. But in the last few years, the company has expanded rapidly into the broader auto insurance market.
The Farmers Insurance Group, the third-largest auto insurer, says it will begin pricing based on safety performance by make and model next year, and analysts say most companies are likely to follow suit eventually. But for now, most companies are still averaging the cost of liability and personal injury claims across all the vehicles they insure. And that creates an opportunity for smart shoppers.
According to Mr. Hartwig's calculations, overall auto insurance costs are expected to rise by an average of 2 percent to 4 percent in the coming year, to reflect rising costs for medical treatment and repairs. But some companies may raise prices much more while others hold the line, again creating opportunities for smart shoppers.
Many consumer advocates praised the shift to pricing by make and model safety performance for its fairness, as drivers who cost the insurance companies the most will pay the most. But analysts say the insurance companies were largely motivated by the prospect of gaining market share through price differentiation.
THE insurers are also taking a closer look at the bottom line when it comes to discounts. They want to attract more customers, Mr. Hartwig said, but they are increasingly willing to give discounts only to people who actually have fewer claims. For example, he said, some companies are eliminating blanket discounts for all older drivers and replacing them with discounts for only those who complete a defensive-driving course.
State Farm is trying out a discount of up to 30 percent in Arizona and Maryland for drivers under 25 who complete a 60-day driver-safety program. Many companies give discounts to customers who also insure their homes or other cars.
There are other ways to save money. Consumers can increase the deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage to the maximum, which is often $2,000, so that they would pay for the first $2,000 in losses. They may also drop collision and comprehensive coverage altogether as their car ages and its resale value declines.
The choice of car also affects rates. The more expensive the vehicle, the more it usually costs to repair or replace and, therefore, to insure. The new pricing based on safety performance may add or subtract just a few dollars or as much as $150 or so, probably not enough to determine which car you drive. (On the other hand, the insurance company's vehicle safety ratings may be an important consideration.)
The price of auto insurance varies because insurers' expenses vary and because they come up with different analyses of the risks presented by similar drivers. So why don't the insurance companies just say what kind of customers they prefer and let the others look elsewhere? Mr. Hartwig says the answer is that "most large insurers want to insure everyone."
"They don't want to discourage you in any way," he said, "because more than likely they have a policy they can offer you, whether you've got a clean driving record or a horrible one."

HEADLINE: Catching Up With Mr. Cuomo

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
I WOULD have liked to have been a justice of the Supreme Court for one case, yes," Mario M. Cuomo said. "It would have been this case."
Mr. Cuomo -- son of a ditch digger, three-term governor and never quite presidential candidate -- was boiling mad. He rejected a seat on the United States Supreme Court, he has said, because he feared it would be the equivalent of having his tongue cut out. He wanted to speak out freely on the issues. 
 Speak out he has. As the world stared in fascination, disbelief and not a little disgust at America's marathon election drama, his bullet-shaped head became a staple on television as he was approached by stations from upstate New York to the British Broadcasting Corporation. To Mr. Cuomo, 68 (and still playing a mean game of basketball), the drama is evidence of an ever fiercer level of partisanship by Republicans. He likens it to the way they pounded on his 20 vetoes of death penalty legislation to beat him in 1994.
"They are ugly people, and they behave in ugly ways," he said.
He doubts that anyone could have swayed the five justices opposed to a recount. But he said he felt energized, not discouraged, by the court's ruling.
"The game is now more exciting than ever," he told his wife, Matilda, at 1 a.m. Wednesday.
She replied, "You're impossible."
He said: "Thanks a lot, sweetheart. Goodnight."
Political passions still run high in this child of illiterate parents, who was rejected by the city's elite law firms because two summa cum laude degrees were canceled out by his Italian background, who went on to fight for the underdog in Queens and then held high state office for 20 years. Along the way he made a speech or two, including the stirring address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention. A generation of New Yorkers learned to love or loathe but never ignore him.
Still, some things have changed. The Cuomos live on Sutton Place South; he glides around Manhattan in black cars; he has a majestic view of Manhattan from his law office window, and he says almost all his legal colleagues are Republicans. Once known for never leaving Albany, he now travels often to Europe. He no longer commits thoughts to his famous diary. His Queens roots, which once loomed like Lincoln's log cabin, seem now as distant as the view from his apartment window.
In 1995, his superb voice touched souls at the funeral of his beloved 92-year-old mother, Immaculata. Then he went straight back to his office at Wilkie Farr & Gallagher to put in some billable hours.
Sometimes he doesn't even sound like a liberal. "I'm representing wealthy people, trying to make them wealthier," he said.
Mr. Cuomo's world turned upside down around 9 p.m. on Nov. 8, 1994, when he knew for sure that he had lost his bid for a fourth term as governor, losing to George E. Pataki. A realization hit him.
"I have no home, I have no job, I have no money," he thought. At 1:30 a.m., in the pitch darkness over the Hudson River, the helicopter taking him back to Albany dipped sharply, and the governor remembered something else: he had only $200,000 in life insurance.
"I got to thinking that if the plane had gone, Matilda would have had to live with one of the kids because I didn't have any money," he said. "How could I get myself into this predicament?"
The short answer was that he had been busy with a succession of state offices, being secretary of state and lieutenant governor before winning the top job in 1982. Unlike previous secretaries of state, he had given up his law practice, and he declined gubernatorial pay raises.
The long answer was that he had been on a crusade to preach his vision of a "sweeter" -- his favorite adjective -- America, in which people look after one another and the government cares. His foes saw only a prima donna on an awesome ego trip, a self-involved Hamlet on the Hudson, but his eloquent speeches roused people in ways politicians seldom do anymore.
Then he lost. Maybe New Yorkers were tired of him, or regarded his quest for a fourth term as plain greedy. Maybe most agreed with the victor, Mr. Pataki, that New York State taxes were too high. Even Democrats criticized his failure to build a stronger party.
But Mr. Cuomo drew solace from Election Day exit polls showing that 60 percent of New Yorkers thought him "a man of great integrity who cares about me." He is not shy in offering excuses for his loss: the lingering effect of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's taxes, President Reagan's budget cuts, the recession of the early 90's.
A few days after the election, the phone rang and on the other end was the unmistakable bray of former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
"Mario, do not be depressed," Mr. Koch said. "There is life after death. Look at me, and you will do everything I'm doing and more."
Like Mr. Koch, Mr. Cuomo now works as a lawyer, writes articles for New York newspapers and has a radio show. The show, "Me and Mario" (broadcast on WAMC in Albany and carried by 46 stations), features Mr. Cuomo and the radio host Alan Chartock discussing issues from baseball to the definition of Judaism to the death of Mr. Cuomo's dog, Ginger.
Mr. Koch and Mr. Cuomo both wrote children's books, but Mr. Cuomo's was published. "The Blue Spruce" (Sleeping Bear Press, 1999), an adaptation of an article he had written for Reader's Digest, is the inspirational tale of a father and son struggling to push a fallen tree back into place.
But Mr. Cuomo, who always had a question for every answer, is still driven by political passions. He travels America giving 50 speeches a year, often to business audiences, refining a message that has become increasingly spiritual. "The truth is that God made the world, but didn't finish it," he says, citing Jewish scripture. "Your job is to finish it."
His son Andrew, the secretary of housing and urban development for the last four years and a likely candidate for governor, said his father "is in heaven; he is paid to speak."
The father's principles are also apparent in the one corporate board he serves on, of the Medallion Financial Corporation, which lends money to small-business owners, mainly immigrants. "We look in their eyes," said the corporation's president, Andy Mustein. "Sometimes the only collateral is somebody's ambition."
 
So Tantalizingly Near, And Yet So Far Away
Mario Cuomo came within grasping distance of the nation's highest prizes. By his wife's count, he was offered a seat on the Supreme Court three times, once by President Carter and twice by President Clinton. Twice, in 1988 and 1992, he passed up running for the presidency, even though he was leading in the polls.
From the perspective of professional pols, he mastered the game. Nixon said for years that he was the Democrats' strongest candidate. In 1988, when President Reagan was asked what "the great communicator" planned to do, he replied, "I think he'll stay as governor of New York."
His celebrity thrives: crowds coalesce around him on streets; men call him a hero, women kiss him.
And given Andrew's political ambitions, the Cuomo name may be in the limelight again. Andrew looks, sounds and is said to think like his father, and, for better or worse, seems to inspire the same passionate love or hate. He is eager for his father's help, and Dad seems more than willing.
"My instinct would be to be all over it, but maybe the manager will want me to stay behind the scenes, just raising money," Mario Cuomo said. "Andrew may even have to overcome his father's image."
Meyer S. Frucher, who was one of Mr. Cuomo's top gubernatorial advisers, cited an October poll showing that only 22 percent of New Yorkers have an unfavorable opinion of the senior Cuomo, and he predicted a prominent paternal role. Still, he urged caution.
"The role of a father in a campaign is a very, very complicated one," Mr. Frucher said. "Just ask W."
Mrs. Cuomo sees nothing complicated about the situation. "If Andrew decides to run, we're going to work our hearts and souls off for him," she vowed.
 
A Politics of Caring, Rooted in the Depression
Mr. Cuomo sits behind his cluttered desk at Wilkie Farr, the jagged skyline sparkling through immense windows. On the wall is his certificate to practice before the Supreme Court and an autographed picture of Joe DiMaggio. He wants people to know he is "not dead yet."
After quoting economists like Adam Smith, he explained that his politics, and his drive to attend to his family's material needs, grew out of his experience in the Depression. When his father lost his job, the Cuomos were befriended by a businessman who let them live in the back of his grocery store in South Jamaica, Queens, if they agreed to run it. All four children were born in that one room, including Mario, the youngest, who was named for a brother who died at 2.
He got a $2,000 bonus from the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1951 to play baseball, but after an injury sidelined him, he used it for an engagement ring for Matilda Raffa (who as First Lady and afterward was deeply in women's health issues and student mentoring) and finished college and then law school at St. John's. He made the rounds of the prestigious law firms, but there was no market for Italian-Americans. He became a successful lawyer on Court Street in Brooklyn, where the phase "ambulance chaser" is no insult.
It all added up to an education.
"I've been married for 46 years and have five children," he said. "That's an education."
"I have nine granddaughters. That's an education."
"I was governor for 12 years. An incredible learning experience."
Almost teasing, he gave the reasons he would have enjoyed the Supreme Court.
"I like being left alone," he said. "I like being able to read, deliberate and then write what I believe to be the truth."
When asked if he would rather make a bright comment on Larry King or write a benchmark Supreme Court opinion, he looked at the questioner and grunted.
The presidency?
In 1991, friends persuaded him to pursue the race he had rejected in 1988 when he thought others were better qualified. But the following year, Mr. Cuomo said, when a campaign would have begun, he was trapped by the unwillingness of the Republican-controlled State Senate to agree on a budget bill.
He says he believes that national Republicans were coordinating the stalemate in Albany to keep him out of the race. "How could I run for president if the economy of my own state was in turmoil?" he asked.
Some friends guess his real reason was an unwillingness to send American soldiers to war, a president's heaviest responsibility at any time. Mr. Cuomo rejects this, pointing out that he demonstrated his toughness during his first week as governor by refusing to yield when rioting inmates at Sing Sing demanded clemency.
Mr. Cuomo answered, "Tell them the answer is no," and went into the bathroom and threw up. The hostages were released in minutes.
He rebutted the idea that he shied away from higher office because he was worried about reporters uncovering Mafia connections in his family, saying that there were none and that nobody had found any despite years of trying.
He added that he resented the recent disclosure that Mayor Giuliani's father went to prison for Mafia activities, saying that had nothing to do with the mayor's own character and record.
In any case, he says he has no regrets about his decisions not to pursue both offices.
"I have never heard him say, 'What if?' " Andrew said.
Shortly after his gubernatorial defeat, an aide mentioned that an advertising agency had asked if Mr. Cuomo would make a Doritos commercial with Ann Richards, who had just lost her bid for re-election as governor of Texas, to one George W. Bush.
"No kidding?" Mr. Cuomo said. "Doritos, huh?"
He did the commercial, and another for Mad magazine. The money went for a down payment on a $600,000 apartment. He then set out to interview law firms.
Jack Nussbaum, chairman of Wilkie Farr, said that despite "the large gap in his resume," referring to his political years, "we knew him to be a man of great intellect."
Dan Rubino, a partner, said Mr. Cuomo writes his own briefs, and, colleagues say, can often be found in the library doing his own research. His assignments have included representing the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in an antitrust case, an Italian drug firm in a copyright case and Sprint in its bid to acquire People's Choice TV.
But some tasks are hard because of his background.
"It's hard for me to go into court, because I appointed 112 judges," Mr. Cuomo said. He has also declined to be on the firm's executive committee. "It's very difficult to be one of nine guys running a little law firm," he said.
Mr. Frucher, who is now chairman and chief executive of the Philadelphia exchange, told of a man who did a double take when Mr. Cuomo walked into a meeting and then appeared nonplused throughout the session.
"It takes a while for people to think of me as a lawyer," Mr. Cuomo complained afterward. "I just don't understand why."
Mr. Frucher answered, "Maybe if you wouldn't sit at the head of the table. . . ."
 
Still in the Game, Still Taking Shots
Mr. Cuomo these days is a study in motion, if not always efficient scheduling. He gave a speech in Phoenix on a Friday, returned to play basketball on Saturday and then went back to Phoenix for a speech on Sunday. He gets bookings through the Harry Walker agency -- he won't say how much he is paid -- but is not under contract there and arranges many of his speeches himself, and he gives many without charge.
His biggest battle last week was not in the political arena. It was on the basketball court, where his team, the Blues ("Play Sad Music When You Play the Blues," say the team's jerseys) was preparing to play the Blacks, the team led by his son Christopher, at an Upper East Side high school.
Christopher, a reporter for the ABC program "20/ 20," anticipated the worst, as usual.
"He will cheat, he will call you out of bounds when you're not," the son said. "He yells and screams about enforcing rules he would never have his own team play by."
The father says he is just glad to be out there, even with the painful cortisone shot he must have in his hand to play. "You play anyway," he said, "because you're running out of time and love the game."
Another day, he showed up at Intermediate School 43 in Harlem at the request of a basketball friend who teaches there. He had passed up an invitation to be on "Nightline" to arrive bright and early.
The children acted cool, yawning for emphasis. Mr. Cuomo began by referring to his new career. "If you have a merger or a big company you want to sell, I'm the guy to see," he said. He tailored his life story to his almost exclusively black audience by describing his experiences growing up in South Jamaica.
"They called us funny names," he said. "Dagos, guineas, greaseballs, wops. You know they're making fun of your mother. You know they're making fun of your father. You know they're making fun of you."
Question time came, and two dozen miraculously energized children waved their hands in the air. What about Governor Pataki?
"I am an ontologist," Mr. Cuomo answered. "That means I believe that everything that exists is good, or God wouldn't permit it to exist. So, in that sense, he is a good governor."
He added salt to feeble praise by saying Mr. Pataki is interested only in helping the rich. Later, he wondered if he had been too kind.
Mr. Cuomo was asked if politicians' personal morality mattered. He said he deplored Mr. Clinton's behavior but did not support impeachment. "We think your soul needs a little work, but the rest of you is functioning very well indeed," he said.
The man, who called the children sir and ma'am, was in his element. "He's pedantic," said his son Christopher. "He's always looking to teach you."
Mr. Cuomo has a playfully thoughtful side. Climbing into a limousine one day, he ruminated on why Lincoln aced Cadillac in the black car business. He moved on to the merits of being a monoecious organism, one in which both sexes exist in one body. This somehow led to taxis and why the price of medallions went up when the city issued 400 new ones for the first time in years.
All of which, perhaps logically, brought the former governor to a Peanuts strip he loves. Charlie Brown's team has lost, 29-0. Lucy says: "Win some, lose some." Charlie replies: "Wouldn't that be wonderful."
A passenger asked whether President Clinton is this era's greatest politician. There was a long pause. Finally, Mr. Cuomo answered: "Yeah, I guess. But politics for what? Winning?"
The car stopped in Purchase, where Mr. Cuomo was to address the Westchester Holocaust Commission. He does not usually write out his speeches, but he said this subject required every word to be right. He spoke of "tormenting, unanswered questions."
Recently, he told his audience, his granddaughter asked about the Holocaust, "Why did they kill them, Grampa?"
Mr. Cuomo struggled, then promised he would explain when she got older. "And you wonder if you'll ever get old enough," he said softly.
There were tears in the audience, and, at the end, long applause. As Mr. Cuomo left, a stranger grabbed his arm and whispered, "My only regret is that you're not running for president."

HEADLINE: Four-Wheeled Wallflowers, Waiting for a Dance

 BODY:
EVEN in the Super Bowl, players sit on the sidelines. And even as automakers celebrated record sales in recent years, some models haven't had much to party about. Bad things happen to good cars.
This has always been the case. Some vehicles, like the Chrysler Airflow of the mid-30's, were ahead of their time. Others, like the Packard Caribbean and Studebaker Lark, couldn't compete with Detroit's marketing muscle and economies of scale. Still others were undone by poor quality, dated designs or changing demographics. The industry's biggest failure, the Ford Motor Company's Edsel, arrived in the midst of a recession in the particularly vulnerable medium-priced sector of the market. Its sucking-a-lemon styling didn't help matters. 
 More recently, Ford pulled the plug on two exceptional performance cars that started out as mundane family sedans: the Taurus SHO and Contour SVT. Despite critical acclaim, the cars failed to convince enough buyers in their intended market -- driving enthusiasts with a penchant for European road manners -- that Detroit's engineers could match the Germans'.
Currently, a German sedan wearing Cadillac's crest is struggling. The Catera, based on the Opel Omega, found only 756 buyers last month. Problems with the quality of early cars left the Catera under a cloud. Another line of Opel-based cars, the midsize Saturn L-Series, has also been a sales disappointment.
Some other models are sagging under the weight of old age. Sales of the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, which were last extensively redesigned for 1993, are a fraction of the numbers posted in their glory days. The Acura Integra, due for a revamping, is similarly flagging. Fewer than 9,000 Mitsubishi Diamantes, made in Australia, have been sold this year.
Entire nameplates have been excised. Chrysler perfomed euthanasia on the Eagle division that it inherited from American Motors. DaimlerChrysler is in the process of killing Plymouth, and last week G.M. said it would similarly phase out Oldsmobile.
As for individual models, some with modest sales will surely survive. And some certainly deserve better. The four models featured below are not just undersellers, they are often underrated and underappreciated -- vehicles that have not received their due.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS;
Finding A Niche as High Tech's Back Office

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. His column on the Main Street economy appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
FOR about three decades, this blue-collar city of 23,000, about 100 miles north of Manhattan, was at the epicenter of the technological revolution. Since the early 1990's, though, when I.B.M. shut down its mainframe-testing operation and offices here, idling 7,000 workers, the city has languished.
But like other working-class communities across the country, Kingston is seeking a new niche in the new economy. One Manhattan developer sees the city as maintaining an important position in technology, only in more of a supporting role -- as a center for back offices or warehouses for expanding Internet and other technology businesses. 
 The developer, Alan Ginsberg, bought I.B.M.'s 256-acre Kingston plant in 1998 for $16.5 million and renamed it TechCity. He says bad times for technology companies -- exemplified by the recent sharp drop in their stock prices -- make blue-collar places like Kingston more appealing to new-economy companies. For one thing, rents at TechCity average $10 to $13 a square foot, compared with $50 to $100 in Manhattan and $30 in Westchester County, just north of New York City. "Now people need to find places in the hinterlands that are both affordable and attractive," Mr. Ginsberg said.
Kingston's effort to find its place in the information-age economy also reflects a growing recognition that lower-cost sites may be best for blue-collar functions like technology support, warehousing and distribution. "The Web can't move a box," said John Kasarda, director of the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina.
Increasingly, Dr. Kasarda said, Web-related companies understand that efficient means of processing orders and storing and distributing products have become as crucial to their success as building efficient electronic portals and offering compelling new products.
THE search for the best homes for these distribution activities -- as well as for customer support and data processing -- is already leading companies to places far afield from conventional high-technology hotbeds like Silicon Valley or Boston's Route 128, or new-media centers like Lower Manhattan or San Francisco's South of Market district.
EToys, an Internet retailer with headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif., has established major distribution sites in Blairs, Va., in the rural south central part of the state, and in Ontario, Calif., 40 miles east of Los Angeles. The sites, which together have 700 employees and cover nearly three million square feet of space, are in relatively low-cost areas with largely blue-collar work forces.
Ted Augustine, senior vice president for logistics at eToys, says that the blue-collar portions of the information economy are best placed in areas that boast easy accessibility and good roads, cheap space and a large blue-collar and middle-management work force. "This is the nonglamorous stuff -- but it's absolutely come to the fore," he said. "It's increasingly seen as critical for success."
The recently completed Ontario site has emerged as a magnet for blue-collar operations. Centered near Ontario International Airport, the area has developed into a center for Internet-related warehousing. It is home to operations of companies like Toys "R" Us, Cooking.com, Home Shopping Network and eToys.
The area's appeal is in large part based on location, price and infrastructure, Mr. Augustine said. The region has freeway and rail access to Los Angeles and Long Beach, a foreign trade entrepot. And rents are as much as 80 percent lower than in coastal sections of Los Angeles County or Orange County, according to John Husing, a local economist. "We have the real estate, and that turns us into a magnet for big space users," Mr. Husing said.
That blue-collar growth is expected to continue. The San Bernardino-Riverside region already has an estimated 220 million square feet of commercial space, and an additional 30 million square feet is planned, if local authorities approve. Since the mid-1990's, nearly 43,000 jobs have been added in manufacturing and distribution.
Across the country in Kingston, Mr. Ginsberg and local business leaders want to develop similar niches for the Hudson Valley region. Although wages here are lower than in Silicon Valley or Lower Manhattan's new-media industry, the business leaders consider warehouse, back-office and other technology support positions as likely to be more attractive than the lower-paying retail and other service jobs that have been the major source of new employment in the area since I.B.M. pulled out.
Eugene R. Gruner, a real estate broker and a longtime business leader in Kingston, said that while unemployment was down and occupancy rates in downtown Kingston were up, most of the new business has come from small, poorly financed business-service companies that use 1,000 square feet of space or less. Technology companies' logistics and support installations, Mr. Gruner said, could help increase local wages and rents.
Yet Kingston still faces many challenges. The city is roughly a two-hour drive from New York City, and it lacks the modern infrastructure being built in places like Ontario. The local airport, Stewart International, does not yet have the capacity to handle the kind of large containers and packages required for large-scale distribution functions.
Despite such challenges, Mr. Ginsberg says he can turn TechCity -- and Kingston -- into a thriving secondary high-technology center. To attract smaller companies, he is breaking up some of the larger expanses at his site, while transforming closed-in, cubicle offices into airy spaces with exposed ceilings.
SO far, Mr. Ginsberg has had limited success. Roughly one-third of TechCity's available space, or around 850,000 square feet, has been occupied. The largest tenant is Fleet Bank, a unit of FleetBoston Financial, which houses back-office operations in nearly 400,000 square feet of office space. Other tenants include FairPoint Communications, a telecommunications service company, as well as a handful of Internet start-ups.
Yet Mr. Ginsberg is hopeful. With the benefit of a 10-year break from New York State on state sales and business taxes, he says that this lagging part of the Hudson Valley can thrive in the new economy.
But he acknowledges that the process will take time. "Lightning changes don't happen overnight in places like this," he said. "Will we get to 75 to 80 percent occupancy? Come back in three years and we'll see."
