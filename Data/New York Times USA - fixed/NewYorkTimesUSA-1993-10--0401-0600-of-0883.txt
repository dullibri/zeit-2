HEADLINE: TENNIS: Secret Sharer: O'Reilly Is Dead, but Her Gift Lives On;
A Tennis-Playing Triplet Made Sure She Spent Her Life as More Than a Mere Curiosity

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIDGEWOOD, N.J. Oct. 13

 BODY:
When Maryann Tierney, coach of Ridgewood High School's girls tennis team, boarded a school bus for the ride to a meet against neighboring Paramus the other day, she was taken aback by the silence that had replaced her players' usual pre-game chatter.
As the bus inched out of the school parking lot and passed under the scarlet-tinged canopy of oaks and maples that make this suburban village seem more pristine than bustling, Tierney discovered the reason behind the long faces. 
 "The girls told me Christine O'Reilly had been killed in a car crash," she said. "It felt awful on the bus that day; it was the worst kind of shock. Everybody knew the O'Reilly girls."
 
Behind-the-Scenes Volunteer
 In her hometown, 25-year-old Christine O'Reilly, is being remembered this week not only as a member of the tennis-playing O'Reilly triplets who achieved recognition worldwide, but also as the ultimate overachiever and throwback to the do-gooders of yore.
"In her we recognized another Dorothy Day in our midst," said Sister Lucy Sullivan of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, referring to the social activist and founder of the Catholic Worker Movement in the 1930's. Sullivan is probably the only person in town who realized the extent of O'Reilly's behind-the-scenes volunteer work. "It just came to her naturally, that gift," she said. "No big speeches, no pious jargon."
O'Reilly went to Mass more often than to the mall, and her first move after returning from a tennis tournament abroad would be to shrug off her backpack and racquets in the hall of her family's spacious Tudor home and dash off to visit the more "difficult" shut-ins on Sister Lucy's list.
O'Reilly's grieving parents, Eugene and Delores, surrounded by condolence cards and floral tributes, said they're finding out only now just how deep their daughter's commitment to lending a charitable hand -- to children, to the old -- actually was. She kept that quality to herself, a semi-secret even from the two sisters who were born just minutes ahead of her on Jan. 18, 1968.
Tierney said: "I can't tell you enough good things about her and her sisters; it sounds trite, but they were a real class act, in triplicate. Even when they were 16-year-old students here, as an adult, I admired them."
Tierney never coached O'Reilly, who along with sisters Patti and Terri formed Ridgewood's famous triplet trio that dominated national junior competition in the Eastern region before all three were graduated from high school in 1986 and enrolled at Duke.
"Hands down, they were just plain too good to play high school tennis; the logical competition for them was elsewhere," said Tierney.
"Whenever you'd hear these ungodly thumps coming from the practice courts, you'd know that wasn't the sound of high school tennis, that was the triplets out there whacking volleys around," said Jim Reamer, Ridgewood High's dean of students.
"If we had a school activity, they were there to set it up and there to help clean it up," he said. "You might have thought having all three play tennis was ripe for an unhealthy sibling rivalry, but you never saw it. They were their own best friends, the kind of kids you'd take for your own."
All three O'Reillys received full scholarships from Duke, and after providing three successful cornerstones to Duke's fledgling tennis program, the sisters graduated with economics degrees and took their turn at the roulette wheel of the professional tennis circuit.
None was able to crack the top 100, but that didn't seem to matter: The O'Reillys, or the O's, as they are still referred to inside the cathedral-like brick high school here, were too busy pelting balls at every match available to them, be it a qualifier, a clinic, or a charity event, to care about their rankings.
And their joy was infectious: Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, now ranked 2d in the world, remembers scurrying up into the bleacher rafters at Hilton Head Island last year because that was the only seat left for a spirited qualifying confrontation between Patti and Christine.
Patti, the sole O'Reilly still active on the circuit, reached as high as 210th in the world and is currently 270th, which matches the highest ranking Terri achieved before leaving competitive tennis for a career in sports promotion, a path Christine had already taken. Bothered by injuries that also hampered her college career, Christine never rose above 357th in the world ranking.
"I talked to her about it, giving up the dream of competing in order to get on with the next bit of life, and she really seemed comfortable with it," said Pam Shriver, the veteran player and president of the Women's Tennis Association. "But she'll be missed: The O'Reilly triplets is one of the great, fun stories of our tour in the last ten years. All three, besides being great players, were always ready and willing to help out whatever charity event we had. Maybe that comes with being triplets, that sense of being part of a team and giving back."
O'Reilly was working as a project coordinator for sports promoter John Korff, producer of the Mahwah, N.J., tennis exhibition that the triplets had played in for the last decade, when she was killed last weekend. She had decided to leave competitive tennis, she told Korff, because she was tired of being labeled a tennis triplet and nothing more. And because she was tired of having her back injury surface each morning and prevent her from standing up straight for the first hour of every day.
Last week, assigned to find a site for a balloon festival Korff was producing, she had arrived in Palm Springs, Calif., on Wednesday, Oct. 6, and hired a private pilot, Steven Evans, to take her site scanning on Thursday. On Friday, in a car borrowed from Korff's father, O'Reilly and Evan drove to several more sites. Late that night, with Evans at the wheel, the car overshot a curve on Newport Coast Drive, spun into a utility pole, and split in two. Evans died instantly; O'Reilly had massive internal head injuries and went into a coma from which she never recovered.
Patti and Terri O'Reilly arrived, along with their mother, at the hospital on Saturday, a day they had expected to spend celebrating their mother's birthday. By Sunday, when it was determined that Christine could not breathe on her own, they made the decision to disconnect the life-support system and donate her internal organs. Next, they went to the accident site to look for a cross Christine had worn around her neck; instead, they found a shoe and the hood ornament from the car. Then they took their sister home to Ridgewood where, by Wednesday, the only visible sign of the tragedy was the steady stream of florists' delivery vans arriving and departing from Madison Place.
Inside the hushed house, Christine's parents and five siblings, dry-eyed but drained, selected the readings and music for her funeral service on Saturday. When the quiet grew too confining, Patti and Terri opted to take a walk.
Dodging the leafy neighborhood's resident squirrels, hedges, and inquiring canines, the two remaining triplets reminisced about their sister in a stroll around the block as the sun began to set Wednesday evening. She was, they said, an inspiration to them, even if it did take them an hour of squabbling to arrive at a consensus whenever they tried to rent a video.
"We're almost like parts of the same person," said Patti. "From the time we were 10, we had our own little team, whatever sport it was: What mattered was being out there doing something."
"We always," said Terri, "had our foot in something."
The sisters supported Christine's decision to start a business career, but when Patti needed a grass-court warmup partner for Wimbledon this year, Christine made time to help -- and didn't mind beating her in their practice sessions.
Last summer, although busy assisting Korff's production of the Pathmark Tennis Classic in Mahwah, Christine not only competed in the event, and with her sisters squared off against Bjorn Borg and Guillermo Vilas for charity, but also organized a basketball exhibition to help the Tomorrow's Children Fund.
"If there was a moment when she could be useful to someone, she'd use it," said Terri. "If I have a spare moment, there I am, on the couch, but she would be out there trying to make a difference. She seemed to know that instinctively, that you can make a difference."
The two O'Reillys, trying to emulate their sister by taking something positive from her death, have made her life's dream part of their life's work and initiated the Christine O'Reilly Children's Fund. The ultimate goal is an orphanage; the immediate goal, said Terri, is to keep the third triplet's spirit alive.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Giuliani on the Attack

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Striving to put Mayor David N. Dinkins back on the defensive, Rudolph W. Giuliani has begun broadcasting two new 30-second television commercials and two similar radio ads, harshly attacking the Mayor's record in office and a range of personal or professional lapses dating back two decades. This is one of them.
 
ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with big words on screen "Maybe we should have known better," next to a tiny picture of Mr. Giuliani noting that his campaign paid for it. Followed by pictures of a Comptroller's report, and a quotation from it: "...serious internal control weaknesses over revenue..." Then newspaper headlines, title noting that Mr. Dinkins failed to file tax returns from 1969 through 1972, footage of Korean boycott, Crown Heights, asbestos sign on a dumpster, and titles that repeat much of the narration. It ends with a picture of Mr. Dinkins, with a smirky smile, and the words "It's not my fault." Last image: White letters on black background, "Maybe it was our fault four years ago."
 
PRODUCER: Garth Group of New York
 
THE SCRIPT:
Male narrator: "Maybe we should have known better. When David Dinkins was City Clerk, a Comptroller audit found that his office was a financial mess. He also forgot to pay Federal, state and city income taxes four years in a row. You think you'd get away with it? Then he becomes Mayor, and we get the Korean boycott, the Crown Heights riots, the PVB scandal, asbestos in the schools and on top of that, we lose 350,000 jobs. And all David Dinkins says is, it's not my fault. Maybe he's right. Maybe it was our fault four years ago."
 
ACCURACY: Two audits by the City Comptroller did fault the management of the City Clerk's office during Mr. Dinkins's tenure from 1975 to 1985. He failed to file income tax returns and pay all taxes due from 1969 through 1972, but he later paid the taxes with penalities and there was no prosecution. As one of the Giuliani radio ads notes, the lapse prevented Mr. Dinkins from becoming the city's first black deputy Mayor in 1973. The school asbestos problem long predated the Mayor's tenure in office, and economists say the city government cannot be held accountable for all the jobs lost in a severe regional recession. Moreover, Mr. Dinkins has acknowledged fault in several of the cases cited, particularly with respect to Crown Heights.
 
SCORECARD: This tough ad attacks Mr. Dinkins for a range of old and new lapses, throwing in everything but the kitchen sink. It is Mr. Giuliani's attempt to counteract the Dinkins ads that have sought to rehash old aspects of his record of service to Republican administrations and link them to his current policy views. Similarly, this ad attempts to paint Mr. Dinkins's entire career as an endless skein of mediocrity and bumbling -- typified by his failure to pay income taxes. The "You think you'd get away with it?" line is an indirect echo of a charge the Giuliani camp sometimes makes more overtly: that if Mr. Dinkins were white, he would never have been forgiven such a lapse. That is a way of saying whites need not feel guilty for voting against him now, having given him a break four years ago. By citing the most notable crises of the Dinkins administration, the ad may ring uncomfortably true. But its rapid-fire mix of images and charges, and its final sneering tone of blaming the electorate may also put voters off.<? TODD S. PURDUM

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Whitman on Florio: Accusations of Corruption

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:

Candidate: Christine Todd Whitman
 
Producer: The Murphey Pintak Gautier Agency. Washington
 
Text: (Voiceover) Whitman and Florio. Compare. Christie Whitman wants to cut state spending. Jim Florio increased spending by three billion dollars. Christie Whitman wants to create new jobs with tax cuts. Jim Florio raised taxes billions and he won't rule out raising taxes again. Whitman will clean up state Government. Florio's administration is under two grand jury investigations. Jim Florio. Rising unemployment, corruption, high taxes. We can't afford more. Christie Whitman. A change for the better.
 
Visual: Still photos of Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio appear side by side -- predictably she is smiling engagingly while he is frosty -- while graphics echo the truncated words of the narrator. Her image disappears when the specter of corruption is mentioned, replaced at the Governor's side by stacks of money and news headlines reading "State Jobless Rate Reaches 7.7 % For Second Rise in a Row" and "Lax Ethical Standards."
 
Analysis: What's new here is the odor of corruption. In earlier television spots, Mrs. Whitman tried to saddle Mr. Florio with all the bad effects of a prolonged recession while contrasting the $2.8 billion tax increases he pushed through the Legislature in 1980 with her campaign promise to cut taxes by $1.4 billion. (Mrs. Whitman herself refuses to sign a no-new-taxes pledge.) While mention of the two grand juries is fair game, equating them with proof of corruption is not, and Mrs. Whitman's pledge "to clean up state Government" not only lacks specifics but means little without evidence that it is dirty. A state grand jury is looking into allegations that $1.5 million in excess state school aid was sent to the Democratic-controlled town of Lyndhurst , which GOP partisans have painted as a political payoff ordered by the Governor's office. Meanwhile, a Federal grand jury has been examining the old practice, unique to neither party, of directing profitable state bond business to Wall Street fat cats who make hefty campaign contributions to the party in power. The fly in Mr. Florio's ointment here is that Joseph C. Salema Jr., his chief of staff and political satrap, was a partner in a bond consulting firm that profited handsomely from state decisions. Mr. Salema resigned last May to spare the Governor further embarrassment, but so far Federal investigators have not indicated that any laws were broken. Some Democrats question whether Mrs. Whitman, whose husband is a wealthy Wall Street broker and whose late father was a Republican power broker and fund-raiser, is all that shocked by back-room deals between Trenton and captains of finance.

HEADLINE: Why Does Israel Arm China?

 BODY:
Israel is expanding its cooperation with China on military technology, according to the Central Intelligence Agency. That's the latest sign of Israeli willingness to engage in dubious arms deals. In this case, Israel is supplying China with advanced technology that the U.S. and other Western powers won't supply.
In the past, compelling security needs drove an isolated Israel to forge alliances of convenience with outcasts like South Africa and Iran, sometimes with U.S. connivance. But why would Israel engage in such risky trade now -- especially with a country that has armed Israel's sworn enemies like Iran? Washington, Israel's protector, should demand a good answer before supplying its ally with more advanced military technology. 
 The Rand Corporation reported two years ago that Israel became "China's leading foreign supplier of advanced technology" after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The sales included missile technology like a new PL-8 air-to-air and air-to-surface missile and improvements in the CSS-2 ballistic missiles that China sold to Saudi Arabia.
Rand also detected "indications" that Israel had helped the Chinese develop a new fighter plane with technology from the canceled Lavi fighter. The U.S. originally supplied some of that technology. In August, the General Accounting Office warned that the transfer of U.S. technology to Israel for developing the Arrow anti-missile interceptor was inadequately supervised, raising the risk of possible diversion to third countries. Israel has repeatedly denied any such diversion. Given the close cooperation between the two allies, it's often difficult to know exactly when Israeli designers develop an original device or when they produce a knockoff of a U.S. design.
The C.I.A., in answer to questions from a Senate committee, was circumspect about whether the military technology Israel was transferring to China was Israel's own or had originated in the U.S. But it offered an unusually blunt public assessment of "broadening" Israeli-Chinese cooperation, noting that "a growing number of Israeli defense firms" are opening offices in China.
Israel's burgeoning cooperation with China is puzzling in the wake of progress in autonomy talks with the Palestinians and the prospect of peace with all its next-door neighbors. There's no new indication that Israel is reselling U.S. military technology in violation of U.S. law. Even so, a further puzzle persists: Why does Israel do business with a country that endangers its security by arming Iran, Pakistan and others?

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Mean What You Say

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The crisis in Haiti offers President Clinton a difficult challenge -- but also an opportunity to answer swelling doubts about his foreign policy leadership. The doubts, to put it bluntly, go to whether his words carry any conviction.
Shilly-shallying has been a feature of Mr. Clinton's Presidency. Friends and allies have come to suspect that what he says, like a cut-rate air ticket, is good for that day only. 
A telling example -- and a tragic one -- has been his policy on Bosnia. Mr. Clinton began by calling for strong action to stop the Serbs' genocidal aggression. But he conditioned the action on European support, and then did nothing serious to get that support. It looked as though he really did not believe in the policy he proposed.
The President took an elusive position on the peace plans put forward by international mediators on the Yugoslav conflict. He did not endorse them, but he indicated that he would not object if the parties agreed. There was no leadership, or even a willingness to shoulder responsibility.
More recently Mr. Clinton said the U.S. would contribute 25,000 American soldiers to a NATO force of 50,000 that would police an agreement -- if there was one -- to partition Bosnia. But no sooner had he said that than he began attaching so many conditions that he effectively abandoned the promise.
In Somalia, Mr. Clinton inherited a commitment of American troops. But the purpose of the mission changed, from humanitarian relief to nation-building, without the Administration noticing -- or at any rate being able to explain it. When officials briefed members of Congress last week on Somalia, even Democrats complained that they got no rational explanation of the policy.
This week Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Republican voice of reason and experience on the Foreign Relations Committee, spoke of what he called "the virtual collapse of Presidential leadership in these matters."
"There is no significant support for the President's policy" on Somalia, Bosnia or Haiti, Senator Lugar told R. W. Apple Jr. of The New York Times. "And it's his own fault."
The other day I asked an old foreign policy hand what President Clinton could do to restore faith in his leadership. The answer was: "Have some convictions, and act on them."
Of course it may be that those Americans who have traditionally been concerned with foreign affairs are simply seeing a President who is not -- and who wants to move the country away from caring. A turn toward isolationism is politically tempting, given the degree of xenophobia among the American people these days, and Mr. Clinton's desire to emphasize domestic reform.
Friends abroad certainly sense the possibility of America turning inward under this President. The Financial Times of London has an editorial headed "Uncle Sam in Retreat," and concluding: "Those who believed the cold war would be followed by a period of Pax Americana, worldwide or even in Europe, need to think again, and urgently."
The trouble is that feebleness abroad has consequences at home. Americans may say they want a President who focuses on domestic problems. But their image of the person in the White House is based very much on whether he is seen to act as a strong leader abroad.
Moreover, if members of Congress come to believe that a President can be moved to change his position abroad because he lacks real convictions, they may suspect that the same is true at home. And that would be fatal to Mr. Clinton's domestic ambitions, given the tendency of Congress to push the White House as far as possible in bargaining for regional or economic or ideological interests.
For those reasons, Mr. Clinton was protecting his own Presidency when he said yesterday that he would act unilaterally to enforce the agreed return to democracy in Haiti. It had the sound of a real commitment. But then came a new challenge by the Haitian thugs: the murder of the Justice Minister. What will Mr. Clinton do?
Public opinion may have been against U.S. involvement in Haiti. But I think Americans will support the President if he now offers firm leadership.
If Mr. Clinton had acted firmly last spring on Bosnia, think what he would have done for peace and order in Europe. And for himself.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Here We Go Again

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Israel sells weapons and the technology of warfare to Communist China. The U.S. prepares the way for the Chinese military to get the American supercomputers for which it has lusted so long.
So, fellow suckers, citizens of the Free World, here we go again. Democratic governments are helping increase the military power of despotism. 
 They are richly experienced at that -- one accomplishment after another, from Hitler Germany to Imperial Japan to the Haiti of the Duvaliers, to Ayatollah Iran and Saddamite Iraq, and so many other sales-points in between.
The C.I.A. has sent a report to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, which is investigating the proliferation of high-tech, high-kill weapons around the world. The C.I.A. says the Israel-China military link has involved planes, tanks and missiles and is moving into "cooperation" in electronics and space. This has been going on under Likud, "unity" and Labor governments.
Is Israel selling American weapons technology? In March 1992, I wrote columns refuting reports that Israel was about to sell American missile technology to China. The technology involved was Israeli.
But if both Israel-U.S. joint military enterprises and Israel-to-China military sales continue, the ice can get thinner. Already, Israeli diplomats have to keep answering Washington's questions about possible transfers -- bad for their alliance, believe it.
But in any case, I wrote when Likud ruled and repeat when Labor is in office: As an American friend of Israel and a lifetime anti-Communist and anti-Fascist, I believe Israel is in moral and political error in selling even a pistol to the keeper of a gulag that includes the entire nation of Tibet.
The U.S. is on the road to the same error. The Chinese will be able to buy U.S. supercomputer technology, directly or from another country, through "relaxations" in American computer-trade regulations.
That is not getting enough attention outside the Senate committee and nonproliferation specialists in and out of government. These valuable people devote their lives to fighting the spread of technologies and materials that carry the virus of death.
Why do Israel and the U.S. so stupidly soil and endanger themselves?
In a world where the U.S. cannot land a detachment of soldiers in Haiti, China's military power is already far greater and more deliverable than America's -- among Asians, it is psychologically no contest.
As for Israel, its Chinese customers are supplying Middle East dictators with missiles that can reach Israeli territory -- if handshakes ever close into fists.
Israelis say they need foreign arms sales to keep their defense industry going. As my mother used to say, I will sit right down and cry my heart out for them. The sales to China are a tiny part of Israel's growing economy, hardly worth the price in honor and relations with the U.S.
The American rationalization for supercomputer sales is that technology sooner or later gets around the world, so we might as well take the profit. Nonproliferation specialists like Prof. Gary Milhollin of the University of Wisconsin's Law School say that some technology cannot be duplicated and that anyway the time lag can be years.
If Saddam Hussein had had the benefit of even more relaxed trade rules, he could have developed nuclear weapons before the gulf war.
No, the reason is money -- money, as in profit for U.S. computer industry, as in cost reduction in Israel's defense industry. That always seems so sensible, until money comes whistling back as dictators' bombs.
The U.S. and Israel aren't alone in doing military-related business with China. Russia, Japan, Western Eur ope, all are bellying up to the trough.
I used to assume that U.S. economic strength could be used as political clout with our friends. Bushbaker certainly put the squeeze on Israel. But about trade with China we never do anything so indelicate.
Still, When the U.S. or Israel, a special ally, play around with trade rules or sales orders that could strengthen the Chinese military, we have the right and duty to protest until we get hoarse.
The U.S. and Israel have plenty of joint interests -- political freedom, history, security. We don't need the additional common ground of cupidity and stupidity.

'Berlin'
'Designing a Capital for the 21st Century'
 Goethe House
 1014 Fifth Avenue (at 82d Street)
 Through Oct. 23
This show of urban design proposals by New York architects for a new Government center in Berlin is a case study in displaced energy. Ostensibly, the 12 firms represented here have set their sights on the reunified German city. But what the show really records is the frustrated desire of these young architects to grapple with the urbanism of their own hometown. The Berlin wall has fallen, but an invisible barrier appears to separate New York's aspiring architects from those who actually plan and build their city. When will these divided sectors be reunited? 
 The Spreebogen Competition, named for a sparsely built-up 70-acre site in the center of Berlin, invited architects from around the world to propose plans for the relocation of the German Government from Bonn. The plans were not to be for actual buildings, but rather urban design schemes that envision ways to integrate a new Government hub into Germany's once and future capital.
The site, on a bend in the Spree River, is haunted by two architectural ghosts of the Nazi era. At one end sits the Reichstag, the Neo-Renaissance Parliament building whose burning in 1933 provided Hitler with a pretext to suspend civil liberties. Later, Albert Speer chose the site for his monumental Neo-Classical complex for the Thousand-Year Reich. Though it was not built, Speer's design has nonetheless acted as a powerful deterrent. The competition explicitly discouraged entrants from designing monumental expressions of state power.
The wild diversity of the New York proposals echoes the euphoria that accompanied the dismantling of the wall. Still, many of the schemes share a similar approach in their use of abstract forms to convey historical and political meanings. Kiss & Zwigard Architects, for example, proposes a "bridge building" to symbolize connection in a city formerly ruled by separation. Smith Miller & Hawkinson uses the metaphor of the urban map in a plan that integrates East and West but retains traces of their cold-war division.
Other proposals display skepticism that German reunification is something to cheer about. Michael Sorkin Studio's plan seeks to resist resurgent nationalism by dividing government functions into small buildings of somewhat reptilian aspect. A site plan by Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture proposes buildings inspired by the graffiti scrawls that turned the wall into a monument of political art.
But this show, organized by the New York architect Alexander C. Gorlin, is less significant for its individual projects than for the collective message they send. Here, a new generation of architects is reimagining urban design, exploring ideas that go beyond both the modernist blank-slate approach to urban planning and the decorative contextualism of recent years. This show is a group plea for the chance to try out new ideas -- an imaginary Checkpoint Charlie between vision and opportunity. HERBERT MUSCHAMP

HEADLINE: Diagnosing Realities of Health Care Reform;
Parity for Mental Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Health reform measures unveiled by the Clinton Administration offer real hope for better medical care for people with mental and emotional illnesses, but they will have to wait until the year 2001 for comprehensive coverage to become available. We applaud the Administration's bold movement toward coverage of mental illnesses on a par with physical illnesses, but questions remain why this parity cannot be achieved today. 
 Full parity was determined to be too expensive despite the fact that cost estimates were based exclusively upon the use of 10-year-old data from the Health Care Financing Administration. According to the National Mental Health Associations, more timely data from many states and Fortune 500 companies -- representing the actuarial experience of millions of Americans already covered -- demonstrate that a comprehensive, flexible mental health benefit is cost-effective and predictable.
Mental health care is a controllable benefit that can lead to significant national savings in overall care costs, and will reduce losses to the economy due to absenteeism and reduced productivity.
Positive steps toward true health care reform include universal coverage, portability of benefits from job to job, and elimination of exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. The proposal also does away with lifetime caps on mental health coverage which forces many of the most seriously ill into state mental hospitals.
However, the Administration proposal continues arbitrary limits on outpatient services, inpatient hospitalization and community-based health services that do not apply to physical health. Higher co-payments for mental health services will remain in place and continue to restrict access to care. Finally, the proposal adopts a cookie-cutter approach for adults and children, making no distinctions in mental health benefit.
We are most saddened by the Clinton plan's failure to address the special mental health needs of children. Common sense tells us that if we offer intensive mental health and/or substance abuse services to kids in child welfare, special education or juvenile justice systems, we can reduce future problems among these very high-risk groups. Our children continue to be overlooked. Let's not leave them out of this landmark legislation, nor add them on as an afterthought.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Still Trying to Spread Democracy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Theory vs. Practice" (news article, Oct. 1), it is mistakenly argued that President Clinton's recent expressions of caution in undertaking new foreign policy initiatives reflect an abandonment of the Administration's announced policy of supporting democratic "enlargement." The mistake lies in confusing high-profile, expensive interventions, such as that in Somalia or that contemplated in Bosnia, with the long-term efforts of recent American Administrations to extend democracy. 
 Most of America's effort to extend or defend democratic institutions and improve international respect for human rights has been the responsibility of the State Department, the Agency for International Development and the National Endowment for Democracy (and the institutions grouped under it). These efforts are both bilateral and multilateral.
They concentrate on promoting democratic institutions at all levels in developing societies through educational programs and support for non-governmental "watchdog" institutions, as well as improvements in the news media, the judiciary and facilities available to legislatures.
Often support is focused on assuring that elections held in previously authoritarian countries are carried out democratically. In addition, the United States uses the traditional means of "carrot and stick" to support efforts to improve democratic or human rights performance in many countries (through the expansion or curtailment of aid or trade programs in countries as different as China and Peru).
With the end of the cold war, these efforts have been expanding steadily. The most important new efforts have been in assisting democratic transitions in Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union. There is every reason to believe that the Clinton Administration intends to continue this expansion.
Important characteristics of this effort are that the costs are minimal when compared with even small military interventions; the use of violence as an adjunct of American policy is abjured, and the United States does not become "sucked in" to involvements from which extrication becomes difficult if not impossible.
None of this argues that we should not also be willing to use or threaten violent force in situations such as Bosnia. It is only to argue that such willingness is not a necessary concomitant of a commitment to enlarging the areas of the world in which democratic institutions operate effectively.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
What's Best? More Cash For Mortgage or 401(k)?

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane

 BODY:
YOU just received a raise. Would you be better off using the extra money for a bigger contribution to your 401(k) retirement plan or a larger payment on your mortgage?
Like so many other personal finance questions, it is not a black-and-white decision. Your choice depends not only on the interest rates in both categories, but also on your feelings about home ownership and investment risk. 
 Nevertheless, when asked to choose between the two, many financial advisers recommend the retirement account. Because the money is made through a payroll deduction with pretax dollars, the return is usually greater, they say.
"From a long-term standpoint, contribute to a 401(k) plan," said Joel S. Isaacson, president of Joel Isaacson & Company, a New York financial planning firm. "You don't get rich by paying off a mortgage."
Gary Cvach, a partner in the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick, concurred, noting that "a 401(k) plan directly reduces your income." By comparison, the interest on a mortgage merits only a tax deduction, a smaller tax benefit than a reduction in income.
The popular 401(k) plans are established by corporations to allow employees to put a portion of their compensation into special accounts. The money continues to compound tax-free until withdrawn -- typically after retirement -- when an employee is probably in a lower tax bracket.
For 1993, the maximum worker contribution to a 401(k) plan is $8,994. Some employers encourage participation by matching all or part of their employees' dollars.
Most of the arguments in favor of paying down a mortgage instead of adding to a retirement plan emphasize the emotional element of owning a home free and clear. "Owning your home is the American dream and when you have only 20 percent of a home, you have 20 percent of the dream," said Marc Eisenson, publisher of The Banker's Secret Bulletin, a money management newsletter in Elizaville, N.Y. "If I had my choice between losing my home or having a few more dollars in a 401(k), I'd rather not live in a box."
Mr. Eisenson cited discomfort as another factor. "While speculative investments, like stocks, might beat your mortgage, if your heart sinks when the Dow dives, you might want to send some or all of that money upstairs, too," he said. "Pocket change prepayments save homeowners tens of thousands of mortgage dollars."
Mr. Isaacson, the financial planner, has created a financial model to support his assertion that an individual who contributes to a 401(k) plan would receive a greater return. His example assumes that you are in the 30 percent tax bracket, have $8,000 a year to spend and would earn 7 percent on your 401(k) investment or pay 7 percent for a mortgage.
After 10 years, you would have accumulated $110,531 in a 401(k) plan, while paying down only $70,108 on the mortgage. Assuming 30 percent of the retirement money went to taxes, you would still have $77,372, a $7,265 advantage over the net return for paying off the mortgage.
The discrepancy grows with a longer time frame. Subtracting taxes, the retirement plan's net return would be $46,531 more than the mortgage paydown after 20 years and $163,249 more after 30 years.
"When you use the money to pay off a house, you have simply taken liquid assets and made them illiquid," Mr. Isaacson said. "Investing in a 401(k) plan is better."

Complaints Against Brokers
 
Q. How can a client initiate arbitration when he has a complaint against a stockbroker?
 DAN HARRISON, Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.
 
A. Arbitration is the method used by member firms of the nation's major securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers for resolving disputes with their clients. These brokerage firms require individuals to arbitrate, rather than litigate, claims or controversies -- a process that is intended to make decision-making faster and cheaper. 
 When opening a brokerage account, "the investor must sign an agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration," said James E. Buck, senior vice president of the New York Stock Exchange. To begin an aribtration, the investor has to "provide a typewritten statement describing his or her claim and pay a filing fee, which varies depending on the size of the claim," he said.
Among the most frequent complaints that investors bring against brokers at arbitration hearings are excessive trading for the purpose of generating commissions (a practice often called churning), and providing misleading information about investments.
 
I.R.A. Distributions
 
Q. When I reach 70 1/2 and must begin taking distributions from my I.R.A. at a brokerage firm, will I have to liquidate some of the stock if there is not enough cash in the account?
 BETTY L. SHAVE, Amityville, L.I.
 
A. Not necessarily. Although distributions from an individual retirement account are normally made in cash, they do not have to be. They can be a transfer of securities or an annuity contract.
"The amount taxable is generally the fair market value of the assets transferred, or deemed transferred, as of the date of the distribution," said Edward Mendlowitz, a partner in the New York certified public accounting firm of Mendlowitz Weitsen. "However, there are special rules when the assets are pledged or where life insurance is part of the transaction."
 
Evaluating Premium Bonds
 
Q. Are there any advantages to buying premium bonds?
 NEIL MORAN, Floral Park, L.I.
 
A. A premium bond is a bond that was issued with a higher interest rate than is available today and therefore sells now at a higher price than it will be worth at maturity. If the extra interest income more than offsets the loss you will suffer when the bond matures, it may be worthwhile to buy a premium bond.
Another reason that premium bonds usually yield more than comparable bonds selling at par is less demand. Many individuals and institutions avoid buying bonds at a premium because of such factors as more complicated accounting, tax ramifications and the effects of early redemptions of the bonds.
"Pre-refunded tax-free bonds, collateralized with U.S. Government securities, almost always sell at a premium," said William K. Joseph, senior vice president of Smith Barney Shearson. "As long as the yield is competitive, these bonds are safe, secure and attractive."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN HAITI;
PRESIDENT ORDERS SIX U.S. WARSHIPS FOR HAITI PATROL

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton ordered six American warships into the waters off Haiti today with instructions to stop and board any ships that appeared to be violating the reimposed United Nations embargo on the turbulent nation.
The President also dispatched a reinforced Marine company to the nearby Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, and Administration officials said they expected ships from Canada, France and Argentina to join the naval cordon. 
 If needed, the officials said, the troops and ships would be used to evacuate the 1,000-odd Americans still in Haiti. Part or all of the staff of the United States Embassy, and United Nations diplomats as well, could also be pulled out if this week's violence threatened to burst out of control.
 
Addresses Haitian Military
 "The military authorities in Haiti simply must understand that they cannot indefinitely defy the desires of their own people as well as the will of the world community," the President declared this afternoon.
Mr. Clinton, who has been heavily criticized in recent days for his handling of the Somalia and Haiti crises, sought to send a firm message, and some of his aides encouraged comparisons to the naval blockade imposed by John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. But as in his speech on Somalia earlier this week, the President's manner was more subdued than his words.
Haiti's defiant military and police leaders, who were scheduled to step down today under an accord brokered earlier this year by the United Nations, refused to do so. A White House aide said that at a meeting in Port-au-Prince with Lawrence A. Pezzullo, President Clinton's special envoy, the military leader, Gen. Raoul Cedras, "yielded not a single centimeter." [Page 4.]
 
U.N. Monitors Moved
 As a precautionary measure, the United Nations pulled its human rights monitors, scattered around the Haitian countryside, back into the capital, where conditions are considered a bit safer, and began to evacuate them.
"The ships and troops have an important symbolic function," a State Department official said. "We want these people to realize that we are willing to back up our words with force. Maybe they will think twice before they resort to bad behavior again. Conceivably we may even save a few lives."
At a brief news conference that came 24 hours after the assassination of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Justice Minister, Guy Malary, Mr. Clinton said he was "very concerned about the safety of Americans there." He also declared a broad United States interest in "promoting democracy in a place where such a large number of Haitians have clearly expressed their preference for President."
Father Aristide, who won the Haitian presidential election in 1990, has been living in Washington since being deposed by a military coup in September 1991. Today's steps by the United States and other countries, intended to supplement the United Nations sanctions voted on Thursday and due to take effect on Monday, are part of an effort to return him to power by Oct. 30, the deadline set by an agreement reached by Father Aristide and the military government in July.
To encourage other countries to join in the naval action, the United States asked the United Nations to authorize member governments to do whatever was necessary to enforce the embargo, "and in particular to halt inward maritime shipping as necessary in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destinations."
The Chinese delegation, which has a veto in the Security Council, asked for a delay to seek instructions from Beijing, and a decision on the request was put off until Saturday.
Father Aristide wrote today to the Governments of the United States, Canada, France and Venezuela, the so-called "four friends" that have been aiding the democratization effort in Haiti, asking them to take steps to protect members of his Government in the wake of the killing of Mr. Malary.
Mr. Clinton declined to say what the United States would do about that request. Administration officials said new security arrangements were being made, indicating that these did not involve the dispatch of American troops to Haiti anytime soon.
In what he later called "an offhand suggestion," President Aristide's lawyer, Michael Barnes, suggested at a news conference that one way to provide additional security for the ministers as well as American diplomats might be to beef up the Marine detail already on duty protecting the Embassy.
"That is something that I have not ruled out,"' Mr. Clinton commented.
In other moves intended to increase the pressure on those who have been fomenting violence in Haiti, the President said he would freeze the assets in American banks and revoke United States visas of those involved in blocking the transition to democratic control there. The State Department advised Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the potential for further disturbances.
Mr. Pezzullo headed back to the United States tonight, but the newly arrived American Ambassador, William Swing, remained behind in Port-au-Prince.
The American flotilla began forming near the island tonight with the arrival of the cruiser Sterett. Two other cruisers, the Vicksburg and the Gettysburg, both members of the $1 billion Aegis class, with sophisticated electronic monitoring equipment; two frigates, the Klakring and the Jack Williams, and a destroyer, the Caron, will arrive by nightfall Saturday, officials said.
Seeking to insure that no merchant ships take contraband oil, guns or other forbidden cargo to Haiti, the United States ships will rely on considerable experience in seeking to stem the flow of illegal drugs.
Mr. Clinton betrayed his lack of knowledge of military nomenclature in making his announcement.
He referred not to three cruisers, two frigates and a destroyer but to six destroyers, and he said he was placing an infantry company on alert when in fact the unit involved came from the Marine Corps, not the Army.
It is a reinforced company of 450 to 600 Marines, drawn from the Second Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, N.C. Once at Guantanamo, it will remain ready to move on at extremely short notice, with gear packed and transport standing by.
The President said he was not ordering a blockade as that word is understood in international law, but conceded that in layman's terms that was precisely what he had done.

HEADLINE: An Unfettered Milken Has Lessons to Teach

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Michael Milken is back from prison and forever barred from the Wall Street world of high-risk financing where he fell from reigning master to disgraced convict. But the tattered mogul hardly seems east of Eden these days as he buoyantly teaches his weekly class of young M.B.A. candidates much, if not all, that he has learned.
"Can you suggest when you'd use the zero-coupon bond?" he asks, endlessly animated as he moves about the classroom of 57 students who seek to enter that chastened world now forbidden to him. They sit raptly, knowing they are being taught by a man of fabulous wealth and considerable resiliency, a man who chuckles at academic business notions and stands as the epitome of real-world experience, 22 months of prison time for securities fraud included.
 
Worshipful Undergraduates
 Across the corridor from his class here at the University of California at Los Angeles, an overflow crowd of worshipful undergraduates, a few commuting for the night from distant campuses, audit the master's lessons. They watch the television screen as if it were a futuristic stock ticker. 
 "We're going to look at securitized business loans," Mr. Milken announces with a boyish smile that acknowledges his own notoriety. "I think that sounds better than 'junk bonds,' " he says of the risky but lucrative financial tool that he made his virtuoso instrument and that finally broke him as the most celebrated miscreant of what became known as the greed decade, the 1980's.
All of this is not quite behind him as the 47-year-old Mr. Milken, a bald, lean, avid-eyed figure who resembles the actor John Malkovich, scrambles back into public life with a certain air of unrepentance.
 
Galileo and Other Visionaries
 Ask him about the financing techniques that eventually scandalized Wall Street and saw him confess to six counts of securities fraud, and Mr. Milken discusses Galileo and other penalized visionaries proved right byhistory. Ask him about the decade of greed, and he talks of misperception becoming reality, citing data to argue that donations adjusted for inflation show Americans in general as charitable, not greedy, in the 1980's. Ask him about specific Americans prosecuted as principals in the biggest insider trading ring in financial history, and Mr. Milken urges the world to await his book on the subject.
"If there's no risk, there's no future," he says repeatedly, having to marshal his comeback on the cusp of the financial world since he left prison in January.
Still rich and self-confident after paying more than a billion dollars in penalties and settlements, Michael R. Milken is creating an educational television network and using himself as the prototype for new TV teaching methods. At a minimum, there are 600 graduate business schools as a potential market, he notes, plus an even larger world of gifted professors in all disciplines who might be recorded and disseminated in new ways that tap the modern electronic media's powers of entertainment and information.
 
Look at the Bottom Line
 Thus is his new vocation classic Milken in scope. Even his untelegenic wardrobe of blue suit jacket and brown pants and tie signals he is a man of bottom-line fanaticism, not Wall Street foppery. In his guest lectures here at the John E. Anderson School of Management, five cameras of his own production company record his every move for later editing and graphics-enrichment into a kind of Milken-become-Donahue approach to life after Wall Street.
"He is a great man -- a martyr, not a crook," insists one student, Scott Ragsdale, ardently absorbing all the Milken he can. "It's not fair, punishing him simply because society can not understand how one man could make $500 million in a single year."
University officials here are more restrained in citing the principles of academic freedom in explaining to the curious and the complaining alike that while they share the California copyright in Mr. Milken's new venture, he is an independent, unpaid guest who happened to become the star of the Management 298D course run by a friend, Bradford Cornell.
"There he is!" comes a cry from a crowd gathered outside room 2343 as Mr. Milken arrives with a retinue that includes two very active Wall Street traders, longtime friends and canny dealers who seem honored to help out. The onlookers include at least one skeptic, Danny Stolarsky, a 19-year-old science undergraduate. "I resent Milken's being here," the student says. "This is an institution of higher education, not a place for opportunists to make money."
That it can be both is the point of Mr. Milken's teaching mission. He is an innovator who became famous after he removed himself and his loyalist crew of investment bankers from New York, resettling here in his native state to focus better on stimulating Wall Street's credit-pumping heart. He set up an outpost of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. that through his junk-bond deals became the tail that wagged the dog and ultimately shook the Street.
 
Booming With Junk Bonds
 Getting the trading-day jump at 4 A.M. here, Mr. Milken was the adrenalized fulcrum of a big X-shaped dealing desk shared by his crew. It was a high-tech umbilical cord to Wall Street, eventually the fabled center of a universe of booming, high-yield junk bond financing that underpinned some of the flimsiest as well as some of the most creative ventures of the 1980's.
This financing was a factor in the decade's savings and loan debacle, in the arbitrage schemes of Ivan Boesky, and in the Wall Street frenzy of cannibalistic leveraged buy-outs. But Mr. Milken cannot help reminding an interviewer from CNN outside his classroom that his high-risk loan dynamics also gave life to CNN itself, and to MCI and other new age companies.
 
Relish for New Role
 As an ex-convict, Mr. Milken, tanned and hyperkinetic, says he lately needs an extra hour of sleep beyond the five hours he allowed himself as a junk-bond king. It may be hard to believe him when he insists he was growing tired of Wall Street even before he was banished from it. But there is no denying he relishes the role of teacher, of explaining how Wall Street really works and shattering some cliches of academia before his book-weary students.
"He is the smartest man in this country," says Art Stanyakovsky, a Soviet emigre and 24-year-old law student who is auditing the Milken series of 10 three-hour classes on Wednesday nights as if it were Aristotle teaching Adam Smith. "He was destroyed just because he stood against the Establishment."
James B. Stewart, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who wrote "Den of Thieves," a study of the corrupt trading manipulations of the 80's, has detailed how Mr. Milken spent extra millions beyond legal fees on public relations experts to spread this very idea that he is a misunderstood genius of creative finance, not of creative thievery.
Even in explaining the criminal case of sham transactions and customer cheating against Mr. Milken, the book concedes he is "a genius salesman" and meticulous researcher. He paid enough attention to economic history to rediscover the value of organizing the overlooked, low-grade bonds of corporate finance into diversified high-yield ventures with which he created masses of fresh investment capital and a personal fortune.
All this will be mere prologue if Mr. Milken has his way in wiring his busy new life. This includes three years of court-mandated full-time community service in which he is pursuing a long-running interest in after-school tutoring innovations for junior high school students here. At a minimum, he seems methodical and avid about building his post-prison role. He said he recently discovered he has prostate cancer. This problem has become a newly capitalized research cause for one of the Milken foundations' grants, part of his remaining empire estimated to run still into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Mr. Milken is different from so many other celebrated white-collar felons in having no tale of personal conversion or zealous expiation to offer from his minimum-security months in a Federal prison camp in Pleasanton, Calif. He shows no sign of hungering after vengeance as he dreams of history with intimations of Galileo. But he cannot resist inquiring about the New York mayoral race, then smiling in open pleasure at the polls' reading that the candidacy of his Federal prosecutor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, remains an uphill, high-risk venture.
Free and full of ideas, Michael Milken would have us believe his prison time was only another pragmatic deal in a life of dealing. He can be amused in recalling parts of it. Among the jailhouse sustenance offered by outside fans were 22 copies of "Atlas Shrugged," the cult novel by Ayn Rand about willful, Promethean characters.
"I had not read it since the 60's," says Mr. Milken, chatting after teaching his fledgling successors all about Wall Street. "In retrospect, I'd have been better off had I re-read it in the early 80's," he adds, smiling and admitting he could have used a caution against hubris in that especially rich time right before his downfall.

Visionary Apple Chairman Moves On

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15

 BODY:
John Sculley brought an era to an end in Silicon Valley today by resigning from Apple Computer Inc., the innovative company he joined 10 years ago and built into a giant in the personal computer industry.
Mr. Sculley, a former Pepisco Inc. executive, made his mark by bringing marketing skills and corporate discipline to Apple, a company founded in Steven P. Jobs's parents' garage. During Mr. Sculley's reign the company's sales grew tenfold, from $800 million a year to $8 billion, and he was credited with helping the industry push the personal computer beyond office desktops and into the homes and onto the laps of America. 
 "His contribution to the field was significant," said Nicholas Negroponte, the director of the media laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "He can almost single-handedly be credited with America's re-entry into consumer electronics."
But in recent months, as Apple has stumbled financially, Mr. Sculley was criticized as having failed to attend to the details of its business while playing the roles of industry luminary, informal Presidential technology adviser and apostle of the creed of "convergence" -- the confluence of computers, communications, publishing and entertainment.
In June, a few weeks before Apple announced a $188.3 million third-quarter loss, Mr. Sculley relinquished the title of chief executive to the president, Michael Spindler. Today, a day after the company surprised Wall Street by posting a fourth-quarter profit, Mr. Sculley stepped down as chairman. He did not publicly indicate his plans other than to say in a statement that after "an extraordinary journey" he was "ready to head off to new challenges."
Mr. Sculley, 54, is being replaced as chairman by A. C. Markkula Jr., 51, a co-founder of Apple with Mr. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak in 1976. Mr. Markkula was previously chairman of Apple from 1977 until 1988.
Apple's shares jumped $4.50 each today, closing at $28.25 in Nasdaq trading. The surge follows the release of Apple's earnings report on Thursday evening after the stock market closed.
Mr. Sculley was not available for further comment today. Although his name has been floated as a candidate for several top corporate jobs, including the chief executive's position at Eastman Kodak, people close to him say he is more interested in finding a position that would allow him to pursue his vision of "convergence."
In the absence of Mr. Sculley's own explanations, it was left for industry executives to consider his legacy.
"His departure indicates that the phase of rapid growth in personal computing has come to an end," said Michael Borrus, a computer industry expert and co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on International Economics. "It's probably appropriate that someone else steward the company through the next phase."
Two years ago, in an attempt to cope in a changing industry, Mr. Sculley steered the company into an unprecedented alliance with the world's largest computer maker, I.B.M. He also led Apple directly into the consumer market with the introduction of the Newton Messagepad, a hand-held computer designed to recognize handwriting. Neither venture has yet proved a success.
Moreover, despite Apple's rapid growth, Mr. Sculley has been faulted for being too slow to respond to an assault on the company by rival computer makers whose machines are powered by Intel Corporation chips and run Microsoft Corporation software. Apple computers are based on the company's own software and use chips from Motorola Inc.
Many industry executives say they think Mr. Sculley missed an opportunity in the late 1980's to move Apple's Macintosh software to Intel-based computers before Microsoft was able to popularize its Windows program, which imitates the graphical Macintosh approach to computing. Many analysts also say he was too slow in reducing Apple's prices during the continuing personal computer industry price war, thereby losing valuable market share that the company has yet to reclaim.
Mr. Sculley's resignation as chairman came less than four months after he gave up the chief executive post following a board room drama full of intrigue, during which Mr. Spindler was made chief executive. Soon afterward the Cupertino, Calif., company laid off about 2,500 employees and reported the $188.3 million quarterly loss, its largest ever.
Today, an executive close to Apple's board said the directors had decided at a meeting in June that Mr. Sculley would leave the company before the end of October.
Neither Mr. Markkula nor Mr. Spindler was available for comment yesterday. "For the past 10 years, John Sculley has had one of the most compelling and articulate visions of how computing technology can improve the lives of people everywhere," Mr. Markkula said in a statement released by the company.
Mr. Sculley was president of Pepsico in 1983 when he was hired at Apple by Mr. Jobs. The two were initially close friends, but in 1985, after the Macintosh personal computer was introduced and was slow to gain momentum, they quarreled. Mr. Jobs was stripped of his position as head of the Macintosh division and left the company soon afterward.
Mr. Sculley was made chairman and proceeded to oversee the success of the Macintosh, which grew in popularity in part because of its success in desktop-publishing applications.
Although Mr. Sculley had originally been brought to Apple as a professional manager, after Mr. Jobs departed he increasingly styled himself as a visionary.
"What surprised me about John was that he changed from being the day-to-day manager to a visionary," said William H. Hambrecht, the president of Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment banking firm, which underwrote Apple's initial public offering in 1981. "I think he did a good job that way."
Mr. Sculley, who was paid $1.65 million in salary and bonus in 1992, owns less than 1 percent of Apple's stock.

HEADLINE: Price Data Flat, Curbing Cost-of-Living Raises

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Fifty million Americans who collect Social Security and other Federal benefits will get cost-of-living increases of only 2.6 percent for 1994, the Government announced today.
The increase, the second-smallest annual rise since the payments were automatically linked to inflation in 1975, was based on data released today showing that consumer price inflation had vanished in September. 
 The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers is to go up $17, to $674. The only percentage increase smaller than today's was the 1.3 percent rise in 1987, which reflected a collapse in oil prices.
Interest rates plunged on the news that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in September. The 30-year Treasury bond's yield, which fell on Thursday on news that September producer price inflation was unexpectedly low, declined sharply again today. [Page 48.]
Inflation has retreated sharply in the last three years. Indeed, with September's data, the annual inflation rate fell below last year's 2.9 percent rate for the first time this year, dropping to a 2.5 percent annual rate.
But some economists interpret the low inflation numbers as a mixed message.
"It's good news and bad news," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Chemical Banking Corporation. "Economic conditions have to be pretty weak for consumer prices to be steady."
Indeed, the Federal Reserve reported today that industrial output in September edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent, while industry operated at 81.6 percent of capacity in the month, a level essentially unchanged since February.
The inflation report was a mixed indicator for many individuals as well as for the economy. While consumers benefit from soft prices, those relying on interest income suffer from the low rates that low inflation has brought.
And consumers with heavy medical costs will find that the 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustments to their wages or their Social Security benefits are not enough to maintain this year's purchasing power. The medical component of the Consumer Price Index, which ticked up last month after an exceptionally low reading in August, has climbed 5.7 percent over the last 12 months, more than twice the 2.7 percent inflation for the Consumer Price Index as a whole in the 12-month period.
Horace D. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, also noted that many low-income elderly people would be getting a small Social Security increase accompanied by a rise of $4.50, to $41.10 a month, in what they pay for Medicare Part B coverage.
The cost-of-living adjustments are based on the amount by which the Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers rose between the third quarter of 1992 and the third quarter of 1993. This index is slightly different from the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, the one on which detailed news coverage is usually focused.
The 2.6 percent Social Security increase applies to about 45 million people collecting regular and supplemental benefits and to another five million in other Federal programs, mainly Civil Service and military retirees.
 
White House Is Pleased
 At the White House, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chief economic adviser to President Clinton, hailed the surprisingly low September Consumer Price Index and said "there don't seem to be out there any factors that would cause inflation to pick up in the near term."
But as the report was prompting another scramble to buy bonds and shorter-term debt, some private analysts noted temporary factors holding down September's inflation and cautioned that October might bring an unpleasant surprise.
They cited the 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase in the Federal gasoline tax that took effect at the beginning of this month. Other factors involve apparel, for which a six-tenths of 1 percent decline last month is unlikely to be repeated, and tobacco, which has already reflected the bulk of discounts from the industry's price war. At the producer level, in fact, tobacco prices rose last month.
Indeed, it is quite possible that the Consumer Price Index for this month will show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent, perhaps even more, one Labor Department official suggested.
 
A Broad-Based Trend
 Still, September was almost uniformly favorable, with the so-called core rate, which excludes food and energy, edging up just one-tenth of 1 percent after rising three-tenths of 1 percent in August.
This gauge shows a steady decline this year from a 4.3 percent pace in the first quarter to 2.9 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, in the second and third quarters.
The cost of medical care rose four-tenths of 1 percent in September, today's report showed, the same increase as in June and July but up from a two-tenths rise in August. The biggest factor was a rise in professional and hospital services.
So far this year, medical inflation has been 5.6 percent, a pace that if maintained for the rest of the year would be the lowest since 1973.
The Social Security cost-of-living data, published by the Department of Health and Human Services, showed that benefits for an elderly couple would rise to $1,140 from $1,111; for a widowed mother with two children to $1,316 from $1,282; for an elderly widow or widower to $631 from $615, and for a disabled worker with a spouse and one or more children to $1,092 from $1,064.
The amount that retired people can earn tax free rises to $11,160 a year from $10,560 for those age 65 through 69 and to $8,040 from $7,680, for those under 65.
As for the industrial production data, the overall rise of two-tenths of 1 percent last month mainly reflected a jump in car and truck assembly, to a 10 million annual pace. Factories raised production four-tenths of 1 percent, but utility output slumped 3.1 percent after sharp increases during an exceptionally hot summer, the Federal Reserve report stated.

HEADLINE: After Wrangling, House Supports Extending Extra Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
After more than two weeks of wrangling, the House voted today to extend the program of emergency unemployment benefits for workers who have been jobless for more than six months and have exhausted their state assistance.
It is the fifth extension of emergency Federal unemployment benefits since November 1991 and is intended to continue helping the 60,000 unemployed workers who become eligible for such assistance every week. 
 The one-sided 302-to-95 vote was deceptive. Less than 24 hours before, a coalition of Democrats and Republicans embarrassed the House Democratic leadership by rejecting a similar plan on a procedural vote of 274 to 149. An extension has been expected to receive full Congressional approval eventually, but the wrangling could have delayed the resumption of the benefits. The last extension expired on Oct. 2.
The problem arose before the first vote on Thursday. At issue was a provision that would prevent immigrants who have been in this country less than five years from obtaining Supplemental Security Income, the welfare program for the blind, elderly and disabled. These benefits are now available to immigrants after three years.
 
Money-Saving Move
 Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, had proposed the change as a way of saving $331 million to pay for the extension in unemployment benefits. A Congressional budget rule requires that the cost of extending the unemployment assistance be offset by either tax increases or spending cuts.
But the Democratic leadership dropped the Rostenkowski plan in the face of impassioned opposition by Hispanic members. The leaders instead proposed to save the same amount of money by extending the program for three months instead of four. But the concession to Hispanic members caused support among Democratic members to erode and led to the rejection on Thursday.
The bill passed today after the Hispanic members accepted defeat and dropped their insistence on retaining the current welfare policy for immigrants.
The legislation that passed today would extend the unemployment program for four months and includes the change in the the welfare program. Having the Administration's strong support, it is expected to pass the Senate.
"The caucus fought hard on this bill and will continue to battle against those who would make impoverished legal immigrants scapegoats for our problems," said Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx and chairman of the Hispanic caucus.
Mr. Rostenkowski praised the bill during the House debate. "The assistance we provide" for the unemployed, he said, "will in many cases mean the difference between scraping by or plunging into poverty."
Currently, 2.5 million people are receiving state jobless assistance. Another 1.4 million were receiving the Federal emergency benefits before that program expired on Oct. 2. The emergency benefits program would provide extra jobless benefits for seven weeks, except for those in Alaska, California, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Puerto Rico. In those states, where the unemployment rate is above 9 percent, the extension would be 13 weeks.
The average benefit is $179 a week.
Of the 95 lawmakers who voted against the extension today, 80 were Republicans and 15 were Democrats. Conservative Republicans led the opposition to the measure, saying the Government could not afford it.
"Unemployment is going down," said Representative David Dreier, Republican of California. "Nationwide, things are going better. Maybe it's time to consider these extended benefits may be contributing to the problem."

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue Climb; Dow Advances by 8.10

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The stock market posted its third gain in a row yesterday, although some profit taking pulled prices down from their afternoon highs.
Contributing to the market's gains was the sharp rally in bond prices following the Government's favorable report on inflation. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the Nasdaq composite index and the American Stock Exchange index all finished again at record levels, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.10 points to close at 3,629.73. For the week, the Dow gained 44.99 points.
"The somewhat better-than-expected inflation numbers and the good bond market makes equities even more attractive," said Lawrence R. Rice, chief market strategist of Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "We are winding up the week with a good environment."
The Government reported yesterday that the Consumer Price Index was unchanged in September, putting the annual inflation rate at 2.5 percent. The news followed Thursday's report that wholesale price inflation was unexpectedly low last month.
The inflation report yesterday sent bond prices surging, as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell sharply to 5.78 percent. With few inflationary pressures, many analysts say, interest rates could decline even further. Low interest rates make stocks more attractive as investors seek higher returns on their money.
A number of stock options expired yesterday, but traders said the expirations had little effect on the market.
"I could hardly notice it," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Smith Barney Shearson. "If anything, it gave the market a slight lift at the close."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange continued to soar, with 366.1 million shares changing hands, up from 352.5 million shares on Thursday. On the American Stock Exchange, volume reached 42.9 million shares, just short of the record 43.4 million shares traded on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after the big market crash.
Shares of Apple Computer vaulted 4 1/2, to 28 1/4, in Nasdaq trading. Late Thursday, the computer maker reported a small profit, even though most analysts had anticipated a loss. Yesterday, John Sculley stepped down as Apple's chairman.
 
Personal Computer Companies
 Other personal computer companies also rose, with Dell gaining 1, to 18 3/4, and Compaq increasing 3/4, to 61 5/8.
Shares of the Baby Bells were higher for the second consecutive day, with many investors said to be considering them as potential growth stocks instead of as traditional utilities. BellSouth gained 1 5/8, to 62 1/4; Ameritech advanced 1/4, to 87 3/8, and U S West rose 1/4, to 49 7/8.
There was also a lift in the steels, following Thursday's big gains for the automobile stocks. USX-U.S. Steel was up 1/2, to 31 1/8, and Bethlehem Steel was up 1/4, to 14 1/2.
Among other issues, Texas Instruments was a standout, jumping 2 7/8, to 65 7/8, after recording stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings.
Kellogg, which similarly beat the expectations of analysts for third-quarter net income, advanced 3 1/4, to 56. And Snapple also posted a large gain, climbing 2 3/8, to 25 1/4, after saying that its third-quarter profits are likely to triple the earnings of the period a year ago.
On the other hand, Rohm & Haas fell 1 7/8, to 47 7/8. The company said that it is projecting a third-quarter loss and will restate its first-quarter earnings for an accounting change.
In Japan, stocks rose modestly. The 225-share Nikkei average ended up 91.61 points, or 0.46 percent, at 20,174.42.

HEADLINE: Whitman Makes Public '90 Taxes

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
After months of badgering by Gov. Jim Florio, Christine Todd Whitman released her 1990 income tax returns today and confirmed again, to no surprise, that she is rich.
The returns showed that Mrs. Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, and her husband, John, reported gross total income of $4,047,051 in 1990 -- $3.33 million in taxable income -- on which they paid $936,670 in Federal taxes and $254,293 in New Jersey and New York State and City taxes. 
 Mr. Whitman was the principal wage-earner in the family, receiving a nearly $2.6 million bonus from Prudential Bache Securities, where he was a financial consultant. The couple also received capital gains of $850,800, which accounted for another large chunk of their income.
After reviewing the returns, the Florio campaign -- which had criticized Mrs. Whitman for releasing returns for 1989, 1991 and 1992 but not 1990 -- raised questions about a refund of $235,648 from New York State. But despite months of innuendo and implication by the Governor, there were no major surprises immediately evident in the documents that Mrs. Whitman released today.
 
'Lusting' for a Return?
 "The Governor apparently was lusting after this 1990 tax return," said Carl Golden, a spokesman for the Whitman campaign. "I don't know what he thought was in there. Maybe now he'll come out of hiding and talk about jobs, taxes and the economy and stop nit-picking."
The Florio campaign, whose style throughout the race has been a hard-hitting and swift attack against Mrs. Whitman at every turn, was uncharacteristically slow to respond today. When it did, the attack was weak.
"The Florio campaign currently is examining Christine Todd Whitman's 1990 tax returns, released to the press only today and obtained by the campaign late in the afternoon," a Florio camp statement said. "The campaign will provide full comment once that analysis is completed."
Jo Astrid Glading, a spokeswoman for the Florio campaign, said the Governor had only sought from Mrs. Whitman the same information her campaign had asked of him in July.
"It has taken Mrs. Whitman nearly three years to release these documents," she said. "It will take us more than a day to analyze them."
In response to questions about the $235,648 refund the couple received from New York State, Mr. Golden, the Whitman spokesman, said the refund was the result of an overpayment based on the bonus that Mr. Whitman received at the end of 1990.
The returns showed that the Whitmans made a large profit very quickly, trading stock options in Great Northern Nekoosa shortly before the company was acquired by the Georgia Pacific Corporation. The return did not show when the options were purchased, but it clearly was before traders were sure that the takeover would happen. The Whitmans made a profit of $23,068 on an investment of just $1,128.
The biggest capital gain reported by the Whitmans came from the sale of stock in the Specialty Materials Corporation, a privately held steel company that was purchased by a French firm. The stock, which they acquired in 1986 for $76,211, was sold in 1990 for $981,553.
But there were also losses on other investments. The Whitmans reported a loss of $62,502 on $68,752 in warrants to buy shares of Dr. Pepper Seven-Up. And a $156,000 investment that was made in the privately held Fortress Corporation in 1989 was sold on the last day of 1990 for $1, providing a loss that offset income from the Specialty Materials deal.
A spokesman for the Whitman campaign said only Mr. Whitman could discuss the investments, and he was not available to comment.
The Whitmans' 1990 income was five times the $600,000 gross income they reported in 1991, but only relatively higher than the total income of $3,597,063 they reported in 1992.
In 1992 the Whitmans paid more than $1.3 million in taxes to the Federal Government and the states of New Jersey and New York. They were due refunds of nearly $131,000.
Mr. Florio and his wife, Lucinda, released their Federal and state income tax returns in April. They paid $30,160 in Federal taxes and $8,237 in New Jersey taxes on an income of $171,106. Most of their income was from Mr. Florio's $85,000-a-year salary as Governor and his official expense account of $75,000.
Mrs. Whitman was not compelled by state election law to make her tax returns public, but she was under tremendous political pressure to do so. She had said she had far exceeded disclosure requirements, having released her 1989, 1991 and 1992 tax returns in August.
 
Comes From Old Money
 Mrs. Whitman said she saw no reason to release her 1990 returns because she was a private citizen in 1991, when the returns were prepared. She resigned as president of the State Board of Public Utilities in February 1990 to challenge Senator Bill Bradley.
Mrs. Whitman is a member of one of the wealthiest and most politically powerful families in New Jersey. Her father, the late Webster B. Todd, was Republican state chairman for a decade, a major figure in the national party and a building contractor whose projects included Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.
Mr. Florio has tried to make Mrs. Whitman's wealth an issue in the campaign. He has tried to paint her as an elitist who is out of touch with the average voter and has made her refusal to release the return an integral part of his stump speech, hinting that she was trying to hide some politically damaging information.
On Monday the Whitman campaign announced that she would release the 1990 returns by the end of the week in order to silence Mr. Florio on the issue.

HEADLINE: Big Rally Puts 30-Year Bond at 5.78%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell yesterday to levels not seen since the late 1960's, pushed lower by another highly favorable report on inflation.
The Government's report that its Consumer Price Index was unchanged in September set off a flood of buy orders for 30-year Treasury bonds, quickly pushing the bond's yield down to 5.78 percent, from 5.85 percent late Thursday. 
 The consumer price report was the second consecutive low-inflation number. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices rose an unexpectedly weak two-tenths of a percent last month.
Taken together, the reports made unusually sweet reading for credit market analysts. They said the inflation outlook not only made a rise in interest rates unlikely, but that for the time being the Federal Reserve Board had achieved its oft-stated goal of price stability.
Over the last 12 months, consumer prices have risen 2.7 percent. And the shorter-term trend is even more impressive: over the last six months, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent, and in the last three months at an annual rate of 1.4 percent.
"I would be willing to say right now that inflation is not an important factor in economic decision making, and by that criteria the Fed has reached its objective," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "It is ironic that at the time the Fed is probably enjoying its greatest success, they are probably facing their greatest challenge from legislators."
Reprseentative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee and a longstanding critic of the secretive way the Fed conducts monetary policy, began hearings earlier this week intended to fashion legislation that would force the Fed to open up its policy-making process. The Clinton Administration, for its part, has said it sees no need to change the way the central bank conducts its business.
Any legislation fashioned along the lines that Mr. Gonzalez favors would be a distinct negative for the credit markets, analysts said. But aside from that, they said there was little reason to feel uncomfortable about the outlook for bonds.
"You can't get bearish here," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities. "The inflation performance has been so favorable that it's hard to come up with a bad scenario."
Yesterday's price movements in the secondary market for Treasury securities suggest that traders largely share that view.
Two days of strong rallies often lead to profit taking, especially when the second day is a Friday. That did not happen yesterday.
"Nobody wants to take any profits over the weekend," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "As long as the inflation news remains benign, short rates will stay pretty constant, and long rates will continue to come down. I can't think of a better environment for investors in financial assets. It's almost scary, it looks so good."
Because of the increase in Federal gasoline taxes, economists do not anticipate that October's consumer price numbers will come close to matching the September performance. But inflation expectations in the bond market are receding, the analysts said, so one month of disappointing inflation figures will probably not spook the market.
In the secondary Treasury market, the 6 1/2 percent 30-year bonds of 2023 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10619/32 , up nearly a point, to yield 5.78 percent, compared with 5.85 percent late Thursday. The drop set a new 25-year low for long-term bond yields. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
Among Treasury notes, the 5 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 10414/32 , up 10/32 , to yield 5.16 percent. It is the lowest yield level on a 10-year note since 1967.
Because the Federal Reserve Board is seen as unlikely to ease monetary policy, short-term interest rates were basically unchanged.
In the corporate bond market, the inflation news prompted a number of companies to price new issues. Among them was the Norwest Corporation, which offered $200 million worth of 30-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 6.65 percent bonds, which are noncallable, were priced at 99.606 to yield 6.68 percent, 72 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 1/2 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Yesterday's flurry of new corporate issues capped a busy week in what has been an exceptionally busy year.
In all, 32 corporate debt issues were priced this week, raising a total of $5.12 billion, according to analysts at MCM Inc.

HEADLINE: August's Trade Deficit Was 6.8% Below July's

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Higher overseas sales of American-made aircraft helped shrink America's foreign trade deficit by 6.8 percent in August, the Commerce Department said today.
Exports grew 3 percent, to $38.2 billion, reversing two months of decline in June and July, while imports increased by only eight-tenths of a percent, to $47.9 billion, putting the deficit at $9.7 billion.
Most of the pickup in exports came from a $707 million increase, to $1.6 billion, in sales of civilian aircraft abroad.
 
Some Problem Areas
 But there were some disquieting elements in the trade report. The deficit with Japan, for example, climbed to $5.26 billion, from $4.74 billion in July, accounting for more than half the overall deficit. The August gap was the widest since a $5.5 billion deficit in April.
And in trade with China, the deficit widened to $2.4 billion in August from $2.3 billion.
The Commerce Department revised the overall July trade deficit up slightly to show a gap of $10.4 billion instead of the previously reported $10.3 billion.
Trade has become a weak spot in the economy because overseas markets remain so soft that exports are unlikely to provide a major push for the slow-paced recovery. The gross domestic product grew at only a 1.3 percent annual rate in the first half of the year and is not expected to get help from foreign trade soon.
"We still believe trade will not add to economic growth before the middle of next year," said Edward Yardeni, an economist at C. J. Lawrence/ Deutsche Bank Securities.
The Commerce Department said trade data for the first eight months of 1993 indicated that the full-year deficit was growing at an annual rate of $115 billion -- well above 1992's total of $84.5 billion deficit.
But Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown noted that August was the second consecutive month that the overall trade deficit had narrowed since touching a high for the year of $12.1 billion in June.
"The need to increase our exports to narrow the deficit remains an important Administration priority," he said.
The White House is pushing on several fronts to open markets abroad, not only by improving access to developed countries like Japan but also to secure a free-trade zone with Mexico's emerging market.
 
Regional Results
 In trade with Mexico during August, the United States had a surplus of $110 million after registering a surplus in July of $108 million.
The trade deficit with Western Europe fell to $813 million, from $1.78 billion in July.
The deficit with Canada, the nation that does the most trade with the United States, fell to $477 million, from $649 million in July.
The cost of imported petroleum products fell to $3.9 billion in August from $4.2 billion in July. The price of a barrel of imported crude oil dropped to $14.53 from $15.
Imports of autos and parts from all sources grew in value by $778 million in August to $8.5 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Against Yen On Signs of Slack Economy

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar firmed against European currencies yesterday but drifted against the yen following reports on the sluggish state of the United States economy.
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.6163 German marks, from 1.6130 marks on Thursday. But it slipped to 107.10 Japanese yen from 107.32 yen. 
 Several reports on the American economy underscored the slow pace of the recovery and slowed the dollar's advance, dealers said.
The Labor Department said consumer prices were unchanged in September, sparking a bond rally that pushed the 30-year Treasury bond yield to a new low of 5.78 percent. Even excluding the volatile food and energy components, consumer prices rose just a tenth of a percent.
Lower interest rates make United States assets relatively less attractive. Even though most dealers said they expected European rates to ease as economies there floundered, the softer United States rates did not encourage dollar purchases.
The dollar was also held back by the latest trade data. While the United States deficit narrowed to $9.71 billion, from $10.42 billion in July, the gap with Japan accounted for half the total and was the biggest since April.
 
Some Encouraging Data
 Jack Griffin, a corporate dealer at Fuji Bank, said the dollar could ease because the figures would heighten trade tensions with Japan. A lower dollar is widely viewed as a corrective to the United States trade deficit.
Other data were more encouraging. September industrial production and August business inventories showed increases of two-tenths of a percent. Consumer confidence also picked up, according to a survey by the University of Michigan.
The dollar was also aided in late trading as the German mark gave up gains against European currencies. Earlier, the mark had posted all-time highs against the French franc. The British pound finished in New York at $1.5132, down from $1.5157 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4280 Swiss francs, up from 1.4230; 5.7260 French francs, up from 5.7043; 1,585 Italian lire, down from 1,589; 35.54 Belgian francs, up from 35.31, and 1.3307 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3253.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Iraqi Exports More Likely; Oil Prices Drop as a Result

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices tumbled yesterday after a United Nations official said for the first time that Iraq was close to meeting most Security Council demands to scrap its weapons.
But the official, Rolf Ekeus, said plans for monitoring Iraqi arms purchases had not been accepted, an essential demand before the Security Council considers lifting the prohibition of Iraqi oil exports. 
 The United Nations has barred Baghdad from selling oil since its army invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Mr. Ekeus said Iraq had complied with all demands in the biological and ballistic missile field and most demands in nuclear weapons. In chemical arms, he said data still needed to be verified before his commission could reach a conclusion.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery fell 23 cents, to $18.27 a barrel.
"What we're doing now is testing the lower end of the price range," said Gerald Samuels of Arb Oil. "Some traders are hesitant to get too bullish based on the way the market acted the last two years during November, when prices fell considerably."
Traders also attributed the drop to weakness in gasoline prices, which had been strong most of the week.
"A lot of it was gasoline breaking 53 cents," said Victor Yu of Refco. "That was a green light for the market to go down."
Unleaded gas for November delivery fell 0.27 cent, to 52.65 cents a gallon; heating oil decined 0.99 cent, to 54.53 cents a gallon, and November natural gas firmed 0.5 cent, to $2.172 for 1,000 cubic feet.
On other commodity markets, precious metals trading turned quiet, with silver prices rising slightly after a steep fall Thursday. The December silver contract gained 0.7 cent, to $4.355 an ounce, while December gold lost 40 cents, to $366.20 an ounce, at the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Government reports showing a slowly growing economy and little inflation had put pressure on silver prices in particular, since silver is primarily a metal used by industry.
Elsewhere, cattle prices continued to rise as traders viewed a recent low as a bottom and supermarket retailers focused on beef. Live cattle for December delivery rose 0.625 cent, to 74.7 cents a pound, while November feeder cattle firmed 0.55 cent, to 85.025 cents.

HEADLINE: Death Benefits Become Living Benefits

BYLINE: By FRANCIS FLAHERTY

 BODY:
Ill with cancer, Patricia North faced a heart-rending problem last year. Her doctor had told her to go immediately to Duke University for a bone-marrow transplant. But her health insurer was taking weeks to decide whether to pay for the $150,000 procedure. What could she do?
Ms. North, a 38-year-old sculptor and painter from Northern California, found a solution in her $200,000 worth of Prudential life insurance policies. She obtained an early payout of more than $190,000 on those standard policies, with the remainder going to Prudential for interest charges and administrative fees. The money financed her care at Duke and enabled her husband to stay with her there for six weeks. 
 "I am the very biggest fan of accelerated benefits," Ms. North said in a recent interview. Like many policyholders who receive such payments, sometimes called living benefits, Ms. North was considered terminally ill by her insurer. "Conventional chemotherapy had not helped, and cancer was going to win" without the transplant, she said. But she is hopeful now, and said her condition had improved since treatment.
Although relatively new, early payouts of life insurance are growing in popularity, and experts applaud the added flexibility. But they caution consumers against using them as a replacement for health insurance or long-term care insurance.
Most important, policyholders should think through several issues -- from family needs to tax implications -- before taking an early payout. And they should get help. "I don't think people should do this without the benefit of professsional advice," said David Petersen, president of Affording Care, a New York-based nonprofit group that counsels the seriously ill about financial matters.
Beneficiaries are the ones who stand to lose, of course, so policyholders must carefully consider their loved ones' needs. "You can't use the money twice," warned Janel Patterson of the American Council of Life Insurance. Policyholders with families and dependent children may want to preserve the death benefit by selling other assets or by borrowing.
Without any dependents, Ms. North did not face this problem. On her policies, her husband was the sole beneficiary.
Prudential alone has awarded $47 million in early payouts to 572 policyholders since January 1990, when it became the nation's first insurer to offer living benefits. Half the policyholders had cancer, 28 percent had AIDS and the rest suffered from other ailments, said Jim Longo, a company spokesman.
More than 150 of the nation's 2,300 life insurers, including Aetna, Cigna and Northwestern Mutual, have followed Prudential's lead. All told, "more than three million policies now have these benefits," Ms. Patterson said. Originally offered only on cash-value policies, living benefits are now available on term and group policies, too.
The payouts can be used for any purpose. Many policyholders, suffering the financial strains of serious illness, spend the money on living or medical expenses. One Prudential policyholder bought his family a washing machine and dryer, and then treated them to a two-week vacation. Another paid off the car and the house to ease the burden on his wife.
Although Ms. North sought the payout to cover medical expenses, her health insurer eventually reimbursed her for the treatment. She then plowed the excess money into a house remodeling project -- which had been in the works when illness struck.
Along with life insurers, about 50 "viatical settlement" companies offer living benefits. A viatical company will pay a portion of a policy's face value in return for being named the policy's beneficiary. Then it pays the premiums until the policyholder dies, recouping its payout plus some from the insurer.
Since first appearing in 1988, viatical companies have bought about $250 million in policies, as measured by face value. "They're growing at the rate of one a month," Mr. Petersen said.
Policyholders considering an early payout should understand how insurers and viatical companies differ. "It's like selling a used car," Mr. Petersen said. "I tell people to shop their policy around to see what offers they'll get."
Prudential's practices are representative of insurers. To get living benefits, a Prudential policyholder generally must be certified by a doctor as having six months or less to live. For these policyholders, the insurer will pay the face amount of the policy, minus a $150 administrative fee and the six months of interest Prudential will presumably lose from the premature payout. No extra premium is charged.
At Prudential's 8 percent interest rate, a policyholder will now get about "95 to 96 percent of the policy's face value," Mr. Longo said. The interest charge is fixed at six months, whatever the policyholder's life expectancy.
Rules vary. Some insurers use a 12-month life expectancy; others, including Prudential, also make payouts to certain nonterminally ill policyholders, like those needing nursing home care or continuous life support. Some set minimum or maximum payouts. And some add 3 percent to 15 percent to premiums for the right to get living benefits. That practice does not appeal to J. Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization. "I think living benefits are basically a good thing," he said. "But why pay for them if I don't use them?"
While viatical companies tend to be more expensive than insurers, they fill a gap in the market and generally place fewer restrictions on payouts. Policyholders whose insurers do not offer living benefits can get early payouts only from viaticals, for instance, and, unlike viaticals, some insurers restrict living benefits to no 50 percent of a policy's face value.
Perhaps most important, people diagnosed with two years to live may be able to get payouts right away from a viatical instead of waiting to qualify for benefits from their insurers.
Among viatical companies, Living Benefits is the nation's oldest and largest. Based in Albuquerque, N.M., the company buys the policies of those with two years or less to live. Like an insurer, the company evaluates a potential client's medical record. But the payout varies based on the policyholder's estimated life expectancy. "Our minimum payout is 60 percent and our maximum is 80 percent" of face value, said Gerry Mandel, the company president.
Some of these companies, however, may be slow in paying. Large ones have cash at the ready, but small ones may have uneven cash flows or merely act as brokers who "shop" policies to investors.
Before selling, a policyholder should verify that the company has money is there. The policyholder should also make sure that the company protects his or her privacy as it seeks payout funds from potential investors.
Currently unregulated, viatical companies would be controlled by state insurance departments under a model law being drafted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Such regulation is welcomed by those who worry about exploitation.
"Older people and sick people are always easy prey," Mr. Hunter said. "At least an insurance company is checked." Such concerns stem partly from stories, some true, of "outrageous, vampire-like ripoffs" in the viatical industry's early days, he said.
Most experts play down these dangers now. "We haven't had a lot of instances" of exploitation, Mr. Petersen said. The consumer gets cash and knows the policy's face value, he explained, and this leaves little room for deception.
In the end, living benefits offer great value to careful policyholders. "If I didn't have this financial freedom, we would have had to put our house on the market in a very poor economy," Ms. North said. "But with the benefits, we wound up remodeling it instead."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Press Clippings From Dinkins

BYLINE: By Todd. S. Purdum

 BODY:

ON THE SCREEN
Black-and-white photo of Rudolph W. Giuliani appears at left while titles repeating the narration flash on a bulletin board background, along with newspaper headlines ("A Victim's Mantle for Mr. Giuliani" and "Rudy's big, muddy guns"). Ominous music plays. Final image is cover of The Village Voice, with unflattering caricature of Mr. Giuliani, over tiny picture of Mr. Dinkins and credit line noting his campaign paid for commercial. As ad ends, black-and-white headline "Department of Dirty Tricks" turns brilliant blue.
 
PRODUCER
Doak, Shrum, Harris, Carrier, Devine of Washington 

THE SCRIPT
Male narrator: "First, Rudolph Giuliani ran ads The New York Times called 'explicitly racial.' Ads 'stirring feelings of racial paranoia.' Now his campaign's in trouble. And he's attacking Mayor Dinkins for everything from his tenure as City Clerk to jobs lost during the Reagan-Bush recession. Some charges are twenty years old, others half-truths and innuendo. More of what The Times called Giuliani's 'politics of disinformation.' But what else would you expect from a man whose last campaign was exposed by The Village Voice as having a "Department of Dirty Tricks."
 
ACCURACY
The Times editorial is quoted accurately, but the ad fails to mention that it also harshly criticized the Mayor's supporters for suggesting that Mr. Giuliani attracted facists, and chided Mr. Dinkins for "tepid disavowals" that were "possibly calculated" to inspire black voters. It is not so clear whose campaign is in trouble. Most polls show the contest is too close to call. Innuendo is in the eye of the beholder, of course, but there has been plenty to go around in the ads of both camps. The Village Voice headline refers to a story about Anthony J. Lombardi, an Internal Revenue Service agent who, the story said, looked into the backgrounds of Dinkins campaign aides in 1989 and inquired into former Mayor Edward I. Koch's sex life. But the story said there was no proof that Mr. Giuliani was aware of this, Mr. Giuliani has denied any involvement, and the Dinkins campaign itself has hired a private detective to look into Mr. Giuliani's record this year.
 
SCORECARD
This commercial, a response to Mr. Giuliani's latest attacks on the Mayor, is a classic of the "Let him that is without sin cast the first stone" genre, and the embodiment of the prevailing maxim that an attack unrebutted is an attack believed. It also uses another classic advertising technique: the expert arbiter -- in this case newspapers with editorial postures as diverse as The Village Voice and The Times -- to buttress its case that the other guy is worse. It tries to paint Mr. Giuliani as the one who started the fighting, but since the ad it criticizes was a response by Mr. Giuliani to attacks from the Dinkins camp, it is not fair to say, "First Rudolph Giuliani ran ads..."; it is hard to tell who did what first. Finally, by continuing to ratchet up harsh oratory, it may alienate as many voters as it persuades.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Texas Instruments' Net Up on Strong Sales

BYLINE: BY KATHRYN JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 15

 BODY:
Texas Instruments Inc. said today that third-quarter net income more than doubled and revenues jumped 14 percent because of strong orders for microchips and higher royalty revenues.
The record results exceeded Wall Street expectations and helped increase the shares of Texas Instruments, which, along with other semiconductor stocks, had fallen in recent weeks amid investor worries about potentially weaker industry sales, eroding profit margins and slower growth next year. 
 Texas Instruments shares closed today at $65.875, up $2.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Texas Instruments, based in Dallas, said net income in the quarter soared to $146 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with $57 million, or 58 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues rose to $2.16 billion, compared with $1.89 billion in the corresponding period last year.
Sales of electronic components were up 29 percent and semiconductor profit margins improved for the sixth consecutive quarter, Texas Instruments said. The higher semiconductor profits helped offset a loss in its information technology unit and lower profits in military electronics. The company does not break out sales and earnings figures for its business segments on a quarterly basis.
John M. Geraghty, a semiconductor analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said the third-quarter results benefited from sales of specialized products with higher margins, as well as royalty payments, which are becoming a staple in the revenues of the company as it aggressively protects its technology patents.
"Their semiconductor business product mix is getting richer with more profitable products," said Mr. Geraghty, who had estimated Texas Instruments would earn $1.15 in the quarter. "This is a company that clearly has improved over the last several years relative to its product mix and the way it's running the business."
Royalties also doubled to $168 million in the quarter from $83 million a year ago. They included $37 million in one-time royalties for computer systems patents and higher continuing royalties for semiconductor patents.
Semiconductor orders and shipments hit record levels mainly because of demand for the microchips in computers and telecommunications equipment, said Jerry R. Junkins, Texas Instruments' chairman, president and chief executive. "The world semiconductor market remains strong," he said in a statement.
Customer demand has been so intense that Texas Instruments has had to limit some bookings of new orders, said William A. Aylesworth, Texas Instruments' chief financial officer, in a telephone interview. The company is also expanding and announced in August that it planned to build a $1 billion manufacturing plant to make next-generation microchips.
Texas Instruments officials still forecast worldwide industry growth at more than 20 percent this year, although some analysts expected growth to slow to 15 percent next year.

HEADLINE: Who Are You Calling a Drunk?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To this 20-year resident of Corofin, in County Clare, Ireland, Peter Finn's review of Rosemary Maho ney's "Whoredom in Kimmage" (Aug. 29) ignores the obvious. This book is an ethnic and sexist assault on our highly respected village and its decent people. Her "research," limited largely to just one pub and one family, extrapolates venomously to a community composed predominantly of superstitious, obscene and unemployed drunkards with repellent physical features, seedy clothing and illegitimate babies. She conveys an image of rural Ireland that is grossly inaccurate. 
 The many thousands of American tourists who know Corofin will recognize Ms. Mahoney's selection and portrayal of subjects as prejudiciously atypical. Had she aimed her feminist invective, instead, at Spanish Harlem or Hasidic Brooklyn, no respectable house -- fearful of the political and legal backlash -- would have published it.

BREAKING THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
Toward Effective
Risk Regulation.
By Stephen Breyer.
127 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $22.95. 
 WHEN Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, leaders of the nation's largest corporations who had long chafed at the expanding regime of Federal regulations knew they had an ally in the White House. They set about waging a full-scale campaign to reverse the trend, even as liberals prepared to hold the fort at all costs.
By the time George Bush completed the dozen years of Republican rule, the debate over regulation was thoroughly debased by both sides. Vice President Dan Quayle's Competitiveness Council served as the vehicle for industry to get rid of as many regulations as it could as fast as it could. Many Congressional liberals were unyielding, insisting, for example, that complicated food labeling regulations apply to restaurant menus.
During that 12 years one of the most provocative commentator-critics on the subject was Stephen Breyer, the Federal appeals court judge in Boston whom President Clinton considered and then rejected for the Supreme Court this year. At the beginning of the Reagan Presidency, he wrote a book, "Regulation and Its Reform," whose theme was that problems with regulation were not the result of sloppy or stupid regulators but rather a mismatch of regulations to risks. Now he has written a new and brief (leave aside the footnotes and charts and it is barely an 80-page read) volume polishing his theories.
Business leaders and conservative economists of the anti-regulation, take-no-prisoners camp would do well to examine "Breaking the Vicious Circle" carefully. They would discover that, the analyses of Judge Breyer's views that circulated during the brief period he was under consideration for the Supreme Court notwithstanding, he is not one of them.
In essence, Judge Breyer fully accepts the need for a strong regulatory system and does not believe that rules designed to enhance safety and health menace market forces. (He does not, though, discuss his service as a senior aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the 1970's, when he served as the intellectual father of airline deregulation -- an experiment on which the jury is decidedly still out.) Judge Breyer is, however, a stern critic of how choices are made about which substances and practices to regulate and which hazards to spend time and money on.
The book reads like one of those intellectually exciting lectures for which some professors become so well known that their courses are fittingly oversubscribed every year. The style is clear and the analysis is dotted with the kind of provocative questions at the heart of this debate: how much regulation is enough, how much is too much, and the ultimate question, what is the dollar value of a life?
THE vicious circle of the title is a reference to the way priorities get distorted. He uses as an example a case in his own court about cleaning up a dump in southern New Hampshire. Regulators were pushed to clean up the last 10 percent of toxic chemicals from a swamp because of public concern. The issue was whether to spend $9.3 million to clean up the dump's last batch of pollutants. The site was clean enough for children playing on the site to eat small amounts of dirt daily for 70 days each year without harm. Getting rid of the last batch would have made it clean enough for the children to eat dirt for 245 days a year. Yet there were no dirt-eating children. The site was a swamp.
This, Judge Breyer writes, is a powerful argument, "not necessarily for deregulation, but for a serious effort to prioritize, and perhaps to reallocate, our regulatory resources."
Congress, enormously susceptible to public concern about toxic waste, contributes to the distortion of priorities, he says. He also contends that regulators aim their rules narrowly, to deal with one problem, while worsening another: "Proposed rules concerning disposal of sewage sludge, designed to save one statistical life every five years, would encourage waste incineration likely to cause two statistical cancer deaths annually."
But when Judge Breyer moves from the diagnostic to the prescriptive his persuasiveness evaporates. His proposal for breaking the vicious circle is a sort of super-regulatory agency to arbitrate with wisdom the competing claims on the Government's limited regulatory resources. Elitist? Yes, he acknowledges. But he fails to deal with the problems that raises in turn.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Life May Be a Madness, but It's Also a Poem

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL

DATELINE: DUBLIN

 BODY:
You can tell that Noel Pearson became a theatrical producer and not the priest he once thought he'd be by his two favorite words. The first is madness, which he uses to describe everything from talent to the weather. The second is delivered so often in his Irish brogue that it's almost a chant. It rhymes with hooking, except when it rhymes with hook.
Actually, Mr. Pearson inspired great choruses of this favorite word from the crew of the 1992 Tony Awards broadcast when he accepted the best play award for Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa." Mr. Pearson had produced the play about five Irish sisters in the summer of 1937 first at the Abbey Theater here, where he had been the artistic director. With the Tony show almost 15 minutes past its scheduled end, he pulled a book from his pocket and announced he would read "a wee short poem by William Butler Yeats, who founded the Abbey nearly 100 years ago." 
 As poems go, it was as wee short as a network could hope for. And since he never got to speak during the previous year's Academy Awards broadcast, when his film "My Left Foot," about the Irish writer and artist Christy Brown, lost to "Born on the Fourth of July," he was due.
This season he's back on Broadway with Mr. Friel's newest play, "Wonderful Tennessee," which is to open at the Plymouth Theater next Sunday. The reception here has been mixed. Three middle-aged couples inadvertently spend a night together on a pier, where they take stock of the small victories and big disappointments in their lives, yearning, as Mr. Friel's characters are wont, for even the slightest spiritual release. But after three months of work, Mr. Pearson says, the play opening next week is quite different from the one already reviewed.
" 'Lughnasa' was such a big and unlikely hit," Mr. Pearson says, "that I don't know what will happen to 'Tennessee.' But I'll stand over it no matter what. It's frustrating if they want us to get like Hollywood now, bringing over 'Lughnasa II,' 'III' and 'IV,' " he adds, sitting in the living room of his 1820 town house, where an excellent self-portrait by Daniel Day-Lewis hangs, painted with his left foot. Along with Patrick Mason, the director, Mr. Pearson has been staying close to the Abbey while Mr. Friel writes, dropping 10 minutes from the first act, adding 10 new ones to the second.
But will it work? Mr. Pearson, who is 50, seems jittery. "Everyone in New York is so cynical," he says. "You never hear anyone wish you good luck. And here, some of the critics have actually compared 'Tennessee' to 'Lughnasa' scene by scene. It's nonsense, y'know? On opening night Friel hid in the back corridor of the theater. He wouldn't even come into the bar.
"The Irish critics were equally split on 'Lughnasa,' " he continues. "I think there's too much truth in 'Tennessee' for the Irish to deal with." He starts to pace. "It's very up front about lives and mistakes. After a few drinks at 4 in the morning everything is not what it appears. All the pretense is set aside, and this bothers a lot of people."
Luckily for Mr. Friel, whose reclusiveness in recent years has bordered on fetish, Mr. Pearson plays his point man with civilization willingly. "Like a fine wine, he doesn't travel too well," he says, excusing Mr. Friel's absence at the Tony Awards. He even tolerates the 64-year-old playwright's refusal to speak into a microphone for the documentary Mr. Pearson is making about "Wonderful Tennessee," though he has agreed to appear on camera. "To get on Friel's wavelength takes a long time," Mr. Pearson admits. "He's a sensitive, vulnerable man. You have to build up a confidence."
Their relationship began in 1979, he recalls, in New York. Mr. Friel's play "The Faith Healer" had just opened on Broadway where it was poorly received, as was an Irish ballet of "The Playboy of the Western World," which Mr. Pearson had imported to City Center. "And that same time," he says, "Siobhan McKenna opened at the Palace in something, and it closed in one night. And this Irish journalist tracked me down at 5 in the morning at Eamonn Doran's on Second Avenue where I was singing the blues to myself and he said the critics had not been kind to Brian, and not to me, either, and could I last the whole two weeks with the ballet? It would be a sad day for Ireland, he said, if the count was Broadway 3, Ireland 0.
"I was staying at the Royalton then, back in the days when the roaches did jigs at the end of the room, and Brian Friel was staying across the street at the Algonquin. He was drinking sizable gins and feeling sore and we started to talk. We became friends. Then in 1987 I took over the Abbey and he wrote me a very warm letter and I asked him to give me a play. He gave me 'Lughnasa,' in 1988, two years before it moved to London. Nobody wanted it there. Nobody wanted it on Broadway, either, at first. An Irish play had not been successful there since 'Da.' "
Still, Mr. Pearson persevered and Mr. Friel is lyrical in his appreciation: "If a theater producer should have the head of a businessman, the heart of a gambler and the untutored intuitions of an artist, then Noel Pearson is thrice -- and abundantly -- blessed," he says.
Outside now, thunder rumbles as the sun shines, in what Mr. Pearson calls typical Irish weather. "Madness," he pronounces it, and chilled, moves near the fire. His face looks pale against his black shirt, though there's a twinkle about him, an almost kindly quality that lives side by side with a prankster, maybe even a hustler. If he offered you a game of three-card monte you'd have no choice but to run. Sometimes his eyes are the eyes of a choirboy, solemn and wide open, seeming to bare his soul and all its secrets. Sometimes he looks everywhere but at you, piling on all the blarney doubletalk he can find. His own joke is: "I don't lie. I'm economical with the truth."
Add in how difficult it is for him to articulate emotion, which only feeds his passion to find writing that can, and voila: a producer. Not a theater owner, not an investor, not a hanger-on. "I find it hilarious at the Tonys when 98 producers get up for one play. I break up laughing," he says. "I don't believe that investors get billing. A hundred thousand dollars doesn't make you a producer, and you can't teach people how to be producers. I was at Yale a year ago, and they didn't have a clue what I was talking about. All I tell investors they will get out of it is the first night party and a bit of a laugh. Can you imagine," he says, talking about "Angels in America," "all 13 producers having breakfast with Tony Kushner the next morning and giving him notes?
"I am terrible at raising money," he adds. "I could never go to a stranger for it." Happily for Mr. Pearson, the Shubert Organization is willing to finance his creative legwork, especially after "Lughnasa." "They put up with my madness," he says "and never ask to interfere."
His madness, as he calls it, is rooted in coming up the hard way. After graduating from a junior seminary, and rejecting the priesthood, Mr. Pearson went to work at the Dublin Fruit Market, which led him to become a union organizer. In the mid-60's he managed the Chessmen, a pop-rock band, moving on to manage the Dubliners, a well-regarded folk group. After 12 years with them, he tried the theater, bringing shows like "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" to Dublin.
Musicals were only part of what interested him. He produced a variety of dramas, including an unfinished Brendan Behan play, "Richard's Cork Leg" at the Peacock, the Abbey's second stage, which transferred to London's Royal Court. Like most impresarios, he loses as big as he wins. Broadway diehards might remember "Brothers," starring Carroll O'Connor, a play that closed at the Music Box Theater after one night in 1983. Conversely, his gamble on "Lughnasa" has paid off. In the next six months alone there will be 63 productions of it in the United States, though his Broadway offering of last season, "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," a drama about three hostages in the Middle East by the Irish playwright Frank McGuinness, recouped only half its investment.
Undaunted, Mr. Pearson has hired Mr. McGuinness to write the book of a new musical called "Limelight." He found its composer, Chris Curtis, an American, playing piano in the bar of a Los Angeles restaurant. "It's about Charlie Chaplin -- not the little tramp but the rejection by America of Chaplin during the McCarthy era and their acceptance of him at the end."
Mr. Pearson has also purchased the film rights to the unfortunately titled novel "The Dork of Cork" by Chet Raymo, an astronomy professor at Stonehill College in Massachusetts. (Mr. Pearson promptly renamed the screenplay "The Seventh Moon.") He stayed up until 6 in the morning reading the book, he says, "an astonishing story about a beautiful French girl who wants to go to Hollywood and gets only as far as Ireland, where she gives birth to a dwarf.
"Studios would scream at a mad idea like this," he says with glee. After "My Left Foot," Universal gave him an exclusive producing contract, which, unsurprisingly, did not work out. "Everything I gave them they turned down, including 'Lughnasa,' " he says. "One guy told me to stop sending play scripts because they would think I'm nuts."
Sticking to the theater for now, Mr. Pearson plans to transfer the critically acclaimed Royal National Theater production of J. B. Priestley's "Inspector Calls" to a Shubert theater later this season.
"Since I've been going to Broadway, they say, 'It's dead, it's dead.' Everyone in New York should lighten up a little," he says. "The gossip on Broadway is frightening. You know that Sondheim song 'The Ladies Who Lunch'? It's the men who lunch now. I'm not a morning person, but when you open a play you get all the calls by 10 A.M. saying, 'Did you hear?' Instead of celebrating, they'll ring you about a show that's not a huge hit. There should be a place for those shows, anyway. You can't have genius every day, y'know?"
Though he spends the majority of the year working in New York, Los Angeles and London, his children remain in Ireland. His daughter, Catherine, 20, is earning a master's degree in English, and his son, Leo, 19, is a drummer. Mr. Pearson has been separated from his wife for 16 years.
He calls the dating rituals in New York "very strange." "When they introduce you, they never say your name. They say he's the producer of 'My Left Foot' and 'Dancing at Lughnasa,' then you meet these women who want a relationship after the soup. I met an Irish gal, a big-deal model, extraordinarily beautiful. We sat down to dinner and she says she's in therapy, takes singing and acting lessons, but now she's taking her Doberman and her white Jeep off into the desert to find herself. I said, 'If your poor mother in Ireland heard this! Did you ever think of having a few drinks and working it off?' You have this great word, relate. I find it hard to relate."
Hard, also relating to expectations for 'Lughnasa II.' But if he makes it to the Tony Awards again, will he leave the poetry at home? He looks wounded. "You know, when I got up there that night and thought about all my experiences in New York, that ballet and 'Brothers' that closed in one night, I didn't want to just thank my granny. Yeats was the founder of the Abbey, and the whole thing had come full circle. It wasn't meant to be opportunistic, or corny."
And with all of the tenderness of a man who can't write, he recites "He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven" again:
 
 Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.

An Artist Who Spoke For the People

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff

 BODY:
Perhaps more than anyone, Agnes de Mille, who died on Oct. 7 at the age of 88, made ballet a household word in America: she was the art form's chief populist and popularizer. Anyone acquainted with the personal heritage she described so vividly in her many autobiographical books would realize how naturally she expressed these traits in her life and work.
The democratic streak that ran admirably through de Mille's ballets -- from "Rodeo," the masterpiece she created in 1942, to "The Informer" of 1988 -- came down from the principles of her maternal grandfather, the economist and social reformer Henry George. 
 What other choreographer and former dancer would have boomed out dire warnings against "big business" as Agnes de Mille did in the 1970's and 1980's? And she did so in her dazzling curtain speeches and in "Conversations About the Dance," the onstage dance-history narration that eventually reached millions on public television.
Class consciousness was relevant to her. In "Fall River Legend" (1948), she convicted Lizzie Borden of ax-murder although the real-life Lizzie was acquitted of killing her father and stepmother. It was de Mille's contention that the prominent citizens of Fall River, Mass., stood by a member of their milieu. Years later, doing original research, de Mille wrote a brilliant book about the case ("Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death").
That was the populist strain in de Mille. "Rodeo," with its tomboy cowgirl getting her man in the land of opportunity -- the frontier of the American West -- was typical of the choreographer's faith in folk and future.
The popularizer in her came from the de Mille side. Uncle Cecil, with his film epics, needs no further introduction. But Henry C. de Mille and William de Mille, respectively Agnes's grandfather and father, were playwrights with Broadway hits (William later worked in Hollywood). It was undoubtedly from them that de Mille took her cardinal belief that dance, like theater, meant communication: in her words, "a statement that has to be witnessed and shared."
The choreographer's most famous exercise in accessibility was the dream ballet in the 1943 hit "Oklahoma!," her first Broadway show. Unsuspecting audiences were served up genuine ballet choreography in the form of de Mille's astute amalgam of a 19th-century vision scene and psychological dance-drama, which she and Antony Tudor promoted in the 1940's.
De Mille remained most at home in the dominant esthetics of the 1940's. Her enduring ballets are few and date from that period: "Rodeo," "Fall River Legend" and the comic "Three Virgins and a Devil" (1941). A self-described "overwrought pantomimist" at the beginning of her dancing career, she picked up her classical training on a scattershot basis and was more interested in motivated gesture than what she called "French steps." In the end, this approach had possibly restricted her creative range.
Yes, she was a better writer than a choreographer (although she could be inaccurate, notably in her book about Martha Graham, published last year). But these volumes popularized dance and American social history. Those that reached an eloquent pitch (especially "Where the Wings Grow") also revealed the true Agnes de Mille, full of gumption and go.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a production error, an article on page 10 of the Arts and Leisure section today about Agnes de Mille omits several lines in some copies. The last sentence at the bot tom of the first column should read, "But Henry C. de Mille and William de Mille, respectively Agnes's grandfather and father, were play wrights with Broadway hits (Wil liam later worked in Hollywood)."The final sentence of the article should read, "Those that reached an eloquent pitch (especially 'Where the Wings Grow') also revealed the true Agnes de Mille, full of gumption and go."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
What Parson Rather Left Out of His Sermon

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
Courtesy demands that in musing over Dan Rather's recent criticisms of television news, one resist the conclusion that he had Connie Chung in mind. After all, Mr. Rather greeted his new partner with gallant affection when she arrived a few months ago to help him do a job that anchors down the years have managed to do single-handedly without visible strain.
So when he says now of the unnamed masters of his fate, "They've got us putting more and more fuzz and wuzz on the air," he cannot have in mind the undeniably decorative Ms. Chung. And when he accuses market researchers of subverting the judgment of professional journalists, he cannot be implying that she owes her new status to her popularity and the prospect that she may lift the "CBS Evening News" ratings. By no means. 
 Indeed, Mr. Rather's call for more minorities on news programs may be interpreted as an invitation to Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw to follow his example and share their roles with Asian-American women. Yet his talk somehow leaves the impression that he does not deeply relish sitting there many a night and looking on with fond interest as his teammate delivers headlines from the prompter. Can it have been a need to escape that drove him to spend several summer days at the scene of a hurricane that did not live up to his presence and possibly his hopes? You'd think that having a network anchorman in the vicinity would inspire the winds to blow with extra gusto.
Ms. Chung aside, or beside, what makes Mr. Rather's brave denunciation of the commercial television mentality ring hollow is his refusal to utter an unkind word about the brains or taste of the great American audience, those co-conspirators of their own exploitation.
Television's many critics can hardly fault Mr. Rather for delivering to the annual convention of the Radio and Television News Directors Association the sort of complaints they themselves have been churning out for years to no great effect, and his strong words like "complacency" and "cowardice" are especially welcome. The promise of television, he told the news directors, has been "squandered and cheapened." Invoking the sainted Edward R. Murrow (who deserves a rest), he invited mass contrition. "We should all be ashamed of what we have and have not done, measured against what we could do."
Now, coming from such a source, that is a veritable expose. Advertising and publicity for network news programs give the anchors star billing as super reporters and in-charge types. Any allusion to their prodigious salaries is quickly followed by notice that their responsibilities go far beyond introducing the dispatches of working stiffs in the field. One of Mr. Rather's titles, remember, is managing editor of the "CBS Evening News." Viewers are left to assume that the anchors are in charge of choosing, shaping, positioning and interpreting the day's stories. What else could justify their high pay?
But here is Mr. Rather confessing that power over what has until lately been advertised as his program is in the hands of others, fearful creatures at the mercy of ratings. He laments over "the things that fear makes them make us do," like substituting "live pops" for thoughtful analysis. Those shadowy decision makers are making Mr. Rather do things he doesn't want to do. "We -- you and I -- have allowed them to do it, and even helped them to do it."
Well, that's news. Not only does it explain his program's increased attention to soft features and other adornments, but it must also explain why Mr. Rather ended his recent interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton with a lame joke and why the interview was so brief. He is confessing that he, and by implication Mr. Jennings and Mr. Brokaw, are paid by the standards of entertainment, not journalism, for their on-screen personas more than their professional skills. Behind the camera, these authoritative figures are evidently being pushed around, like glamorpusses in the old Hollywood turned to jelly by bullying producers. One's heart goes out.
Imitating generations of critics of radio and television, Mr. Rather blames market researchers for the "showbizzification" of news programs and for promoting the following propositions: "American audiences won't put up with news from other countries. Americans won't put up with economic news. Americans won't put up with serious, substantive news of any kind." To such negative thinking, Mr. Rather cries, "Bull feathers!"
Is that so? Delighted though any reviewer must be with Mr. Rather's exhortations to news directors to confront the decision makers and to "go with quality and substance" instead of sleaze and glitz, his dismissal of market research as bull feathers is bull feathers. Such populist effusions have long served as smokescreens for critics who are willing to put the blame for the deficiencies of television anyplace but on the audience. The cigar chewers in the executive suites are, after all, easy marks; everyone enjoys despising them.
Mr. Rather condemns pandering. Well, it is a form of pandering, not to mention bad reporting, to blame advertisers or corporate chiefs or their functionaries for imposing inferior stuff on an America athirst for quality. Just as he flattered his audience of news directors with the assurance that "your own knowledge of news and human nature, your own idealism and professionalism will guide you more surely than any market researcher ever will," he flattered the television audience by saying it craves better programs than it is being offered.
The ratings may not be all that scientific, but the bottom-liners have learned that they are more reliable guides to the nation's taste than high-minded journalists. Corporate executives are not by and large suicidal. If they were persuaded by the figures that news from other countries, economic news and serious, substantive news of any kind would bring in more money than game shows or crime shows, America would have an hour's worth of such nourishment every night. The problem faced by Mr. Rather and his allies is that mass merchandising does not permit much in the way of boutique programming. That's the reason for public television.
So good luck to Mr. Rather in his campaign to stand up to the bad guys and rouse others in his trade to do likewise. But he had better recognize that the fat cats he is fighting have nothing more devious in mind than catering to the enormous audience he wants to serve, and that bold talk notwithstanding, he is more a beneficary of the show-biz system than a victim. He has to hope that the watering down and dolling up of the "CBS Evening News" do not increase its ratings, for otherwise he may be driven to flee the studio and charge about the land trying to stir up new hurricanes against the old windmills.

HEADLINE: TROUBLED WATER

 BODY:
Many of the tests required under the current Safe Drinking Water Act have nothing to do with preventing the kind of public health problems cited in Sara Terry's article "Drinking Water Comes to a Boil" (Sept. 26). Instead, Congress has made public water suppliers spend large sums of money to search for and eliminate contaminants that present little or no public health risks. Thus, when "violations" occur, they are often meaningless bureaucratic occurrences that cause money to be spent for no real purpose. 
 Terry belittles attempts to compare the benefits and the costs of meeting higher standards, giving credence to the comment that water must be "completely safe." While long on emotion, such a statement is short on science, economics and public policy. It is entirely appropriate for society to make choices about the relative costs and benefits of different levels of pollution control, public safety and the like. Among the issues to be resolved are whether public water supplies should meet standards for immune-deficient people or for the public in general. As difficult as such decisions are, we have to remember that society needs to decide where and how to spend its money to best protect the public. The Safe Drinking Water Act is one law that has not done this very well.

HEADLINE: Habitats/S.R.O.;
New Deal for Old Hotel

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
THERE is the unmistakable bustle of a construction site as carpenters coated with plaster dust hop over electrical cables running along the floor in the lobby of the Narragansett, a single-room-occupancy hotel at 93d Street and Broadway in Manhattan.
Within a few months, the lobby, with its austere glass-partitioned front desk, will become much more elegant, with a concierge's desk in the corner inside the front door. Burgundy carpet salvaged from the Russian Tea Room will be used to redecorate the rooms. Kitchens are being installed on each of the 11 upper floors. 
 The 47,000-square-foot hotel was bought for $3.45 million this summer by Housing and Services Inc., a nonprofit group that is rehabilitating the building while keeping its occupants, many of whom receive rent subsidies, in residence. The group's goals include housing persons with the AIDS virus. Of the Narragansett's 14 full-time and 6 part-time employees, 4 are full-time social workers and substance-abuse counselors.
"It's the first time that a building that was already a major residence for AIDS tenants was taken over by a group that wanted to house the same people -- only better," said Claire Haaga, president and founder of H.S.I.
Right now, about 40 percent of the Narragansett's occupants are rent-stabilized tenants who have lived there for years. The rest are persons with AIDS, who were living there when HSI bought the building. There are city transit workers, musicians and unemployed people, among others, Ms. Haaga said.
Frances DeMartino-Gonzalez, who has lived at the Narragansett for 11 years, has seen changes in the first two months with the new landlord. "Already some of the more undesirable tenants have left," she said, "and H.S.I. has started providing two meals a day, where before some people had to beg on the street for food."
David Smith, known as Dee to his friends, has lived at the Narragansett only since April. He likes the H.S.I. people, he said, because "they just don't talk about things -- they do them." He said he had been reluctant to move to an S.R.O. because his friends had lived in a drug-ridden one. "They were scared to go out and scared to come in," he said.
NOT at The Narragansett, however. "This is by far the best," he said, looking around his carpeted 150-square-foot room with lustrous yellow walls and private bath -- one of the 50 rooms with private baths out of the total 100 rooms there.
To buy the Narragansett, the current owners put together a combination of city rental subsidies and private loans. Chase Community Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan, lent $4.9 million at 8 percent for acquisition and rehabilitation. "We've never done anything like this before," said Mark A. Willis, the Chase unit's president, who said it was the first time a private bank in New York City had lent money to an S.R.O. with AIDS tenants.
Ms. Haaga and the project lawyer, Richard Higgins, had to sort through a tangled web of details. The past owners had filed for bankruptcy, and the building was in foreclosure, according to Ms. Haaga, who is also a lawyer. Because of title problems, the closing lasted from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. "Our last extension from the bankruptcy court expired on July 30 and we closed on July 29," she said.
"The whole thing was a stretch," she said, "but we think it's a good kind of risk to take."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Sharing a Studio In a Co-op
 
Q. My wife and I own an alcove studio on East 77th Street. We have been renting it out with board approval and the board scrutinizes tenants thoroughly. We now feel we would like to use the apartment ourselves, but because the maintenance is so high we would like to give the key to two other couples. Each couple would use the apartment for a whole or partial week once every three weeks. Do we need board approval? . . . Manny Zahav, Belle Harbor, Queens 

A. Yes. According to Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer, under most proprietary leases you would need to get board approval for this type of arrangement. "This is a sublet," he said. Mr. Weinstein also said many boards might be reluctant to give that approval because they might feel the arrangement was transient.
 
Structural Change In a Co-op Studio
 
Q. I replaced a co-op-installed 10-foot sliding room divider in my studio apartment with a permanent wall, turning a large alcove into a permanent one-bedroom. Nothing else was changed. The room already had a standard separate door from a hallway. Even though I bought the apartment, I have heard the board can make me tear down the wall. Is this true? . . . Robert Stradder, Manhattan
 
A. Yes. According to Stuart Saft, president of the Council of New YorkCooperatives, in a co-op you cannot make a structural alteration without board approval. He also said the city could cite the co-op for violations because the building no longer complied with its certificate of occupancy because the number of rooms on that floor would have changed. "The co-op would rightly be concerned about safety," he said. "They would want to make sure that the wall was properly installed, made with the proper permits, and make sure that it won't come down and kill somebody or adversely affect the floor, which is the ceiling of the apartment below."
 
Getting a List Of Mortgage Rates
 
Q. I would like to get a listing of all the New York State mortgage bankers and their rates. I remember a listing the New York State Department of Banking puts out. Does it still exist? If so, How can I get one? . . . Stephen Silverman, Brooklyn
 
A. The State Department of Banking puts out a consumer bulletin three times year. It lists the rates offered by all state-chartered and some of the federally chartered banks in New York. Clare E. Sykes, a spokeswoman for the department, said you could get a copy by contacting the office of your Assemblyman or State Senator. Ms. Sykes also said that the bulletin was generally available at most public libraries in New York or can be obtained by writing to the Public Information Office, New York State Department of Banking, 2 Rector Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10006.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Opening Loan Windows

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
NOT everyone has been able to profit from the giant refinancing party that has enabled thousands of homeowners to tap into rock-bottom interest rates.
Those left out in the cold include people whose homes may have plunged in value, leaving the old mortgages as high or higher than prevailing prices. Or their incomes may have dropped, disqualifying them for the same amount of credit. Still others may own co-op apartments in New York buildings that are no longer eligible for financing, or they may have been tardy paying bills. 
 But such people should not give up. Lenders are easing terms, new programs are emerging and unconventional sources are being tapped to make mortgage refinancing possible. "Both the market and lending practices have changed a lot in the past year," said Nancy Boles, a senior vice president at Arbor National Mortgage in Westbury, L.I.
The changes include a special state program beginning in Connecticut this month, the impact of more owner-occupied units in many New York City co-ops, the margin loans now increasingly available through brokerage houses in place of conventional financing and even the chance to borrow temporarily from a 401K plan.
Connecticut borrowers can benefit from a new state program called Mortgage Refinance Guarantee. Open to anyone irrespective of income, it guarantees the difference between the amount a bank is willing to lend and what the homeowner needs to borrow.
An example would be a case in which a homeowner has an outstanding balance of $110,000, but because of the drop in values, a bank would only refinance up to $100,000. The state will now guarantee the difference, allowing the bank to go ahead with a loan for $110,000.
Investor properties are not eligible, though two- and three-family, owner-occupied houses will qualify. And there is a $100,000 limit on each guarantee. Moreover, the loan cannot exceed 125 percent of the current appraised value of the home. For details and an explanatory brochure call the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority at (203) 721-9501 or contact a local bank.
Another way to make up the difference in loan size without an infusion of personal cash would be to use a program like the one offered by Merrill Lynch & Company. It allows anyone with a portfolio of securities with Merrill Lynch's brokerage division to pledge those securities in place of cash. The program is called Mortgage 100.
A margin loan, available from any brokerage house where you might hold securities, offers a similar opportunity to raise the difference at rates that may even be lower than those from any lender, though the interest may not be tax deductible.
A retirement portfolio would not qualify. This exclusion should not apply, however, to anyone contributing to a 401K plan at work. According to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., 74 percent of employers permit borrowing against equity built up in a 401K plan.
Say a lender is asking for another $20,000 in cash to compensate for depreciation in value or a drop in family income. The borrower could use $20,000 from the accumulated assets in his or her 401K plan and gradually repay the loan through payroll deductions, said Christine Seltz, a spokeswoman for Hewitt. But she warned that the loan could be recalled or expensive penalties imposed if the borrower lost his or her job before the loan was fully paid back.
ANYONE previously unable to get refinancing because of a drop in the value of a mortgaged property should also keep on top of changing market conditions. Homes priced from $100,000 to $250,000 in Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island and Fairfield County in Connecticut have been rising sharply this year, said Ms. Boles of Arbor National Mortgage. Local real estate agents can usually provide an updated appraisal. And most will do so free.
Where declining household income has been the stumbling block, having a family member, like a parent, co-sign a new loan to help get it approved is yet another technique, said Nancy Gordon, manager of the Globe Mortgage office in Hackensack, N.J.
Another way to qualify, Ms. Gordon said, is to extend the existing term of the new loan -- say from 15 years back to 30.
Co-op shareholders in New York should continually monitor the percentage of owner-occupied units vs. sponsor-owned units in their buildings. The "acceptable" range to qualify for refinancing is usually 70 percent shareholder-owned units or more.
Consider what happened at the 72-unit co-op at 320 West 76th Street in Manhattan. This year, more than 20 units were repossessed by the co-op from a defaulting sponsor, of which more than a dozen were purchased by tenants already in the building. Overnight, this raised the level of owner-occupied units from 34 percent, to 72 percent.
"I'd been waiting for this moment for three years," said Vincent McGowan, the co-op's president. Dropping his mortgage from an interest rate of 11 percent to 7 1/2 percent will save him $260 a month, he said.
He now wants everyone else in his building to do the same -- thus making it easier for them to meet maintenance payments. So he has been lining up interested banks and circulating the list to residents.
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is also taking a fresh look at the plight of New York's co-op shareholders.
Fannie Mae's policies set the tone for local lenders. And its new co-op guidelines, which are not yet completed, should help ease the gridlock, said Wayne Curtis, a spokesman at its Northeastern regional office in Philadelphia. Details were not available.
To find a local lender who is willing to observe more relaxed rules, it helps to apply through a mortgage broker (listed in the Yellow Pages). They work with many lenders and are on top of policy changes. It should cost no more.
Then there are programs like the one at Arbor National Mortgage. Since September, it has been taking a more lenient view toward people with troubled credit -- provided they have at least 25 percent equity in the home.

HEADLINE: For the Deep of Pocket, Tailored Homes

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE grass has yet to be planted on the broad lawn of James and Eileen Farley's new house at a development called Highland Woods, off Annin Road in Basking Ridge, N.J. The long, gravel-covered driveway has yet to be paved.
But Mrs. Farley, who is 34 years old, nevertheless feels a sense of fulfilment. Encountered in the driveway a few days ago, she said she and her husband had met three goals they set in 1991 when they started house shopping in the hills of northern Somerset County. These were to find a property "in a family neighborhood, on a quiet street, with a level backyard." 
 Could they not have found that at less cost in a resale house, she was asked. "We looked but we couldn't find just what we wanted," she said. The Farleys went into contract in February 1992 on a New England colonial-style house with a two-car garage on an acre of land. Construction started a year later and they and their two young children moved in last month.
As with the Farleys, so with Irwin and Elizabeth Gotlieb in Westchester County. They couldn't find just the thing in resale housing either. Their special needs included suitable display space for Mr. Gotlieb's bonsai collection and Mrs. Gotlieb's formidable collection of perfume bottles.
A home builder provided it -- built-in and handsomely lit -- in a house they occupied last year at a development called Willoughby II, still under construction on 20 acres of a rocky hillside off Old Chappaqua Road in Briarcliff Manor, in the Town of Mount Pleasant.
There is no shortage of resale housing in a wide range of price categories on the market in the suburban and almost exurban communities of the wider metropolitan area. Yet, like the Farleys and the Gotliebs, many well-to-do house seekers continue to choose a semi-customized, detached single-family house.
The buyers are usually people with a disposition to modernity and a taste for self-expression, said Louis Winnick, a housing economist. "They are making the statement to the world, 'This is me,' " he said.
Fortunately for the regional economy, there are still pockets of this sort of highend home building activity. Most of it is semi-customized housing, often on subdivisions of no more than 30 lots. A far smaller segment is the fully customized house, perhaps on a piece of land that the buyer has purchased and proceeded to hire an architect to design and a contractor to build. The cost to do this as primary housing in the metropolitan often ranges well above $1 million.
BASE prices for the semi-customized houses usually range from $500,000 to $800,000. The value of the land and the size of the house are key determinants of cost.
The typical house in this category probably provides about 4,000 square feet on two levels on a one-acre lot. A basement level provides additional square footage. If the terrain is sloping, there may be an additional level. There is a two-car or three-car garage.
Buyers often spend more than the base price, not only for upgrades of fixtures, finishes and equipment but also for customization of construction to meet an individual family's needs. This may add as much as 10 percent to the base price.
Figures on the extent of new high-end, single-family home construction are hard to come by. The National Association of Home Builders, based in Washington, tracks the pace of new-home construction by large regions -- the Northeast, the Midwest, the South and the West -- in five price categories starting at "under $80,000." The highest-price category is $200,000 and over.
In the Northeast, figures for the first half of 1993 show that 31 percent of all new single-family sales were for more than $200,000, a total of 21,000 houses, compared with 32 percent in all of last year and 35 percent in 1990. "The indication is that the higher end hasn't recovered yet," said Dean Crist, a research economist at the association.
New-home construction generally is marginally improved. Last year there were only 65,000 one-family houses built at all price levels in the Northeast, according to the home builders' association. That compares with 57,000 in 1991. Total construction was 116,000 in the Midwest, 259,000 in the South, and 170,000 in the West. All these figures were slightly higher than 1991's.
But housing markets have niches and the niches differ not only in pace of sales but also in the nature of the "product" -- the house -- even when prices seem roughly comparable.
In 1993 the builders are selling in an environment quite different from pre-recessionary 1987. There are fewer single-family subdivisions in development. Since market prices are lower, land values are down. Builders who can acquire sites at reduced prices can charge somewhat less for the basic house, perhaps a more modest product than the previous owner intended.
On long-held subdivisions builders have sometimes modified the product in size or degree of interior completeness to be able to maintain sales at economically viable level at current market prices.
Buyers of new housing often comment that they are struck by their ability to buy new and get just what they want without paying much of a premium over a comparable but less satisfactory resale house.
Joseph and Laura Ferrari make that point. They wanted to move from a house in Bedford Hills, in northern Westchester County, that they had lived in since 1985.
"We looked at resale houses in the $350,000 to $400,000 range," said Mr. Ferrari, "but we decided we would be better off moving into a new house than buying a resale and making the renovations we wanted for another $30,000 to $50,000."
They bought a house listed at $435,000 in January in a development called Pine Hill Estates, 14 one- and two-acre lots off Pines Bridge Road in the town of Bedford. Mr. Ferrari enjoys landscaping -- "I'm a perpetual worker," he says -- and he is putting in all the landscaping of his new house himself. He declined to say what he paid for the house.
In Huntington, L.I., Harry and Blossom Weiss moved in September into a new four-bedroom colonial "in the $400,000 range" at an eight-house development called Walden Place near Lake Road. "We looked at resales but many owners were asking top dollar for houses that had not been touched in years," Mrs. Weiss said. "For the same amount of money we could buy something new."
The Weisses bought a four-bedroom colonial with three-and-a-half baths and a maid's room on one acre of land. They also took a package of upgrades that included an outside deck and a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace eight feet wide. Tane Construction of Huntington was the builder.
SOME custom-home buyers are repeating the experience of buying new.
"We like the feeling of the new," said Joseph Friedman, 37, a sales and marketing executive. "We don't like old things we consider gloomy. 'New' represents fresh for us."
Mr. Friedman and his wife, Nancy, and four children moved in August into a new house at the Charter Club at the Hamptons development, which, notwithstanding its name, is in Marlboro, N.J., off Route 520. The Friedmans were moving from another house that they bought new in Marlboro nine years ago. The builder was the same organization, the Kramer Group, based in Marlboro, a home builder since 1960.
THE Friedmans bought their three-quarters-of-an-acre lot five years ago and waited for development on the 125-lot site to reach them. "I knew the lot I wanted and I knew it would be gone by the time development got to it," Mr. Friedman said.
He also benefited from a past experience of working with a builder on a house. "We knew southeast exposure is best for the front of the house so there's no north wind blowing at it," he said. "And there's no sun beating on our bedroom window. The back corner on the east has no windows."
But there are 84 windows in the house, along with seven bedrooms, six baths, three garages, five air-conditioning zones and six heating zones. The basic model cost something over $500,000, but beyond that the Friedmans spent heavily, probably close to $40,000 on granite tile alone.
"In a new house you'll have added costs, but you'll get what you want," Mr. Friedman said.
A similar conviction led the Gotliebs of the bonsai and perfume-bottle collections to the Willoughby development in Briarcliff Manor.
"We needed a lot of closets," Mrs. Gotlieb said. "The builder said, 'You want closets? I'll give you closets.' " He gave them three walk-in closets in the master bedroom alone, with track lighting. One of them has a built-in refrigerator.
The house has three bedrooms and four-and-a-half baths, Palladian-style windows, and an octagonally shaped breakfast table built as an extension of the center-island stoves in the kitchen. It also has a fully equipped exercise room, a sauna and several fireplaces, including one in the master bedroom that is clad in marble and stocked with gas-burning logs.
"People say building a house is a terrible experience, but we just had a wonderful time," Mrs. Gotlieb said.
Their neighbors are William and Barbara Bastardi , who moved into a five-bedroom three-bath contemporary cedar-and-stone house with their three young daughters and newly born son only this month. They, too, tinkered with the basic model, adding a third garage, putting another room above it, and rearranging an upstairs bathroom so that it can serve two rooms.
Mrs. Bastardi and her husband, William, who is in the automotive-parts business, believe in buying new. They lived for 10 years in a house in Briarcliff Manor, which they are trying to sell for $439,000. "In a new house you have all new problems instead of old problems," Mrs. Bastardi said.
All these buyers sought customization that involved special construction, not mere upgrades of materials and equipment, which in high-end housing is at a luxury level in the basic package. At Willoughby II buyers typically spent 3 to 5 percent above base prices of $625,000 to $725,000 for customized construction, said Richard Syracuse, a partner in the Syracuse Brothers Development Corporation of Briarcliff Manor, the builder.
The pricing of new housing is basically determined by three factors -- the builder's "hard" costs of construction (labor and materials); the soft costs for fees and construction-period interest and other nonconstruction expenses; and perhaps above all, the cost of the land, the key variable.
IN the Somerset County hill country of central New Jersey, ready-to-build sites that might have cost a de veloper $200,000 to $300,000 in the 80's now sell for $150,000 to $200,000, Bruce Bocina, a principal in Bocina Development Corporation of Basking Ridge, the developer of Highland Woods and other Somerset County developments.
"Land prices are about half what they were in the 80's," he said. "The home buyer who is paying $600,000 today would have paid $750,000 in 1987."
The perceived quality of local schools seems to exercise an extraordinary influence on land values between otherwise comparable neighboring communities.
"In the school district where we were looking lot prices ranged from $225,000 to $350,000," said Marc Goldstein, a financial advisor who bought a house at Willoughby II, which is in the Briarcliff Manor school district. He also looked at houses in the Chappaqua school district. "Elsewhere house lots were $150,000 to $200,000 in the area," he said.
On the north shore of Long Island, David E. Eisenberg, a partner with Peter C. Lewis in the construction of Woodbury Oaks, a single-family-home development in Syosset, said that land prices were 40 percent higher in the Syosset-Woodbury area than they are in neighboring Hicksville solely because of the reputation of the schools. Selling of the quarter-acre house lots began in January at a basic price of $425,000. Prices for the three remaining lots have risen to $525,000. A minimal amount of customization is available.
Another factor in sales is price relative to those for single-family houses generally within the area. In Syosset, unrenovated houses 30 years old sell for about $350,000 and for new customized housing builders ask between $700,000 and $800,000, Mr. Eisenberg said. The new houses of Woodbury Oaks are therefore in a favorable market position with a small-lot neo-colonial with modest customization possibilities.
A few miles east of Woodbury Oaks a long-standing Long Island building partnership, Anton Cerrone Associates, based in Port Washington, is building the 44-lot Rolling Hills at Woodbury project, customized houses in the 4,200-square-feet-and-up range that sell for $740,000 and more. It has maintained its prices through the recession, said Robert Anton, the 36-year-old son of one of the founding partners, Irving Anton, and 30 houses have been sold, most of them already occupied. Four are in construction.
"We had hoped to finish in three years," Mr. Anton said. "We should finish in 12 to 18 months."
On two-acre parcels the Anton-Cerrone partnership is also selling high-end houses in Muttontown, off Brookville Road. There are 45 lots and houses with 4,700 square feet selling at prices starting at $840,000. Fifteen have been sold, Mr. Anton said.
Also in construction on the North Shore after a lull caused by an ownership change is the final phase of The Links at North Hills, off Shelter Rock Road. Allan V. Rose, principal in AVR Development Company, based in Yonkers, originally won subdivision approval for 210 town houses plus a lavish clubhouse on the 125-acre site, once a golf course. AVR took over the site from another builder.
The third and final section was planned as 96 additional attached and semi-detached town houses on 45 acres, but it has been redesigned as 40 semi-detached and fully detached units, Mr. Rose said. A sales campaign began in July at prices of $675,000 to $825,000. Six buyers are in contract.
How much to spend on upgrades over the builder's basic package is often a puzzle for buyers. "You can go berserk on extra charges," said Mrs. Farley at Highland Woods in Basking Ridge.
ONE buyer there, Steven Spinner, told of putting in a limited number of special improvements in his five-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath house, spending about 6 percent more than the base price to do so. The upgrades included wider moldings at the floor and ceiling in the living room and dining room, wainscotting in the foyer and an additional two feet of space in the kitchen. Mr. Spinner, his wife, Holly, and their three young children moved in on Sept. 27.
"You can spend $800,000 on a $450,000 house," he said. "I wish we had more money to spend."

MAGIC LANTERN
An authentic re-creation of a raucous Victorian magic lantern Halloween show will be presented next weekend at the Ivoryton Playhouse by Terry Borton and his American Magic Lantern Theater, based in East Haddam. 
 Slides for the magic lantern were hand-painted on glass plates in the 1890's and the lantern itself is a century old. The troupe of costumed actors, narrators and singers give dramatic voice to the ghosts, goblins, macabre and comedic goings-on depicted on the slides, and the audience is encouraged to toot horns and join in the singing.
The theater is on Main Street in Ivoryton, and performance times are on Friday at 7:30 P.M.; Saturday at 11 A.M. and 2:30 P.M.; and Sunday at 2:30 P.M. Tickets are $8, $5 for children. The show is suitable for children from the age of 4. Call 767-4035, extension P for reservations.
 
ARTISTS AND HUNTERS
 For the past eight years, artists, conservationists, hunters and art collectors have converged on the New England Wood Carving and Wildlife Art Expo. The ninth edition will be held on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. and Sunday from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. at the Radisson Hotel in Cromwell.
More than 400 East Coast artists from Canada to Florida will display and sell their carvings, prints, photographs and paintings, and some $5,000 will be awarded in competitions. The winning works will be auctioned at 3 P.M. on Sunday.
Demonstrations will be given by the guest carvers Frank Switaj and Richard Magane, by the guest artist Bob Zarczynski, and by Tom Hirata, Connecticut's first duck stamp artist.
Admission is $6, free for children through the age of 12. Proceeds will benefit Connecticut's wildlife habitat projects, land acquisitions and biological studies. The hotel is just off Exit 21 of Interstate 91, nine miles south of Hartford.
 
RIVALS AND LOVERS
 Richard Rodriguez, author, critic, and essayist on the MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour, will be the lecturer today at 2:30 P.M. at the Yale Art Gallery, Chapel and York Streets in New Haven. His talk, titled "Mirror, Mirror, on the Wall: The United States and Mexico as Moral Rivals and Painted Lovers," is one of several events accompanying the current exhibition "Mexico in the American Imagination, 1914-1947," which remains on view through Nov. 21.
A day of family-oriented programs on Saturday from 10 A.M. to 11 P.M. begins with Hernandez Chavez and Rafael Weil discussing their work as muralists with middle- and high school students from 10 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. They will initiate a mural project to be placed on exhibition.
From 10:30 to noon, elementary school children will be involved in a mask-making project under the direction of Colleen Coleman and Don Wunderlee. Their creations will also be put on display.
James Oles, curator of the exhibition, will give a gallery talk in Spanish at 11 A.M., and a food and craft bazaar will fill the sculpture hall from noon to 2 P.M.
Performances by two musical groups, Gropo Choqui and El Sol Americano, will focus on the variety of music within Latin American countries from 2 to 5:30 P.M., and from 8 to 11 P.M. Latin American dance music will be offered by Versatil, an 12-member ensemble of trumpets, trombones, bongos, maracas and other instruments.

POLO MATCHES
 UConn has started a series of polo matches that will take place annually in the fall and spring. Male teams from UConn and Cornell will meet at 4 P.M. in the university's outdoor polo arena on Horsebarn Hill Road in Storrs. Female teams from UConn and Cornell will square off next Sunday at 1 P.M. There is no charge for admission and more information may be obtained by calling 486-1088.
 
USING THE LAND
 The E. F. Schumacher Society of Great Barrington, Mass., a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to better understanding and use of the land, and the Yale Student Environmental Coalition will present a program about land use with three speakers on Saturday in New Haven.
The first is Wes Jackson -- plant geneticist, farmer, author, teacher, a founder and director of the Land Institute in Salina, Kansas. The organization seeks to establish a town in Kansas where the most innovative methods for developing a sustainable agriculture can be practiced.
The second speaker will be Winona LaDuke, a member of the Mississippi Band of Anishinaabe from the White Earth Reservation, and campaign director of the White Earth Land Recovery Project, which is attempting to regain ancestral Anishanbeg lands from Federal, state and county government control.
Finally, George Davis, former executive director of the Wilderness Society, will speak about an international land use policy consulting firm that he founded in Wadhams, N.Y., called Davis Associates. He is currently leading an international effort to develop a comprehensive land use plan for the Lake Baikal watershed area in Siberia.
Registration begins at 9:30 A.M., lectures and audience response periods will continue to 4:30 P.M., with a break for lunch from 1:45 to 3 P.M. Tickets at $20, or $7 for students, and optional lunch at $7, must be ordered in advance by calling 432-7222. The program will be held in Sheffield-Sterling-Strathcona Hall, at Grove and Prospects Streets on the Yale campus.
 
RELIGIOUS EXPLORATIONS
 Religious fundamentalism and its effect on the three major faiths will be the subject of a seminar on Thursday from 5 to 10 P.M. at the Hartford Seminary, 77 Sherman Street in Hartford.
Christian fundamentalism will be discussed by Scott Appleby, assistant director of the fundamentalism project of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at the University of Chicago, and Martin E. Marty, author of "The Glory and the Power: The Fundamentalist Challenge to the Modern World."
Following a light kosher supper served on the premises, the Islamic resurgence will be addressed by Sami al'Aryan, an associate professor at the University of South Florida.
Jewish fundamentalism will be the concluding topic, presented by Samuel Heilman, professor of Jewish studies and sociology at the City University of New York.
The seminar will end with an open dialogue among speakers and audience members.
Tickets in advance are $30, or $35 at the door. Call 232-4451 for reservations or more information.
 
HORROR MOVIE MAGIC
 "The Witch's Dungeon is a hobby that got a bit out of control," Cortlandt Hull, creator of the Horror Museum in Bristol that opens each year for Halloween, said. The dungeon will unfold its terrors for the 27th time on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings through Oct. 31, from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M., and it is not recommended for children under 6.
As an illustrator, make-up and prop specialist, and horror movie buff since childhood, Mr. Hull fell quite naturally into his hobby. Each year the life-sized replicas of Bela Lugosi as Dracula, Boris Karloff as Dr. Frankenstein's monster, Lon Chaney as the Phantom of the Opera, and Vincent Price as the abominable Dr. Phibes, among others, have increased in numbers, accuracy and artistry.
So, too, have the vignette settings in which they appear, until today the Witch's Dungeon is the only such exhibition sanctioned by Universal Pictures, which produced the films. Many of the original costumes and special effects body parts are incorporated into the display that is housed in a specially built structure on Mr. Hull's front lawn.
To set the mood as visitors enter, they will be guided by the frightfully familiar voice of Vincent Price and some cautionary commentary by Mark Hamill. In their wanderings through the dark corridors they will hear in-character voice-overs by June Foray, a veteran witch-voice of Hollywood cartoons.
Admission of 50 cents defies inflation but Mr. Hull regards his museum as a public service comemmorating his beloved vintage horror films. The dungeon is at 90 Battle Street. For more information call 583-8306 or 584-4718. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Interest Drops to 5.9%;
Sonyma Raises Income Limits

 BODY:
The State of New York Mortgage Agency has renovated its Low Interest Rate Mortgage Program, raising income-eligibility ceilings in all 62 counties and lowering the interest floor.
The income limits, based on statistics on median income in each area supplied by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, vary county by county and according to family size. They are also are higher for people purchasing homes in what are called target areas, neighborhoods targeted for economic development, than they are elsewhere. 
 Target areas in Manhattan, for instance, include Central and East Harlem, Inwood, areas of the West Side and parts of SoHo.
In New York City, the maximum allowable income for a family of three or more seeking a loan in the program for a home in a target area is $61,740, an increase of $3,640 over last year; for a nontarget area, it is $50,710, a rise of $2,990. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the target-area ceiling for families of three or more is $88,340, an increase of $11,340; in nontarget areas, it is $72,560, a rise of $9,310.
The interest rate has dropped from 6 percent to 5.9 percent. Loans, which the agency says are primarily for first-time home buyers, are available through the agency's network of 72 participating lenders statewide. They cover co-ops, condominiums and one-family homes, as well as two-family homes more than five years old, in all areas, and two-family homes that are newly constructed or less than five years old in target areas. Information is available from Sonyma's toll-free number, (800) 382-HOME.

HEADLINE: Time to Change Farmland Assessment

 BODY:
Given the documented statewide abuse of the New Jersey Farmland Assessment Act ("Farm or Fake? State Is Checking Up," Sept. 19), it is obvious that local, country and state officials have little capacity and/or the ethical fortitude to enforce this 1964 state constitutional amendment.
Illegal farmland assessment has become an important political perk offered under New Jersey's "justice and democracy for a select few" home rule system. Farmland assessment is held by less than 2 percent of New Jersey's population but accounts for nearly 25 percent of the state's land mass. 
 We believe it is time for Trenton to wake up and change the law accordingly. We recommend these initial legislative changes:
*The minimum qualifying acreage should be doubled, from 5 to 10 acres. In all but a few cases, five acres does not contribute enough to a local economy to warrant a tax break that amounts to hundreds of dollars per acre.
*Minimum yearly qualifying receipts must be raised to a more economically justifiable level, and thus we recommend raising the $500 yearly minimum to $10,000. We can no longer afford to subsidize property owners whose property tax break is greater than the average yearly receipts generated by their property.
*The present two-year rollback system should be doubled to four years and rollback law-enforcement capability should be strengthened. These revenues will help our rural communities to weather the present financial upheaval created by new development by providing monies for school system and infrastructure expansion.
Isn't good government all about providing tax equity to 100 percent of the people instead of supporting an outdated property tax scheme that gives a huge property tax break to 2 percent of the citizens at the expense of the other 98 percent?
Let's have a farmland assessment program, but Trenton must bring it into the realities of the 1990's.

HEADLINE: Beyond Issues in County Executive Contest

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
IT was 1 P.M. on a recent Friday and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a candidate for county executive, was on the steps of the County Office Building, demanding that state and Federal officials look into alleged misuse of a County Medical Center fund used for miscellaneous expenses. Those who were alleged to have misused the fund were officials appointed by County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who is seeking re-election.
Mr. Brodsky was doing what he hopes will win the election for him -- challenging.
 
Challenging and Governing
 Mr. O'Rourke, who has held the county's highest office for 11 years, was not in the building, however. He was several miles away, sitting under a sugar maple tree at Muscoot Farm in Somers, a county-run working farm, flanked by supervisors and other officials from several towns in northern Westchester, issuing a warning that impending actions by New York City on its reservoirs in the county could have a devastating impact on local communities. 
 Mr. O'Rourke was doing what he hopes will win his re-election -- governing.
Challenging and governing are hardly unusual activities for office seekers and their incumbent rivals, but this year, in what is essentially a re-run of a 1989 race, they have been honed to a fine point. The election on Nov. 2, which could be closer than the 52-46 percent spread of the earlier race, will be decided by how well the candidates fulfill their self-assigned roles.
There are issues that separate Mr. Brodsky and Mr. O'Rourke, but the question likely to confront many voters on Election Day may be the classic one: is it time for a change?
Mr. O'Rourke says no. "I don't think Richard could do the job," he says. "He is a lot of talk, but very little action. He has never actually confronted anything that a county executive does, which is run things.
"I think he is probably all right as a legislator; you don't have to carry a lot of water as a legislator. You can pretty much skate around issues, and you don't have to have a position on everything that happens in Westchester County."
Mr. O'Rourke castigated his challenger for helping to maintain what he called the "tax and spend" mentality in Albany, especially in resisting two taxes fiercely sought in recent years by the O'Rourke administration and the Republican-controlled Board of Legislators: a hotel tax and an increase in the county sales tax, both of which were eventually approved.
"I honestly believe that, driven by ambition, Richard has tried to hurt Westchester County in holding out against the sales tax and the hotel tax because he never wanted us to succeed," Mr. O'Rourke said. "He wanted to run for county executive and needed a budget problem."
Mr. Brodsky characterized Mr. O'Rourke as "tired," "exhausted" or "worn out," basically running for an office that he thought last year he would be giving up for a more prestigious Federal judgeship. He had been endorsed by President Bush, but the end of the Republican regime in Washington all but doomed his chances of confirmation.
 
Dueling for Two Decades
 Mr. Brodsky, 13 years younger than Mr. O'Rourke, who will celebrate his 60th birthday on Oct. 26, has made corruption the central theme of his campaign, saying that Mr. O'Rourke cares more about his family and friends than the people of Westchester, a reference to the efforts that Mr. Brodsky said Mr. O'Rourke made to find jobs for or direct county contracts to his children and close friends.
The candidates, who have been dueling for two decades, know each other well, beginning with the Board of Legislators where Mr. O'Rourke, as chairman, and Mr. Brodsky, as a Democratic thorn in his side, struggled, often with clever and highly amusing exchanges, for verbal if not political domination.
They do not find each other so amusing as this, their second confrontation for the county's top job -- which pays $119,085 a year -- nears a conclusion. Their increasingly direct exchanges carry an acerbic bite, with the recitation and angry rebuttal of now familiar charges.
They have put forward economic plans that seem unusually similar, with Mr. Brodsky claiming that Mr. O'Rourke lifted the major tenets -- retraining of the unemployed with special emphasis on the white-collar jobless and assistance for small-business owners -- from the Brodsky plan.
 
On the Matter of Taxes
 In a midweek debate at the Women's Club of White Plains, each candidate summarized the thrust of his campaign, with Mr. Brodsky emphasizing the "need to clean up the O'Rourke government," especially the "ethical lapses," which he said characterizes its recent history.
Mr. O'Rourke sought to associate Mr. Brodsky with what he saw as free-spending liberals in Albany who have "imposed $6 billion in new taxes over the last four years," with Mr. Brodsky "voting for new taxes 48 times." He said his opponent left the chamber for the final vote on the current budget "so he wouldn't have to be recorded" as favoring its passage.
Mr. O'Rourke held up a chart showing that the county tax bills have remained the same or gone down over the last three years and will remain even for the next year. Mr. Brodsky said county taxes have gone up 120 percent during Mr. O'Rourke's tenure in office.
Both are correct, and Mr. Brodsky held up a tax bill, urging members of the audience to ignore Mr. O'Rourke's chart in favor of checking their own bills to determine the truth of the argument. Again, both were right because while the county's tax is statistically even, individual communities see their assessments rise or fall.
 
Dispute Over Hospital Fund
 Mr. O'Rourke said his 27 years of experience as an elected official enabled him to maintain Westchester's AAA bond rating, one of the nation's best. Mr. Brodsky spoke of the need for a change, one that will produce a government "that is candid and that can be trusted."
Mr. Brodsky also referred to what has become a major issue in his campaign, a story in the Gannett Suburban Newspapers stating that a special fund maintained at the County Medical Center and intended for medical research, professional education, patient benefits and the purchase of medical equipment had been used also for parties, plaques, golf outings and dinners.
Mr. O'Rourke said that there had been no misuse of the money and that the fund, known as the Medical Center's Supplementary Fund, was built on private contributions and was used, for example, to collect $20 donations for a retirement gift and to pay for restoration of the hospital lobby and emergency room area.
Mr. Brodsky, delighted with the disclosure so near the end of the campaign, demanded that law-enforcement officials investigate the fund's activities. A similar request came from Stephen P. Tenore, the Republican chairman of the Board of Legislators, who said the fund's activities should be studied "for possible criminal wrongdoing."
Mr. O'Rourke sought to de-emphasize the story's impact by saying that no public money was involved and that Mr. Brodsky was seeking to make much out of very little. But the County Executive helped fuel the political fire by asking for the resignations of four of the five hospital officials who controlled the fund.

HEADLINE: Forget Border Wars, Think Globally

 BODY:
According to "Business Border Wars Heat Up" (Aug. 22), Westchester's leaders apparently believe that we should match the kinds of financial incentives offered by competing states so that we can lure companies to our county. This kind of "vestigial thinking" fails to address the major cause of our economic downturn -- global competition. Westchester's real challenge over the next few years is not to win border wars but to reposition the county and its businesses as world-class competitors. 
 Westchester's leaders continue to view the economic development process through the wrong end of the telescope, focusing very narrowly on the most visible symptom of economic decline -- empty buildings -- instead of on the fundamental issue: creating jobs for a transformed economy. Now is the time for "new thinking" in Westchester. Recognizing that the historic flow of small- to mid-sized businesses moving from New York City to the suburbs is continuing, we should redirect our focus from wooing out-of-county companies to expanding the business activity of the 28,000 businesses that are already here and to stimulating new "home-grown" entrepreneurial efforts.
Westchester's current level of economic activity (measured by employment) is back where it was at the end of 1982. Two challenges face our county today -- how to recoup the nearly 40,000 jobs lost over the last four years and how to get job growth back to its healthy 1980's rate of expansion, at 2 percent a year. Complicating these challenges is the apparent contradiction of abnormally high unemployment combined with a looming shortage of high-skilled workers.
People currently unemployed will not see their former jobs reappear in Westchester. Downsized-assembly-line workers are no more likely to find similar production jobs than "early-retired" middle managers are likely to find executive positions.
Yet many of our high-tech and information-intensive service businesses cannot find enough properly trained workers. The sharp instrument needed to cut this Gordian tangle is leading-edge technological training and retraining and improved education in poorer school districts.
To broaden, strengthen and expand Westchester's business and tax base, a county economic development strategy must harness the following forces: a brutally competitive global economy, the lightning pace of technological innovation, the expansion of world trade, the trend toward telecommuting, the demand for information-intensive services, the rapid transition from high-volume production jobs to high-value-added jobs requiring knowledgeable workers, the need for a highly sophisticated and fully digital telecommunications infrastructure and the need for affordable housing.
It is time to turn the telescope around and look through the eyepiece to get a view of the county's economic challenges and opportunities. Economic development is the process of creating wealth. Westchester needs an economic development strategy with a farsighted vision sharply focused on grappling with the compelling forces of structural change.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
OPEC Sits Atop Shaky Barrels

BYLINE: By Youssef M. Ibrahim

DATELINE: TUNIS

 BODY:
THE good news for OPEC is that oil prices stand about $2 per barrel higher since the oil cartel struck a deal in Geneva last month to rein in the runaway production of oil by some of its 12 member countries.
The bad news is that these higher oil prices are still roughly $3 a barrel below where they were a year ago. 
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' temptation to rejoice over indications that demand for oil is increasing worldwide is checked by the fact that supplies of oil are also rising from producers who are not members of the cartel, and therefore, not bound by any production limits.
Oil economists and industry officials say that oil output in the North Sea oil fields, shared by Britain and Norway, is expected by the end of this year to be 1 million barrels a day higher than it was in 1992, to a record high of 5.2 million barrels a day.
Elsewhere on the globe, oil output from Oman, Syria, Colombia, Yemen and other third world countries is also inching ahead.
That's a great deal of oil poured into world markets every day.
What's worse is that the largest chunk of this increase in production is controlled by countries fiercely opposed to interference with market forces.
Britain and Norway have repeatedly asserted that they were committed to producing all the oil they can, leaving the matter of setting prices to market forces -- a philosophy that is diametrically opposed to OPEC's goal of pushing prices up by restricting output.
"In general they are not doing well except that if they hadn't come to an agreement, prices would have been something like $5 a barrel below the present level," said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "The bottom line for OPEC is that the idea of oil prices rising sharply any time soon because of a shortage in supplies is a far-fetched thought," Mr. Lichtblau added.
The only gain brought by the Geneva accord reached unanimously by the members of OPEC is that it has sent a faint signal to skeptical oil markets, improving OPEC's poor image and credibility, which had deteriorated since 1986. That was the year when similar challenges coupled with an internecine war in OPEC brought about an oil price crash to $10 a barrel.
In the two weekssince the OPEC accord, prices of Brent oil, which is traded in London, have moved up from $15.75 a barrel -- when OPEC met in the last week of September -- to $17 a barrel now. Other crudes have moved up by about $2 a barrel.
Provided these gains hold up for the rest of the year, the increase in prices will bring badly needed infusions of several billion dollars into the hard-pressed treasuries of OPEC members whose countries depend almost entirely on oil exports.
It is estimated that each dollar rise or fall for the barrel roughly represents a billion dollars in income, making such swings a highly destabilizing factor for those attempting to plan a budget in Tehran, Riyadh, Caracas, Algiers or in other oil-producing capitals.
Lower incomes in the last two years have brought political turmoil and instability to several major oil producers including Venezuela, Ecuador, Algeria and Iran.
Even rich OPEC members, like Saudi Arabia, which is the world's largest producer and exporter of oil, as well as Kuwait, have gone into deficit spending to sustain their budgets in the last few years.
These pressures have always pushed OPEC members to abandon agreements and rush to pump more oil in a vicious circle that only lowers oil prices.
"This is the most durable agreement they have struck among themselves since 1986," said Mehdi Verzi, an OPEC expert at Kleinwort Benson, a securities firm based in London. "We still have to go through a testing period to see if they adhere to it. They have to run a very tight ship. My feeling is that they will," Mr. Verzi said.
But is it enough?
Virtually all oil experts argue OPEC will have to do a great deal more if it wants to recapture its position of the 1960's and 70's as the arbitrator of higher oil prices or even reach the modest goal boosting oil prices closer to $21 a barrel, the official OPEC wish price.
That means bringing the ceiling significantly below the current 24.5 million barrels a day for the 12 members.
OPEC also has to be a little luckier. If this winter turns out to be a mild one, the industrialized countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the world's largest group of oil consumers, may significantly cut oil demand, especially as all 24 members have accumulated hefty amounts of oil purchased at cheaper prices in the last few months. The variables between a cold or a mild winter can be as much as one million barrels a day.
Then there is the problem of Iraq, which is a key, but dormant, OPEC member.
If the United Nations allows Iraq to resume the production and export of oil, prices will drop sharply. Iraq, which has the world's second largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia, is capable of putting at least 1.5 million barrels of oil on world markets every day.
"I am very ambivalent. I wouldn't be surprised at all if prices start falling again," said Peter Gignoux, manager of the petroleum trading division of Smith Barney Shearson in London.

Computerizing the Clunker

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
COMPUTERS work well in new cars to reduce air pollution, but what can be done with old ones, especially in third world countries where old models predominate? In those lands, where often the only gasoline is leaded, catalytic converters are not practical.
A start-up company in Maryland won a patent last week for a device that cleans car exhaust and reduces fuel consumption by harnessing a computerized sensor to an old-fashioned carburetor. The system can continually adjust the air-fuel mixture, making it as lean as possible at any given instant without hindering the engine's performance. It can also work with fuel-injected cars. 
 The Lean Power Corporation of Silver Spring, Md., attaches a magnetic sensor that monitors the speed of the engine's flywheel. The sensor looks not only at revolutions per minute (a measure of engine speed) but also at the flywheel's smoothness of revolution (an indication of performance) and sends the appropriate signals to an air-control device attached to the carburetor.
"When combustion is smooth and uniform, the sensor tells our controller that the engine will tolerate a leaner mixture," said Michael D. Leshner, the company's vice president and senior scientist. "When it gets rough, it tells our controller it's a little too lean."
From a chemistry standpoint, air and gasoline mix best at a ratio of 14.7 parts air to 1 part gasoline. But power is maximized at a richer mixture, 12 to 1, and cleanliness is maximized at a higher mixture, 19 to 1.
The Lean Power system decides how rich the mixture needs to be by looking at fluctuations in the flywheel, which runs faster after a cylinder fires and slows down between firings. A four-cylinder engine fires twice in each revolution, and the engine runs between 600 and 6,000 revolutions per minute, which means measuring a cycle of acceleration and deceleration 100 times per second or less. Using mechanical means to measure something that fast is hard, but Mr. Leshner said, "for modern electronics, that's slow. It's 100,000 times slower than your personal computer."
The company has been concentrating on Mexico, where it hopes soon to announce a joint-venture partnership with a manufacturer. Tests at Ford de Mexico's engineer labs showed carbon monoxide reduction of 60 to 70 percent, hydrocarbon reduction of 20 to 40 percent and nitrogen oxide reduction of 15 to 25 percent. The product is supposed to sell for less than $200, and the company hopes it will be popular not solely on environmental grounds but also because it improves fuel economy by 10 to 15 percent.

HEADLINE: Trade You Two Robert Solows for a J.K. Galbraith

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
JERRY HAUSMAN. Didn't he play third base for the Padres in the early 80's? Great glove man, but never learned to hit a screwball?
No way. He's an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Invented something called the Hausman specification test that propelled him into the big leagues of number-crunching. More important, it got him into the elite group of 29 "Economist Greats" whose trading cards are sold by the economics club at the University of Michigan at Flint. The price: $5 a set. 
 Where else would you learn that Gerard Debreu "gave formal conditions for the Pareto optimality of an economic allocation, for the local uniqueness and (with K. Arrow) the existence of general equilibria."
M.I.T. gets the most mentions on the list (6), with Harvard (4) the runner-up. Princeton (3) and Columbia (3) split the bronze. Men outnumber women. In fact there's just a single female entry (Irma Adelman of the University of California); one might expect calls to send the club's officers to gender-sensitivity classes.
No one, though, could accuse them of age-ism: The group averages 70.
The rest of the list: William Baumol, Gary Becker, Abram Bergson, Jagdish Bhagwati, Alan Blinder, Kenneth Boulding, Gregory Chow, Sir Alec Cairncross, Edward Denison, Evsey Domar, Robert Dorfman, Stanley Fischer, Franklin Fisher, Milton Friedman, Victor Fuchs, John Kenneth Galbraith, Alfred Kahn, Charles Kindleberger, Wassily Leontief, Jacob Mincer, Edmund Phelps, Robert Solow, Herbert Stein, Lawrence Summers, Jan Tinbergen and James Tobin.
Discretion leads one not to question who does not belong. But there are puzzling omissions: Kenneth Arrow, Robert Eisner, Martin Feldstein, Claudia Goldin, Zvi Griliches, Gottfried Haberler, James Heckman, Dale Jorgensen, Anne Krueger, Paul Krugman, Robert Lucas, Franco Modigliani, Jeffrey Sachs, Tom Sargent and Paul Samuelson -- and last week's Nobel Prize winners, Robert Fogel and Douglass North.

HEADLINE: When Smoking Is a Patriotic Duty

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
MEET Dr. Ei Kubota, the man with the toughest job in Japan.
As the Health and Welfare Ministry official who directs Japan's anti smoking efforts, Dr. Kubota faces two adversaries familiar to public-health officials in the United States: the tobacco industry, whose hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising here have imbued smoking with a rakish cachet, and smokers, who find it hard to quit. 
 But Dr. Kubota, a good-natured physician who once worked with Mother Teresa in the slums of Calcutta, faces another, more formidable, foe -- the Government itself. The Finance Ministry, the most powerful arm of the Government, operates a near monopoly in the production and sale of cigarettes in one of the world's largest and most lucrative tobacco markets. The Government-owned company, Japan Tobacco Inc., generates a cascade of taxes -- $15 billion last year -- making it the largest corporate taxpayer in Japan.
The company's success is no accident. By law, the ministry is charged with looking after Japan Tobacco's financial health above all else, including public health, and maintaining the huge flow of tax revenues. Thus, while the United States and other industrial nations have long since begun aggressive campaigns to warn citizens of tobacco's long-term health dangers, the Japanese Government has not. On the contrary, the Government is one of the few in the world that still permits cigarette advertising on television, finances almost no smoking research and, indeed, leavens reports on the health hazards of smoking with claims of the benefits of cigarettes.
Never has the conflict between health concerns and financial interests been sharper than now. The ministry is counting on windfall profits early next year from the sale to the public of one-third of the shares of Japan Tobacco Inc. The pending sale has made the Government particularly eager to put the tobacco business in the best possible light.
 
The Exploitable Consumer
 The Japanese Government, in its attitude toward cigarettes, provides an important insight into its priorities. The protection of the tobacco interests is one of the starkest examples of a national strategy the Government has pursued vigorously for decades -- putting manufacturing might first, while often regarding consumers as a national resource to be exploited. The strategy transformed the country into a ferocious industrial competitor, but Japan is beginning to wake up to its long-term cost.
"Eventually, this is going to create a catastrophe in the health care system," said Dr. Takeshi Hirayama, director of the Institute of Preventive Oncology and former head of epidemiology at the National Cancer Center. "By the early 21st century, the costs are going to rise significantly."
In some respects, this strategy has benefited consumers: with Japanese manufacturers so very competitive, job security is high, even in the midst of the current two-year-old recession. But consumers also pay among the highest prices in the world, find it almost impossible to afford a home, generally commute long distances and enjoy fewer public amenities like parks and modern sewerage facilities than in most other industrial countries. Nor do consumers here enjoy the protection of a product liability law.
In fact, belated recognition of the burden consumers have been bearing helped evict the Liberal Democratic Party last summer after 38 years in power and helped install the reformist coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
On a few occasions in the past, the Government has responded to the ill effects of its industrial policies. For instance, after egregious air and water pollution began to take a horrific toll in the late 1950's and early 1960's, Japan instituted some of the most stringent industrial pollution standards in the world.
There has been no such response to the impact of smoking, however. With the tobacco industry enjoying state support, this is what Japan looks like:
* It has what is thought to be the highest smoking rate in the industrialized world, 36.1 percent (compared with 25.7 percent in the United States). More than 60 percent of Japanese men -- and 44 percent of doctors -- smoke.
* Life insurers offer no discounts to nonsmokers, in spite of Western research that finds nonsmokers live longer.
* Hundreds of thousands of vending machines dot street corners across the land, putting cigarettes within reach of minors.
* No-smoking sections in restaurants and offices remain curiosities.
Meanwhile, Dr. Kubota is left to pursue his quixotic campaign with an annual budget of less than $200,000 and a staff of two. A stroll through the hallways of the Health and Welfare Ministry also makes it clear what he is up against: cigarette vending machines can be found throughout the building. Said Dr. Hirayama: "The big difference between Japan and the United States is that the Finance Ministry is the tobacco industry in Japan. It is a gorilla."
Physicians like Dr. Kubota and Dr. Hirayama are among the small but growing number of experts who say that, contrary to the Finance Ministry's assertions, the medical costs to the Japanese Government of not fighting harder against smoking will overwhelm the money raised from cigarette sales. Deaths from lung cancer, heart disease and other illnesses related to tobacco are mounting. Although smoking rates have been declining slowly, the rates at which Japanese come down with these debilitating illnesses will continue to rise because of heavy consumption of cigarettes for most of the past four decades, these experts say.
 
Lung Cancer on the Rise
 The trends, they say, are troubling. In 1955, cancer of the lung, trachea and bronchus -- linked by Western research to smoking -- ranked seventh among cancers, taking 3 out of every 100,000 lives. By 1991, however, the lung, trachea and bronchus cancers ranked second, killing 31 of every 100,000 Japanese, compared with a rate of 39 deaths from stomach cancer, long the No. 1 cancer killer. (In the United States, about 50 of every 100,000 die annually from lung cancer, and 5 from stomach cancer. Doctors speculate that the rates of stomach cancer in Japan are much higher because of the salty diet.)
Finance Ministry officials sneer at such figures as propaganda. "People who say these things have come to their conclusion before they examine the evidence," said Hideki Yamada, deputy director of the Finance Ministry's Tobacco and Salt Business Division. "We are not saying tobacco is good for health, but for smokers it has some merits, like a good mental feeling. They help people relax."
That attitude, in turn, angers anti smoking activists here. Dr. Reiko Saito, a pediatrician and the founder last year of a minuscule antismoking movement among doctors, said: "The bureaucrats have a narrow view. They only look at tax revenues for this year, not the medical costs of smoking, or the life of a person who smokes 20 years from now."
 
Hostility From Doctors
 The Government's prosmoking bias has created an environment unusual among industrialized countries. Dr. Kubota enjoys no organized support, and even some hostility, from the medical establishment, which relies heavily for its livelihood on the Finance Ministry. Under Japan's universal health insurance scheme, all doctors' fees are fixed through negotiations with the Finance Ministry.
Dr. Minoru Sugiura, executive director of the Japan Medical Association, was indignant when it was suggested that doctors should disseminate more information to young people on the health effects of tobacco and that more doctors might set an example by not smoking.
The culture of Europe and America is "dry" and too logic-oriented, he complained, "so if something is bad, you think it is only bad. But Japanese traditional culture is 'wet,' or more flexible."
Dr. Sugiura was quick to add: "People are receiving benefits from the tobacco sales tax. Without this money, the Government might have to increase the consumption tax rate. We have to think about the total social balance. Therefore, though I do not myself smoke, I do not think we should especially work on it as an organization."
That attitude is common here. While there are no-smoking sections in restaurants and offices today, they are still rare. The Government, rather than financing smoking research, relies on the tobacco industry, which claims no clear proof of a link between smoking and ailments like lung cancer and heart disease.
In fact, a Finance Ministry advisory council reported several years ago that smokers learn more easily, are more relaxed, are more extroverted and suffer fewer neuroses than nonsmokers. It also argued that tobacco addiction is very mild, with those who quit experiencing no great desire to smoke again.
By contrast, the United States Surgeon General declared in 1964 that smoking caused serious health problems, and companies were required to place health warnings on cigarette packs in 1965. Not until 1972 did Japan require even a mild warning. Today, cigarette packs carry a statement that says: "Smoking by minors is prohibited. Please beware of over-smoking because there is a danger of harming your health. Please observe smoking etiquette."
And while the United States banned cigarette advertising on television in 1971 and many other countries have followed, Japan still permits it, though only between 10:54 P.M. and 5 A.M. (The odd starting time allows advertisements just before the 11 P.M. news.) The ads here are supposed to include a health warning, but this is flashed for only a second.
Most spots depict smoking as the ticket to beauty and adventure, with scenes in spectacular natural settings. Some of the biggest users of television are the American tobacco companies, like Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, which leaped into the market after American trade negotiators wedged it open in 1985. They have aggressively built market share since then with heavy advertising and promotions. Foreign cigarettes now hold 17 percent of the $28 billion tobacco market here, with Japan Tobacco holding the remainder.
 
Glowing Ads
 Newspaper ads also depict smoking in dreamy terms that would probably be prohibited elsewhere because of their claims. For instance, a recent newspaper ad quoted an actor saying, "Cigarettes are indispensable to creativity for me."
But most advertising is actually done through Japan's almost ubiquitous vending machines. The nation has some 5.5 million of them, the highest concentration in the world, and 500,000 dispense cigarettes.
Most important, much of the $14 billion a year worth of cigarettes sold through vending machines are sold to people under 20, according to various studies, even though smoking by minors is illegal. (The one group whose smoking rate is still increasing is young women.) The Government has repeatedly insisted that this law be enforced strictly, and the Finance Ministry says it requires vending-machine operators to monitor the machines closely. But an official said the ministry had never revoked a license for sales to minors.
In addition, many companies that for sound business reasons are involved in the antismoking movement in the West are passive here. American life insurers, for instance, have offered nonsmoking discounts to customers for years, citing statistical evidence that nonsmokers live longer. But Japanese life insurers do not.
Officials of this industry, which is tightly regulated by the Finance Ministry, say they have thought about studying the health consequences of smoking, but have yet to do so.
But it is life and health insurers who could be hit hardest by the prosmoking policies.
The Finance Ministry and Japan Tobacco argue that if smoking were such a problem, the Japanese would not be so healthy. The Japanese, in fact, enjoy the greatest life expectancy of any people, 75.9 years for men and 81.8 years for women. In the United States, it is 72 for men, 78.9 for women.
"Why do you think Japan has such great longevity?" said Yukio Akiyama, the head of Japan Tobacco's Scientific Information Department. He argued that smoking was just one of many "risk factors," and that the long life spans proved it may not be the decisive one.
He was also quick with a response to the question of why American lung cancer rates are higher than those in Japan. "My personal opinion is that the intake of fats in the United States diet probably is a lot higher," Mr. Akiyama said. "I'm also wondering if the nuclear weapons testing there has some effects."
Some Japanese also bristle over comparisons between Japan's and America's policies on smoking, because of a glaring conflict in the United States approach. While Washington has sought to warn Americans about tobacco, it has also aggressively pried open foreign markets for American tobacco companies and encouraged exports of cigarettes, paying no attention to the health of the smokers in those other countries.
As for the antismoking activists here, Dr. Hirayama said epidemiological studies have shown that the relatively low rates of smoking-related illnesses until recent years were a product of the unusually low smoking rates during and after World War II, when cigarettes were largely unavailable. "But the effects are about over," he said. "By the end of the century, the shortening of the life expectancy of Japanese males will be very visible."
 
 
 
TOBACCO, SALT AND BIG MONEY
 FOR decades, smoking has been regarded by most Japanese men almost as a patriotic duty. (As in most of Asia, it is considered disreputable for women to smoke here, although aggressive advertising is eroding that taboo. Enter any fast-food restaurant and find thick fog banks of cigarette smoke drifting from tables of young women.)
In fact, the Government monopoly was born of nationalism. Near the turn of the century, the Government created the tobacco monopoly to finance imperialistic wars with China and then Russia. A salt monopoly was established for the same purpose. The two were eventually combined into the Finance Ministry's Tobacco and Salt Business Division. Japan Tobacco retains its monopoly on the salt business to this day.
Since World War II, the tobacco monopoly has become a crucial source of revenues to support economic development. Individuals did not question the strategy because it was regarded as so important.
With the end of nearly four decades of one-party rule by the Liberal Democrats, those days may be ending. The Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to give the long-suffering consumer a share of Japan's wealth, a higher standard of living and a larger say in government affairs.
If he delivers -- which many doubt -- it would mark something of a revolution. At the least, the new environment engendered by Mr. Hosokawa has raised questions about how out of step Japan's policies on smoking are compared with the West's.
 
 
 
THE OFFICIAL WALL PROTECTING JAPAN TOBACCO
 JAPAN TOBACCO INC. is one of the world's largest cigarette companies and a business powerhouse, but if there were any question about the source of its success the answer is hinted at in a simple sentence on page 31 of the company's latest annual report.
The line states that at the end of the fiscal year on March 31, 1993, "the company had no material litigation or claims outstanding, pending or threatened against it."
While American tobacco companies face a steady flow of smoking-related legal claims from consumers, the Japanese legal system has traditionally been hostile to lawsuits, and especially hostile to those by private individuals against the Government. Nor has there been substantial research on how tobacco affects health, research that might form the basis for legal action.
That is just one aspect of how the Government has insured the sound health of Japan Tobacco ahead of its first offering of shares to the public, scheduled for early next year. The Government fixes the price of cigarettes, currently more than $2 a pack, of which about 60 percent is taxes. And it controls distribution.
Some critics even say it influences the way the media report on health issues because of its huge advertising and promotion budget -- about $750 million a year. Last year Nippon Television, a major network, refused to broadcast a documentary claiming that the Government pushes smoking because of its stake in the business.
The network's union went public, charging that the company's advertising executives killed the project, even though there was no direct pressure from Japan Tobacco. After the uproar, the film finally ran, but without a portion mentioning that Japan was one of the few countries that permit cigarette ads on television.
Japan Tobacco remains a fount of cash, even as smoking rates decline. It had net sales of $23.8 billion in the fiscal year ended March 31, and provided a massive $15 billion to the Finance Ministry in taxes.
That left the company with $494 million in net income. It also had a balance sheet swimming with money. Japan Tobacco reported cash and short-term securities holdings of $3.7 billion. In fact, a substantial portion of its profits -- $143 million -- came simply in the form of net interest income.

Strategies for Style Index Funds

SERIES: Second of two articles on growth and value investing

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
TWO sets of "style" index funds set up last year -- one by Vanguard and the other by Dreyfus -- have made it easier for mutual fund investors to use growth and value stockpicking strategies in building their portfolios, much as mutual fund managers use them in shaping their funds. These index funds can serve as handy benchmarks for investors, or be used as tools themselves to implement a variety of growth- and value-related investing tactics.
Mutual fund managers using a value approach look for shares priced at less than what they think the company is worth, often in mature, dividend-paying companies with cyclical businesses dependent on the overall economy. By contrast, those after growth prefer shares in companies with strong earnings or sales prospects; they may be relatively expensive but are less dependent on economic conditions. 
 The Vanguard Group, of Valley Forge, Pa., captured these diverse approaches via the Standard & Poor's/Barra Growth and Value indexes. Vanguard's value index comprises 320 of the S.&P. 500 stocks with the lowest price-to-book ratios; the rest of the S.&P. 500 make up the growth index. The funds' annual expenses are a low 0.2 percent.
The Dreyfus-Wilshire Target funds, part of the New York-based Dreyfus Corporation, were constructed by splitting the 2,500 largest stocks in the Wilshire 5000 index into four parts. They were first separated by size, with the largest 750 (assets of $900 million to $80 billion) in the large-capitalization fund, and the next group, 1,750 stocks (assets of $90 million to $900 million), in the small-cap fund. Each group was then divided into growth and value camps based on price/earnings and price-to-book ratios, yield and so on.
The four funds each hold between 150 and 550 issues. Annual expenses range from 0.59 to 0.91 percent, and a 1 percent redemption fee applies to sales within six months.
For many investors, these indexes can be useful largely as benchmarks in evaluating the performance of their own value- and growth stock funds. The index funds provide a ready reference as to how much of another fund's performance reflects its stockpicking style as opposed to its manager's skill.
The funds also provide an easy way for investors to bet on shifts in the economy that would favor the growth or value approach. While Vanguard's funds are the cheaper way to do so, Dreyfus's funds permit more refined bets by taking into account the cycles favoring large- and small-capitalization stocks.
Second of two articles on growth
 and value investing.
 For long-term investors, the funds are best used with a simple rebalancing strategy, say fund experts. Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago, advises putting equal dollar amounts into both Vanguard funds and then rebalancing the accounts each year, adding more money to whichever fund performed less well that year.
Daniel P. Wiener, editor of the Vanguard Adviser, a Boston-based independent newsletter for Vanguard investors, developed a similar strategy, which he calls "contrarian style cycling." In a study, he found that in 43 of the 74 quarterly periods from 1975 through June 1993, value investors outperformed growth investors; growth won in the remaining time -- and each style often won by wide margins. Mr. Wiener recommends that investors who add continually to their holdings buy shares in whichever type of fund underperformed in the previous quarter.
He suggests that investors with fixed amounts of money switch back and forth between the value and growth index funds using the same methodology. Doing so would have produced an average annual compound return of 17 percent, 1 percentage point higher than leaving the money in the Vanguard S.&P. 500 index fund, based on quarterly results over 31 rolling 10-year periods, he said. Taxes can cut the gains, so this works best in tax-deferred retirement accounts.
Do the style index funds outperform actively managed funds? In most cases, no, according to a study by Kenneth E. Gregory, editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst, in San Francisco.
Using a hypothetical track record created by Dreyfus, Mr. Gregory compared the performance of Dreyfus's small-cap growth index fund to 25 small-cap growth funds tracked by his newsletter over 10 years ended October 1992. The index lagged all of them, as well as all of the 75 United States equity funds Mr. Gregory tracks. On the other hand, the small-cap value index mostly beat the 7 actively managed small-cap value funds.
Among larger-cap stocks, the Vanguard and Dreyfus growth index funds both turned in middle-of-the-road performances, the study found.
Mr. Gregory concludes that actively managed funds are preferable among small stocks, where manager skill can uncover market inefficiencies.
Some experts say the style index funds are a good idea taken too far. While investors can use the style funds to target leading market segments, doing so requires making judgments -- and that defeats the purposes of indexing, said Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y. Stick with index funds that cover the whole market, he advised.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Bags, Belts and the Safety Factor

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
"Y'KNOW," a friend said recently, "I've been hearing bad things about air bags. I think you ought to check it out."
Uh-huh. Like what kind of things? 
 "Well," he said, "that people have been getting hurt by air bags. Sometimes even killed."
Actually, I had been hearing the same things, although some of the rumors had come from people who work for automobile companies that have been slow to implement what most manufacturers have recognized as one of the better safety devices to come along.
"Another thing," my friend said, "air bags are really dangerous when a guy is smoking a pipe."
I hadn't thought of that. But then my mother always told me not to run with a stick in my mouth.
In fact, this is a propitious time to talk about air bags. The 1994 models are rolling into the showrooms and about 90 percent of them have air bags, at least for the driver.
Not only that, but the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has just completed a major study of bags and belts and published the results in its newsletter, the Status Report. And while the study finds that air bags do indeed cause some injuries, it also concludes that they are minor in comparison to the major injuries they prevent.
Understand, of course, that the institute represents the insurance companies of America and, as such, has a vested interest in getting all of us to buckle up and be safe. But the study does stand on its own, and it acknowledges that air bags are not perfect.
"Air-bag-induced injuries happen while the bags are still inflating," the report says. "People injured this way often aren't using belts, so they've moved forward enough to contact the air bag early in its inflation. Another problem involves people who sit very close to the steering wheel."
Determining whether minor injuries are caused by the bags is easy, the study says, but it is harder to figure the cause of more serious injuries because the steering wheel and dashboard may be involved. Most injuries from air bags have been abrasions, cuts and bruises, although some crash victims have suffered minor burns from the gas that inflates the bag.
The air bags in today's cars fill in a fraction of a second to restrain occupants, and they deflate just as quickly to further the cushioning effect.
The hot gas that inflates them is disspelled through vents, and the location of those holes has been altered over the years to prevent burns. The inflation is activated by electronic or electromechanical sensors in a vehicle's front end, and the sensitivity to impact depends on the manufacturer's system.
The bags are designed to deploy after a crash that is the equivalent of hitting a solid barrier at 10 to 15 miles an hour. The number and location of sensors vary from model to model, and some systems -- notably those on Mercedes and BMW -- have "adjusted deployment thresholds" that depend on whether the occupants are using seatbelts.
Belts, of course, are crucial in preventing injury, since air bags are designed solely to protect occupants in a head-on or front-angle crash. Belts hold passengers in place so the bags can do their stuff, and they also protect a car's occupants in side and rear accidents.
With more cars now equipped with air bags, the institute's database has grown, and researchers have been able to compare driver deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles in new cars during their first year with bags and belts and their last year with belts alone. What they have found, according to the Status Report, is a death rate of .96 in cars with bags compared with 1.15 in other vehicles.
About 24 percent fewer driver deaths are occurring in front and front-angle crashes of cars with air bags, the institute reports.
All the same, the newsletter cautions, bags and belts can cause injuries as they restrain occupants and keep them from more serious harm. Belt injuries are mostly to people's chests, abdomens, shoulders and necks, while bags more often injure arms, hands or faces.
And, as with bags, injuries from belts can be reduced by proper positioning of the car's occupants. Drivers should sit as far from the steering wheel as is comfortable because, even with a seatbelt, there is some "give" and the person can move forward to hit a hard interior surface.
Lap belts should be positioned low over an occupant's hips, not the abdomen, the newsletter says. And people in cars with air bags should follow the same advice on seating to minimize contact with an inflating bag.
No matter the car's equipment, though, the institute points out in a new pamphlet that a large car is safer than a small one. The booklet, "Shopping for a Safer Car," notes that small vehicles account for more than twice as many occupant deaths as large vehicles.
"The fact that people traveling in small vehicles fare worse when they're in crashes than those in large vehicles isn't surprising," the pamphlet notes. "It's a direct consequence of the laws of physics, which dictate that, everything else being equal, the larger the vehicle the safer the people inside."
The booklet offers model-by-model lists of safety features in 1994 vehicles, including air-bag and antilock-brake availability. In addition, there are discussions of head restraints, built-in child seats and advances in side-impact technology.
"Enhancing crash protection in side impacts is an important new development in vehicle safety," the booklet says. "A Federal standard that goes into effect this year requires passenger cars to meet improved side impact performance requirements as demonstrated in full-scale crash tests."
Manufacturers have the option of phasing in the protective beams in doors, beginning with 10 percent of 1994 models and reaching 100 percent by the 1997 model year. Or an auto maker may defer meeting the requirement until the '95 model year, but then all its new cars must comply.
The edict doesn't apply to utility vehicles, passenger vans or pickups, although some of those do offer the new protection. The pamphlet lists the '94 models that already meet the standard.
Antilock brakes, of course, are an important feature for preventing accidents in the first place. The system uses sensors that determine imminent lockup, and it pumps the brakes many times per second to prevent a skid and to retain the driver's ability to steer.
"Because a car equipped with antilocks handles differently in an emergency stop," the pamphlet says, "drivers need to adjust their braking style. Unlike regular brakes, which require gentle pressure when stopping on wet and slippery surfaces, heavy braking pressure is required to activate the antilock feature. Drivers shouldn't try to pump antilock brakes because pumping prevents effective operation."
The booklet is useful and free. You can get it by sending a stamped self-addressed envelope to Car List, Box 1420, Arlington, Va. 22210.

HEADLINE: Have A #%!& Day

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
IT'S rude out there. Rude all over the place. In the country that invented "Have a Nice Day," citizens now wear sweatshirts that scream "Back Off," or worse. On the football field and on the basketball court, the old ideal of sportsmanlike conduct has degenerated into a fiesta of trash talk and aggressive taunting.
Since the 1940's, the Salvation Army has put out drop-off bins so that kindhearted citizens could donate old clothes and furniture. Last month, it announced that it would retire the bins in eight Midwestern states because people were using them as Dumpsters. 
 There's a problem here.
At the height of the riots two years ago in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Mayor David N. Dinkins, an icon of restraint and politeness, traveled to the neighborhood to make a heartfelt appeal for calm, reason and the rule of law. He beat a hasty retreat while being pelted with rocks and bottles.
Rude, rude, rude.
President Clinton has noticed. In late July, a heckler interrupted a speech he was giving in Chicago and blamed the Democrats for Congressional deadlock. The President bristled, then delivered an off-the-cuff policy statement. "I might say this is another thing wrong with this country," he said. "There's not enough civility in how we treat each other."
This is a bipartisan issue. In an address he delivered in May at a Mercer University in Macon, Ga., Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court meditated on the tormented history of racism in America, and on his own trial by fire before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"I am here today to share my thoughts about a principle that seems to be falling out of fashion these days," he said. "Civility."
A civility deficit? "It may be the problem," said Richard J. Mouw, the president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif., and the author of "Uncommon Decency: Christian Civility in an Uncivil World."
"Unless we can find a way to live with diversity without screaming at each other or shooting at each other," he said, "it's all over."
Or as Rodney King put it, with Los Angeles burning in the background, "People, I just want to say, can't we all get along?"
The notion of civility is ancient. It derives from the same Latin root, "civilis," as do words like "city," "civil" and "civilization." It links such seemingly disparate ideas as keeping a civil tongue and fighting for civil rights. "Civility is public politeness, showing courtesy in the public square," Mr. Mouw said. Over time, civility broadened to take in all sorts of territory, from teatime manners to behavior on the football field, but it began as a political idea.
For most of human history, civility could be described as the style of behavior peculiar to the ruling class, and as an entrance exam for those who hoped to rise in social status. Consult the works of Edith Wharton for clarification. One thing was clear: social values and style came from the top down.
Those days are gone. The have-nots are no longer as docile as they once were, for one thing. Critics of the culture have devoted much energy to exposing dominant social codes as tools of oppression and social control, for another.
"I believe very much in civility, but sometimes manner and class can be used as a means of excluding other people," said A. R. Gurney, whose most recent play, "Later Life," explores the limitations of the haut-WASP code. "My father said, 'Gentlemen say trousers, gents say pants.' Or if you said 'excuse me,' that was fine, but 'pardon me' was slightly gauche. He used it as a way of excluding people from his world, I thought."
Mr. Gurney also suggested that civility could be used to dampen useful confrontation. "I was brought up to feel that argument, or what we called contradiction, was wrong," he said. "You agreed and in private said something else. I think that's wrong, because those coals can smolder underneath; an insight may not be arrived at."
No worry about unexpressed insights on "The Simpsons" or "Married With Children," television shows devoted to rudeness as a blue-collar art form. Week after week, the title character on "Roseanne" gives a Bronx cheer in the direction of her natural enemies: middle-management weenies, bankers, lawyers and the phony, dim-witted jerks who hand out layoff slips and bottom-line explanations to union workers.
"People are not feeling powerful these days," said Will Miller, a psychiatrist, Baptist minister and stand-up comedian who psychoanalyzes old television shows on "Nick at Night" under the name Dr. Will. "I believe that TV has tapped into a strong chord of recognition by millions of people that the smart people, the people running the show, are guilty, not of hotblooded rudeness, but of cold-blooded cruelty."
Back in the 1980's there was a fair amount of hotblooded rudeness, too, as the swaggering nouveaux riches pushed and bullied their way to the head of the line. The economic downturn put a damper on that, but the sour taste lingers. And the working class is getting its chance to fight back, at least on television.
In a curious reversal of values, the new blue-collar rudeness stands for honesty, simplicity and sincerity, as opposed to the sneaky, passive-aggressive style that goes under the name of politeness. To the bosses, it says, "You may have the power to get away with this, but don't think for a minute that I don't know what's going on."
Descend one level from the working class to the underclass, and the temperature rises. Skepticism shades into outright rejection. Part of the appeal of rap is that it refuses to buy into the civility model. After Rodney King made his televised appeal, the rap artist Willie D. threw it back in his face with a vulgarly titled record that in essence said, "No, Rodney, we can't get along."
"Rap artists reject what they see as a too-polite civil rights movement," said James Bernard, a senior editor of The Source, a hip-hop magazine. "People feel that being polite doesn't get you anywhere -- it's weak."
All along the political front lines, anger and excess tend to be seen as signs of virtue. Anti-abortion protesters throw out reasoned argument and use words like "murder" and "genocide." Act Up members, protesting the Catholic Church's stand on contraception, disrupt a service at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Already, the Mayor has had to temper the language of some of his supporters, who have been spicing up their descriptions of Rudolph W. Giuliani with terms like "fascist" and suggestions that his candidacy promotes Ku Klux Klan values.
It feels good to dish out abuse. Besides, the enemy has sacrificed his right to be treated like a fellow human being -- to be treated civilly, that is. There can be no civility, no discussion, no compromise, for "fascists" and murderers.
This style is sometimes called "in your face." Originally a basketball term, it refers to the very fast, very physical, very vocal playground game that came out of the ghettos and now dominates the National Basketball Association.
In-your-face does not subscribe to the old gentlemanly rules. It is loud. It is boastful. In playground ball, half the game lies in the art of mercilessly taunting one's opponent during the game, then rubbing his face in the ashes of defeat afterward.
"Victory is not enough; you have to humiliate," said Frank Deford, who devoted his weekly sports commentary on National Public Radio recently to the decline in civility. His remarks came after a wild Saturday of college football marked by free-for-alls that involved not only players, but also coaches. To older fans, it seemed like the end of civilization as we know it.
New Yorkers are old hands at contemplating the demise of civilization. In this, as in so many other areas, the city is in the vanguard.
Fred Siegel, a professor of humanities at Cooper Union in New York, spends most of his time analyzing what he calls "the collapse of public space in New York."
It's a depressing business. A combination of bulldozers and quasi-martial law has restored order to Tompkins Square Park on the Lower East Side. But in dozens of pocket-size parks and playgrounds, Mr. Siegel sees tribal warfare and turf battles, battling boom boxes and an unhealthy atmosphere of menace. Civility, like a toy poodle on a leash, shivers in the corner.
"New Yorkers have never been terribly civil, but it never had an ideological edge, which it now has," Mr. Siegel said.
This edge comes in part from "a loss of shared assumptions, which is the underside of multiculturalism," he said.
"We don't feel we can criticize behavior different from our own, because that would mean imposing a narrow middle-class point of view," he added.
In recent months, however, timorous New Yorkers have begun to whine out loud about the myriad of petty offenses known as quality-of-life crimes: the broken bottle on the sidewalk, the use of convenient nooks and crannies as public urinals. Middle-class New York is suffering death by a thousand life-style cuts. It hurts.
Suddenly, the quality-of-life issue has taken on new urgency. And Mayor Dinkins has received the message. In an aggressive speech last month, he said, "I believe that by creating a climate of civility and decency and order in our neighborhoods, we'll let the pushers and the criminals know that this city is ours to enjoy -- not theirs to destroy."
The standoff is not just between drug pushers and mothers pushing baby carriages, however. Civility breakdown seems to occur whenever two cultures come into contact. The boycott of a Korean grocery store in Brooklyn by black neighborhood residents in 1988 presented two groups whose sense of civility had been outraged.
Black customers complained that the store owners showed disrespect by, among other things, not making eye contact with them at the cash register. Apparently, they did not realize that for Koreans, bowing the head shows politeness toward a customer. The Koreans interpreted loud talking or displays of high spirits as threatening.
Both sides felt aggrieved. Neither side showed much interest in trying to tune in to the other's cultural frequencies.
Mr. Siegel calls this the new tribalism. "If we have fundamentally different values and assumptions, there's no reason to believe we can transcend them in the political arena," he said. "Multiculturalism argues that persuasion is irrelevant."
Civility is a hard sell, particularly in a city like New York, which cherishes its own brand of rudeness like a pungent cheese, repellent to outsiders, perhaps, but prized by the locals. The city that never sleeps is also the city that never says, "Excuse me," "I'm sorry," or "You know, you could be right."
Civility can seem weak and ineffectual even in a normal environment. In New York, it can look like a personality disorder. I'm O.K., you're not O.K. In fact, you're a jerk. And no, we can't get along.
"There may be points at which we can't compromise, but we'd better be very sure we're at this point," Mr. Mouw said. "There's just too much hostility in the air."
 
MOMENTS (ABUNDANT) OF NASTINESS

* Dennis Leary, a chain-smoking, tough-talking comedian, made his debut on MTV in 1987. His trademark, delivered with his face looming into the camera: "I think you hear me knockin' and I think I'm comin' in."
* During the 1991-92 basketball season, Charles Barkley, a forward for the Philadelphia 76ers at the time, spat at heckling fans, hitting an 8-year-old girl. He was fined $10,000, suspended for one game and was subsequently traded to the Phoenix Suns. With him the Suns, talent-rich but considered "soft," aggressed their way into the 1993 National Basketball Association Finals.
* In December 1992, "The Chronic," an album by Dr. Dre, made its debut and featured the rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg. One number profanely suggested, in title and in detail, that women are worthless. "The Chronic" became the biggest-selling hardcore rap album (more than two million sold) and that track's sentiment was emblazoned on a popular T-shirt. Soon after, Onyx, a hip-hop group, released an album with an indelicate title meaning, essentially, "back off." The album sold more than 500,000 copies.
* Beavis and Butthead, cartoon metal-heads, got their own show on MTV in March. Their mixture of adolescent idiocy and cruelty -- blowing up lizards, for example -- made the show one of the music network's biggest hits.
* Vince Coleman of the Mets threw a firecracker at a group of fans outside Dodger Stadium in July, injuring three people, including a 2-year-old girl.
* A duo calling itself the Jerky Boys created an album of its prank phone calls to New Yorkers. The album sold nearly 500,000 copies.
* Ru Paul, the drag performer, insulted Milton Berle onstage at the MTV Awards in September, suggesting that the elderly comedian needed to wear adult diapers. The outburst earned him the nickname Rudepaul.
* This month, Howard Stern, the shock radio disk jockey, published "Private Parts" (Simon & Schuster), which includes this thought on Rodney King: "They didn't beat this idiot enough."
 
MOMENTS (RARE) OF CIVILITY
 * The New York City Transit Authority announced on May 12, 1989, that its trains were 100 percent graffiti-free. Rude culture was tagged back.
* The author M. Scott Peck issued "A World Waiting to Be Born: Civility Rediscovered" (Bantam, 1993). In it he says America is in need of healing. The book stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for 14 weeks.
* The Handshake: Yitzhak Rabin and Yassir Arafat clasped five on the White House lawn on Sept. 13, symbolizing the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Mr. Rabin also gave secondary but symbolic skin to other startled Arab representatives. "Nobody told us this was going to happen," said the Ambassador from Jordan, Fayez Tarawneh. "But we are gentlemen, after all."
* "The Age of Innocence," Martin Scorsese's rendering of an Edith Wharton novel, opened on Sept. 17. Audiences were fascinated by its depiction of life in New York in the 1870's and of a society so civil that you could insult someone without opening your mouth.
* In July, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo came to the aid of Mayor David N. Dinkins's re-election campaign, calling him "the essence of civility." In September, however, the Governor and Mayor were forced to acknowledge the limitations of that style. At another rally, Governor Cuomo told the Mayor, a Marine veteran, "Sometimes you need to talk like a Marine."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS: VOWS;
Janet Wickenhaver and Tom Allon

BYLINE: By Lois Smith Brady

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, Janet Wickenhaver was working as a freelance crime reporter and living alone in a railroad flat in Hoboken, N.J. She jokingly called her apartment "the penthouse exercise suite" because you had to climb four flights of stairs to get to it.
When she wasn't covering murders or drug busts, her night life consisted mainly of playing poker with a close-knit group of other female journalists. "I was militantly pursuing my singlehood," Ms. Wickenhaver said. "But it was beginning to crack." 
 She met Tom Allon, then the editor of The Manhattan Spirit, a weekly newspaper, when she called him with a story idea: a single woman's survival guide to Valentine's Day. (Advice from the guide: "Do not let any question resembling 'What's wrong with me?' stick in your head. Do not call any ex-boyfriends and ask them that question. Do not call your mother and ask her that question.")
Mr. Allon not only bought the story but he also hired her as an associate editor, and they essentially put out the small West Side paper together. For a year, they were friends and colleagues, critiquing each other's headlines, drinking beers after late nights in the office and talking about their love lives.
His love life was, he said, overactive. "One week, I had seven blind dates in six days," he recalled. "I had two in one day -- lunch and dinner. I used to meet them at Caffe Dante on MacDougal Street between Bleecker and Houston. I remember I was there six consecutive nights and I was getting weird looks from the waitresses."
After a year, what was clear to almost everyone who knew the pair became clear to them: they were falling in love.
Now they live together (in a building with an elevator) but work separately. Mr. Allon, 31, is the publisher and editor of both The Manhattan Spirit and Our Town, a neighborhood newspaper for the East Side. Ms. Wickenhaver, 33, is the editor of Street News, a biweekly paper that focuses on homeless issues in New York and has included features on everything from sidewalk musicians to President Clinton's antipoverty legislation. The paper is distributed mainly in the subway by jobless and homeless people.
"It is true that a lot of street people have ancillary mental, drug and other problems," she said. "But they still have stuff to offer, and we shouldn't give up on them."
Mr. Allon and Ms. Wickenhaver were married on Oct. 10 in the grand ballroom of the Puck Building in SoHo. Gauzy curtains covered the windows, Christmas lights were wrapped around the room's many columns and the couple stood under a large white tentlike chuppa surrounded by ficus trees and flowers; it looked like an elaborate Victorian gazebo in the woods.
During the ceremony, Rabbi Avi Winokur sang Hebrew prayers, quoted George Bernard Shaw, recounted the couple's love story and commented that between husband and wife, it's as important to have a down-to-earth friendship as it is to have a love affair.
"Tom and Janet became good friends long before they made this serious decision and I think that bodes well," he said after the ceremony. "I think passion remains with couples who have more than passion to begin with."

HEADLINE: Child Maltreatment Affects the Poor More

 BODY:
Myths die hard, and few myths seem to have as much staying power as the myth that "child abuse cuts across all social and economic lines" but, as the District Attorney candidate Jeanine Pirro puts it, "we see it more in poorer families only because they have more contact with government services" ["Child Abuse Drawing Closer Public Scrutiny," Sept. 12].
Of course, there are some middle-class child abusers, but the evidence is overwhelming that poverty is by far the most important cause of child maltreatment. The Federal Government's second Study of National Incidence and Prevalence of Child Abuse and Neglect found that physical abuse was at least five times more common among poor families and neglect was nearly 12 times more common among the poor. Many other studies have produced similar results. 
 That's not surprising. We know that child abuse is linked to stress and that poverty increases stress. More important, the mere act of being poor is enough to fit the definition of "neglect." And as the article notes, 93 percent of all allegations of child maltreatment in New York State involve neglect.
The overwhelming majority of these cases are nothing like those cited in your article, in which children were starved, drowned and thrown out a window. Far more common are cases in which a family's poverty is confused with neglect.
If not giving enough food to a child is neglect, that includes the wealthy parent who deliberately starves a child and the poor parent whose food stamps run out. But who is likely to turn up more often? If neglect is "lack of supervision," it includes wealthy parents who leave a child alone so they can party all night and the poor, single mother trying to hold a job and stay off welfare whose baby-sitting arrangements are inadequate. But who is likely to turn up more often?
This does not mean we have to eliminate poverty to eliminate child abuse. Simply ameliorating the worst effects of poverty by providing day care or rent subsidies, for example, would dramatically reduce the rate of abuse and neglect. Not only would that allow more children to remain safely in their own homes, it also would free up scarce resources for cases like those described in your article.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: Haiti's Curse;
Power Means Brutality; Practice Makes Perfect

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
FOR most of Haiti's history, the formula insuring its misery has been depressingly simple: a mulatto elite leaves politics to a professional class of brutal demagogues free to do what they will with the country as long as the elite's monopolies are untouched by the hand of government.
"Leave the rich alone to do what they've always done," says a disgruntled army officer in the recent novel of Haiti, "No Other Life," by Brian Moore, explaining the system perfected by the bloody, 29-year Duvalier family dictatorship. "In turn, they're grateful for being spared and so they render unto Caesar." 
 But since the military coup two years ago against this country's first democratically elected President, Haiti's power equation has become even more brutally elementary. The military has muscled out the elite -- a perverse result of repeated international attempts to isolate the country through embargoes and diplomatic pressure meant to secure the return from exile of the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
That result was starkly illustrated last week as the military repudiated a United Nations agreement that it had signed allowing for President Aristide's return -- an accord supported by prominent members of the elite along with vast numbers of the nation's poor as a way of restoring political and economic order to the country.
The military instead orchestrated a demonstration by armed thugs that forced the humiliating retreat from Port-au-Prince of an American ship carrying more than 200 American and Canadian troops sent to help implement the settlement. Two days later, after the United Nations reimposed economic sanctions to force the military to comply, the Justice Minister in Mr. Aristide's transitional Government was cut down by a hail of assassins' bullets on a Port-au-Prince street, along with two aides. By the end of the week, even the menace of warships dispatched by President Clinton to enforce the embargo had not changed the mind of the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who reneged on a promise to step down. With threats against foreigners mounting in a climate of intense hostility, hundreds of United Nations personnel hastily left the country.
Thus have those who imagined that this country could fall no lower than it did under the Duvaliers been awakened to a much more frightening nightmare.
Fed by its control of the country's ports and landing strips, and emboldened by an unfettered ability to cow a population with bullets, the Haitian military has become at once the new elite, the traditional nationalist dictatorship and even the Tontons Macoute -- the Duvaliers' fearsome private militia -- all wrapped into one.
The leaders of the army and the police have learned well the lessons of raw power. General Cedras; his chief of staff, Gen. Philippe Biamby, and the 36-year-old police chief of Port-au-Prince, Col. Joseph Michel Francois -- widely thought to be the military's most powerful officer -- all are descendants of prominent Duvalierists and were raised with a disdain of democracy.
Their economic portfolios are strikingly well-balanced. They earn their livelihood from the lucrative transshipment of illicit drugs from South America to the United States as well as through control of state monopolies like the telephone company. Skimming profits from tariffs and electricity bills alike, their wallets are constantly being fattened in ways that could prove stubbornly resistant to isolation.
Colonel Francois, for example, has become the new czar of the elite's old monopolies: flour, sugar, rice and cement. Through sheer intimidation, he controls enterprises once held by old-line families or more recent Middle Eastern immigrants -- businesses that his downtown police station used to sell "protection" to.
A potentially modernizing influence, a small entrepreneurial class that built its wealth on low-cost, light-assembly industries, has been hurt by an oil embargo, slapped on the country last week for the second time this year.
The entrenchment of the military in Haitian society has long historical roots. Haiti won its independence from France in 1804 in the world's only successful slave revolt. Overnight a land of recent arrivals from Africa, disparate in origin, was forced to stand alone against a hostile outside world. France quickly exacted heavy reparations from what had been its richest colony. The United States, afraid of the inspiration a black nation might give its slaves, declined to recognize Haiti until 1862, despite its contribution of soldiers to America's War of Independence.
For all its African origins, Haiti has always seemed to live in a time all its own. "There is something peculiarly Roman in the air of Haiti: Roman in its cruelty, in its corruption and its heroism," wrote Graham Greene, whose novel "The Comedians" is the classic fictional portrait of the Duvalier era. "We are nearer to the Europe of Nero and Tiberius than to the Africa of Nkrumah."
Haiti as Rome comes across repeatedly in its tormented history. In one of the goriest episodes, President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, having ordered the execution of more than 100 political prisoners, was dragged out of the French Embassy in 1915 by an angry mob, pulled limb from limb through the closed gates. The incident was a factor in the United States intervention in Haiti that followed, although American concerns over German penetration were probably of equal importance.
The ensuing 19-year occupation of Haiti by 3,000 marines, ending in 1934, merely strengthened the Haitian Army along with its determination to be a controlling force in the nation's life. It has gone much the same with subsequent American efforts to influence Haitian affairs.
"The United States is always looking for the good guy, the man that they can trust in the army," said Jocelyn McCalla, an expert in Haitian affairs who directs the National Coalition of Haitian Refugees in New York. "And they are always surprised when things go bad."
Although it could suddenly capitulate in the current confrontation, the army has the ability to hold out for at least months while conditions deteriorate rapidly for the vast majority of Haitians. That could result in a renewed exodus of boat people toward the United States, as well as an incalculable toll of victims of violent repression.
Even if the military can be brought quickly to its knees, however, a more vexing issue remains: Can an institution that has never long kept itself out of politics be induced to live within the bounds of a true democracy?
Many people knowledgeable about the United Nations settlement intended to end Haiti's agony doubt its viability. The plan calls for lightly armed international experts to separate the police from the army and retrain both forces in perhaps no more than six months. Haiti's forces are intended to emerge as respectably professional entities after crash courses in everything from physical fitness to basic soldiering skills and human rights.
Mr. McCalla and others say that the most important question, one few diplomats or officials wish to confront, is why Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country and a land without external enemies, needs an army at all.
And as long as Haiti's institutions remain sapped of their vitality by a craven elite and threatened by military power, any outside "solution" is likely to prove transitory. Saying as much in his pessimistic novel, Mr. Moore compared Haiti to a "cheap gramophone record."
"The new tune plays for a while, then the needle sticks in the groove and the player-arm slumps back and slips off the disc."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Just Say 'Security';
One Clinton Promise Fits All Issues

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A NEATLY dressed 8-year-old boy stood up at at a televised question-and-answer session in Sacramento recently to tell President Clinton that he has been scared to go to school ever since his brother got shot there.
In the White House Rose Garden days before, a young woman told Hillary Rodham Clinton that her sister is dying of AIDS while fighting for the coverage that her insurance company is threatening to cancel. 
 And every day for two weeks, Mr. Clinton has argued for the North American Free Trade Agreement before angry union leaders and dubious members of Congress who fear that it will cost thousands of jobs.
For each of these issues and several others, Mr. Clinton has offered virtually the same response. His administration, he has promised in a series of speeches, will restore security to American life.
Security. The scope of that promise is immense, but the President has tapped into a American craving for certainty at a time when so much of what has gone before is up for grabs. Big corporations and even governments are laying off workers, and health costs and health coverage are slipping out of reach. And, as even the United States' role on the international stage is being rewritten, American optimism is fading.
The President has said he will curb skyrocketing health care costs, flood the streets with police officers and create thousands of new jobs by dropping trade barriers with Mexico and Canada. It is a deep burden for any President to take on.
And if he does not, Mr. Clinton runs the risk of handing his opponents a new version of the formulaic campaign query that Ronald Reagan coined in 1980 to defeat Jimmy Carter and that Mr. Clinton appropriated to defeat George Bush: Do you feel more secure than you did four years ago?
During the campaign, Mr. Clinton also said he would cut taxes on the middle class and devise a national service program that would enable every student to pay for college. Neither of those pledges, which were compromised away after Mr. Clinton took office, lived up to expectations.
Now, with the almost breathtakingly ambitious domestic agenda, the President has constructed a new set of hurdles for himself. The North American Free Trade Agreement is already creaking under the weight of organized opposition. The health care plan is beginning to suffer in public opinion for lack of detail. And the anti-crime package, which has advanced toward near-passage at least twice before in Congress, has yet to win the consensus it will need to push it over the top this time.
All of this could make the promise of security a pretty hard one to keep.
"There's a huge gap between what they say they want to accomplish and the programs and policies they put into effect to accomplish them," said John E. Robson, who was deputy treasury secretary under George Bush. He calls this condition "Clinton's gap."
But the President's closest advisers say that the call for security transcends politics and is Mr. Clinton's way of recognizing the precarious nature of the American condition, both politically and economically.
"It was something evolved by him, not something pasted together by his staff or by his advisers," said David Gergen, a counselor to the President who has helped shape the message. "There has been an evolution in his thinking. He has been trying to piece together in his own mind a way to talk about and think through what we go through as a people."
Sheltering all of the President's domestic initiatives under a single umbrella, Mr. Gergen said, "gives momentum to all of them."
Frank Luntz, a pollster who worked for Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot, agrees.
"It's very easy to sell security, because you're selling a panacea," he said. But the White House, he asserted, is selling a pledge of safety that probably cannot be honored.
"That fear of the future is what's leading Americans to try to put a floor down which they cannot fall below," Mr. Luntz said. "The President is of the belief that people are so desperate and so anxious to create that floor that they will sell the future for the present."
In some cases, the link seems to make perfect sense. In recent speeches, Mr. Clinton has segued from discussing the need for universal health coverage to bemoaning the violence that has burdened city hospitals with uninsured victims of gunshots and gang warfare.
"We have some demographic characteristics that make us a more expensive population than Canada or Great Britain or Germany," a senior White House aide said last week. "And the level of violence is one of those characteristics. And unless you talk about violence and substance abuse as health problems, you don't deal with the whole range of issues that are out there to be confronted."
"It is not just a social problem," the aide said. "It is not just a criminal problem. It is a health problem. And the more we can draw those links, people will begin to understand the relationship."
The link between individual well-being and free trade is a somewhat more difficult case to make, because the Administration lost the march on selling Nafta to labor unions and to Ross Perot, who joined forces to paint the pact as a bad idea.
Some Administration officials sense that they may have handed their Republican opponents a weapon that they can eventually use to attack the President. As a result, they have begun fine-tuning the Clinton message to reflect public distrust in Government.
"If we were to deal seriously and get a serious gun bill through and a serious bill on cops, would that solve the crime problem?" said Mr. Gergen. "No. But would it convince people that the Government is working with them to help reduce violence? I think it would. The trust would go up."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
After 20 Years, America's Foot Is Still On the Gas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
TWENTY years after the Arab oil embargo, after the gas lines, after the fist fights, after the nation's promise to itself to do better, some things have changed. Mostly they've gotten worse.
The United States today uses almost as much oil as it did then, but imports 44.6 percent of it, up from 37.2 percent in 1973. At the time of the embargo, 5.3 percent of the oil used here came from Arab members of Opec; now it is 11.6 percent. Then our largest supplier was Venezuela, which is geographically and culturally close to the United States; now it is Saudi Arabia, which is neither. 
 Then, we imported oil to help drive our cars and trucks 1.3 trillion miles a year; today we drive 2.2 trillion.
Some of the people most concerned about energy say none of this should come as a surprise. "The only thing we learn from history is we learn nothing from history," said James Schlesinger, a former Defense Secretary and head of the C.I.A., who was the "energy czar" during the second oil crisis, in 1979.
Everyone who thinks about it agrees that some supplies are shaky. Venezuela, now the second-largest supplier to this country, has had two coup attempts this year. Nigeria, No. 5, is also unstable. Saudi Arabia, No. 1 at 1.5 million barrels of the 8.5 million barrels imported each day, faces religious strains.
Production from stable, friendly places, like Texas and Oklahoma, continues to dwindle; domestic production is down by about 2 million barrels a day over the 20-year period, despite tapping the Alaskan fields. The oil industry wants import tariffs or tax incentives, along with access to areas that environmentalists want protected.
Environmentalists like heavier gasoline taxes, and on Oct. 1 the Federal tax rose 4.3 cents a gallon, as much as Congress could stand but not as much in the average motorist's weekly budget as a morning newspaper.
"Our energy policy is to take the cheapest oil in the world, regardless of source, and take our chances that it will continue to be cheap and available," said William K. Tell Jr., senior vice president of Texaco.
On the consumption side, the problem is partly technology but mostly will. A Federal standard established after the embargo sets average mileage at 27.5, and the Environmental Protection Agency said in a recent report that manufacturers have no incentive to do better.
 
Accelerating Acceleration
 While the manufacturers are getting more from a gallon of gasoline these days, they are applying the gains to performance, not mileage. The average time to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour was 14 seconds in 1974, and is now about 11.5 seconds, thanks to multi-valve engines and other technical improvements. If Detroit had interrupted that trend in 1984, when the average time was about 13.4 seconds, and applied all subsequent improvements to fuel economy, average miles per gallon would be about 30 instead of 27.5, the agency believes.
"We have testosterone cars instead of efficient cars," said Daniel F. Becker, an energy expert at the Sierra Club in Washington.
Detroit does, in fact, build some efficient cars. The Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a lobby backed by the auto makers, analyzed the E.P.A. statistics on the 1994 models and pointed out that the 10 models with the highest ratings, 43 miles a gallon to 58 miles a gallon, "represent less than 2 percent of all passenger cars sold." Mr. Becker's response is that Detroit doesn't try very hard to sell the efficient ones.
But the trend to indulge the vehicular equivalent of hormones leads some consumers into vehicles less efficient than cars. "The industry's gone to tremendous efforts to improve the fuel economy of cars, but for the fleet as a whole we're losing it to trucks," said Robert M. Heavenrich, an automotive specialist at the E.P.A., who noted that 4 of 10 vehicles sold are light-duty trucks. Among the top 10 most popular vehicles in the last model year were four pickups and a van.
Intermittent schemes to get people out of cars do not get very far. A recent book on Americans and their cars, "Where the Road and the Sky Collide," by K. T. Berger, (Henry Holt, $22.50) says even the most casual observer would conclude that the car and driver are "the dominant life-form roaming the countryside."
President Clinton recently announced a program to put idle nuclear bomb scientists to work helping the industry make an 80-mile-a-gallon car. A tall order, but maybe more likely than getting drivers to take the bus.
Are there any grounds for optimism? Maybe a few.
For one, the world's largest oil producer, the Soviet Union, collapsed in the early 90's with barely a ripple in the market. For another, some exporting companies are unlikely now to cut off supplies to consuming nations' distributors, because the exporters are the distributors; the Saudis own half of Texaco's eastern retailing system, and the Venezuelans have invested heavily in Citgo.
There is no more Soviet Union to march into the Persian Gulf. At least at the moment, there is no more Arab-Israeli conflict. And there is recent evidence, from the invasion of Kuwait, that war in the oil fields does not mean a catastrophic reduction in supplies.
Charles DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said, "Although we're importing a larger fraction, there's also more oil in the world than there was then." It seems unlikely, but world reserves now are nearly 50 times annual consumption, the highest ratio ever.
"The idea that we're running out is getting to be sort of weak," he said. "The idea of weaning yourself off oil with expensive methods makes less sense."
There are reasons to be wary of imports, though, he said, among them the tremendous cost. In 1973, spending on oil imports was $23.9 billion, and total trade deficit was a paltry $3.9 billion; last year, oil imports cost $44.8 billion and total deficit was $84.5 billion.
Eventually, the habit will have to change, said Mr. Becker of the Sierra Club. The deciding factor may not be the stability of distant countries; it may turn out to be pollution or global warming, or the realization that this resource should be shared with future generations. No matter how much oil is found, Mr. Becker said, it is a finite resource: "After all, they're not making new dinosaurs."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Wanted: Hot Leads on Cold Cases;
Now Bounty Hunters Can Make Out Like Bandits

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE prices on the "Wanted" posters are going up.
Earlier this month, the Federal Government offered $1 million to anyone who helps crack the 15-year-old "Unabom" case -- the hunt for the bomber whose parcels have maimed and killed executives and professors. 
 And last month, the Clinton Administration offered its second $2 million reward in the World Trade Center bombing case. It said the money would go to anyone providing information leading to the capture of Abdul Rahman Yasin, a suspect in the bombing of the World Trade Center who may have fled to Iraq. Over the summer, the Administration made a similar offer for information about another suspect, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. He is also believed to have escaped to Iraq, although investigators think he may have gone from there to Iran or Afghanistan.
While million-dollar rewards are still rare, the trend toward them seems to be rising much faster than inflation can account for. After United States troops were sent to Panama in 1989, President Bush approved a $1 million bounty for information that would lead to the capture of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was hiding in the Vatican diplomatic mission. The money was never paid because Mr. Noriega gave himself up.
Some private groups and other countries have offered seven-figure rewards, including the Colombian Government's bounty earlier this year of more than $6 million for the capture of Pablo Escobar, one of the leaders of the Medellin cocaine cartel. But in the United States, by and large, Federal and state agencies have posted more modest offers -- in the $10,000 to $50,000 range for killers and kidnappers.
And private bounties seem to be getting larger as well. For many years, armored truck companies and art galleries have offered large rewards when they have been the victims of robberies. But a recent offer by the film star Winona Ryder of $200,000 for the safe return of a 12-year-old girl kidnapped at knife-point from her California home has struck some law enforcement officials as unusually generous. Like the girl, Polly Klaas, Ms. Ryder is from Petaluma and began her stage career in a local theater at age 12. She decided to offer the reward after seeing a segment about the case on "America's Most Wanted."
What has changed things?
Officials say that high-profile, high-stakes cases -- like the World Trade Center explosion and the serial mail bomber -- put enormous pressure on investigators. And when the trail starts to grow cold, sometimes the only way to keep an investigation going is to tantalize the public with lottery-sized jackpots.
"A million dollars tends to wonderfully focus the mind," said John C. Killorin, a spokesman for the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "It's a fair assessment to say that when an agency comes forward with a reward offer, it means that either the leads have run out or there are just too many of them out there."
The firearms agency is one of three Federal agencies, along with anonymous private donors, to jointly offer $1 million for information that leads to the conviction of the serial bomber. Mr. Killorin said it already prompted more than 1,200 calls offering tips, although the case still remains far from being solved. He said the agencies will divvy up the reward if more than one person offers clues that crack the case.
Do bounties work? Sometimes. Of course, governments have offered them since before the founding of the Republic. One of the earliest Federal laws on the subject was adopted in 1899, when Congress authorized the Government to provide rewards to anyone who helped turn in those who failed to pay taxes. And earlier this century, rewards played an important role in the Government's enforcement of Prohibition laws forbidding production or sale of liquor.
Because big rewards are rare and Federal and local agencies account for them in different ways -- most lump them in with their payments to street informants, for example -- it is hard to compare such programs. But officials say the largest is probably the Internal Revenue Service's program that gives informants a portion of what the Government collects (up to a $100,000 maximum). Between 1967 and last year, the I.R.S. paid more than $21 million to recover more than $1 billion in unpaid taxes. Some rewards reached the full $100,000, and officials think those are the largest government bounties collected.
Civil libertarians and defense lawyers say they are generally less troubled by rewards offered to the public than by other kinds of inducements -- like payoffs to informants. Still, they are worried when the awards get so big that they encourage crackpots. They can also taint a trial when a jury begins to consider how much money was paid to help catch the defendant. The large awards, they say, can be big incentives to those tempted to violate civil liberties and privacy rights.
Vivian Berger, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who teaches law at Columbia University, said that because the rewards are usually offered to the public at large and paid only after convictions, they are not as problematic as payments to an informant who may have participated in a crime or to someone who can entrap a defendant. She also said that rewards, "to the extent that they are not humongous," are less likely to "skewer the reliability of information."
Still, some rewards encourage abuses anyway. Last year, the Internal Revenue Service received 10,966 claims for prizes. It awarded 671.
"Some of the complainants are people who are disenchanted with their neighbors, spouses or employers," said Johnell Hunter, an I.R.S. spokeswoman. "They don't always work out very well. We don't publicize the program just for that reason. We don't want a rush of unhappy people ratting on their neighbors without cause."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
In a Politician's Eyes, Some Jobs Are Worthier

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HERE is a case where economists and politicians part ways.
Economists say it should make no difference whether a worker was laid off by General Dynamics or by Woolworth -- whether a plant closed because of a specific change in Government policy like cuts in the defense budget or because of corporate mismanagement or the vagaries of the marketplace. All laid-off workers, they say, deserve equal treatment. 
 To politicians, however, some workers are more worthy of Government help. In their view, farmers, lumberjacks and assembly-line workers need retraining more than office workers do. And, they say, when the Government is to blame for layoffs, it is obliged to help.
So when Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who used to teach economic policy at Harvard, announced last week that the Administration would support new money to retrain workers who lose jobs because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, he did it against his better judgment but out of political necessity.
Shortly before the announcement, he had argued that special programs for particular workers were bad economics. "If you were a supersleuth," he said, "you could trace everything back to some Government policy or other -- to fiscal policy or monetary policy or regulatory policies."
So, he had said, rather than waste money trying to figure out why someone is unemployed or risk treating workers differently, the Government should equally aid everyone out of work, regardless of the reason.
John T. Dunlop, who was Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration, agreed. "Suppose the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates leads to a decline in business and people are laid off," he said. "That's just as much a Government policy as new trade rules."
Although a Labor Department audit circulating last week showed that the existing training program for workers hurt by foreign trade has been largely ineffective, Mr. Reich had to bow to political reality. The trade agreement faces do-or-die votes in Congress, and manufacturing workers, who fear Nafta would cost them their jobs, have considerable influence. Without a special retraining program for workers who lose their jobs to Mexicans, the trade measure cannot pass.
Another recent example of how some jobs carry more political weight than others: Last summer, when President Clinton announced plans to restrict logging in the Pacific Northwest, he promised $1.2 billion to help affected communities. That works out to $200,000 for each of the 6,000 jobs the Government thinks will be lost.
But when 30,000 Wall Street workers, most of them secretaries and clerks, were laid off in the late 1980's, the Government offered no special help.
Or consider how differently the jobs of auto workers and computer workers are treated. The policy of the Federal Government and most states and towns is to buy only cars made in the United States. The idea is to protect American jobs.
But walk into any government office and you are likely to see computers made overseas. This, even though International Business Machines is cutting almost 200,000 jobs from its worldwide payroll.
It is easy to understand why the Government spends hundreds of millions of dollars to help workers and towns adjust to the closing of military bases. This is more a question of equity than politics.
But it is less apparent why loggers should get more help than Wall Street clerks or auto workers more than computer programmers.
 
Union Labels
 One explanation is that the workers at computer companies and banks are rarely unionized, while the United Automobile Workers has political muscle and public relations experience.
But Northwest loggers do not owe their political strength to a union. Their case turned on how concentrated the timber industry is. Whole counties in Washington, Oregon and California depend on logging. I.B.M. jobs are spread so widely around the world that no single community is so dependent.
In the counties just north of New York City, where several thousand I.B.M. jobs are being eliminated, the cutback is of more social than economic significance.
"I.B.M. was a symbol of economic growth for this region," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It was high tech, high skill, high pay, high security. Now that symbol has given way. Suddenly the stability is gone."
The most important distinction politicians make about industries seems to be to favor dying ones. Loggers cannot go across town and find new trees to chop down. Workers who lose spots on assembly lines are unlikely to find equivalent pay elsewhere. And lumberjacks and grimy factory workers seem to fit the American myth of the rugged individual, while few good movies have been made about the romance of data processing. The perception is that a computer worker with a pink slip can drive a mile down the road and get hired without missing a paycheck. In fact, that is not always the case. The number of jobs in the industry nationwide -- about 400,000 -- has dropped by 20 percent since 1985. But it is true that computer workers can transfer skills more easily than blue-collar ones can. And companies like I.B.M. make Government intervention less necessary with generous severance pay and early retirement plans.
"The buyout plans are very effective, so people aren't considered victims like the auto workers," said Lenny Siegel, director of the Pacific Studies Center, a research institute in Silicon Valley.
And despite problems at some companies, the industry is not flagging. "I.B.M. is cutting back, and New York loses jobs," Mr. Siegel said. "But things are booming in Austin. The auto business isn't booming anywhere."
James E. Challenger, who heads a job-placement company in Chicago, offered another reason why some workers seem to have more political influence.
"They're the ones who are the most newsworthy," he said. "The picture of the logger versus the spotted owl is simply much more graphic than the picture of someone who sits in front of a computer all day long."

HEADLINE: PACT CALLED KEY TO LOWER IMPORTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton, in his most vigorous promotion of the North American Free Trade Agreement since the formal signing of labor and environmental safeguards in mid-September, warned today that failure to ratify the deal could isolate the United States and flood it with imported goods.
"Without Nafta, one of our best markets, Mexico, could turn to Japan and Europe to make a sweetheart deal for trade," the President said in his weekly radio address. "Without Nafta, Mexico could well become an export platform, allowing more products from Japan and Europe into America. Why would we want that to happen?" 
 Critics of the agreement have repeatedly argued that it would be American companies that would use Mexico as a platform from which to export goods after they move factories there, causing a substantial loss of jobs.
Mr. Clinton's renewed campaign for the agreement, which would gradually remove tariffs and other trade barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada, was the latest example of a shift in the drive to stress the consequences if it fails.
Other arguments are that a rejection would undermine multinational trade talks now headed for their decisive phase and would jeopardize changes already adopted by Mexico.
 
Vote Set for Nov. 17
 The House is scheduled to vote on the agreement on Nov. 17, with no clear majority for passage yet in sight. The Administration is expected to win approval in the Senate by Thanksgiving.
The President's warnings also followed the outbreak this week of a battle over how to replace $2.4 billion in tariffs that would be lost under the trade agreement and how to pay for $325 million in border cleanup and worker retraining programs. An Administration proposal to levy a tax of at least $5 on international airplane tickets met fierce resistance from airlines and the travel and transportation industries.
The House Ways and Means Committee is to meet Tuesday to consider this issue, among other things, and the Administration is struggling to find a compromise. Mr. Clinton did not refer to the revenue question today.
On Wednesday, representatives of 200 companies with interests in Mexico will display products at the White House in an effort to portray American reliance on trade with Mexico, with which the United States runs a hefty surplus of exports over imports.
Mr. Clinton also used the radio address today to boast that "good things are beginning to happen" with the economy. He cited the savings that homeowners have pocketed as they take advantage of tumbling long-term interest rates to refinance mortgages and passage of a budget intended to cut the Federal deficit. He also said that 1.1 million private-sector jobs were created in his first eight months in office, more than the number generated in all of President George Bush's term.

HEADLINE: At Border, Optimism on Trade Accord

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: McALLEN, Tex., Oct. 12

 BODY:
In this Texas city near the Mexican border, where the unemployment rate is more than twice the national average, Pedro Diaz is acutely aware of the promise and the perils of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Diaz, a 24-year-old entrepreneur, owns a small but growing business along Highway 83 that sells automobile stereos and alarms. Already, 45 percent of his customers come from Mexico. The trade accord, he says, could be his ticket to rapid expansion into a more affluent Mexican market. But larger retailers might sense the potential, too, he says, and move in to undercut him and drive him out of business. 
 On balance, though, like many people here who somehow seem to be in favor of free trade and a little afraid of it at the same time, Mr. Diaz says he wants Nafta, as the accord is known, to pass when it comes up for a Congressional vote scheduled for next month.
"For me, I might just set up shops in Mexico, hire sales reps, all of that," he said. "But it's going to be a whole new world there, and the one thing I know is that if it passes, I can't just do things the way I'm doing them now. That would be devastating."
 
Fingers-Crossed Optimism
 While the proposed agreement has provoked visceral hostility in many parts of the Northeast and Midwest, a much more common sentiment here and in many cities close to the border is a fingers-crossed optimism about the opportunities Americans might enjoy when and if Mexican consumers have more money to spend. That may help explain why two-thirds of the Texas Congressional delegation is pledged to vote for the accord and several other Texas Representatives are still on the fence.
For many poor cities like McAllen, the support for the pact, which would gradually eliminate all tariffs and other trade barriers between Mexico, the United States and Canada, is bolstered by an undercurrent of fear about what will happen if the accord is defeated.
"Mexico is not going to let us have our cake and eat it too," said Mike Allen, the president of the McAllen Economic Development Corporation, explaining that he feared free trade could be replaced by a trade war. "They may just raise tariffs sky high."
The corporation Mr. Allen heads operates an 80-acre foreign trade zone just three miles north of the international bridge to the neighboring Mexican city of Reynosa. The trade zone, one of several along the border, is an area through which American-made components pass to Mexico, with duties waived, until they are assembled into finished products in Mexico by factory workers in what is known as the maquiladora industry.
The finished products are then shipped back to the United States with a tariff applied only to the amount of the value that is added by the assembly. The trade zones were approved by Congress as a way of spurring economic growth along the border.
About $1.2 billion worth of goods annually move through the trade zone here. The 91 operating maquiladoras in Reynosa put together a combination of goods, including pianos, semiconductors, lingerie and chrome-plated lawn chairs.
 
Fears of Higher Tariffs
 If the trade pact is defeated, some merchants here said they feared a return to the days when Mexican tariffs discouraged Mexicans from crossing the border to buy in Texas. The Mexican tariffs on some goods purchased in the United States could run as high as 50 to 100 percent.
"I talk to people in Reynosa all the time, and I can tell you, it's bordering on a tremendous insult to Mexico if Nafta is voted down," Mr. Allen said.
As in many parts of the country, there are some people here who fervently support the pact, arguing it will stimulate the economies on both sides of the border, create jobs and raise incomes.
And there are people who oppose it because they fear its chief effect will be to drain jobs from this country to Mexico, as industries move their operations south where labor is much cheaper. Some even insist the evident public support for the trade accord is misleading.
"There's not a whole lot of unionizing going on around here," said Jesse Bielefeld, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. representative for the area. "On the other hand, there is a real management push for Nafta. So if you're a worker and you speak out against the trade agreement, it really might affect whether you work the next day."
Still, many people here who favor the pact say they do so not because they completely understand the mechanics of free trade, but because they see tying their futures to the Mexican economy as a gamble worth taking -- or as an inevitability.
The McAllen area is one of the poorest metropolitan areas in the country, and it showed up in Federal statistics a few years ago as having one of the highest percentages of homes without indoor plumbing. But those figures also belie the enormous amount of economic activity here in recent years. Almost all of it, local officials say, is connected one way or another with Mexico.
 
Big Growth and Unemployment
 In fact, if it is possible for a place to be booming and busting all at the same time, McAllen fits the bill. Unemployment for surrounding Hidalgo County stands at 15.1 percent, a figure that almost everybody here says is understated, well above the national rate of 6.5 percent, according to the Texas Employment Commission. But McAllen, which despite being named for a Scottish settler has an unmistakable Latin feel, is also experiencing phenomenal growth. Its population, barely 10,000 a half century ago, swelled to 66,952 10 years ago and then jumped 25 percent in the last decade, to 84,021. The surrounding area is the fastest-growing in Texas and the 13th fastest-growing metropolitan market in the country, according to Federal census statistics.
Annual retail trade more than doubled in McAllen in the last five years, from $800 million in 1987 to $1.7 billion in 1992, said Michael J. Blum, a McAllen business consultant. Next door to the foreign trade zone, a $15 million produce market and storage center is under construction, financed by a large Mexican bank.
Tony Aguirre, who owns several hardware stores and an industrial supply house in the McAllen area, said about two-thirds of his business stems from the other side of the border. "I think we'll grow regardless of what happens," he said. "But we won't grow as fast without Nafta. That's the key."
 
'It Could Be a Nightmare'
 The more complicated question, said both he and Mr. Diaz, the car stereo entrepreneur, is whether their investing in Mexico will be too risky.
"It's not like it will be an automatic gold mine," Mr. Diaz said. "It could be a nightmare. There are all sorts of problems. Mexico has to change its infrastructure, for one thing. You drive to Monterrey, my friend, and you'll see crosses every half-mile on the highway. The roads are horrible."
But, Mr. Diaz added, if the point is to increase Mexicans' investment in their country's highways and bridges, the trade accord will probably be a good catalyst. In any event, given that Reynosa is next door and that people here can get to Monterrey faster than they get to just about any big city in Texas, many people here say they are convinced that their city's prosperity is linked to Mexico's.
"That's the bottom line," said Tommy Joyner, an official with the local Chamber of Commerce. "The people in McAllen, Tex., probably have a lot more in common with Reynosa than they do with Washington, D.C."

HEADLINE: A Deluge of Foreign Assistance Fails To Revive Egypt's Stricken Economy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO

 BODY:
For nearly two decades, Egypt has been the beneficiary of one of the world's most ambitious assistance program, a multibillion-dollar rescue mission involving the United States' largest overseas aid operation since Vietnam, wealthy Arab neighbors, European creditors and international bankers. All are committed to securing Cairo's political stability.
By any measure, these huge infusions of cash -- more than $35 billion in United States economic and military aid alone since 1975 -- have done much to reshape the Egyptian landscape. The money has provided better roads and telephones, cleaner water and wider access to consumer goods. Birth rates have declined, and life expectancy has risen. 
 But over the same period, Egypt's creaking economy, with its wheezing state-run industries and bloated public sector, has remained virtually intact, forcing economists, bankers and Egyptian Government officials to acknowledge a painful truth. For all the billions pumped into Egypt, including a tripling in overseas assistance the last three years as a reward for Egypt's role in the Persian Gulf war, there has been little real improvement in the daily lives and fortunes of most of the country's 56 million people.
 
Expectations vs. Reality
 For Egyptian officials and overseas policymakers who have invested in Egypt's stability, the gap between expectations and reality continues to cloud the Egyptian Government's future, despite progress over the last two years in beginning to reform Egypt's moribund economy.
While President Hosni Mubarak appears to be firmly in control -- he won overwhelming endorsement to a third six-year term this month, albeit as the only candidate on the ballot -- the poverty, joblessness and lack of opportunity that is endemic here provides fuel for the Islamic militants determined overthrow the Government.
"The biggest challenge we will face over the next two or three years is in getting the economy moving in such a way that ordinary people will feel it, and be convinced things are getting better," said Yousef Boutros-Ghali, the American-educated Minister of State for the economy and nephew of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations. "There is no point in pretending otherwise."
All across this teeming, swollen city of more than 10 million, people measure their lives against their hopes, and come up wanting. On the campus of Cairo University, students like 18-year-old Mahmoud el-Kourdy complain that while they are pursuing studies for a degrees, they know their best hope for a job after graduation is to work as a hotel tour guide.
"I speak some English, so I think I have a chance," he said. "Otherwise, I don't know what I will do."
 
Rising Cost of Living
 In the slums of Imbaba, across the Nile from Cairo, a tea shop owner named al-Saify Khodayra said he was hard-pressed to afford the rising costs of electricity, gasoline and sugar, as a result of cutbacks in Government subsidies. "The electrical bill for my shop and my home is now 200 pounds a month," or about $60, he said. "But my income is less than 500 pounds."
Nearly 20 years after Anwar el-Sadat, then the President, said he wanted to open Egypt to Western investors, Egypt has only just begun to implement the sort of basic changes that international bankers say are necessary to restructure Egypt's hugely inefficient, centrally planned economy, attract serious private investment and create the jobs that are key to any hope of real stability.
Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United States, Egypt has made notable progress over the last two years. Bolstered by a huge infusion of aid after the Persian Gulf war -- including a decision by the United States and Arab governments to write off some $13 billion worth of military debt -- Egypt agreed in 1991 to carry out a first round of economic reforms.
In return, some $3 billion in non-military debt owned the Paris Club of creditor nations was forgiven, the first of some $10 billion in promised loan write-offs tied to guarantees of an economic overhaul.
 
Egypt's Fiscal Changes
 As a result, Egypt has now cut its budget deficit from about 20 percent of gross domestic product to below 3 percent, brought inflation below 10 percent, stabilized its currency exchange rate, reduced expensive consumer subsides and removed controls on interest rates, helping bolster cash reserves to an estimated $11 billion.
This summer, the Egyptian Government agreed to a second phase of economic reforms, promising another $3 billion in debt forgiveness in return for promoting private business, liberalizing trade, and overhauling and privatizing state-owned companies.
Egyptian officials say the country's course toward a free-market economy is "irreversible." But this summer's agreement was delayed while Egyptian officials and international bankers wrestled over the pace of economic change, despite warnings it must move quickly to generate some of the 500,000 new jobs a year that the World Bank say are necessary to sustain real growth in the face of a population growing at 2.5 percent a year.
In the meantime, Egypt is vulnerable to domestic unrest. Half of the country is still illiterate; one in every three Egyptian workers lives off an average income of less than $25 a month, and housing remains woefully inadequate. More importantly, there are simply not enough jobs to absorb the 400,000 to 500,000 people who enter the work force each year.
 
Disappointing Example
 If Nasser's 1950's utopian vision of land reform, central planning and nationalization once provided the principal model of economic change for developing nations trying to shuck the remnants of colonial rule, Cairo's nearly two decades of dependence on Western economic assistance stands as an example of quite another sort. It shows the limits of even enormous, long-term financial intervention to achieve fundamental change within developing economies burdened by scarce resources, bloated public sectors and years of mismanagement.
The difficulty in achieving real and sustained economic change in Egypt raises questions for Washington and its Western allies, as they embark on aid and assistance programs intended to revive the moribund economies in the former republics of the Soviet Union, as well as the formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe.
But in some ways, Egypt has posed difficulties that do not exist in the old Soviet bloc, where the move toward market economies has come abruptly, on the heels of political rebellion. Compared to those in Eastern Europe, Asia or Latin America, the transformation here has been drawn out.
In a recent analysis of the Egyptian economy, Rodney Wilson, a professor at Durham University in Britain, argued, "Egyptian state-sector managers are even more resistant to change than their counterparts in Eastern Europe, and they are highly skeptical about the gains which restructuring or privatization will bring."
 
Fears of Social Problems
 Part of the problem is political. Haunted by memories of widespread rioting that followed the Government's abrupt decision in 1977 to abolish many consumer subsidies, officials of the Mubarak Government are resisting changes that may pose any threat of further social dislocation.
While 17 nations have set up a $613 million fund to help alleviate the impact of privatization, the World Bank has estimated that the sale or liquidation of state-owned companies could more than double unemployment.
Last year, according to the United States Embassy, unemployment here was estimated at about 9 percent, although the number is probably closer to 20 percent because of Egypt's vast shadow subsistence economy of workers, peddlers, vendors and others who never show up in official data.
Partly because Egypt has been slow or reluctant to enforce the kinds of fundamental economic changes already under way in Eastern Europe, few people believe Cairo is prepared to be weaned from its outside cash lifeline, especially considering the continuing threat posed by Muslim militants and the instability in the Middle East.
"If the tubes were disconnected, the patient could die," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said. "We still need to know that we have the financial support, because it is, as much as anything else, a reflection of political support, too."
 
Remarkable Amount of Aid
 In Washington, some members of Congress have already questioned whether the Clinton Administration can afford to continue pouring billions of dollars in Egypt and Israel.
The amount of money funneled into Egypt has been remarkable. According to the United Nations, Cairo last year received more than 10 percent of the $45 billion in overseas assistance distributed among more than 150 nations.
Since 1975, American economic assistance to Cairo has totaled approximately $19 billion, most of it in the form of grants for local development, waste water projects, food aid and energy development. In addition, the United States has given Egypt $16 billion in military assistance since 1979, of which $7 billion consisted of loans that were written off in return for Egypt's help during the Persian Gulf war.
Persian Gulf nations also wrote off $6.2 billion worth of debt in 1991 and began to provide $2.3 billion in economic assistance. Over all, according to data from the United States Embassy, the gross official development assistance to Egypt jumped from $1.6 billion in 1989 to $5.4 billion in 1990 and nearly $5 billion in 1991..
 
Need for Private Investment
 But international bankers say the key to real growth in Egypt is increased private investment and the development of a substantial private sector. According to Mr. Wilson, foreign investment in Egypt since 1974 has totaled just $2.3 billion.
While manufacturing accounts for 16 percent of Egypt's gross domestic product, exports remain weak, and Cairo continues to carry a large trade deficit, aggravated by its continuing need to import some 42 percent of its annual food requirements.
Mohammed Farid Khamis, chairman of Oriental Weavers Group, an Egyptian rug and carpet manufacturer, is one of Egypt's most successful businessmen and a proponent of more Government measures to encourage private investment. His company's sales have grown to $200 million in 1992 from $1.5 million in 1979, with much of that growth coming from overseas.
"We employ 300 people in our factory," said Mr. Khamis, whose plant in the Tenth of Ramadan industrial city outside Cairo uses computer-assisted design and manufacturing processes. "If the public sector was running this company, there would probably be 3,000 employees here."
 
Dependence on Tourism
 Until now, economists say, Egypt has remained far too dependent on its service industries, which in turn means its annual revenue stream can vary widely, from year to year. Receipts from tourism, for example, one of Egypt's principal sources of hard currency earnings, have more than tripled over the last decade, according to the United States Embassy.
But this year, the tourist industry virtually collapsed as a result of fears among travelers about Islamic militants' violence in Egypt.
In addition to foreign aid receipts, tourism is one of the pillars that have anchored the economy since the mid-1970's. The others are Suez Canal revenues, oil exports and remittances from Egyptians working mostly in neighboring Arab countries.
According to current estimates, about 2.5 million Egyptians -- one in every seven people of working age -- leave Egypt to seek their fortune. Last year, according to the United States Embassy, they sent back a record $5.5 billion, taking advantage of high returns on Egyptian bank accounts.

HEADLINE: Congress Eliminates Aid for Production Of Honey and Wool

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 16

 BODY:
Tenacious Federal subsidies for the wool and mohair industry have been cut by Congress.
The subsidies, created in 1954 when wool and mohair were considered strategic materials essential for military uniforms, cost the Government nearly $200 million a year. Cited as an example of Government waste by officials like Vice President Al Gore, the subsidies were given a death sentence by the Senate in July, only to be revived through the efforts of lawmakers from Texas, where many of the sheep and goat ranchers work. 
 In voice votes on Friday, the House and Senate agreed to phase out the subsidies over the next two years. The bill is intended to satisfy critics of the program while easing the economic blow to ranchers.
Congress also eliminated honey support payments, another program criticized as unnecessary.
 
75 Percent Subsidy in 1994
 Under the bill, ranchers will receive 75 percent of their expected subsidies for wool and mohair produced in 1994, half for the 1995 crop and none for 1996. During the two-year phase-out, they may qualify for Government loans so they can hold on to their wool and mohair if prices are too low.
Supporters of the subsidy said it was crucial to the survival of many wool and mohair ranchers. But opponents said the payments were a waste of money that often went to the well-off.
"I would prefer to have the taxpayer checks stop flowing sooner," said Senator Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, who had led the Senate campaign against the subsidies along with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. But Mr. Bryan said he was pleased that the program had been killed, saving taxpayers $500 million over the next five years.
The agreement enabled the Senate to give President Clinton an overdue $71 billion spending bill for agricultural programs in the fiscal year 1994, which started Oct. 1.

HEADLINE: Mechanic's Job: Keep Part of New York Culture From Disappearing

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Armed with a welding torch and socket wrench, Raffaele Pepe is staving off the extinction of a cherished piece of New York culture: the lovable, lumbering Checker cab.
There are only 10 Checkers still on the road in New York City -- out of more than 11,000 yellow taxis -- and Mr. Pepe's auto shop in Astoria, Queens, is their port of call. The cabs now make up a fraction of his business. But having clocked an average of 500,000 miles each on the city's pockmarked streets, they are his biggest challenge. 
 Like a lifelong family doctor, Mr. Pepe, wearing a grease-splotched blue bandana over his head, knows which cabs had engine transplants, which struggle with rusting rears and which are due for a tuneup.
 
'He's the Checker Czar'
 While there are other mechanics in the area who occasionally service Checkers, Mr. Pepe is generally acknowledged to be the ultimate authority. "He's the Checker czar," said Bernard M. Higgins, publisher of Taxi Talk, a trade newspaper.
Donald E. McKinley, president of the 900-member Checker Car Club of America, said of Mr. Pepe: "He's the last of the old Checker craftsmen. On the East Coast, he's the man. He's it."
Spotting a Checker, which looks something like an overstuffed holiday bird, makes the heart of many city-dwellers beat faster. It conjures up images of a bygone New York, where Pennsylvania Station outshone Grand Central, where couples met under the clock at the Biltmore Hotel and the El rumbled above Third Avenue.
Riding in a Checker can be the day's highlight. With an ocean of leg room, two jaunty jump seats and a back seat that thrusts passengers high above the road, the rotund cab feels more like an airship than a car. It has appeared in frothy movies ("Breakfast at Tiffany's") and sinister ones ("Taxi Driver"). And so identified is the Checker with New York City that even characters in films set in the present have no trouble hailing one, as in the Manhattan scene at the climax of "Sleepless in Seattle."
But for the 56-year-old Mr. Pepe, Checker cabs have meant something different. They established him with a steady income when he came to New York in 1965 from the Italian town of Nusco, outside Naples. They secured him a home in Bayside, Queens, put four children through college and afforded him a country getaway in the form of a mobile home in Germantown, N.Y.
That is not to say he does not appreciate the Checker's singular attributes. "It's like stepping in a house," he said in an Italian accent as viscous as the motor oil that flows in his garage.
 
Makes Some of His Own Parts
 Upon arriving in America, he worked for a service center in Long Island City owned by the Checker Motors Company of Kalamazoo, Mich. The company churned out Checker cabs -- as well as an even larger, "civilian" model called the Marathon -- from the early 1920's until 1982. Production peaked in the 1960's but sagged in the early 1980's, forcing Checker Motors to stop making cars and to start making major assembly parts for Chrysler and General Motors.
In 1976, Mr. Pepe struck out on his own, opening Mira Auto Body Shop. "It was beautiful," he said wistfully. He had eight mechanics under him and serviced hundreds of Checkers. In the 1970's, when there were as many as 5,000 Checkers on New York City roads, Checkers accounted for 80 percent of Mr. Pepe's workload. Today, they account for less than 10 percent, and so he has reached out to the Checkers' sleeker descendants. Hurt by the recent recession, his operation has shrunk, down to three employees.
But on a recent day, Mr. Pepe's shop bustled. His son, Lou, a 25-year-old graduate of St. John's University who is not yet ready to "work behind a desk," drained a transmission contaminated by water. "It should look like rich red wine," his father said. "This looks like a strawberry shake." (Mr. Pepe should know since he makes his own red wine, some of which was used to wash down lunch.)
Toward the back of the garage, dismembered Checkers were stacked according to body part: curvaceous chrome bumpers, Kelly-green and yellow fenders, serpentine grills and a jumble of steering wheels, hoses and belts. Some parts are hard to come by, and Mr. Pepe has no choice but to make them himself.
Even though there are only 10 Checker cabs left on the road in New York, Mr. Pepe will sometimes see most of them in a single week. One recent week was typical.
 
International Reputation
 On a recent Saturday, Fritzgerald Cajuste brought in his 1981 Checker (800,000 miles) to have a spark plug replaced. Victor Acuna came by on Tuesday with a smashed rear after he and his 1980 Checker (715,000 miles) were sandwiched in a multi-car accident. Russell Neville and Earl Johnson both stopped by on Wednesday with their Checker cabs (500,000 miles each) to get a new power steering box and a new brake line, respectively. And on Thursday, Lou Di Maria pulled in with his 1980 Checker (752,000 miles) to have the oil changed and brakes checked.
"They've kept my car running for 13 years," said Mr. Di Maria, 59, who said he was retiring with his cab to South Carolina in two months. "Pepe makes it work, one way or the other."
Mr. Pepe's reputation extends internationally. A few years ago, a woman drove her Checker from Ontario, Canada, to his shop for a restoration, which included a hot-pink paint job. Recently, a man came from Jamaica -- the island, not the neighborhood -- in search of Checker parts.
Mr. Pepe's son, Lou, owns a Checker cab that is so souped up it rarely comes out from under its canvas cover in Mr. Pepe's shop. The car is painted a candied-apple red and boasts a 350-horsepower engine, four-barreled carburetor, sunroof, red leather seats, tinted windows, basket-spoked rims and, in place of a muffler, chrome side pipes. "Everyone thinks I'm crazy," Lou Pepe said, explaining that his peers lean toward the svelter Camaros and Corvettes.
Checker cabs should grace the streets of New York City for at least a few more years. Most likely, their disappearance will be due to their drivers' retirements, not their own deterioration. For a current owner, there is no age limit on a taxi as long it passes inspection every four months. "But if it's a new owner, the car can't be more than 24 months old," said Susan D. Feinstein, a spokeswoman for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.
Neither Lou Pepe nor his father seem too sentimental about the Checker cab's fate, however. Lou Pepe says he would sell his Checker tomorrow if the price were right. "What are you going to do?" asked his father. "They're a memory. Maybe it's better that way."

HEADLINE: Shoplifting Arrest Leads to Discovery of Children Locked in Attic, Police Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, N.J., Oct. 16

 BODY:
The two children a 15-year-old girl and her 11-year-old brother -- were caught in a local supermarket last Friday night stuffing bagels, bologna, crackers and candy into book bags and taken, terrified, to the Police Department on shoplifting charges.
"They were frantic, not so much that they were caught shoplifting but that I was going to return them home," Detective Frank C. Jones recalled today. "They were completely hysterical."
Under gentle questioning over the next hour or so, the two children told Detective Jones a story of living for months in isolation with two other children -- like them, in foster care -- in a cramped and often locked attic room with no furniture, no lights, no heat and little food. They pried open the bolt lock last Friday with a coat hanger and went out on their food foray because they were hungry, Detective Jones said. At the time, the couple raising them had gone out for a seafood dinner at a fast-food restaurant in Paramus, the detective said.
"The girl told us more or less they had to go out and steal to get an adequate amount of food," he said.
 
Two Others in Attic
 After the questioning, Detective Jones said he went to the two-story gray house on Howland Avenue and found a 16-year-old girl sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the pitch-black attic room and a 10-year-old boy in diapers asleep on the floor.
Several hours later, the couple, Anthony James, 36, and his wife, Shirley, 39, were arrested on charges of endangering the welfare of the four children. Subsequently they were released on $10,000 bail each after a hearing in State Superior Court. The four children have been placed in the care of New Jersey's Division of Youth and Family Services. They were examined at Englewood Hospital and not found to be suffering from any serious physical ailments, Detective Jones said.
The other two children in the house, a foster daughter, 12, and the Jameses' son, 8, had their own bedrooms, the detective said.
The Englewood Police Department's Youth Bureau has been trying to trace the four children's lives as foster children and learn why the Jameses had them stay in the attic.
 
Not Attending School
 He also said the four children had not attended school for months.
"They were imprisoned, more or less, in the attic," Detective Jones said today. They were allowed out for meals, which consisted of warm cereal in the morning, no lunch, and peanut butter sandwiches, with water, for dinner, he said. The youngsters told the detectives that they had to eat the food in the basement, not upstairs with the others. The two boys also said Mr. James hit them with belts and wires whenever they were caught taking food from the family refrigerator, the detective said.
Whenever the four had to go to the toilet, they had to knock on the locked door of the attic room to be released, the detective said. They were required to use the bathroom in the basement, not the one in the regular living quarters.
"They were more or less rationed out toilet tissue," the detective said.
For the most part, he said, the two boys were allowed out of the attic, aside from meals and toilet trips, only when the Jameses' 8-year-old son wanted to play with them outdoors.
No one answered the door today at the James house. They have no telephone listing.
 
Link to New York State
 A neighbor on Howland Avenue who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the couple, like many on the quiet residential street, kept to themselves. Occasionally, he said, he saw several children in the yard, cleaning it or sharing in barbecues. He said he believed Mrs. James was a Jehovah's Witness and took the children to worship on Sundays at the kingdom hall on Palisades Avenue, about a five-minute walk from their house. Officials at the kingdom hall said today that they knew the Jameses and were aware of the charges against them. But they declined to comment further.
Authorities said they believed the five foster children had been placed with the couple by social services officials in New York and that the Jameses received monthly subsidies of $500 for each, or a total annual stipend of $30,000. Detective Jones said Mr. James was unemployed.
Authorities, he said, were also investigating whether the couple had formally adopted the five children, possibly in New Jersey.
The Bergen County Prosecutor, John J. Fahy, said his staff was trying to learn why New York agencies paid the monthly maintenance stipends for the five children, but apparently did not monitor their living conditions.

HEADLINE: Seeking Help and Enthusiasm in His Home Base, Dinkins Returns to Black Churches

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins has gone home to the black churches in this campaign, wooing the pastors and congregants who have sometimes felt taken for granted by the man they helped elect as New York City's first black Mayor.
In folksy stump speeches and closed-door meetings with hundreds of ministers, Mr. Dinkins is working to convince black churchgoers that he has delivered for them on issues varying from health care to housing to the prevention of police brutality, and they are responding warmly. 
 "It's like you hear from a source that your girlfriend is moving away from you," explained Bill Lynch, the Mayor's campaign manager, "so you buy some flowers and get home earlier."
The enthusiasm of black churches, traditionally rich lodes of Democratic voters, is indispensible to the Mayor in a contest that is still too close to call. In 1989, Mr. Dinkins received about 500,000 black votes, more than half his total tally, and was separated from his opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, by fewer than 50,000 votes.
 
Taking for Granted
 Polls suggest that Mr. Dinkins has lost ground with white voters this year; he may be able to make up some of it with increased black support. But to get that support, he must overcome a perception among some black voters that he has taken their support for granted and failed to sufficiently deliver jobs and services to their neighborhoods.
The wooing of church leaders and their members is part of that push. The ministers are being counted on for a major 'get out the vote' push on Election Day, Nov. 2. In recent weeks, they have begun talking more frequently to their own congregations about the importance of this election, as well as giving Mr. Dinkins a platform to address their members without the filter of the news media, much as President Clinton uses 'town hall' meetings to bypass interviewers.
The normally staid, speech-reading Mayor has thrown away his notes and seems to be having a grand old time. He alternates funny stories about his childhood days with zestful digs at Mr. Giuliani, his Republican-Liberal opponent, and descriptions of how his programs have helped black communities.
At the Thessalonia Baptist Church in the Bronx, the Mayor took to the pulpit to speak to about 200 members of the women's auxiliary of the United Missionary Baptist Association. Afterwards, some of the women, dressed in white suits of satin and silk and white hats of all kinds -- pillboxes, berets, fedoras and derbies -- asked for his autograph and posed for snapshots with him.
 
Parable About Meaning
 When Mr. Dinkins told them that the city had opened primary health care centers in impoverished neighborhoods, he said indignantly, "For many people, the emergency room is the family doctor." The women chorused back: "Yes. That's right. Uh-huh."
He also told them a story that could be a parable for his own difficulties with the black churches. As a boy, he said, he and the other children had to memorize a Biblical quote for Sunday school. Parents, worried their children would forget the words, coached them to say, "Jesus wept."
"One Sunday morning a child got up and said, 'Christ cried,' " the Mayor said, as pews full of church women hooted with laughter. "But everyone knew what he meant."
Some ministers say their congregations have not always known what the Mayor meant. He should have spent more time in the churches, tending his home base and explaining actions of his administration, they said.
 
Waiting at Abyssinian
 The Rev. Calvin O. Butts, pastor of the 5,000-member Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said the Mayor had stopped by a couple of times, but not for his Sunday services.
"I've offered him the opportunity to come to Abyssinian anytime except Easter and maybe Christmas," Mr. Butts said. "If he walked through the door at 11:15 A.M., I would give him the sermon. But he never came. He's been at St. John the Divine and synagogues and I'm saying, 'Gee whiz, maybe he'll take advantage of it closer to election time.' "
Nonetheless, Mr. Butts said he mentioned the Mayor's accomplishments every Sunday in his sermon. The minister said he believed that the Mayor was now "coming closer to his base." And indeed, Mr. Dinkins is scheduled to appear for Sunday services at Abyssinian on Oct. 24, nine days before the election.
Mr. Dinkins says he has not been ignoring the churches; he's just been busy.
"It's a big city with a lot of problems and constituencies," he said. "My experience is that if you go to a church at 110th Street, some will say you didn't get to 116th Street, and if you go to 116th Street they'll say you weren't at 125th Street."
 
Black Church Is Focal Point
 No one argues the importance of the constituency, however. The black church often has served as a focal point for communities confronted with racial discrimination and economic deprivation, and many black ministers wear several hats, not just as preachers, but also as social workers, neighborhood organizers and political advocates.
The campaign's clergy coordinator, Malcolm Smith, is quick to point out the help the Dinkins administration has given to community development groups formed from black churches to obtain government money for low-income housing and other social programs. He ticked off half a dozen such groups, including a corsortium of churches in Harlem that is involved in a huge effort to redevelop 40 blocks of Bradhurst Avenue.
"The Mayor has actually delivered something for the churches," said Phillip Thompson, an assistant professor of political science at Barnard College, who served as a housing official in the Dinkins administration.
That record has helped Mr. Dinkins attract the support of about 800 black ministers whose churches have over 500,000 members and who will be involved in what the campaign hopes is a big effort on Election Day, Mr. Smith said. The churches will try to muster thousands of volunteers to knock on doors, run phone banks and drive hundreds of church vans loaded with voters to the polls.
 
'Most Disciplined People'
 Mr. Dinkins knows how crucial the success of the churches' efforts is to his own. "The political clubs are not as strong as they once were in terms of bodies," he said recently. "The most disciplined people are trade unions and churches. They turn out in huge numbers."
And black turnout could be the difference between victory and defeat for Mr. Dinkins. "Where the polls are roughly tied, turnout is everything," Mr. Thompson said. "He could more than make up the slippage among white and Latino voters if black turnout is 70 percent. The black vote has room to grow and no one seems to be talking about that."
Political analysts and church leaders say the closeness of the race could spur black turnout, so the Dinkins campaign is trying to head off any signs of overconfidence. At a recent morning pep rally of 250 to 300 ministers, organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition, the campaign distributed copies of a newspaper article that said the Mayor's support from black voters had eroded and could dampen turnout. It was a warning against apathy.
Ministers say that the increasingly rancorous, racially polarized tone of the election is also energizing black voters. So is the sense that the Mayor, after a long summer of harsh media coverage, is under siege and must be defended.
 
Anger About the Media
 "There's a backlash," said Rev. Timothy Mitchell, pastor of the 500-member Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing, Queens. "The quiet, docile, nice, so-called older saints of the church -- the female leadership -- are calling us about what the media and Giuliani have done to Mayor Dinkins."
More than a dozen ministers also said in interviews that there was a growing realization among black people that whatever the Mayor's faults, they did not want Mr. Giuliani to win.
Over and over, ministers pointed to Mr. Giuliani's speech last year to rowdy off-duty police officers at a rally of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association that turned violent. They said it showed Mr. Giuliani's disrespect for Mr. Dinkins and highlighted his own prosecutorial, 'lock em up' approach. The officers were protesting the Mayor's proposal to create a civilian board to review complaints of police brutality -- an issue of special impact in black communities that have historically had strained relations with the police.
"Giuliani's campaign is a threat to the peace and tranquillity of this community," said Wyatt Tee Walker, pastor of the 2,300-member Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem.
 
Awakening a Giant
 The Giuliani campaign's television advertisements attacking the Rev. William A. Jones for associating the word fascism with Mr. Giuliani have also stirred anger.
"If I was the Giuliani campaign, I wouldn't be attacking Bill Jones," said Mr. Thompson, the Barnard professor. "They're not attacking one man; they're attacking a network, a tradition, an organized political base if it wants to be. Why awaken a giant?"
Mr. Jones, pastor of the 1,800-member Bethany Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, is a prominent religious leader revered by many other ministers for his lifelong battle against discrimination. They say Mr. Giuliani has intentionally misinterpreted Mr. Jones's remarks as an anti-Italian slur for political gain. Some do not mute their anger.
"He is in search of a black leader to attack so he can prove to the white community he is their hero -- the great white hope," said the Rev. Preston Washington, pastor of Memorial Baptist Church in Harlem, which has 350 members, and president of Harlem Churches for Community Improvement. "Dr. Jones meant exactly what he said."
 
Pastor's Special Status
 Mr. Dinkins's own ginger handling of Mr. Jones's remarks illustrated his own appreciation for the preacher's status. Mr. Jones's charge that "fascist elements" were flowering around Mr. Giuliani came as he stood beside Mr. Dinkins after a private meeting with 60 ministers. Mr. Dinkins, with no inflection in his voice, simply stated that Mr. Jones's choice of words was not his own. Later, he vigorously disavowed the remarks, but turned aside Mr. Giuliani's suggestion that the Mayor should have refused the support of Mr. Jones and the other pastors he spoke for that day.
"Those clergymen represent thousands of people who support my candidacy," the Mayor said several days after the incident. "Of course, he wishes I would disavow them."
Mr. Jones said of the Mayor: "He's not crazy. He doesn't want to alienate me because that would alienate a whole lot of people whom he really needs."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Is Bellwether To Politicians Across U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
He may fret about the daily developments in Port-au-Prince and Mogadishu, but President Clinton is also keeping a watchful eye on this capital city. "Usually, when I see the President the first thing he says is, 'How's my friend Jim doing?' " said Paul Begala, a White House adviser who is also a strategist for Gov. Jim Florio's re-election campaign in New Jersey.
Although Mr. Begala may have overstated the President's immersion in New Jersey politics, the outcome of the contest between Mr. Florio and Christine Todd Whitman, his Republican challenger, is being watched intently by Republican and Democratic politicians nationally. They are hoping to find signs of the viability of President Clinton's programs, as well as implications for statewide campaigns in 1994 and for Mr. Clinton himself in 1996. 
 While it is in part by default that the New Jersey race is drawing a disproportionate share of attention -- Virginia is the only other state with a gubernatorial election -- it is no accident that Mr. Clinton is so interested in what happens to Mr. Florio or that the national parties are pouring resources into the state.
The President's political position mirrors Mr. Florio's in important ways, the most obvious being the Governor's decision to ram a $2.8 billion tax increase through the State Legislature early in his term after promising in his campaign that there was no need to raise taxes. Likewise, after campaigning on a pledge of middle-class tax relief, Mr. Clinton drove a tax increase through Congress this summer as part of a deficit-reduction package.
 
Tax-and-Mend Politics
 Even as the political parties seek to spin the outcome to their own advantage, a legitimate case can be made that the New Jersey contest will not turn on Mr. Clinton, but on a simpler idea, like which candidate runs the better campaign. Some Republicans are already saying that missteps by the Whitman organization, not any national trends, may cost her the election.
No matter who wins in two weeks, the race has already produced an important political lesson that could be called tax-and-mend: Raising taxes and cutting services may, but does not always, mean political suicide. Polls taken in New Jersey show that the initial furor over Mr. Florio's tax increase has softened.
"I believe, all across the country, from the city council to the state house to the White House, people are looking at this race," Mr. Begala said. "If Florio wins, it says you can be tough and strong and decisive and still win. And if we lose, the do-nothing crowd will have won a victory."
From the rival camp, Edward J. Rollins, Mrs. Whitman's chief strategist, also sees national implications: as a test of the Republican Party's devotion to supply-side economics and, more specifically, his own candidate's proposal to cut the income taxes of most New Jersey residents by 30 percent. The race may also demonstrate whether, in this time of economic uncertainty, voters trust politicians who promise to cut taxes.
 
An Economic Battle
 "If Christie laying out her tax-cut economic plan can win, I think it will give courage to a lot of other people to try, particularly if she succeeds in implementing the policy and it brings the economy back," Mr. Rollins said. "Equally as important, if Florio comes back, it will encourage others who want to raise taxes that you can do it and make the tough decisions, perceived tough decisions, and fight your way back. And the lesson will be: go in early and raise taxes early."
Don Foley, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said that among his crop of candidates next year he had already detected "a newfound boldness that allows political leaders to do or say what they think is right."
He said, for example, that Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia, who faces tough competition next year, was traveling Virginia praising Mr. Clinton. It is an obvious contrast to Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate for Virginia governor, who has criticized the President and who has found herself in a tight race.
Though he has never wavered from his support for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Florio has been careful not to link his fortunes too closely to him either. And he resists the notion that a vote for or against him is a vote for or against Mr. Clinton. "I don't know if it's a national test, what the national significance is," he said in an interview. "I know I take the responsibility for the hard decisions that I make and have made in the past."
 
Like a Conservative
 A victory by Mr. Florio might also encourage other Democrats to follow his lead of running almost like a conservative by promoting such issues as fighting crime and getting tough on welfare cheats.
As Republican Governors like John Engler of Michigan and William F. Weld of Massachusetts have endorsed major tax cuts in their states, Mrs. Whitman has found herself in the difficult position of distancing herself from their contentious proposals while still insisting that cuts are a viable way to bolster the economy.
"I am not going to become a walking, talking Bill Weld," Mrs. Whitman said at a news conference here the other day, "or a walking, talking John Engler."
Politics, of course, is rooted in perceptions. So most politicians will only ascribe national import to a statewide race when it looks as if they will win.
So three months ago, when Republicans were so confident that they were practically picking their jobs in a Whitman cabinet, Haley Barbour, the national Republican Party chairman, pronounced the race a test of Mr. Clinton and the Democrats. "New Jersey is the prototype state for us," he said.
 
Reading Too Much In
 Now that Mr. Florio is showing more resilience than many political analysts expected, Mr. Barbour has tempered his spin, saying that "governors' races principally are decided by the candidates and the state issues."
Mindful of recent polls, perhaps, John Sears, a Republican political consultant in Washington, also warned against reading too much into the race, saying that voters were not embracing Mr. Florio but repudiating Mrs. Whitman. "I don't think his survival has any great national implications," he said. "She just didn't run a very good race, and she's going to lose."
But while the state has the demographics of a mini-America, the infighting that has plagued Mrs. Whitman's campaign cannot be viewed only through a New Jersey eye. Her difficulties may be a sign of what lies ahead as the Republicans seek to find the best response to the Democratic policies.
In a strategy that may be mimicked if Mr. Florio is re-elected, James Carville, an adviser both to Mr. Clinton and to Mr. Florio, said it was his idea to question not simply Mrs. Whitman's tax-cut pledge, but the credibility of the pledge itself.
 
'Doesn't Even Add Up'
 Mr. Carville said he contemplated two options for television advertisements attacking the Whitman tax cut: "You could have firemen say, 'They're going to cut fire'; you could have homeowners say, 'It's going to raise property taxes'; you could have schoolteachers say, 'It's going to devastate schools.' Or you could say, 'She's got no intention of doing this anyway; her plan doesn't even add up.' "

New Rimes For Mariners Not So Ancient

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
OUTSIDE on the water, the city shoreline was a stretch of updated Whitman: bridges and skyscrapers soaring hither and yon, jetliners and ferries coursing past fiery glints of trees that glowed autumnally in the ragged marshes of Queens to the south and the busy parks of Co-op City to the west. Inside the yacht club, Buddy Rice, a retired city firefighter, was having an early beer at the bar and chastising someone who asked him about sailing all his life out of City Island.
"That's a bad word, sailing," Mr. Rice said, friendly in the special way of City Islanders, with an outerborough tinniness of tone and a heartiness worthy of New England. 
 "Me, I like boating the way I like my car," he said, blessing the internal combustion engine as an improvement over canvas. "Boom! goes the ignition, and away I drive around the water."
It's hard to argue with any urban mariner, a breed apart who find an extra dimension in the waters that most New Yorkers ignore. City boaters can snooze nights at their moorings with one ear left open for the same sort of thieving predator who busts wing windows of cars parked overnight on city streets.
"Yeah, there's been a lot more breaking into boats lately," said Charlie Carman, a retired city police officer whose family roots on City Island go all the way back to the 17th century. "But the island stays pretty good. A woman can go out at night, and some people still leave their doors unlocked."
Mr. Carman is at the wheel of the service tender of the Morris Yacht and Beach Club, a seven-acre piece of the city with some history -- Diamond Jim Brady supposedly used its Victorian frame house as a romantic hideaway from Gotham's hectic heart. The membership has a base of officers, firefighters, sanitation workers, telephone workers and other blue-collar guys. Some do competitive sailing out on Long Island Sound on Wednesday evenings, replete with Topsider shoes and other paraphernalia.
Others sit with Buddy Rice, enjoying the camaraderie of the bar, or watch down on the lawn that offers a splendid view of the city, or work on their boats themselves. They help one another with the sanding and patching in a group effort required by the rules to maintain the tradition of a "working club," not heavy with rich members who can hire outside specialists.
The commodore, the club leader chosen by the members, is Jack Mahony, a mechanic with city sanitation, and the big problem is dwindling membership. It is down to 200 members from the normal 350 now that dues are up to $1,000 a year, five times what they used to be. This is because tax rates on the island began soaring in a reassessment sparked by some condominium construction elsewhere on the island, back before the recession hit. The club's taxes are up tenfold to $200,000 a year.
"The city is taxing the club into oblivion," said Wolfgang Ott, working on a beautiful, strange sailboat he built with a curved cement hull. "I'm a truck driver and love this, but I sacrifice for it," he said, gesturing about the boat yard. "We'll belly up eventually."
With the mayoral race narrowing and only a point or two between the candidates, who knows, maybe even urban sailors could become a focus group for the campaign strategists and taxes could return as a big issue. Older members recall when taxes were a hot issue, before race and crime took over the frenzied agenda.
"This is a very American place -- friction and joy together, if you know what I mean," said Ben Fernandez, a club member for 15 years who got his first taste of sailing as a Boy Scout from East Harlem. "On the water, you get a special view of the city and enjoy a different group of people," he said, sitting on the deck of his 30-foot sloop, Ben Siiri, up among autumn foliage at the back of the club's storage yard.
Mr. Fernandez was the club's first Puerto Rican commodore, but more mark him as the "committee commodore," a busy 57-year-old executive always prodding members to get more involved. He is a professional photographer and teacher known for his years of documenting the American protest movement and he is returning now from a Fulbright, looking to get his boat back into New York waters.
"We need boaters, new members," Mr. Fernandez said, staring at the urban seascape drenched in sun and taxes. "Club meetings can be chaotic but they are the essence of what freedom is about," he said appreciatively, envisioning more minority-group yachtsmen coming aboard, the club changing with the city.
He brought a Hispanic friend around for membership the other day. "It went well," Mr. Fernandez said. "One member told me, 'We old-timers have to change with the times if the club is going to make it.' I hope so," said the urban sailor, "because there's nothing so nice as to be on the mooring overnight, the city out there with the water rippling and wind blowing."

HEADLINE: Call That a 'Good' Job, Do You?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I laughed out loud after calculating the annual before-tax income of the holders of the so-called good jobs as described in " 'Good' Jobs in Hard Times" (Oct. 3). 
 A discount retail-store employee making $8 an hour, 35 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, plus a 6 percent profit share, makes $15,435 a year. (I would include an estimated value of the benefits described in the article, but you can't buy food with a health care plan.)
If your reporter had to support his family on $15,435 a year, would he consider himself lucky to have a "good" job? The reality is exploitation of desperate American workers by corporate America. These jobs may be better than nothing, but not by much.

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Campaign -- At Issue: Fiscal Crisis;
Needed: Honesty on the Budget

 BODY:
Crushing budget deficits await the winner of New York City's mayoral election, because city spending will continue to grow faster than revenue until someone makes painful cutbacks -- or pushes through painful tax increases. The budget this year is $31 billion. Projected deficits in the next few years rise to $2 billion a year, not counting new or expanded programs. Band-Aids won't do.
Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani, his principal challenger, share an aversion to talking about cuts, so much so that neither says much about the need for radical surgery. The Mayor stands on his record -- four balanced budgets in four difficult recession years. Mr. Giuliani stands on a wishful platform of spending cuts and tax cuts. 
 Mayor Dinkins's budget record has less merit than he claims. Yes, it has been a difficult time to balance budgets. Adding to the city's constantly swelling needs, the recession has increased welfare caseloads and other costs of caring for the poor, while Republican Administrations in Washington have stinted on Federal aid.
How Mr. Dinkins will work out the current year remains to be seen. Both the spending and revenue numbers appear to be worse than he projected; he or his successor will have to make fixes before the fiscal year is out, because the books must balance. The State Constitution says so. And state law says if there's a deficit of more than $100 million, city officials must cede budget authority -- the heart of their power -- to the state's Financial Control Board.
The Dinkins administration has gotten by with a combination of spending cuts, a modest reduction in the city work force, tax increases and various one-time gimmicks, while still adding police and schoolteachers. But it did not score essential long-term gains. Most significantly, the Mayor failed to win concessions for greater productivity from city workers who benefit from antiquated work rules.
Last spring Mr. Dinkins commissioned a panel of three budget experts to tell him what must be done. But he gave them until Dec. 1 to report, thus postponing the bad news past Election Day. That was not fair to voters.
Actually, Mr. Dinkins has already proposed some sensible long-term measures -- in his budget messages. He just hasn't gotten them off the page and into practice. Some will doubtless reappear as recommendations from the panel.
One lively prospect for added revenue -- a perennial -- is tolls on the free bridges that link Manhattan with Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Another is garbage and trash collection fees. Still other ideas would make the police more productive by staffing patrol cars with one officer instead of two in low crime areas and using more civilians for desk work.
These ideas aren't new. Are they more likely to be adopted now than before? Only if the person at the mayor's desk can persuade the objectors who block them that it's time to get serious.
One problem for any mayor is Albany's authority over what he wants to do. Mr. Dinkins wants the state to take over the city's $2 billion share of annual Medicaid costs, as most states do. So does Mr. Giuliani, and Gov. Mario Cuomo has proposed it to the Legislature. There it sits, because suburban and upstate legislators don't want to pay for New York City's poor.
Similarly, despite years of pleading by Mr. Dinkins and others before him, the Legislature refuses to adopt an equitable school aid formula; the current formula favors suburban school systems at the expense of their central cities.
For better or worse, Mr. Giuliani has no record as mayor -- or, for that matter, as an administrator. Thus untested, he can promise pie in the sky a la mode, and no one can prove he can't deliver.
His pledge to cut $2 billion of city taxes is in that category. He would like to phase out the commercial rent tax, the unincorporated business tax and the surtaxes on personal income, and reduce the hotel occupancy tax.
Who wouldn't?
But with annual $2 billion deficits already in store, his tax proposals would require unthinkable slash-and-burn spending cuts. These would be difficult anytime, because most city outlays are mandated by Albany or Washington, and more difficult now because some cuttable programs have already been reduced by the Dinkins administration.
City services must be improved, not curtailed. The streets are unsafe; bridges need repair; schools need better teachers and smaller classes. Even so Mr. Giuliani wants less spending. His promises ring hollow. He doesn't say how he'd clear away bureaucratic roadblocks, union contracts or Albany's opposition.
Mr. Giuliani says he would eliminate 35,000 city jobs in six years. The payroll is now 211,000. It would be reduced by 15 percent, back to where it was in the early 1980's when go-go spending was just beginning. He doesn't say where he would cut, though -- only that he'd try to spare programs that have already taken heavy hits. More realistically, Mr. Dinkins anticipates trimming 8,000 jobs in the next three years, in addition to 15,000 he has cut so far. Both men say they will rely on attrition, which is no guarantee of anything.
Mr. Giuliani also says he can get savings that Mayor Dinkins has been unable to get from increased productivity of city employees. But how much better he would do against strong unions that can paralyze the city with strikes or slowdowns is problematic.
Mr. Giuliani talks about more privatization, too -- turning more city functions, even hospitals, over to private contractors. Within limits, that can make sense, but responsive service to the public must be paramount. Mr. Giuliani would also shut down some city agencies whose functions duplicate state agencies, such as consumer affairs, mental health and human rights. That's a good idea, but hard to get past entrenched bureaucrats, and not a big saver.
Both mayoral candidates owe New York's voters fuller explanation of how they would pack all their promises into the city's diminished resources. If they ever hold the debate they are so strenuously ducking, that would be a good first topic.

An Appeal To Shoppers Is Rewarded

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Adriana's Bazaar, an international cooking store on Broadway between 75th and 76th Streets, has been struggling to survive ever since Rochelle Zabarkes opened it two and a half years ago.
The store, big and airy behind a high teal awning, sells condiments, pottery and spices from around the world, like lemon grass, curries and dried peppers. 
 But the recession stacked the decks against the store, a 1,200-square-foot space in an expensive area.
Ten days ago Adriana's filed for Chapter 11 protection. Ms. Zabarkes still owes several months' rent to the landlord as well as money to other creditors.
But the fight goes on, in the form of a large black-and-gold sign in the window that reads: "Dear Neighbors, if you love us and want us to stay, BUY SOMETHING NOW. (We need an angel or 40,000 little angels.)" And the angels have appeared.
"If we lose our neighborhood stores, we have no neighborhood," said Lisa Picolini, a frequent customer, as she entered the store recently.
Sales have doubled since the sign went up two weeks ago, Ms. Zabarkes said.
"Even without the financial support," she said, "just knowing the neighborhood really cared about us was enough incentive to keep going." E.M.B.

From Medical Supplies To Hollywood Films
 
How does the owner of a medical supply company in Bensonhurst get involved in the movie business? For Julius Nasso, it began when he landed a job translating Italian for the making of the film "Once Upon a Time in America" in his neighborhood. That led him to think about entering the movie business, and when he was visiting Japan, he arranged to meet Steven Seagal, a distant relative. That led the businessman and the actor to form a company, Seagal-Nasso Productions. 
 The new company shares an office building with Mr. Nasso's other business, Universal Marine Medical Supply. Seagal-Nasso has a deal with Warner Brothers to produce five movies.

Bringing Much-Needed Sand to a Storm-Battered Beach

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

 BODY:
Over the last year, erosion worsened by storms has devastated much of the Rockaways shoreline. But with the Army Corps of Engineers expected to approve a $46 million, 10-year restoration plan, repairs may begin early next year.
"It's really a question of the sooner the better," said Joseph Vietri, a planner in the Army Corps of Engineers district office in Manhattan. "We have about 50,000 people living on an island that has been decimated by a series of storms over the last few years, and this project will in essence give the people a measure of protection against the effect of storm damages." 
 The project calls for the replenishment of a 6.2-mile shoreline between Beach 19th and Beach 149th Streets on the Rockaway Peninsula.
About 6.4 million cubic yards of sand would be pumped onto the beach, and additional sand will be laid twice in the next 10 years.
The New York office of the Corps of Engineers recommended the plan after the Corps' 1994 budget had been submitted to Congress, so Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat whose district includes the Rockaways, persuaded a House subcommittee to add $3.2 million to the budget so the work could begin early next summer.
"The beaches are the lifeblood of the Rockaways," Mr. Schumer said. "If they go, so does the economic viability of the whole peninsula, and that's why it's so important to get the Federal Government doing everything they can to fix the beaches."
The Government will pay 65 percent -- $30 million -- of the cost, and the state and city are to split the rest. The work can begin as soon as the State Legislature appropriates the state's share.
"We are in a low-lying area," said Jonathan L. Gaska, district manager of Community Board 14 in Queens. "The beaches are the only thing that's stopping the water." GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

City Planners Take New Tack On Giant Project: Think Small

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
It stretches for nearly two miles along the oceanfront, block after block of weed-filled, trash-strewn lots, occasionally interrupted by a cluster of buildings. It is the Arverne urban-renewal area in the Rockaways, for a quarter-century the site of a repeatedly thwarted effort to build a "new town" of homes, parks and shopping centers.
The Arverne project suffered its latest blow two years ago when the developer of the most recent plan for the site, Oceanview Associates of Manhattan, pulled out, citing a poor economy in which to market the kind of vast development it was contemplating: a $1.5 billion complex of 7,500 apartments priced to sell or rent to families with annual incomes of $45,000 to $80,000. Stores, movie theaters and a refurbished boardwalk and beach were also part of the package. 
 Previous obstacles to construction on the site had included the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, sharp cutbacks in Federal housing subsidies and local opposition to various schemes.
The result was that although nearly 4,000 deteriorated buildings were demolished in the late 1960's, very little of the envisioned new housing was built to replace them, and the area became one of America's most notorious examples of redevelopment gone nowhere.
But the Dinkins administration insists that the Arverne project is not a nightmare of failure but a dream deferred.
"The project is still alive," Valerie Jo Bradley, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said last week.
"We're working on a phasing plan," she said, referring to what other officials have described as a future "series of discrete, smaller projects by separate developers within the urban-renewal area, rather than proceeding with a single master developer."
Kathleen Dunn, the agency's deputy commissioner for development, said that two companies -- Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut and Vollmer Associates -- have been retained as engineering and planning consultants to help determine such issues as where in the vast renewal tract the first such project should go and how much housing to "put out on the market" as part of that phase.
Ms. Dunn could not say how long it might be before the city could move to the next stage -- requesting yet another round of proposals from potential developers in an area where schemes have come and gone like the nearby tides. JOSEPH P. FRIED

Recreating a Classic Era for a New Generation of Strivers

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
In its heyday, central Harlem drew people from around the world to small, smoky clubs where they could hear the greatest jazz musicians of their day. Now an ambitious development program seeks to recreate that era by bringing new restaurants and clubs to the area around 135th Street.
If the planners win the necessary approvals, the project, called Strivers Center after historic Striver's Row a few blocks north, will mix of middle- and moderate-income housing and upscale businesses, particularly boutiques, and restaurants and jazz clubs. It will stretch from 134th to 136th Street and from Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard to St. Nicholas Avenue, and be financed by public and private loans and city and state grants. 
 Organizers from the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, the project's liaison with the community, the city and the state, said they hoped to make the area a magnet for tourists, as well as for middle-income Harlem residents who, they say, often spend their money downtown.
The first phase, which was finished last month, includes eight five-story brick and stone buildings. Forty-eight units have been filled, and about 12,000 square feet of commercial space is now being completed. The Chamber of Commerce plans to move its office to the block, and there will be a new restaurant, a florist and several social-service-agency offices, said Emmett Causey, the chamber's project director for the center.
Next month, the chamber is to begin construction on $3 million in improvements for 135th Street, including wider sidewalks and new benches and lights. There are plans to add a plaza in St. Nicholas Park behind the subway station at 135th Street, and a new, straight, well-lighted path through the park to link Central Harlem with City College.
The streetscape project will also include a "walk of fame" along the sidewalk of 135th Street, paying tribute to famous residents with tiles made by neighborhood artists.
The second phase of Strivers Center is now in the planning stage. It calls for the renovation of 15 buildings for rental apartments and commercial space, and some major corporations have already begun negotiating for that space, Mr. Causey said. A third phase will offer new condominium apartments.
Strivers Center is financed by a loan from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit coalition of banks and insurance companies. The street improvement money is from the State Economic Development Corporation. E.M.B.

Loan Program Aims at Asians

BYLINE: By VIVIAN LOUIE

 BODY:
A loan program for small businesses on the Lower East Side and in Chinatown has been set up to help Asian owners turn to banks, rather than personal and community resources, for financial needs.
This month, two nonprofit groups, Asian Americans for Equality and Manhattan Neighborhood Renaissance, began administering $175,000 in loans for the State Urban Development Corporation. The loans will benefit minority- and female-owned businesses in lower Manhattan, many run by Asian immigrants. 
 The program is meant to encourage borrowing from banks, according to Christopher Kui, executive director of Asian Americans for Equality and president of Manhattan Neighborhood Renaissance. The fund is intended to provide small-business loans of $15,000 to $20,000.
"The goal of our program is that in 5 to 10 years, the bank takes on these customers," he said.
Mr. Kui, a 33-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong, said that Asian business owners are often reluctant to approach banks because they are used to relying on savings, family loans or borrowing clubs, which pool the resources of dozens of people.
But because those options generally provide only $10,000 to $50,000, they do not help business owners with more costly plans.
The loan program is a continuation of Mr. Kui's efforts to negotiate language barriers and demystify the intricacies of American finance for Asian business owners.
The two groups he runs hold seminars, help owners with business plans and often go with them to banks to get loans.
The population of Chinatown has grown from 41,174 in 1980 to 55,216 in 1990, according to census figures, and many new small businesses have begun, Mr. Kui said. Last year, Mr. Kui was able to help Ellen Chiang get a line of credit after several banks turned her down.
Ms. Chiang and her partner Estrella Chan had started Prestige Care, a Manhattan-based home care service for the Chinese elderly, with a bank loan, money from relatives and from a borrowing club. But they needed more to keep the business going.
Mr. Kui arranged a meeting with officials at Merchants Bank of New York. Its Broadway branch approved a $200,000 line of credit.
"They are doing very well," said Spencer Witty, the chairman. "It was good for the community and good for the bank." VIVIAN LOUIE

At Last, Maybe, a New Beginning

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
City officials have agreed to begin talks with Community Board 4 on the long-stalled development of what is known as the Clinton Urban Renewal Area, a six-block section of tenements west of midtown Manhattan.
Some 2,000 people live or work in buildings on month-to-month leases in this rundown stretch (from 50th to 56th Streets between 10th and 11th Avenues), which was designated for renewal in 1969, nearly a quarter century ago. 
 But economic uncertainties and disagreements between the community and the city over how to develop the area delayed the project virtually from the start.
John Glynn, executive director of the Clinton Preservation Local Development Corporation, a community group, said dozens of buildings were razed and seven apartment buildings constructed with Federal funds. Then the money ran out. Most people moved out of the condemned area, leaving buildings prey to vandals and weather.
In the early 1980's, the Koch administration, seeking to turn Clinton into an area of luxury residential development, offered two blocks on 10th Avenue to developers. The neighborhood group blocked this plan, stopping the demolition of five buildings.
In 1984, the group came up with a rehabilitation plan of its own; it called for retaining most residences and commercial and manufacturing structures and building a set of residential towers in which 80 percent of the units would be designated as low- or moderate-income housing. The goal was to keep small businesses as well as the many artists who make their home in Clinton.
Although the plan was backed by Community Board 4 and won the Urban Design Award of Architectural Digest in 1990, nothing happened. The City Department of Housing Preservation and Development said the proposal was impractical and too costly.
The debate heated up after the demolition last summer of a vacant tenement on 10th Avenue at 52d Street that had been slotted to be restored under the community plan. Residents urged the city to shore up other crumbling buildings until renewal work could start. Then, on Oct. 5, Housing Preservation and Development officials told Community Board 4 that they were willing to consider the board's proposals for Clinton renewal.
"If our space is taken, we can't stay in the city," said Linda Colby, an artist who lives in a threatened building, explaining the need for adoption of the 1984 plan. "Hasn't the city lost enough art?"
Tony Parker, vice president of Brabrook, a flooring manufacturer established in 1927, said: "We won't leave the area. We have an investment to keep the neighborhood intact." MARVINE HOWE

South Street Seaport: Just Another Mall?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
CAPTAIN HOOK'S has a smidgen of everything: a ship in a bottle goes for $9.99. Some wooden ship models fetch in excess of $2,000. A fish scale marketed as a nail file is one way to spend 59 cents. Resembling nothing so much as a dusty, cluttered attic, this old-salt emporium in South Street Seaport is fighting for its life.
Captain Hook's monthly rent has been increased from $2,000 to $19,780.62, and its owner, a lifelong maritime hobbyist turned mall merchant named Joe Hill, is hopping mad, fuming that he can't pay nearly that much. Moreover, he insists that he shouldn't. He is suing the Rouse Company, developer of South Street Seaport Marketplace, claiming that his eviction would violate Rouse's promise to maintain a maritime flavor. 
 "There's a man-eating shark in our midst and the citizenry must be warned," says Mr. Hill. "A shopping mall monster is trying to devour our city's history."
Now, to some people around the seaport, Mr. Hill is at least eccentric. After all, this is a man who habitually wears a pirate hat and a whale tooth around his neck. To others, he is simply going too far. They note that he used to charge customers a quarter just to browse, and they explode at the mere mention of the terms of that $2,000 lease (a relic of his status as an original, indeed the last original, tenant of the market).
Still, if Captain Hook's fails, there will be only two solely maritime shops left at the old seaport. And as the Marketplace turns 10, some admittedly less apocalyptic versions of Mr. Hill's harangue are being heard along the cobblestones of South Street.
Even as it has become one of the city's major tourist attractions, some people are wondering, has Rouse's Marketplace failed in its mission to preserve its original reason for being, the 19th-century character of the city's historic seaport hard by the Brooklyn Bridge? Has it, in short, become just another high-rent shopping mall?
This marriage of seaport and marketplace, history and commerce, was conceived as a way of supporting the South Street Seaport Museum, a museum without walls, set up in 1967, whose holdings range from the four-masted bark Peking to Titanic Memorial Tower on Pearl and Water Streets. The relationship, though, has never really found its way off the rocks.
Part of the problem has been the museum's inability to center itself in a single location. Because of overly optimistic sales projections and the recession, Rouse has never been able to pay more than the minimum required to keep the museum going.
"It didn't work," said Peter Neill, president of the museum. As a result, the institution's exhibits have remained scattered around the seaport, though the city has begun paying some of the museum's expenses and will soon unveil plans to house part of the collection in a 60,000-square-foot space along Schermerhorn Row.
To help maintain the area's character, another strategy was devised: lower rents for original tenants, like Captain Hook's $2,000 a month. But most of them, a half-dozen or so, have gone out of business (Sweets restaurant, established in 1842, closed last December). They have been replaced by upscale newcomers like Country Road Australia, with its stylish wear from Down Under, and Structure, which sells men's sportswear. Last month, Liz Claiborne opened its first New York City store, a sleek two-story space in the seaport, joining other chain stores like Ann Taylor and Coach Leatherware.
Some community advocates and history buffs say that the seaport's character is threatened. They say the shopping-mall ambiance shows a lack of regard for its history and inattention to its cultural potential. "They don't protect the place the way they should," said Anne Compoccia, chairwoman of the local community board. "They're just looking for money." She and other Rouse detractors would have emphasized the museum and antique buildings as the principal attractions.
Others find it an unusual, and sufficiently maritime, attraction. "A mall in New Jersey is the same as a mall in Los Angeles," said Blades Williamson, an investment banker from Wall Street eating lunch recently at the Yankee Clipper, in the seaport historic area. "But a mall where you can see the Statue of Liberty is different."
Joseph E. Ochs, a Rouse vice president and Seaport Marketplace manager, defends Rouse's commitment to maritime promotions and merchandising. "Guess what? His 10 years are up," he said about Captain Hook's lease. Added Glen Wielgus, the marketplace's marketing director: "Our intent is to preserve the integrity and feeling of 19th-century New York. But our audience is very much part of the 20th century."
In many people's minds, the seaport, one of New York's top five attractions, remains a warm-weather tourist destination. But with annual sales exceeding $100 million, it is rivaled as a downtown shopping center only by the World Financial Center. Data that the seaport distributes to prospective tenants is impressive. The average visitor, with a household income of $56,392, spends two hours at the seaport. Downtown workers visit three times a month; city residents visit six times a year.
The scene shifts with the time of day and the day of the week. Wall Street workers congregate at lunchtime, brightly attired day-trippers dominate on weekends, and on Friday nights, the seaport becomes one vast, rambunctious singles bar -- though less so than in previous years.
But like malls everywhere, the seaport has had problems. The original flagship, the blocklong Fulton Market Building, waned after the glitzier Pier 17 opened in 1985. People walk right by on their way to the water; many long-time businesses say they are struggling. "The sales don't warrant us staying there," said Fred Bass, owner of the Strand Book Store. He may close.
But Rouse is actively recruiting. It recently attracted Ferrara Foods from Little Italy, which now sells espresso at the Fulton Market Building. Officials have also talked to movie studios about opening the kind of super entertainment store that Time-Warner will soon open at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street.
Mr. Neill is unenthusiastic. "A Disney-like experience in the South Street Seaport would be a travesty, both culturally and commercially," he said. His distaste for a miniature golf course, a temporary attraction in the Fulton Market Building, is apparent. "That's the level of trivialization that concerns me," he said. "It ain't maritime, is it?"
Meanwhile, Mr. Hill at Captain Hook's lectures customers about his plight and fights to stay on the terms of his original lease. Never mind, he says, that he owns a $2 million house in Sands Point, L.I., and vacations for four months a year in Florida. It is the principle that matters.
"If I go," he says, "the flavor of the Seaport will be completely lost."

HEADLINE: Will U.S. Be Healthier? Maybe Not, Experts Say

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
Suppose President Clinton's health plan is adopted. Suppose every American gets a health insurance card and no one need worry again about being uninsured. Will the nation be healthier?
The answer might seem obvious. After all, 37 million Americans are uninsured. How could the plan do anything but improve the overall health of the country? 
 Oddly, medical and public health experts say that although the system may increase access to health care and although it may be more equitable than the current system, it will not necessarily make Americans healthier, at least by the broad measures generally used to gauge public health.
The problem, health experts say, is that the proposal for overhauling health care is not really a health program. Instead, it is a plan to pay for doctor visits, prescriptions and hospitalizations. It is a plan to insure that no one is bankrupted by medical bills. But sickness and death are often caused by poverty and dangerous habits like smoking, which will not necessarily be affected. Many people who disregard advice to have children vaccinated or to have a Pap smear or exercise or eat less fat or drink less alcohol will not change their ways because they have health insurance.
To be sure, President Clinton has always promoted the plan as what it is: a way to address gross inequities in health care and to get medical costs under control. In his address to the nation on Sept. 23, he said the urgent priority was "giving every American health security, health care that can never be taken away."
 
Benefits for Many People
 And many people are expected to gain enormous benefits. For example, Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said: "Uninsured people now think twice before they go to a doctor for a headache or even a lump in the breast. Every contact is so, so expensive."
And Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and a health economist at Stanford University, said some people who are now uninsured would undoubtedly benefit from the plan. Others said that poor people now receiving spotty care on Medicaid might do better with a family doctor in a health plan.
But "you have to ask how much difference the health care system can make," Dr. Garber said.
Dr. Reinhardt noted that the Clinton plan was a financial security plan. In fact, it is called a health security plan. Instead of promising good health outright, the American Health Security Act promises that all Americans will have health insurance, with access to plans that meet national standards on benefits, quality and access to care.
"That is very important," Dr. Reinhardt added. "But if you want to make them healthy, get them out of poverty."
One problem in trying to decide how the health plan will affect the nation's health is deciding how to measure health. Public health officials often look at two measures, infant mortality and life expectancy. Neither statistic is likely to be altered perceptibly by the Clinton health plan, experts say.
Infant mortality is highest in the inner cities, where pregnant women often suffer from more than lack of health insurance and where they often have Medicaid. They may be teen-agers, they may smoke heavily, or use cocaine or heroin, and they may have a very poor diet.
Dr. Reinhardt noted that in Britain women had prenatal care through the national health service for more than 30 years. Yet, he said, infant mortality among people in the lower social classes is still triple the rate among people in the higher classes.
Dr. Garber said infant mortality was particularly troubling because "it is heavily influenced by factors outside the medical care system."
Nor is longevity likely to change, experts said. Dr. James W. Vaupel, a medical demographer at Duke University and Odenske University Medical School in Denmark, said there was little relationship between a nation's health care delivery system and its average life span. The United States has an average life span of 75 years, a figure comparable to that of European countries, where health care is readily available to all. But it is also comparable to China and Costa Rica, poor countries where "the level of care is very very low," Dr. Vaupel said. "There may not be a lot of connection between the quality or level of care and life expectancy."
"Medical care sometimes saves our lives," Dr. Vaupel said. "But the main purpose of medical care is to help us get over an acute illness." And that, he said, does not measurably change a nation's average life expectancy.
"Even if you saved 100,000 lives, it wouldn't show up in the life expectancy figures," Dr. Reinhardt said. "If you write down the equations, you realize what unbelievably dramatic changes have to happen" for life expectancy to budge.
So, Dr. Reinhardt said, "if you want to judge health reform by measurable health status indicators, you'll be sorely disappointed."
While the Clinton plan's focus on preventive medicine is generally a good thing, Dr. Garber said, "we shouldn't be surprised if the effects are small" -- even in looking at specific diseases.
One reason is that many people are already receiving preventive care, like vaccines for their children, screening to detect diseases early or blood pressure checks, even if they have to pay for it themselves. So for a noticeable difference to occur, there would have to be a substantial change in the health of those who would suddenly have health insurance.
 
Hard Populations to Reach
 But many people who do not get such care are among the most difficult to reach. They often are poor and poorly educated. Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, said: "If you remove the financial barrier, some will come in, but not all. Another group comes in after an educational effort." As for the third group, the most recalcitrant, "you literally have to send the vans out to get them," he said.
A second reason that gains will be limited is that doctors have only a limited arsenal of preventive and early detection measures. These include childhood vaccinations, screening for high blood pressure, Pap smears and mammograms. Many conditions cannot be prevented: most cancer, birth defects, many cases of heart attacks. Others could be partly alleviated by changes in personal habits, like stopping smoking or eating a low-fat diet.
A decade ago, the Rand Corporation conducted a huge study of free medical care, including preventive services.The only improvements the study found were among the poor people in the group: more of them got glasses and their blood pressure levels were slightly decreased. The study, which involved 3,958 people, aged 14 to 61, concluded that "free health care did not improve health status." It also said the people who received free medical care visited doctors more often, spent more time in the hospital and perceived themselves as sicker than those who had to pay.
And in places that stress preventive services, like Hawaii, very few people take advantage of them. "Whenever we offer preventive services, like mammograms or Pap smears or cholesterol screening," said Robert Mytinger, who is vice president for community relations at the Hawaii Medical Services Association, "we never get more than 25 percent of the eligible population."
 
Little Interest in Checkups
 Dr. Mytinger added that about half the insurer's subscribers, or 300,000 people, participate in a program called Healthpass that aggressively encourages the use of preventive services. Each subscriber is invited on his birthday to come in for a general checkup and counseling on his health and how to reduce his risk of disease. But, Mr. Mytinger said, no more than 8 percent of them do.
Of course, Dr. Blendon said, there are aspects of health care that are not captured by health statistics but that do improve people's lives. "Medical care will affect pain and disability, but when you talk of mortality or life expectancy, that doesn't show up," he said. "My mother is convinced that if she has her cataract out, she's healthier. But that won't affect her life expectancy."
In fact, national surveys repeatedly showed that people did not become healthier because they went to doctors. "You go to a doctor when you're born, when you have babies, when you get really sick, and just before you die," said Dr. Donald Patrick, a professor of health services at the University of Washington in Seattle. "Otherwise, if you're lucky, you stay out of the medical system."

CORRECTION-DATE: October 24, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with the heading "Health Care: Clinton's Plan and the Alternatives," misstated aspects of the proposal by Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington. His plan would impose a payroll tax on individuals as well as employers, and would require individuals to pay "sin taxes." The measure's health security board would also have the authority to revise benefits; it would not be able to establish them.

HEADLINE: Unmasking Roots of Washington Heights Violence;
Residents Point to Overcrowding, Distrust of Police, Poverty and Thriving Drug Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
After last summer's disturbances, a firebombing that injured two firefighters and the recent killing of a housing police officer, Moises Perez has a blunt reply to those who wonder just what is happening in Washington Heights.
"You think they're getting the message?" said Mr. Perez, the executive director of Alianza Dominicana, a social service group in Washington Heights. "They can't ignore us anymore. We need people to come here with real responses to these problems." 
 Although Mr. Perez and others active in the teeming upper Manhattan community roundly condemned the violence, they emphasized that it was symptomatic of long-simmering problems like overcrowded schools and apartments, distrust of the police, high unemployment and overburdened social service groups like his own.
 
Youths Idle on Street Corners
 The potential for conflict increases when coupled with another factor: a thriving drug trade. Washington Heights, after all, is set amid a narrow stretch of land whose easily accessible highways and bridges make it a natural locale for selling drugs, which offers the promise of quick money to youths who find themselves idle on street corners day after day.
From the narrow streets clogged with double-parked cars outside buildings where some families double and triple up in cramped apartments, to the sun-drenched avenues thick with street peddlers, the area is one of the most densely populated in the city.
"You just have people stacked on top of people," said the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp, assistant minister at the Church of the Intercession at Broadway and West 155th Street. "Those kinds of things lead to a deterioration in the quality of life and lead to the kind of irrational acts and violent acts that we have been seeing."
Although the police have been the targets of violence in other neighborhoods, in Washington Heights the tensions seem more pronounced due to a variety of factors: intense crowding, a traditional distrust toward the police among some immigrants and a sizable drug trade that puts the police constantly on guard.
At the same time, the overcrowding distorts the public's perception of crime, said Deputy Inspector Joseph Esposito, the commanding officer of the 34th Precinct, which in recent months has cultivated better relations with the community. He said while the area had always had a high homicide rate, the number of killings was actually down this year.
"If you compare us per capita to the rest of the city, we're probably well to the middle of the pack," he said. "Everything seems so dense because of the population, the perception appears to be more serious than it actually is."
According to the 1990 Census, 146,416 people, 40 percent of them Dominican, inhabited the heart of Washington Heights, which stretches from 155th to 190th Streets between the Hudson and Harlem Rivers. But community leaders say the larger area, reaching north to Inwood and south into Manhattanville, packs some 300,000 people -- a fifth of them under 18 years old -- into a three-square-mile area.
These leaders note the actual number of Dominicans may be higher than officially reported, when illegal immigrants and others not counted in the census are considered.
 
Poverty Sets Stage For High Crime Rate
 According to the City Planning Department, Dominicans represented the city's largest group of new immigrants last year, with their numbers growing 20 percent faster than in previous years, and many of them have settled in Washington Heights.
Yet in an area where nearly one in three people lives under the poverty line, and by some estimates one out of every five Dominicans is unemployed, advocates said services like job training, education and family assistance have been stretched thin, setting the stage for problems like crime.
"I hope that the message is clear," Mr. Perez said. "Something needs to happen in this community. Young people need to be supported and families need to be helped and reinforced. Unfortunately, in the United States we function under a crisis mode, which means that we only deal with issues once it's at the crisis level."
Each morning, Amaurice Bautista leaves the apartment he shares with another family to hawk batteries, umbrellas and trinkets alongside the vendors who sell food, cassettes and T-shirts in the swirling sidewalk bazaar on St. Nicholas Avenue and 181st Street. The unlicensed peddler sometimes ends his day with little to show for his day's work, especially when the police sweep through and confiscate his goods.
"This is a very hard place to make a living," he said one recent afternoon as he swiftly gathered his goods before a police car passed by. "Every day the economy gets worse and people sometimes feel there is no way to get ahead."
Some trace the social and economic problems in the community back to the 1970's, when large numbers of Dominican immigrants began arriving. It was a time when the city's economy was hurting and the factory jobs that once provided economic opportunity for new immigrants began disappearing.
Rafael Lantigua, a doctor who is active in Dominican social and political issues, said many families had yet to establish themselves economically, while others were hampered by language.
"Most of the community is hard working, and came to establish themselves and help this nation and city," Dr. Lantigua said. "But unfortunately, due to dramatic urban changes in the United States in the last decade, we have not been allowed to reach those dreams."
 
Dreams of Better Life For Their Children
 Gina Martinez and her husband, Ramon, have placed their dreams with their three children, for whom they scrimp and save to come up with tuition to send them to parochial school. They do not want to take their chances with the public schools, which they feel are too crowded and impersonal.
In the Dominican Republic, Mrs. Martinez was an executive secretary and her husband a lawyer, but now he works as a maintenance worker and she takes odd jobs as a housekeeper and baby sitter while taking courses toward a college degree in education.
"My husband says it's been very hard to come here and work as a laborer when you've been a lawyer all your life," she said.
Nevertheless, their efforts are born of a simple desire. "We are sacrificing ourselves for our children," Mrs. Martinez explained.
Others have had a tougher time. Julio Lora, a teen-ager, remembers his years at an overcrowded public junior high school, where he says substitute teachers did little more than baby-sit. When he entered high school, he was a year behind in math.
"There were too many kids," he said. "Sometimes it's too crowded to get a normal education. I mean, sometimes kids get lost and there aren't enough teachers to get them back on track."
Maria Luna, the chairwoman of Community Board 12 in upper Manhattan, noted that youths had often been at the center of the various disturbances that have rocked Washington Heights. Part of the problem, she said, is a high dropout rate and a lack of vocational training that do not give many a chance at competing in the job market.
While five new schools are being built and there are some youth programs in the area, most notably a beacon school program at I.S. 143, Ms. Luna says more are needed.
"We have a subculture of young people who hang out on the street because there is nothing for them to do," she said.
Yvonee Stennett, assistant to the director of the Community League of West 159th Street, said that cutbacks had limited the efforts of groups like hers that have after-school and other youth programs.
"We often tell them to get off the corner," she said. "But we don't tell them where to go."
Some teen-agers end up drifting into the drug trade, lured by the elusive promise of a fast fortune that more often than not results in shortened lives and broken families.
Msgr. Gerald T. Walsh, the pastor of Incarnation Roman Catholic Church, said that while only a small percentage of the area's residents are involved in the drug trade, these people are responsible for much of the trouble in the area.
 
Youth Suspicious And Defiant of Police
 Compounding the problem among the youth is a defiance and suspicion toward the police that has been evident in past confrontations. Rolando Acosta, first deputy commissioner at the Commission on Human Rights, said some of that suspicion could be traced to a troubled relationship between citizens and the authorities back in the Dominican Republic.
"We come from a society where the police are viewed as one of the institutions that are there to oppress us and prevent us from engaging in the democratic process," he said. "Parents say to their children, 'Be careful with the police.' They have this folklore about what the police do with people."
Some young people insist the police do not respect them and are prejudiced against Dominicans. Robin Soriano, 18, said that after Officer John Williamson was killed on Oct. 8 by a bucket thrown from a roof, he and his friends were brought in for questioning and badgered by the police. A few days later, he said, he watched police officers laugh as they drove away after confiscating the goods of an unlicensed street vendor.
"There are policemen who shouldn't be policemen because of the way they treat you," Mr. Soriano said.
But others fault the families of these youths for their behavior. Rosario Bruno, 45, a single mother of three who is enrolled in a clerical skills course in Washington Heights, said she reared her children to be respectful of teachers and the police.
"How you raise your children has a lot to do with it," she said. "But there are women who either do not have the time, inclination or ability to correct their children."
Respect, she said, starts from within.
"If you respect the authorities, they will respect you," she said.
Since last summer's disturbances, elected officials and community leaders have been working to increase that respect, with the police becoming more active in reaching out to residents with programs aimed at young people and forums where residents meet their local beat cop.
"The 34th Precinct has been making an incredible effort to reach out to the community," Mr. Acosta said. "That kind of interaction is necessary. People see with their own eyes that the police are not what they've been led to believe."
In fact, a few days before Officer Williamson was killed, City Councilman Guillermo Linares helped sponsor a meeting with officers involved in the community policing program and 500 Washington Heights residents. The officers, he said, helped people to understand how they could report information to the police without fearing for their safety, and encouraged a continuing dialogue and partnership.
"The officers don't feel alone and they are welcome, respected and appreciated for what they do, as is the community," Mr. Linares said. "It is then the community that challenges anyone that dares violate the community itself."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Toronto

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH; CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH is Toronto bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
Walt Whitman, visiting Toronto in 1880, called the city "a lively, dashing place." In 1993, it is infinitely more so, pulsing with theaters, jazz and comedy clubs, restaurants and flea markets. Unesco recently counted more than 100 languages and dialects spoken here. One-third of the city's residents identify a language other than English or French as their mother tongue.
Chinese, Greeks, Portuguese, Ukrainians, Russians, Koreans, Indians and West Indians all have their own neighborhoods. In fact, there are three Chinatowns, reflecting different periods of immigration, starting with last century's railroad builders. 
 The liveliest places are where the nationalities spill into one another, such as on Bloor Street West, between Spadina Avenue and Bathurst Street. Haider Khan, born in Simla, India, in the foothills of the Himalayas, and raised in Karachi, Pakistan, runs the newly renovated Rajput Dining Room at 388 Bloor Street West, named after a princely Hindu caste famous for its cuisine. Lebanese, Hungarian, Russian, Korean, Italian, Mexican and Chinese restaurants are all within a stone's throw of Rajput.
Despite the proximity of so many peoples, ethnic strife is almost nonexistent, and crime is relatively low.
Public transportation is swift and moderately priced ($1 a ride if you buy five tokens, $1.50 if you buy only one, calculated at 75 United States cents to the Canadian dollar).
 
Events
 With its 44 theaters and more than 26,000 seats, Toronto is the most important theater city in the English-speaking world after New York and London. In a stunning display of optimism, nearly a fifth of the seats were added this year by Canada's largest impresarios, Garth Drabinsky and the father-son team of Ed and David Mirvish.
The biggest event of the fall season is the scheduled opening today of the North York Performing Arts Center, 5040 Yonge Street, which is about a 20-minute subway ride from downtown Union Station (take the Yonge Street Line to the North York stop). The center has three theaters (3,132 seats in all), including one with treelike pillars merging with a gold-domed ceiling and another modeled after the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. Together with a 5,000-square-foot art gallery, they make the arts complex, the first to be built in Canada since the 1960's, one of the largest in North America.
The 1,850-seat Main Stage Theater, which has the treelike pillars, is now the home of the musical "Show Boat," directed by Harold Prince, which opened for previews this month. Tickets range from $38 to $62. The 1,032-seat Recital Hall, modeled after the Concertgebouw, has scheduled Itzhak Perlman, Kathleen Battle, Yo-Yo Ma, James Galway and Alicia de Larrocha, among others, for its inaugural season, which begins Nov. 23. Tickets are $14 to $70. Call (416) 872-2222 for tickets to "Show Boat" and the Recital Hall.
The Mirvishes' 2,000-seat Princess of Wales Theater in downtown Toronto, at 300 King Street West, (416) 872-1212 or (800) 461-3333, opened in May with an indefinite run of "Miss Saigon." Rollicking murals painted by Frank Stella grace the walls of this new theater. Tickets are $19 to $68.
The performing arts calendar includes plentiful helpings of opera, ballet and symphonic music. The Canadian Opera Company will present "The Marriage of Figaro" from Nov. 4 to 28 and "The Magic Flute" from Nov. 12 to Dec. 5 at the Elgin Theater, 189 Yonge Street, (416) 872-5555. Tickets range from $19 to $65.
The National Ballet of Canada will offer "The Taming of the Shrew," "The Rite of Spring" and "La Sylphide" in November at the O'Keefe Center, 1 Front Street East, (416) 872-2262. Tickets cost $10.50 to $52. Sixty to 90 minutes before the curtain goes up at designated performances, the audience can hear talks by artists about what happens on stage and behind the scenes. For further information, call (416) 362-1041. The cost is $5.
The Toronto Symphony, in addition to its regular programming, began a new series called Casual Concerts this month -- 75 minutes without intermission, with introductions of the program from the podium and the orchestra in casual attire. Musicians will stay afterward to talk with the audience. The next of the season's four Casual Concerts, to include works by Ravel and Stravinsky, is scheduled for Nov. 27. The concerts are at Roy Thomson Hall, 60 Simcoe Street, (416) 593-4828. Tickets are $14 to $34.50.
 
Sightseeing
 Possibly encouraged by the Blue Jays' performance this season, visitors can explore the titanic $450 million Skydome, the domed stadium completed in 1989 at 1 Blue Jays Way, smack in the downtown center (the subway stop is Union Station). The 40,000-seat stadium features a retractable roof, sensing devices that monitor internal movement and a huge Jumbotron video screen. Daily walking tours are given from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Visitors can see the field the way the players do, step into the dugouts, tramp through the media center and see some of the building's inner workings. The tours take an hour, including a 15-minute film; they are not given when daytime events are scheduled. Tours are $6; $4 for children and the elderly; (416) 341-2770.
After a $44 million facelift, the Art Gallery of Ontario, at 317 Dundas Street West (the St. Patrick stop on the University Subway Line), (416) 977-0414, is well worth a visit. Its 16,000 works cover the last 600 years of human creative endeavor and are tastefully presented. Besides clusters of Dutch, English, French, Impressionist, Surrealist and other paintings, the gallery boasts the largest public collection of Henry Moores in the world and one of the world's most important assemblages of Inuit art. Admission: $5.50; $3 for students and the elderly, and free on Wednesdays after 5 P.M. The gallery is open Wednesday and Friday 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. and Thursday, Saturday and Sunday 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.
The Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood observed several years ago that Toronto was becoming a literary city on the model of London. A Writer's Map of Toronto ($3.75 from Colombo & Company, 42 Dell Park Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M6B 2T6, Canada) is a handy guide to places of literary interest. The Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov hunted butterflies in Queen's Park, home of the Ontario provincial government. And the Ontario Parliament buildings were the inspiration for the red stone buildings in one of John Updike's stories in "Bech Is Back."
 
Where to Eeat
 Toronto is an excellent city for dining out. One of the more exciting restaurants, Joso's, is set among interior design businesses at 202 Davenport Road, (416) 925-1903. The owner is from the Dalmatian coast of the former Yugoslavia, and the seafood is Mediterranean. Among the specialties are risotto nero, made with cuttlefish and its ink, and octopus steamed with garlic, capers and olive oil. Dinner for two, with a modest wine, is $65 to $75.
More than 4,000 people a day eat at Marche, a new restaurant of the Swiss Movenpick chain, at B.C.E. Place, 42 Yonge Street, (416) 366-8986. Diners line up at stalls where the food is prepared, pick out what they want, and watch it being made. Toronto represents a trial run for this concept. Among diners' choices are rosti, which are Swiss hash browns, and a daily pasta. Dinner for two, with wine, is less than $30.
For those who wish to enjoy Toronto's spectacular skyline in elegant surroundings, and eat well besides, there is the Roof Restaurant on the 18th floor of one of two towers at the Park Plaza Hotel, 4 Avenue Road, (416) 924-5471. The view to the south is of the CN Tower and Lake Ontario; specialties include lobster and truffle ravioli and seared chicken breast with spicy goat cheese. With a modest wine, dinner for two is $60 to $75.
Brownes Bistro at 4 Woodlawn Avenue East, (416) 924-8132, near the Summerhill subway stop is a friendly neighborhood restaurant run by a former cooking teacher from Wellington, New Zealand, named Beverley Burge. Some of the best dishes have a New Zealand signature; lamb shank stew or lamb sausage with mashed potatoes are especially good for cold winter nights. With a modest wine, dinner for two is $50.
Peter's Chungking Restaurant, at 281 College Street East, (416) 928-2936, specializes in Sichuan, Mandarin and Hunan dishes like spiced chicken with garlic-peanut sauce ($4.85) and Sichuan shredded beef ($6). Dinner for two, with beer, can cost less than $25.
For dim sum in Chinatown there is the Chiu Yuen restaurant at 2A Kensington Avenue, (416) 598-1573, on the outskirts of the Kensington Market. It is open seven days a week from 8 A.M. to 7 P.M. Fried yam spring rolls and shredded taro bean curd rolls are among the specialties. A large meal for two costs about $12, without drinks.
Another wholesome, inexpensive place is the vegetarian Capers Cafe at 372 Bloor Street West, (416) 323-9955, where the fare includes a vegetable stew and ratatouille served with brown rice. Dinner for two, with a modest wine, costs well under $25.

We have been looking through proofs of his fall catalogue featuring the model Kristen McMenamy, whose cropped hair and big features are anything but classic. Lagerfeld did the photography, as he does for most of his catalogue and ad material, preferring to keep his vision out of the hands of star photographers, stylists and Madison Avenue types. He says he doesn't need a translator:
"I am the most informed person I know. I like magazines, newspapers, books. I can read in German, French, Italian, English."
In casting his net wide, with a network of what he laughingly calls sociocultural "spies," from Gutfreund to the Chanel phone operators, he hopes to avoid the gilded-cage atrophy that has stunted much of traditional couture.
"I have the feeling that a lot of designers only want the lives of the clients," he says. "MY LADIES. That's very demode. If you do only what you think will flatter her taste, soon your lady will go somewhere else. You have to force people to break with things."
Like offering his ladies rap styles with four-figure price tags?
Lagerfeld smiles. "Look, the subculture is here," he says, pointing to one side of a piece of paper. "Here is the very high established look. And we have to be walking the edge of both of them. This is the secret of couture and expensive ready-to-wear. On the edge. You have to show the people that the world is changing. Because nothing is worse for a woman than having the feeling that she is dated."
He may eschew the worship of tradition but he does not dismiss the impact of his metier on history. "How can you imagine the 20's without the short dress, the 18th century without the corset? No, I think fashion is not just stupid. Millions of people live from it, in it. And it is, as a short note, the most typical expression of a moment."
It has grown very late. Once the last taille has swished down the corridor, only Susan Gutfreund remains. Ask which of the $30,000 visions we've seen are selling and Lagerfeld insists it's the edgier stuff, rather than the "old stiff couture dresses," which he's still obliged to make in small numbers.
"What are we doing still making such things?" The couturier laughs. "Are we all QUITE MAD?"
 
'WHAT'S A SUPERMODEL?'
Shimmering in the heat, ringing with the sounds of the Icelandic rocker Bjork, a limousine is shooting west, toward a spectacular desert sunset. It bears a weary Cindy Crawford, MTV producer Alisa Bellettini, plus hair and makeup stylists. We are headed back to Los Angeles after a day's shoot in Two Bunches Palms, during which a game Crawford wore Alaia and Calvin Klein, stood in hot springs and on a sizzling 110-degree mesa until she nailed her lines.
"It's O.K., honey," Bellettini assured her talent. "A little sweat is very 'Thelma and Louise.' "
Crawford works hard for the money. And, honey, she is always working; men in suits are still lining up to toss money at Cindy Crawford for being the stunner no one's afraid to talk to. Bellettini, who created "House of Style" four years ago, says she fought the network's desire to use a v-jay for the host.
"I wanted a model and I wanted her to be famous," she says. "Because I knew that if I didn't get good ratings, it would be easy to cancel . . . a fashion show."
Crawford was well known at the time, but not so much as now, since she's married a famous actor and been on TV. She thinks that supermodeldom, like the pouf, was very much a creation of the 80's. Recently she had a talk with Lauren Hutton, who, in 1973, became the highest paid model in history when she signed with Revlon. As they compared notes, Crawford realized that "even with inflation, they weren't making the kind of money we make now. And the power."
The swimsuit calendars. Exercise videos. Crawford does Pepsi ads, has a reported $2 million Revlon contract. Much of it came to her back in those limo gridlock days when Nancy Reagan was accepting all those couture "gifts" and the Donald and Ivana were still a fun couple.
"That was a very special time, the Christy-Cindy-Linda-Naomi group of girls," Crawford says. "I don't know if it's going to happen again soon, because I don't know if that necessarily was a good thing for the business."
Nonetheless, she has little patience for the product managers, designers and ad directors moaning about the size of the models' checks. "They made us really important," she says. "Then they didn't like it when we became more important than the clothes."
Now that everyone's sobered up, now that they've had to trade in their car-jackable Range Rovers for less-enticing Accords, she's noticed that their attitudes have changed. She figures that modeling fees and their attendant media fuss might get more "minimal," just like the clothes.
"What's a SUPERMODEL? I always feel like I'm going into a phone booth to change."
The sun has gone down behind the tinted windows, the two-hour drive is nearly over and, as she has quite often this long day, Crawford is telling a Richard story. Seems they were at a dinner party when another well-known beauty entered. Gere leaned over to his wife and whispered, "You know, you're still the most beautiful woman in this room."
Crawford is smiling, declares that, of course, she loves him for saying it, whether it was true or not. But oh, men. Husbands. Boyfriends. Photographers. And Designers. Yes, them too. They can't always catch up to where Beauty has gone, can't help being so retro in the sweetest of nothings.
"Don't they get it yet?" she says. "They just don't seem to understand. We don't need to hear that anymore."

SEX, ECONOMY, FREEDOM AND COMMUNITY
Eight Essays.
By Wendell Berry.
192 pp. New York:
Pantheon. $20. 
 WHEN Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill and 14 Senators presented their prurient drama on television two years ago, most of us believed that that confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court Justice dealt with sexual harassment, personal integrity and political probity -- or, perhaps better put, the lack of probity. But Wendell Berry, in the title essay of his most recent collection, will have none of this kind of superficial analysis. The event, he writes, had to do with community, and what happens when community disintegrates in a society. In his view, unwhole community is, perforce, unwholesome. Because we have destroyed community, the Senate Judiciary Committee attempted to "deal publicly with a problem for which there is no public solution."
It is essential to know that the author is defining community here as intimately connected to a place, not just an abstract concept. Most particularly he means a rural place, for Mr. Berry is our foremost living literary exponent of the values of rural life and livelihood. His province, as Wallace Stegner, his teacher and friend, has written, is "the farm, the neighborhood, the community, the town, the memory of the past and the hope of the future -- everything that is subsumed . . . under the word 'place.' " Place creates community, but when the place and its natural environment are destroyed -- as rural places inevitably are by ruthless economic exploiters who, in effect, live nowhere -- then the capacity of community to provide a useful moral context and a restraining "mutuality of interests" is lost. And so, says Wendell Berry, are we.
"Sex, Economy, Freedom and Community" is Wendell Berry's 11th collection of essays (he also has written 7 novels and 10 books of poetry), and it is perhaps the most demanding intellectually. Unlike some earlier work, it deals not with rural anecdote, parable and reporting, but in its eight essays distills the author's radically conservative views (in the good senses of both words) that have sprung from land and community in Kentucky's tobacco-farm country, a place -- the Berry "homeplace" -- chosen deliberately by the writer.
Through the lens of this countryman-writer, then, we find that the Persian Gulf war was a tragedy, not a triumph. In "Peaceableness Toward Enemies," Mr. Berry calls it a war to defend an oil-based national economy that "is not at all related to the prosperity of American localities and communities." In an essay on "global thinking and the sustainability of cities" ("Out of Your Car, Off Your Horse"), he challenges the bumper-sticker apothegm "Think Globally, Act Locally" as being facile, hopeless and perilous.
"Local life," he writes, "may be as much endangered by those who would 'save the planet' as by those would 'conquer the world.' " For saving the planet calls for abstract purposes and central powers that cannot know -- and thus will destroy -- the integrity of local nature and local community.
Mr. Berry also takes up, in "Christianity and the Survival of Creation," a point forcefully raised in the historian Lynn White's troubling 1967 article in Science magazine, "The Historic Roots of Our Ecologic Crisis." Though not the first to do so, White most persuasively laid our environmental catastrophes at the feet of a Christianity possessed by a fatal "arrogance toward nature," an attitude "deeply grounded in Christian dogma." Mr. Berry berates what he calls the "anti-Christian environmentalists," who have borrowed White's thesis for their own purposes but have not "mastered the first rule of the criticism of books: you have to read them before you criticize them." In the book in question, the Bible, he finds much support for a reverence for nature, although he excoriates organized Christianity for ignoring its own sacred text. "I don't think," he observes archly, "it is enough appreciated how much an outdoor book the Bible is."
The first essay, "Conservation and the Local Economy," contains a pithy statement that provides the theme for this book, if not for all of Mr. Berry's work: "The great, greedy, indifferent national and international economy is killing rural America, just as it is killing American cities. . . . Experience has shown that there is no use in appealing to this economy for mercy toward the earth or toward any human community. All true patriots must find ways of opposing it."
If you believe in land and community, Mr. Berry argues in "A Bad Big Idea," then you cannot believe in GATT (the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade), which in his view will empower the "supranational" corporations even further to demand that farmers adopt industrial farming practices that are destructive to land and community. Moreover, you cannot even be against the Government's tobacco allotment program for small farmers. In an essay that first appeared in The Progressive, and that drew heavy mail from anti-smokers, Mr. Berry, himself a sometime tobacco farmer, insisted that he and his neighbors not be condemned out of hand and not be deprived of a program that operates at no net cost to taxpayers and helps to protect the rural, community values that otherwise most of us subscribe to. The critics, he says, "will sit in their large automobiles, spewing a miasma of toxic gas into the atmosphere, and they will thank you for not smoking a cigarette."
Such are the challenges and joys of reading Wendell Berry. If "Sex, Economy, Freedom and Community" seems too rarefied, a bit dry, unleavened by the telling imagery and stories of rural life in Mr. Berry's other collections, nevertheless it presents him at his aphoristic best. Read it with pencil in hand, make notes and hope that somehow our country and the world will soon come to see the truth that is told here.

HEADLINE: SHOPPER'S WORLD;
An Appalachian Trail for Carolina Crafts Seekers

BYLINE: By SUZANNE CARMICHAEL; SUZANNE CARMICHAEL is the author of "The Traveler's Guide to American Crafts" (E. P. Dutton).

 BODY:
AT the beginning of this century, North Carolina mountain crafts were the whooping cranes of the craft world, a seriously endangered species in a changing environment with few protectors. Even in isolated hamlets throughout the Appalachian Mountains along the state's western border, manufactured goods were gradually replacing handcrafts, the lively barter economy was declining, and the craft-dependent mountain way of life had begun to fade as families took jobs outside of their communities.
Fortunately, during the 1920's and 30's, several cultural missionaries began to organize local cottage industries, establish regional markets and found craft schools. Besides assuring the continuation of traditional crafts -- from elaborate Cherokee basketry and hand-spun wool coverlets to whimsical folk toys -- they inspired what today is a burgeoning contemporary crafts scene. 
 I recently made a whirlwind three-day tour of North Carolina's mountain craft caches to see some of the best work being done in the region. The first stop was in Cherokee, 48 miles south of Asheville, the home of Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, an Indian cooperative founded in 1946 to nurture and market native Cherokee crafts.
Traditional baskets, pottery, masks and carvings fill Qualla's spacious quarters, providing a glimpse of tribal craftsmanship developed centuries before European contact. A small museum illustrates these techniques with step-by-step exhibits and videos of artisans.
Qualla's most impressive items are double-weave, river-cane baskets once used to transport water ($100 for small ones to $2,000 for large, intricate versions). Essentially two nesting baskets woven as one continuous piece, the containers have handsome geometric designs made with dyes derived from dark brown walnut, rusty red bloodroot and sunny yellowroot.
Traditional pottery includes bear-grease oil lamps with serpent-head handles ($60) and "seven clan" peace pipes that resemble small hollow tree trunks studded with seven stubby branches ($25 to $60). The pottery is made from continuous clay coils smoothed with river stones, then decorated by pressing rope, fabric or carved wood paddles against the clay. Finished surface hues range from solid black to softly mottled coral and gray, the precise color determined by the type of wood used in firing. Buckeye, gourd and fur masks ($75 to $300) that were once used in ceremonies or worn as decoys during hunts are another Cherokee craft specialty.
Perennial favorites include eerie "Booger" masks, stark faces with grimacing mouths and startled eyes, which mocked people considered of questionable character -- generally white men and Indians from other tribes.
From Cherokee, the craft route winds south 58 miles through gentle, smoky mountainscapes to Murphy, then eight miles east to the small village of Brasstown, home of the John C. Campbell Folk School. Founded in 1925, the school promotes traditional mountain crafts, music and dance through three-day to two-week courses. Visitors are encouraged to take a self-guided walking tour through Campbell's 365 wooded acres, a National Historic District, stopping at rustic studio cabins to watch students handle sizzling iron, weave brightly colored textiles or carve wood amid fragrant shavings.
The school's cozy stone craft shop sells a variety of traditional work, including a menagerie of winsome wood animals by the renowned Brasstown carvers, who constitute a cottage industry developed by the school in the 1930's. For over 60 years, local carvers have come to the shop each Friday to pick up blocks of wood, returning a week later with finely detailed carved animals.
Using pale basswood, warm-hued butternut and buckeye streaked with black grain, Brasstown carvers recreate mountain creatures, from fluttery hummingbirds ($10) to stately miniature deer ($58). Shelves, windows and table tops teem with critters: doleful hound dogs ($16 to $20) and dozing cats ($6.50 to $60), inch-high beavers and bears ($8) and foot-tall geese ($60).
From Brasstown, the road passes 52 miles northeast through valley farmland and low mountains to the industrial town of Franklin, the home of Maco Crafts. This mountain co-op represents 200 artisans and offers traditional textiles as well as sweet-toned dulcimers ($245), starchy cornhusk dolls ($6.75 to $14.95) and intricately crocheted doilies ($35). The most irresistible items are Robert and Judy Abel's innovative carved or painted gourds, a potpourri of natural shapes including dark, glossy ones covered with finely carved birds ($36), or transformed into elaborately carved world globes ($145). Other gourds, embellished with paint, become birdhouses ($30) or black and white potbellied cows ($21).
At the Riverwood Pewter Shop in picturesque Dillsboro, 26 miles north of Franklin, artisans wielding leather-wrapped hammers pound pewter on wood forms to create a variety of Colonial-style items, from plain-rimmed nut dishes ($40) to elegantly simple punch bowls ($200). Other artisans use delicate jeweler's saws to pierce pewter rims, fashioning stylized dogwood-blossom edges on shallow plates ($25 to $85) and long oval platters ($65 to $95).
Riverwood pewter, like many other traditional North Carolina crafts, owes its existence to the Penland School of Crafts, the next stop on my trek. A pleasantly remote, almost monastic aura surrounds Penland's 480-acre campus, an artistic retreat framed by mountain backdrops, lush meadows and forested hillsides, 55 miles northeast of Asheville.
Established in 1923 by Lucy Morgan, a weaver and Appalachian enthusiast, Penland first taught classes in weaving, which Miss Morgan hoped would resurrect textile crafts while providing local families with an economic incentive to preserve their traditional mountain life styles. Eventually other endangered crafts were added to the curriculum, including pottery and pewter arts. Today, about 75 students study a variety of crafts during eight-week fall and spring sessions; over 180 students attend two-week summer courses.
Since the 1960's, Penland's mission has shifted from preserving mountain crafts to encouraging serious craft artists to produce fine contemporary work. Penland's sales gallery reflects this change, showcasing imaginative pieces in a variety of media by instructors and students.
During a recent visit, the collection included colorful ceramic teapots with deliberately skewed perspectives by Deborah Groover ($400); Ken Sedberry's oval ceramic plates swimming with speckled frogs ($35), and David Wilson's intriguing glass globes, which resemble small nightmarish caves filled with smoky three-dimensional forms ($300). Another glassy standout was "Bag Explosion," a sculpture by Kate Bogel and John Littleton, the son of the master glass artist Harvey Littleton. This whimsical piece consists of a large, amethyst-colored glass "bag" with two small bags, rose and turquoise, bursting from each side ($2,000).
In recent years, Penland has spawned scores of studio artists, more than 175 of whom have moved permanently to the surrounding countryside. Maps available at the Penland Gallery and local bed-and-breakfasts direct craft connoisseurs to over two dozen of these artists. One is the potter Jane Peiser, whose studio sits at the bottom of a twisty dirt road near the Penland campus.
Inside Ms. Peiser's studio, piles of gaily colored porcelain sit near shelves lined with innovative pottery, from soap dishes ($40) and tapered vases ($80 to $200) to ornate planters (up to $2,000). Ms. Peiser, a former Penland instructor, creates her signature ceramics from thin layers of colored porcelain that are rolled, layered, sliced, relayered, chopped, then rolled again before being shaped into vessels featuring fey female figures robed in vivid complexity or surrounded by mazes of color.
Arval Woody, a fifth-generation chairmaker in nearby Spruce Pine, also has a Penland connection: his grandfather once taught woodworking at the school. Today, the 73-year-old artisan continues the family tradition, making Colonial-style chairs, from fine hardwood rockers ($275 to $475) to "slipper" chairs ($110 to $120). True to their name, the latter are close to the ground, perfect for bending over to put on one's slippers.
All chairs are assembled without nails or glue, depending upon the wood's natural shrinkage as it dries to assure a tight, lasting construction. To prove the sturdiness of his wares, Mr. Woody uses his favorite sales gimmick: balancing a chair on one of its legs, he jumps up on a rung. Neither the chair nor Mr. Woody collapses.
From Spruce Pine, the Blue Ridge Parkway wends south 47 miles, skimming the forested ridges that lead to Asheville and my final destination, the Southern Highland Handicraft Guild's Folk Art Center. This massive 30,000-square-foot stone and wood establishment houses three galleries, a spacious gift shop and, from April through December, a trio of artisans demonstrating their techniques. One frequent demonstrator is Ralph Gates, a garrulous, white-bearded broom maker, whose fanciful yet practical creations include a double broom with two joined sweeping heads ($60), a "cobweb" broom mounted on a twisted honeysuckle vine handle ($18) and an elaborate hearth sweeper with a colorful braided grip ($84).
Beyond the demonstration area, a sloped walkway leads past walls of elaborate quilts ($850 to $895) to balcony galleries. Recent exhibitions have featured intriguing pieces, including a sextuplet of robed black gospel singers carved in wood by Sarah Haines ($4,000).
Below, in the cheerful hubbub of the Allanstand Craft Shop, 275 guild artisans display work that ranges from rustic pine-bark berry baskets ($30) and colorful rag rugs ($40 to $120) to soft-sculpture cows dressed in gingham ($28 to $32) and a shy, bearded folk doll holding a miniature dulcimer ($400). For $2, you can buy a gee-haw whimmy diddle, a traditional folk toy made from a wood propeller mounted on a notched rhododendron twig. By rubbing another twig along the notches, you make the propeller spin right (gee) or left (haw).

HEADLINE: Malls Add Services to Keep Customers

BYLINE: By NANCY KENNEDY

 BODY:
HOLD on to your credit cards. New Jersey shopping malls, trying to cope with challenges ranging from warehouse clubs to television home-shopping channels, are scrambling to keep their status as consumer icons.
As any serious consumer can attest, the number of places to spend an allowance, a paycheck or an inheritance seems to have risen sharply. Warehouse clubs and large specialty stores like Ikea, with its home furnishings, and Staples, which sells office supplies, are moving into existing retail space along the state's busiest corridors. Discounters and outlet stores have taken a firm hold as well. Easy-access strip centers are enjoying a resurgence with time-starved New Jerseyans. 
 To lure shoppers back into their climate-controlled environs, many malls -- some dating to the 1950's -- are expanding and renovating. Others are trying to be more savvy by luring hot tenants like Nordstrom and the Disney Store.
Still others are finally becoming aware that many customers want more service and better security as much as selection and bargains. The Menlo Park Mall, for example, has wheelchairs and strollers, emergency diaper kits and a mall-walkers' club, whose members exercise by circling the interior of a mall before the stores open.
When customers asked for recycling bins in the food court, they got them, said Alice Rosen, Menlo Park's marketing manager. Menlo Park, one of the earliest malls at 30 years old, is in its second year of operation after an 18-month shutdown for rebuilding.
Last month, the Quakerbridge Mall, in Lawrence Township, began offering year-round valet parking after the service proved popular during the holidays, said its marketing manager, Lisa Stezzi. And earlier this year, Bridgewater Commons instituted a smoke-free environment -- a bold move that other malls have adopted.
For enhanced safety, Menlo Park brightened lighting to eliminate dark corners. A Lawrence Township police officer is now stationed at the Quakerbridge Mall, which executives say played a part in reducing auto theft at the mall by 80 percent compared with a year ago.
Hit by recession and an accompanying real estate decline, new shopping-center construction starts in New Jersey declined to just eight in 1992, from 56 in 1989, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
New Jersey is home to about 978 shopping centers -- groupings of stores that have central management -- and generally the largest shopping centers are considered malls. Of the total shopping centers in the state, 35 are enclosed malls, putting most residents within a half-hour's drive of at least one mall, if not several. There hasn't been a new mall constructed in the state since 1990, when the Freehold Raceway Mall opened its doors on the site of a former race track.
Many retail analysts argue that the state has all the malls it can support. The decline of mall development as a profitable venture might be the biggest constraint. "The retail market used to be more development driven; today, the money is in management," said Keith Foxe, the spokesman for the shopping-center council. Shopping-center management companies receive not only rent but also a percentage of their tenants' profits.
Some experts trace the malls' extra efforts at luring shoppers to 1988, when Bridgewater Commons, the second-to-last mall to open in the state, had its debut in central New Jersey.
"Bridgewater Commons made all the other malls in the state look tired," said Prof. James W. Hughes, associate dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.
"Malls began to see that new players could come on the scene and take business away."
 
'Siren Call' of Affluence
 Retail developers have long heeded New Jersey's siren call. Residents' personal annual income, at $26,457 per capita in 1992, continually outshines the national average of $19,841. The state is home to four of the country's 10 highest income areas, said Tom Brown, an economist with the State Office of Economic Research.
Developers tend to place their malls in these strategic trade areas of high household income. The average household income of an Echelon Mall shopper is about $50,200, said Monica Carassa, the marketing manager at Echelon, which is in Voorhees. In Somerset County, home to Bridgewater Commons, average household income tops $58,000.
Low vacancy rates among retail properties attest to the fact that retailing is still a viable business. Overall retail vacancy rates today stand at just 10 percent, according to the shopping-center council.
"An office-building developer would think he'd died and gone to heaven to see just 10 percent vacancies in his buildings," said John M. Gilchrist Jr., the chief executive of the Hahn Company, the San Diego-based developer of Bridgewater Commons.
Vacancy rates at malls, at about 5 percent, are the lowest in the retail industry. "Malls tend to be more stable because of their size," Mr. Foxe said. "If two out of 100 stores leave, it doesn't discourage potential tenants."
 
The Profit Potential
 The average mall pulls in about $225 in sales per square foot of the gross leasable area, according to the shopping-center council. In New Jersey, sales figures can be much higher. The Mall at Short Hills, for example, has sales of about $380 a square foot, said the mall's manager, Craig Perry. That puts Short Hills near the top in terms of mall sales: only 1 percent of malls do $400 or more a square foot in business. Bridgewater Commons is said to be in that top 1 percent, although officials there wouldn't discuss sales figures.
For many malls, renovation has indeed been the catalyst to greater profits. The Quakerbridge Mall, which was built in 1975 in Lawrence Township, spent $6 million on renovation this year, replacing about a third of its gross leasable area of 1.2 million square feet. Robert Hart, the mall manager at Quakerbridge, said sales increases are in the double digits this year.
"Same-store sales are up moderately, about 2 to 3 percent, but the new stores are experiencing tremendous increases," Mr. Hart said.
At the Menlo Park Mall, Nordstrom and Macy's are big draws. "Our customers are primarily suburban, dual-income households," Ms. Rosen said. "They have no problem spending money as long as they feel they are being treated as though their dollars matter, and that they are getting good value for the money spent."
 
Establishing an Identity
 Malls try all kinds of moves to establish an identity in the minds of shoppers. Quakerbridge, for example, with 36 clothing stores and 4 major department stores, wants to be known as the "fashion mall," Mr. Hart said.
Just up Route 1 from Quakerbridge, Forrestal Village is hitting its stride as an outlet center, reinventing itself after failing as a tony shopping enclave. At Freehold Raceway, with its double-decker carousel, "everything pivots around children," the mall's manager, Paul Comorado, said, apparently intending no pun.
Menlo Park likes to say it has something for everyone, but it caters to its upper-middle-class suburban community of business professionals with stores like Ann Taylor and Talbots. But even a few miles can make a difference in the target market a mall strives to shape itself around.
"The fashion attitude of our shoppers runs to classic traditional," said Menlo Park's manager, John Carpenter, who until August was the manager of Woodbridge Center. "Just two miles up the road at Woodbridge, the customer could be more accurately described as fashion forward, and closer to the city, at Bergen Mall, say, the customer is a trendsetter."
With their comfortable, controlled environment, malls can entice shoppers to spend money even when they haven't got a specific purchase in mind. "As much as 30 percent of purchases are the result of impulse shopping," Mr. Gilchrist, of the Hahn Company, said. "The customer goes shopping without an idea of what he or she wants to purchase."
 
Happy Shoppers Spend More
 Even average customers will spend 20 percent more if they are enjoying shopping, said Murray Raphel, an Atlantic City-based marketing consultant.
The success of the mall in the 1990's, Mr. Raphel said, depends not only on what the mall as an entity does to attract shoppers, but also on individual mall merchants and their relationship with their loyal customers.
"The rule of thumb is that 80 percent of your business can be traced to 20 percent of your customers," Mr. Raphel said. "Merchants need to reward these customers, give them something they pay nothing for, something they'll get just by walking in the door."
Most malls express confidence in their ability to retain their place in shoppers' hearts. Mr. Hart of Quakerbridge isn't worried. He believes there is room for malls, specialty stores, discounters, warehouse clubs, outlets and strip centers alike on the New Jersey retailing scene.
"Competition merely makes this area more of a retailing hub," Mr. Hart said. "It can only serve to increase customer draw. We're not worried about how big the pie is. We believe the pie is still growing."

HEADLINE: Can Schools Curb Rising Bias Incidents?

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
"HOW many of you have ever witnessed a racial, ethnic, religious or sexual slur?" the speaker asked the students. "If you have, stand up."
One by one, students rose, until every student filling the auditorium at Commack High School was standing. 
 The speaker, Joe Giordano, who often addresses students about bias, continued, "How many have heard these remarks from a close friend?"
More than half the students stood.
"How many have heard them from members of your own family?" A majority remained standing.
"We have some work to do, don't we?" Mr. Giordano asked. "When remarks are made that put you down, we often say it doesn't matter. But it really does. These comments are about you and your family -- this is your soul. It's who you are."
 
Face the Hate Week
 The recent assembly was part of a Face the Hate Week in the Commack School District, one of a growing number of districts on Long Island that have introduced programs to address increases in bias incidents among youths.
Commack High School was the scene in June of one of the most blatant incidents of anti-Semitism on the Island. On the night before graduation, anti-Semitic graffiti were painted on the school track and football stands. In July, two graduating seniors were arrested after the police questioned a number of students. Last week the two 18-year-olds, Robert Rolsteon and Philip Argiros, were arraigned. They face up to seven years in jail if convicted.
In addition, another Commack student, Richard Sasto, also 18, was indicted on a charge of perjury. He was accused of lying to a grand jury when he denied that a friend never mentioned to him that he was involved in defacing the track.
There have been a number of other incidents of anti-Semitism on the Island recently. Last month the head of a pig was thrown into the living room of a yeshiva teacher in Lake Grove. The Suffolk County police said they were investigating the incident.
In Port Washington, a swastika and anti-Semitic graffiti were found at a park. Anti-Semitic graffiti were also discovered in elementary schools in Levittown and Huntington. Last week, anti-Semitic graffiti, including swastikas and the phrase "Jews Must Die," were spray painted across the back of a P. C. Richards appliance store in Oceanside.
Suffolk has received 100 reports of bias-related incidents this year, according to Detective James Mosby of the police bias unit. He added that 75 percent of the criminals had been youths from 13 to 19. In Nassau County, 67 incidents were reported to the police this year. The bias coordinator, Inspector Ronald Olsen, said 70 percent of those caught were usually teen-agers.
 
New Programs in Curriculums
 The incidents have prompted educators to become more aggressive in dealing with the problem. Some districts have added to their curriculums programs with acronyms like PINK for Prejudice Is Not Kool, STAR for Students Together Against Racism and BUTY for Bring Unity to Youth. Others are introducing programs sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Congress, the Americans Civil Liberties Union and other groups.
 
Increase in Ethnic Violence
 While students are becoming familiar with terms like bias-reduction, ethnic sharing and cultural diversity, some educators and others are concerned over why the acts of bias seem to be growing and whether the programs are effective in changing behavior.
Intolerance is not a new problem, but it has become more visible in schools, said Amy Levine, Long Island director of the American Jewish Congress. Incidents of anti-ethnic graffiti have become more prevalent, she said, along with a general increase in violence.
"We've got to give kids tools to combat hate, to respond to their parents when they hear them making derogatory remarks," Ms. Levine said. "We don't want people to be tolerated, but honored for their diversity."
Racism is no longer just a black-and-white issue, said Louise Simpson, Long Island regional director of the N.A.A.C.P. The tendency to look for scapegoats is an attitude that comes from the home, she added.
An assistant school superintendent in Commack, Robert Davis, said the weeklong program in his district was scheduled early in the school year in response to the vandalism in the spring. "Our students need to know that such ugly incidents will not be accepted or tolerated," he said.
After the first day the events at the high school continued with sensitivity groups to discuss discrimination and stereotypes; the viewing and discussion of a film, "Crimes of Hate," and a crossculture festival. The principal, Ron Vale, said:
"In one week we can't change the behavior of kids. But it's an attempt, and we've got to keep chipping away at it. We're hoping that this will stimulate thinking among the kids and lead to other follow-up activities."
 
Role of Economics
 One widely held theory explaining the rise of bias-related incidents cites economics. The community relations director of the South Huntington School District, Dr. Joan Wilson, said:
"The growing incidence of bias and racism among youth is embedded in the economic conditions of our country. We're seeing the result of the frustration on the part of families unable to live in the manner that they would like to or that they were accustomed to. Children are registering their reactions to the anger and frustrations of their parents."
 
'All Kinds of Fantasies'
 Most experts emphasize early intervention. Dr. Mary Rose Paster, a psychologist in Glen Cove, said that by 12 children are set in their ideas and attitudes. "The earlier we can intervene and teach respect for individuals of different cultures, religions and races, the easier it is for them to take these values and make them part of their own value systems," Dr. Paster said. "If members of minority groups are not part of the broader community, kids can project all kinds of fantasies onto members of these minorities without having the opportunity to check out their perceptions."
Experts also agree that for programs on prejudice to be effective, they should involve parents. A psychologist in Roslyn, Dr. Robert Byalick, said parent education was critical and added:
"It is the attitudes of their parents that kids identify with and imitate at an early age. Their perceptions are often based on fear and ignorance rather than reality. School programs are important to make students more aware of these issues. But unless the schools include the parents on an ongoing basis the programs won't change the behaviors among the kids."
A conference for educators on prejudice was held in May by the American Jewish Congress and the Suffolk Association of Jewish Schools. Its purpose was to exhibit programs that districts have started to help break down stereotypes and reduce prejudice, said Ms. Levine.
The conference was sponsored by more than 30 organizations, including the N.A.A.C.P., the Archdiocese of Rockville Centre, La Union Hispanica, Boces, police departments and other agencies. Workshops demonstrated some of the programs.
 
 'If It's Reinforced Every Day'
 PINK, a counseling program at Rockville Centre Middle School, is one of several anti-bias programs developed by the district, according to Superintendent William Johnson, who is also president of the Nassau County Council of Superintendents.
"This trend is typical of most school districts," Dr. Johnson said. "If they don't already have programs in place they're setting them up. In a multicultural community the process must be on going. The evolution of behavior that allows kids to understand and tolerate one another will happen only if it's reinforced every day."
A national program sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, a World of Difference, has taken workshops to 87 of the 126 districts on the Island in recent years. The coordinator for Nassau-Suffolk, Robert Ricken, said the workshops started focusing on prejudices about race and religion, but have expanded to include sex, handicaps and other stereotypes.
"We talk to kidsabout how it feels to be picked on, if they're fat, skinny, a Jew, an Indian, a nerd, someone who wears glasses," Mr. Ricken said. "Then we try to give them techniques for dealing with these stereotypes and for appreciating differences among themselves. It's difficult to measure if the workshops have made a difference, but there are indicators that they have been effective in changing the attitudes of some of the kids."
 
Peers as Mediators
 The STAR program at Longwood Middle School features student-led exercises against stereotypes and racism, said an assistant superintendent, Peter Strafaci. "We have a slogan," Mr. Strafaci said, " 'If you educate the young and wait 50 years the old will die out, and racism will die out with it.' We're trying to emphasize that differences are good, not bad."
He said other recent programs in the Longwood district include Bring Unity to Youth, which tries to bring black and white high school students together in an effort to understand differences, and the Diversity Institute, a program in which a group of fourth graders were selected by their peers to become student mediators.
"It's hard to measure if these programs are reaching the kids," Mr. Strafaci said. "But students are more involved than ever before, and kids are talking to other kids. In the long run, hopefully, this will change attitudes."
Districts are introducing programs created for their students. In Bay Shore, whose students are 25 percent black, 20 percent Hispanic and 5 percent Asian, teacher volunteers started a high school program in ethnic sharing several years ago. Last month the district agreed to finance the program, said the coordinator, Pat Ponzi.
 
Pain, Resentment and Anger
 "The beauty of the program is its simplicity," Mrs. Ponzi said. "It's about sharing experiences and opening the lines of communication in a structured three-hour session. Kids can spend time together every day, participate in the same activities and never talk. In an ethnic-sharing session, students of diverse groups talk about bias and stereotypes. We hear about pain, resentment and anger. It touches a lot of nerves.
"When a student hears how another feels about being stereotyped and how it hurts he starts to think more about his own behavior. Has it made a difference? Not an 8 on the Richter scale. But we've seen kids hanging out together who never did before, and we've noticed some reduction in the level of antagonism among groups."
Mrs. Ponzi said teachers in the program had trained other districts to set up programs.
In Herricks a growing Asian population that makes up one-third of the students has mandated increased sensitivity to cultural differences, said Michael Klopfer, coordinator of the community coalition in the district. Recent programs include ethnic sharing, a Korean support group, book talks, a community holiday cookbook and community programs.
"Initially the differences are subtle," Mr. Klopfer said. "The real success will be long range. How will these kids function with their own families when they grow up? We hope that we're educating a generation that will be more tolerant than their parents. The earlier we can reach them and make an impression on their young minds the more effective it will be."
 
Course From New York City
 In Plainview, a district that is half Jewish, a Holocaust and genocide studies center helps students and adults remember those horrors through memorabilia, said a spokesman for the district, Robert Zimmerman. The goal is to focus on what prejudice can lead to and how people can fight back, he said.
Last month, a conference sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union at Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School drew 100 educators to preview a course, "Civil Rights and Race Relations," that has been taught in New York City schools.
 
Response to Series of Incidents
 The director of the A.C.L.U. on Long Island, Barbara Bernstein, said the impetus for the conference was the graffiti in Commack, anti-Hispanic incidents in Hicksville and other cases. The six-week course, financed by the New York Civil Rights Coalition, is free to school districts.
Instructors begin discussing the civil rights movement and black pride and lead the group to dialogues on discrimination, prejudice, stereotypes, sexual harassment and other issues. Bringing in outside instructors who are not emotionally attached to the students allows them to be nonjudgmental, Ms. Bernstein said, and makes it easier to have students talk openly.
Ms. Bernstein added that six districts on the Island had requested the course, which is adapted for each district depending on its population. The programs are expected to begin on the Island in December, she said, adding:
"Theoretically, high school is too late, and we should start prejudice reduction when kids are 3 years old. But the fact is that most visual and verbal expressions of hate come at the high school level, and if we want to put our finger in the dike we must start at the high school level."
A health teacher at Syosset High School, Hilda Ward, said that when some students were recently invited to a workshop of the Martin Luther King Club they looked at it as a free period from classes. But they soon found themselves forced to think about issues, she said, and they were surprised and angry to hear what other people thought of them.
"There were many misperceptions," Ms. Ward said. "These kids realized how they too had misjudged others. The message was you don't have to love me, but at least respect me."

WORKING MEN
Stories.
By Michael Dorris.
286 pp. New York: Henry Holt & Company. $19.95. 
 IT is a cliche about Americans that one of the first things we ask a new acquaintance is "What do you do?" In Europe, the question would be considered unpardonably rude. Michael Dorris taps into this essential aspect of American life, that we are what we do, and most of the stories in "Working Men" center on a moment of self-revelation connected with work.
Mr. Dorris has established a reputation as a novelist ("A Yellow Raft in Blue Water"), nonfiction writer ("The Broken Cord" and essays too numerous to mention) and children's book author ("Morning Girl"). "Working Men" reveals him to be one of the more exciting and gifted American short-story writers as well. These 14 stories demonstrate his skilled and subtle storytelling, roving imagination and embracing humanism.
The stories share a concern with how ripples from the world of work spread into and even define a character's emotional and family lives. Some of the protagonists are inseparable from their labors, their trade the prism through which they view the world: Normand Pasco, in "Qiana," who drives the snowplow in a small New Hampshire town, strays from his comfortable, if unchallenging, marriage into the bed of a woman whose unpredictability "could wake him up like the jolt of a frost heave on an otherwise smooth grade." For others, like Dwayne in "Oui," work is more a matter of happenstance: "I joined the service, re-enlisted twice for lack of a better idea, but when my last two-year hitch in Germany was over, I decided it was time to get on with whatever." Dwayne, who stumbles into a job as a high school French teacher, although he knows only one word in the language (the story's title), is as much defined by his openness to happy accident as others are by professions that fit them like a second skin.
We see that intersection of self and work in "Groom Service" as Bernard, a young American Indian, learns humility, love and the depths of his previously untapped resourcefulness when he is faced with the protracted indifference of his prospective wife's family to his prowess as a hunter. In "Jeopardy," a glib and garrulous traveling salesman discovers -- through the death of his father and the coincidental, unexpected use of one of his products to save a child's life -- that he is lonely and isolated yet connected to "the chain of things . . . a part of the flow, more than I admit, a river that can best be witnessed from very far away."
Collections are rarely even, and there are enough inspired stories in "Working Men" to make the merely well wrought disappointing. (Although "Name Games" pokes witty fun at brand-name fiction and people who mistake designer goods for a life truly lived, the story doesn't rise above its easy target.) There is also a sameness of narrative tone to the stories, although Mr. Dorris is to be lauded for successfully delivering up a wide range of personalities, economic and ethnic backgrounds and historical periods.
The flaws are easily eclipsed by the overall strength of this sensitive and beautifully observed book. The description of pond building by the narrator of "The Benchmark" could equally serve to describe Mr. Dorris's masterly attention to craft: "To start a job, you drive a nail into a peak of ledge, pound it deep, make it your benchmark. . . . Weather patterns can alter, crops grow, houses get built and collapse, but you can return in 50 years and position a tripod, rotate the dials of the spirit until the air bubble precisely crosses the hairline, then aim an alidade at that solitary, centering nail and be in business."
In a lesser writer's hands, this artfulness would be all we would get and the story might offer just another shopworn allegory in which a laborer's craft stands in for the truly arduous work of hauling blocks of words from page to page. A family tragedy has made the narrator of "The Benchmark" aware that the craft he learned from his father won't be passed on to the next generation, that while his "imagination would . . . fill any empty space with water," it is insufficient to fill the gap a favorite son's death has created in his marriage and in his soul. Deeply insightful and generous toward human foibles, this story surprises the reader by veering away from the expected and facing a larger vision that is, on reflection, more accurate. It serves as a fitting bench mark for Mr. Dorris's fine collection.

HEADLINE: Bill, Take a Leaf From J.F.K.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Russell Baker's experience, insight and writing skill combine to cheer his readers when he occasionally turns out a serious column. And so it is with "Make It Bill and Lyndon" (Oct. 9), in which he correctly points out that Bill Clinton's focus on domestic issues matches that of Lyndon Johnson. But Mr. Baker errs when he states that John F. Kennedy "was so absorbed in foreign policy that he seemed to have no domestic policy at all" (until he became active with respect to civil rights). 
 As manifested by a strongly pro-growth tax policy, Kennedy's effective attention to the country's economic needs has been matched by few chief executives, Democrat or Republican. Advised by a splendid economic team (Douglas Dillon, Henry Fowler, Robert Roosa and Paul Volcker at Treasury; Walter Heller, James Tobin and Kermit Gordon at the Council of Economic Advisers), Kennedy moved from day one to promote the saving and investment essential to higher living standards.
(1) In early 1961 J.F.K. called for enactment of an innovative tax credit to promote investment in productive equipment. Congress approved his request (against the lobbying of both Big Labor and Big Business) in 1962.
(2) Secretary Douglas Dillon started his Treasury technicians to work to revise and liberalize business depreciation guidelines. (These two actions alone -- innovative tax credit and depreciation liberalization -- sharply reduced the capital cost of productive investment.)
(3) In January 1963 Kennedy called for a strongly pro-growth general tax cut (what we would now call supply side) on individuals and business. The proposal passed the House before his death and Lyndon Johnson pushed it through the Senate in 1964. The measure cut the top marginal tax rate on individuals from a confiscatory 91 percent to 70 percent, and the rate on the lowest bracket from 20 to 14 percent (shades of Ronald Reagan's Kemp-Roth tax cut in 1981). The corporate rate was cut from 52 to 48 percent, but Kennedy's request to reduce capital gains tax rates was rejected by the Democratic Congress.
The results were an economic policymaker's dream. Saving and productive investment took off, only to be sidetracked in the latter half of the 1960's when, as one observer said, Johnson tried to conquer Vietnam, poverty and space all at once.
The United States did not return to the pro-growth tax track until 1978, when little-known Representatives Jim Jones and Bill Steiger and well-known Senator Russell Long pushed through a bill cutting taxes on saving and investment over Jimmy Carter's objections. Ronald Reagan's massive tax reduction in 1981 may well have gone too far, but it at least temporarily created the most pro-saving and investment tax system in the industrial world. Temporarily because Mr. Reagan blew it all in 1986 by trading the investment tax credit and accelerated depreciation for huge individual tax cuts.
There is an important lesson here for President Clinton. To be sure, his plate is crowded now with health care, trade liberalization and foreign policy problems. But significant tax restructuring for capital formation and fairness should be on the agenda for his first term. If it is not, then his first term may well be his last.

HEADLINE: MISSION IN SOMALIA;
After Supporting Hunt for Aidid, U.S. Is Blaming U.N. for Losses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Despite the Administration's attempts to blame the United Nations for the Somalia crisis, the intensifying military operations there were repeatedly endorsed and sometimes driven by top American officials in the months before the disastrous Army raid on a hostile faction two weeks ago.
Last Thursday, 11 days after 18 American soldiers died in the raid, President Clinton sought to shift responsibility to the United Nations, which took over the Somali operation in the spring. 
 Mr. Clinton said the aggressive effort against the faction leader Mohammed Farah Aidid "never should have been allowed to supplant the political process that was ongoing when we were in effective control, up through last May."
Mr. Clinton has gone so far as to say he was not even aware United States forces were still trying to capture General Aidid.
But while officials and critics are hunting for scapegoats, classified messages between Mogadishu and Washington and interviews with United States policymakers and military officers and with United Nations officials show a more complex picture of a policy with wider support in Washington than the Administration has acknowledged.
The premise of the United Nations policy -- to neutralize General Aidid's power -- was shared by top Administration officials throughout most of the summer, though some were uneasy that the strategy relied too heavily on military force. The United States military at first also supported the policy of confronting General Aidid with force, but later came to doubt that it would be possible to capture him.
Even when the Administration began to rethink its approach in September, it did not tell the United States forces in Somalia under Pentagon control to abandon their hunt for General Aidid. It was under the old standing orders that the Army Rangers launched their attack on Oct. 3.
 
Officials at Odds
 A broad range of interviews disclosed these details of United States policymaking:
*As late as Sept. 6 -- two weeks after the Administration agreed to a plea from military commanders in Somalia to send a battalion of Rangers -- the State Department's liaison office in Mogadishu sent a classified message to Washington seeking more troops. The message alarmed Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, head of the United States Central Command, who sent his own message to Washington dismissing the idea as a hopeless crusade.
*In early summer, the Central Intelligence Agency endorsed the view, held by the United Nations and publicly supported by President Clinton at the time, that General Aidid was a disruptive force who would interfere with the rebuilding of Somalia.
*Using his extensive contacts in Washington, Jonathan Howe, the retired United States admiral who is the special United Nations envoy to Somalia, engaged in what an aide to Defense Secretary Les Aspin called "frenetic and obsessive" lobbying for more forces, culminating in the decision to send the Rangers. The mild-mannered Admiral Howe acknowledged the calls but said he never requested any troops without the agreement of the United Nations and United States military commanders in Somalia.
 
What They Wanted
 "I know there are a lot of people trying to put the finger on me," Admiral Howe said. "I have just been one of the many people involved in the policy, which started with the Security Council. A lot of people were involved in it."
"I never asked for anything that American and Turkish leadership did not want," he added, referring to Lieut. Gen. Cevik Bir of Turkey, the commander of the United Nations troops in Somalia, and Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Montgomery, General Bir's deputy and the senior United States military officer there.
 
In the Beginning, A Focus on Food
 President Bush sent 28,000 troops to Somalia last December for what was to be a short mission to help feed starving Somalis. In retrospect, the Bush Administration seems to have underestimated the problems and overestimated the ability of United Nations peacekeepers to take over the mission after United States troops were withdrawn.
The Bush Administration also had its problems with the United Nations: when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali wanted to disarm the warring clans there, the Bush Administration resisted. Some now say that if disarmament was to be attempted at all, the best time would have been early this year when United States combat strength was at its peak and the United Nations was distributing food, which added to its political leverage.
As the United Nations tried to rebuild Somalia, it sought to reduce the influence of the heavily armed factions. The C.I.A., in an assessment first obtained by Defense Week, a Washington newsletter, seemed to support this track, saying in one unclassified paper that General Aidid was "a threat to peace."
On June 5, forces believed to be under General Aidid's command attacked Pakistani peacekeepers, killing 24 of them.
At the urging of Washington, the Security Council adopted a resolution calling for the arrest of those responsible and for "the disarmament of all Somalia parties." While the resolution did not name General Aidid, Administration officials made it plain that they thought he was responsible.
A week later, United States AC-130 gunships and attack helicopters, supported by other United Nations troops, pounded the clan leader's headquarters and armories. The attacks continued, destroying large amounts of weaponry and a radio station.
When the operation was over, President Clinton proudly declared it a complete success. "The purpose of the operation was to undermine the ability of Aidid to wreak military havoc in Somalia," he said on June 17. "The military back of Aidid has been broken. A warrant has been issued for his arrest."
 
After the Attacks, Calls for Troops
 The military strikes against General Aidid's command center and ammunition caches were not the only steps urged by United Nations and United States field commanders. Admiral Howe and General Montgomery also requested the Delta Force commando unit to hunt for General Aidid.
The Administration initially rebuffed the request, fearing that sending the highly touted commandos would attract too much attention to the effort to capture General Aidid. General Hoar, who supported the attacks on General Aidid's strongholds, opposed a manhunt and told the Pentagon there was only a 1-in-4 chance of catching him, officials said.
Admiral Howe would not take no for an answer. He said in an interview that Washington's initial refusal to approve the request may have made the job more difficult. "Your opportunities change over time," he said. "If we had had the capabilities in June, we would have had a much better chance."
An aide to Mr. Aspin said that beginning in July, Admiral Howe had "adopted Aidid as his Great White Whale" and repeatedly called his contacts in the Administration to request more troops. Admiral Howe acknowledged lobbying for more forces, but said he was merely trying to carry out the Security Council resolution.
Finally, as General Aidid continued his attacks, Admiral Howe's lobbying bore fruit. The Deputies Committee, a panel of sub-Cabinet officials, decided in late August to send the Rangers and a number of Delta commandos.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in a recent interview with The Washington Post that because the policy was being managed by the Deputies Committee, Cabinet-level officials "were not sufficiently attentive."
But senior Administration officials said the decision to send the Rangers was approved by Mr. Clinton, Mr. Aspin, Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.
An aide said that even though General Powell was skeptical about the prospects of capturing General Aidid, he supported the request because his general in Somalia wanted the Rangers.
One day after the Rangers arrived, the Administration began to emphasize a broader political agenda. On Aug. 27, Mr. Aspin called in a speech for more work on the political and economic reconstruction of the country. He also said United States troops would stay in Somalia until violence was quelled, the clans gave up their heavy weapons and a national police was created.
 
Rangers in Place, More Troops Sought
 The Rangers met with mixed success in Somalia: they failed to capture General Aidid but they detained some of his top aides and seized equipment.
To Admiral Howe, who had been saying the United Nations intended to disarm everyone in Mogadishu, it seemed that even more troops were now needed.
He was not alone. On Sept. 6 the Administration received a message from Robert Gosende, the senior United States diplomat in Mogadishu, who wanted more troops to conduct weapons sweeps and urged Washington not to negotiate with General Aidid because he was a terrorist.
An Administration official said another aim behind the request for more troops was to enable United Nations forces to move around the country more freely, demonstrating that General Aidid did not control the country and supporting the political efforts to build a new governing structure.
General Hoar, head of the United States Central Command, was alarmed by the request and sent a strongly worded classified message to Frank G. Wisner, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and to General Powell.
"After four months of operations with extraordinary help from the United States Government, the United Nations' successes have been modest," General Hoar wrote. "A coherent plan which involves the political, humanitarian and security needs for the country has yet to emerge. Control of Mogadishu has been lost."
General Hoar complained that the United Nations favored "facile solutions like, get Aidid and all will be well."
"If the only solution for Mogadishu is large-scale infusion of troops and if the only country available to make this commitment is the United States, then it is time to reassess," he wrote.
By the time General Hoar sent his message, however, senior Administration officials were already reviewing policy toward Somalia with an eye toward encouraging a political solution.
 
Trying to Balance Force and Politics
 But as the Administration sought to move to a political strategy, policy became less clear. Washington was looking for some sort of political settlement but had not yet given up its military approach.
On Sept. 9, United States combat engineers and Pakistani forces were ambushed in Mogadishu and a Pakistani M-48 tank was blown up when it tried to come to the rescue. That day General Montgomery sent a message asking for more firepower -- 4 tanks, 14 armored personnel carriers and a battalion of artillery.
General Hoar supported the request, except for the artillery. So did General Powell. A senior Administration official said General Powell did not argue strongly for the request, but an aide said the general had presented it twice.
Mr. Aspin rejected the request on Sept. 23 because he feared it would emphasize military operations just when Washington was trying to emphasize diplomacy and speed up a withdrawal.
At the same time, Mr. Boutros-Ghali resisted Washington's push for a political strategy, saying establishing security in Somalia was paramount.
Since the Rangers were under United States' command, not United Nations', the Administration could have rescinded their standing orders to try to capture General Aidid. The orders were not rescinded, one senior official said, because Washington had not yet given up the idea of capturing him.
On Oct. 3, the Rangers mounted the raid in which 18 Americans were killed and scores wounded. According to a senior military official, most of the casualties were suffered early in the fighting and could not have been avoided even if Mr. Aspin had approved dispatch of the armor. But military officials agreed that the armor would have improved rescue efforts and limited casualties somewhat.
Of course, if the Rangers had succeeded in capturing General Aidid, the political fallout might have been very different.
"Yes, the United Nations should have focused earlier on political reconciliation in Somalia," one Administration official said. "But all this finger-pointing is unseemly, since no one in the Administration stoutly resisted the main elements of our Somalia policy, including the effort to get Aidid."

HEADLINE: RACES FOR MAYOR FOCUSING ON CRIME

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 14

 BODY:
Pervasive fear of violent crime is dominating mayoral races across the country in a year that is seeing the largest turnover of big-city mayors in more than three decades.
In cities as diverse as Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, Miami and Minneapolis, whether the races pit blacks against blacks, blacks against whites, whites against whites, or involve other ethnic groups, veteran mayors are retiring, and crime is the dominant issue. In cities from New York to Seattle, challengers are using crime as a battering ram to try to unseat incumbents. 
 Political experts say the mayoral races, which are dominating the off-year political landscape, and the rash of retirements both reflect the grim times and diminished expectations in the nation's cities as maintaining order has replaced dreams of minority empowerment or urban innovation.
"There are not a whole lot of subtleties to these races," said David Axelrod, a Chicago-based political consultant whose candidates include Dennis Archer, one of the two candidates bidding to replace Coleman A. Young, who is retiring after 20 years as Detroit's Mayor. "There are fundamental fears, crime being the leading one, among the people who live in cities, and they want someone to address them. Everything else is secondary."
Still, one complication is race, which is an overt issue in the conflict between Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York and a more complex factor in other elections around the nation, including the one in Detroit.
In some cases, the mayoral retirements reflect special circumstances, like Raymond L. Flynn of Boston resigning to become Ambassador to the Vatican. Some decisions, like those of of Mr. Young and Tom Bradley of Los Angeles to give up their jobs after more than two decades in office, reflect age or health concerns. (A conservative businessman, Richard J. Riordan, was elected as mayor of Los Angeles last June.)
But at least as common are the frustrations of running cities in the 1990's, when addressing mounting needs with falling resources is the norm.
 
Jobs Called Greatest Issue
 "The greatest need in our cities is to create jobs, but when you don't get any help from the state or from Washington it's just a very tough time to be a mayor," said John C. Daniels, who is stepping down after four years as Mayor of New Haven. "I think if I had run, I would have won, but I just think the next two years would be some of the same old stuff, just continually fighting and fighting and not really making any accomplishment."
Among other big-city mayors giving up their jobs are Xavier Suarez of Miami, Maynard Jackson of Atlanta, Donald Fraser of Minneapolis, Sophie Masloff of Pittsburgh, James Griffin of Buffalo, James D. Scheibel of St. Paul and Thomas P. Ryan Jr. of Rochester.
Crime is a main issue in the mayoral race in New York, and it is hardly surprising that crime would dominate a race in Detroit, where urban violence has long been prevalent.
Sharon McPhail, a lawyer and administrator in the Wayne County prosecutor's office, who is running with Mr. Young's endorsement, has promised to put an additional 2,000 police officers on the streets, a proposal that many believe will never happen. Mr. Archer calls for a reorganization of the police department that he says would add 380 officers to the streets.
But even in Minneapolis, long a home of sedate, efficient government, voters face an election driven by fears of crime. John Derus, who was voted out last year as Hennepin County Commissioner, came from nowhere to finish second in the primary last month by running a strident law-and-order campaign.
Mr. Derus is in what is judged to be a tight race with the City Council President, Sharon Sayles Belton, in the Nov. 2 election.
"People are interested in being safe in their homes and having their children safe in their schools," said Mr. Derus, who is proposing a 20 percent increase in the number of police officers. "They're really tired of people who want to engineer human behavior by using their tax money."
In most cases, the debate over crime has revolved around who can put the most police on the streets.
In Boston, where a recent spate of highly publicized murders has made crime an especially emotional topic and where a recent front page of The Boston Herald screamed "Gripped by Violence," acting Mayor Thomas M. Menino and State Representative James T. Brett have put forward competing plans to beef up the police.
Mr. Brett, who likes to remind voters that as a state representative he led the fight to ban assault weapons in Boston, has pledged to add 400 new officers. He proposes to pay for them with Federal money and new taxes.
Mr. Menino pledges to add 100 officers to the force every year of his term. He added 45 officers shortly after replacing Mr. Flynn in July and another 65 will join in January. He also wants to consolidate the Boston Police Department, Boston Housing Authority Police and the school police. Both men call for strike forces to go after violent criminals.
Also common are calls for "community-based" policing, which is being advocated by candidates like Ms. McPhail in Detroit and Bill Campbell, the front-runner in Atlanta.
Few doubt that fear of violent crime is a legitimate issue and an overriding fact of life in urban America. But some question whether either the campaign debates or the single-minded focus on law enforcement is likely to be effective in combating it.
 
'Exploit People's Fears'
 "The politicians, and that's going on in our city, too, are trying to exploit people's fears to get elected," said Mr. Fraser, the current Minneapolis Mayor, who is supporting Mr. Derus's opponent. "But everyone in police work knows that's not the long-term answer, and even in the short term it won't have much impact."
Of Mr. Derus, he said, "We've got a guy running here who whether the issue is infant mortality, teen pregnancy, school dropouts or unemployment, his answer is more cops."
In some cities, particularly New York, the crime issue has exacerbated racial ones, and experts say it clearly has the power to hurt black politicians, whether a vulnerable one like Mr. Dinkins in New York or a generally popular one like Norman Rice in Seattle.
But in other cities, the political tie between crime and race is no longer clear. In Atlanta and Detroit, where all the candidates are black, the issue is as potent as in Boston, where the candidates are white. In Detroit, race has been injected into the campaign by Ms. McPhail and her supporters, who have tried to follow in Mr. Young's tradition by painting her as the candidate of urban blacks and her opponent as the candidate favored by suburban whites.
"Voters want a mayor who will shuffle when he's not going anywhere, scratch when he's not itching and grin when he's not tickled," the Rev. Charles Adams said at a prayer breakfast for Ms. McPhail this week. "But I want a tough mayor."
But in a city with problems as desperate as Detroit's it remains to be seen if the strategy, which extends down to Ms. McPhail's "You Go, Girl," a street-slang slogan for "go get 'em," will override more pragmatic judgments.
"Quite frankly, 'You Go, Girl,' gets on my nerves," said Michelle Brown, the business manager of the Michigan Catholic newspaper, who is supporting Mr. Archer. "If I wanted a home girl that's fine, but I want a mayor."
Despite the nation's urban problems, not all incumbent mayors are in trouble. Michael White in Cleveland and Bob Lanier in Houston are among those rated as shoo-ins for re-election. Many of the retirees, like Mr. Jackson in Atlanta, would have been in the same position had they run.
Their relative popularity reflects the fact that despite a high level of frustration, many voters know there are no quick fixes for the cities.
That could mean the tough talk on crime and the promises to radically improve law enforcement will not win elections unless people have reason to believe the claims.
 
 
 
MAYOR'S RACES IN THE BIG CITIES
 BOSTON: Thomas M. Menino, who was appointed to replace Ray Flynn as Mayor when Mr. Flynn resigned to become ambassador to the Vatican, faces State Representative James Brett in contest dominated by crime and education issues.

 MIAMI: Steve Clark, the former Mayor of Dade County; Miriam Alonso, a former City Council member, and Willard Fair, an Urban League leader, are competing in a race dominated by crime issues and personal attacks.

 MINNEAPOLIS: John Derus, a former Hennepin County Commissioner, faces City Council President Sharon Sayles Belton in a race that has been dominated by Mr. Derus' acerbic law and order campaign.

 DETROIT: Dennis Archer, a former Michigan Supreme Court Justice who has strong business backing, faces Sharon McPhail, a lawyer and county prosecutor's office administrator backed by outgoing Mayor Coleman Young, in the race to succeed Mr. Young.

 ATLANTA: Two City Council members, Bill Campbell and Myrtle Davis, and a former County Commission chairman, Michael Lomax, are bidding to succeed Maynard Jackson and preside over the 1996 Olympics in a race dominated by crime issues.

HEADLINE: New Immigrants Test Nation's Heartland

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, Kan.

 BODY:
Its milky white sky sits squat on the plains, a horizon unbroken but for grain elevators and water towers. At a feed yard off Old Highway 83, cowboys gallop into the noonday sun, fringed chaps slapping their thighs. Blond girls practice cheerleading jumps on square lawns adorned by pumpkins. Near a central intersection, a large sign says simply: Have a Nice Day.
That is Garden City at first sight, stereotypical Kansas, wheatlands and cattle pens and rosy cheeks. But before long, a second reality grows apparent. There is a tortilla factory on Main Street, a Laotian market offering Thai videos on Fulton Street. At dawn, hundreds of immigrants and refugees file into Slaughter Employee Parking at a giant meat-packing plant.
 
'A Little New York City'
 At nightfall, while locals head to the Grain Bin for Texas two-step dancing, Mexican immigrants crowd into Saigon, a Vietnamese-run karaoke bar, and Southeast Asians pack the Pho Hoa One Restaurant, where the fish sauce and lemon grass are plentiful. 
 Multiculturalism has come to the heartland, especially to this cow town in the short grass and sand-sage prairie of southwest Kansas. In the direct center of the country -- 1,640 miles from the Atlantic and 1,625 from the Pacific -- Garden City offers an ideal case study of the many forces at work as the latest wave of immigration spills over into the Middle West.
"We've become a little New York City in the land of Dorothy, Toto and Auntie Em," said Roxy Thompson, an elementary school teacher here.
As in New York City, Los Angeles and Miami, immigration into the heartland is a story of conflict and accommodation. But in places that have never known much racial and ethnic diversity, foreignness in and of itself is an issue. Since so many immigrants to the heartland are uncertain whether they are just passing through or will stay, the towns cannot tell if their young, tentative ethnic communities are a temporary challenge or a historic transformation of identity.
In the last 13 years, after the biggest beef-packing plant in the world opened here, Garden City's population has grown by 42 percent to about 25,500. Most of the newcomers -- who work grueling jobs as bleeders, tail rippers, flankers, head droppers, gutters and horn sawers -- are Hispanic and Southeast Asian immigrants and refugees.
The immigrants have made the town worldly while shaking its stability. They have ushered in an era of growth while contributing to an increase in crime and drop-out rates. Privately, ethnic antagonism simmers. But publicly it rarely finds a voice, because newcomers and old-timers live, work and play in worlds that barely intersect.
 
Packing Plants Draw Wave of Immigrants
 Eight years ago, Marcial Cervantes, the Mexican-born son of a migrant miner, met a packing company recruiter at an unemployment office in New Mexico. A day later, with the guarantee of a $6.70-an-hour job in Garden City, he and his newlywed wife crammed their belongings into a 1966 G.M.C. pickup and hit the highway for a place he assumed would be "100 percent guero," -- fair-haired, blue-eyed American.
But in his first day on the kill floor, Mr. Cervantes looked around with amazement.
"I hadn't seen so many mexicanos since I left Mexico in 1976," he said.
Immigrants do not end up in the heartland by chance. They are either plopped here by the Federal Government's refugee resettlement program or lured by jobs in increasingly industrialized rural America. Meat-packing plants, in particular, have cut costs by moving away from unionized cities and closer to the feed yards in areas antagonistic to unions.
When IBP Inc., one of the nation's major food-processing companies, made such a move to just outside Garden City in 1980, the town was typically heartland. About 16 percent of the residents were descendants of the Mexicans who came to work in the early 1900's on the railroads and in the sugar-beet harvest, but only about 2 percent of the residents were foreign-born.
Unemployment stood at about 3 percent as IBP set out to hire 2,850 people and another plant began to double its work force to about 1,400.
"At first, IBP tried to recruit all our people from Nebraska and Iowa," said Duane West, a retired lawyer and former city commissioner. "But the simple fact is that this is hard, tough work, and farm boys just didn't want it."
The Mexicans, Salvadorans, Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians who showed up to do the plant's dirty work presented no economic threat. In fact, the town offered IBP a decade's worth of tax breaks, and issued $100 million in bonds to help finance construction. The meat-packing plants were seen as the key to future prosperity, and that set the tone for the polite reception the thousands of new immigrants received.
Garden City is a town that prides itself on civility.
"Basically, there isn't anyone here with the intestinal fortitude to raise heck," Mr. West said. "Sometimes, when you do speak out, people look at you like you're crazier than a pet coon. This really isn't a clash-y kind of community,"
Still, while conflict has been kept to a minimum, so has contact between the old-timers and the newcomers.
"Except for driving down the streets, I don't much notice them immigrants," Greg Ayers, a 37-year-old cowboy, said. "But now, my boy, he's in the second grade and he probably has more Mexican friends than Americans, and they're, well, just buds."
 
Transients Challenge The Staid Heartland
 The Garden City area's past claims to fame were the 1959 murder of the Clutter family in outlying Holcomb (immortalized in Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood") and the nation's largest free concrete municipal swimming pool. Now Garden -- as its residents call it -- is renowned not only as the state's fastest-growing town, but also as its most cosmopolitan one.
Where else in Kansas would a 10-year-old girl born in Laos and raised in a refugee camp in Thailand proudly declare that she, Sopha Bounthasen, loved America and her favorite American food: "Tacos!"
At least 20 percent of the town is now foreign born -- compared with 7.9 percent nationally -- and 40 percent is nonwhite. New immigrants keep arriving, many from California and Texas. Some are recruited by relatives, who are paid a small bounty by the plants. Some come without any job guarantees, gambling that life is easier in Kansas.
Bob Ma, a Vietnamese refugee, and his wife, Elba, a Mexican, met in Los Angeles, where they lived from hand to mouth on their earnings in construction and garment jobs. Now, after six months at IBP here, they own a used van and have made a down payment on the trailer they share with their son, Richard. The trailer is already home, with a new videocassette recorder in one corner, a shrine of apples and incense to Mr. Ma's mother in another.
"Over there, in L.A., it's too wild and expensive," said Mr. Ma, 29."Over here, it's boring but it's better. The kids play outside on the street, and you don't worry about gangs and drugs. And you don't got to stay forever. You can save up and move on."
Indeed, the immigrant population has proved to be a transient one, in part because turnover in the hazard-ridden packing industry is so high, averaging about 7 percent a month, said Donald Stull, a University of Kansas anthropologist.
Tracking new students entering the school system in 1986, a study by Dr. Stull for the Ford Foundation found that only a third remained in town two years later.
A rare few immigrants have made a commitment to Garden City, among them, Donald T. To, the town's first Vietnamese insurance agent, who started in the plants nine years ago. "I'm trying to put down roots in this area," he said.
But many more cannot see their lives here beyond the immediate future. "If they can get out and be their own boss, that's a goal," said Levita Rohlman, refugee services director here for the United States Catholic Conference. "So there is a lot of out-migration to Texas, Hawaii, Louisiana."
The police chief, Roger A. Schroeder holds the newcomers' transience -- especially the movement of young, single males -- partly responsible for the 54 percent increase in violent crimes between 1987 and 1992.
But, paradoxically, the transience has also worked to keep tensions low. Absorbed in their six-day-a-week jobs with no plans for a future here, many immigrants lead a wholly separate life that does not threaten the town's traditional identity.
Indeed, despite all the change, despite the publication of a Spanish-language weekly by The Garden City Telegram, despite the Vietnamese-language mass at St. Dominic's Church, despite the new Buddhist temple, there is surprising constancy.
The town is still perfumed by dung. It is still adorned by a 40-year-old sign advising, "Eat Beef, Stay Slim." It still counts only one Asian police officer, and one Hispanic and one Asian teacher in core courses at the high school. And its power still lies in the hands of an elite of old-timers who mix little with the immigrants who tend to live and work on the edge of town.
And sometimes it is the immigrants themselves who keep things segregated. Recently, 75 Laotians put down $5,000 each toward a 120-acre lot that they intend to convert into a "Laotown" if the city permits.
 
A Gracious Facade Masks Latent Biases
 One recent afternoon, Bountome Pheuahakphay, who swam the Mekong River to escape his homeland in 1984, parked his U-Haul in East Garden Village, a mobile home park built for packing-house workers. Mr. Pheuahakphay had arrived the previous night from Fresno, where, despite an engineering degree, he had lived off public assistance.
One night, in Fresno, he had met a Laotian from Garden City, who was in California to persuade welfare-dependent refugees to start over again in the heartland, moving at taxpayer expense as part of a Federal program.
"We tell them, 'We guarantee that if you listen to us you will save $12,000 to $15,000 a family your first year,' " said Roger Vilaysing, executive director of the Southeast Asian Mutual Assistance Association here. "We tell them, 'It's easy job, meat-packing, if you know how to sharpen your knife.' We tell them, 'In Garden City, the kids see parents work hard, want to please parents, obey parents. Not like in California.' "
Mr. Pheuahakphay had nothing to lose, and neither did Oudom Vongphakdy, another Laotian from Fresno. Mr. Vongphakdy, however, was somewhat unsettled by his first glimpse of East Garden's flat, unwooded acres on the outskirts of town. "This looks just like a refugee camp," he said.
In 1987, several years after East Garden Village opened, a new elementary school was built nearby. Victor Ornelas Elementary was known "with a lot of animosity as that school for those kids," said Ms. Thompson, a teacher there. When the school district proposed busing some white children there, parents rebelled. It was as close as Garden City has come to a public confrontation over the town's changing population.
Now, the 6-year-old school, spacious and modern, has a devoted staff that prides itself on adapting to an America that defies the Norman Rockwell image of their childhood. A kindergarten teacher joked recently about preparing a bulletin board of student self-portraits, where crayon-drawn faces were decorated with colored yarn for hair.
"It's not like the old days," said the teacher, Linda Walker. "I didn't need much yellow yarn, as you can see."
Officially, from the police chief to the grocery store manager who stocks chilies and peanut sauces in staggering varieties, the town sees its cultural diversity as an asset. Townspeople proudly distinguish Garden City from neighboring Dodge City.
Recently, the chairwoman of the Dodge City Commission, Laura Carlson, was quoted in the local paper comparing illegal immigrants to cockroaches: "If you spray for them there, they only end up here." She said she had been misunderstood, but her comment nurtured latent xenophobia, prompting one newspaper letter announcing the formation of a citizen's militia.
Although such public outbursts are not Garden City's style, ethnic animosity does exist -- in muttered remarks behind closed doors about the "wetbacks" and the "gooks," about Wal-Mart turning into "Wal-Mex."
Penney Schwab, Western Kansas director for the United Methodist Care Centers, said: "If you were able to take a secret poll here, you'd find a lot of closet Laura Carlsons who have been careful to keep their mouth shut. Garden is not perfect, just polite."

HEADLINE: City Seeks to Grow by Disappearing

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Like other big city mayors, W. W. Herenton of Memphis was concerned that employers were fleeing to the suburbs and that white city residents were fleeing as well. But Mr. Herenton recently took a gamble that few other mayors would take: he proposed that his city merge with the suburbs in surrounding Shelby County.
To be sure, suburban officials are wary about the proposal. For one thing, said the Mayor of one suburban city, Germantown, Charles Salvaggio, no suburban political leaders were included on a committee that Mr. Herenton appointed on Oct. 12 to look into the legal issues in such a merger. 
 In addition, Mr. Salvaggio said, Mr. Herenton was vague about what would happen to the predominantly black city school system and the predominantly white county school system. Two years ago, Mr. Salvaggio said, an effort to merge the two school systems foundered, largely because of opposition from the suburbs.
Mr. Herenton, the first black mayor of Memphis, did find some mild support for his suggestion among business leaders in Memphis, who maintain that a merger would lessen the tax burden they now carry. But many black officials said the suggestion had all the attractiveness of "A Modest Proposal" by Swift, in which he suggests, albeit satirically, that citizens solve their overpopulation problem by eating their young.
 
Opposition in City
 "For me personally, this idea was dead on arrival," said Jerome Rubin, one of six black members of the 13-member Memphis City Council. "This would mean a dilution of the black voting strength here and giving up some of the political control we have fought for for so long."
What was particularly curious to some black political leaders was that the proposal came from a man whose election two years ago came by the slimmest of margins -- 142 votes.
"The black citizens of Memphis have been deprived of political power for so long and there is an understandable jubilation at my election as mayor," Mr. Herenton said, acknowledging in an interview the poor reception his idea of merger has had among blacks. But, he added, "I have an obligation to look down the road to see that we don't end up like other cities have."
Outside Memphis some urban economists and experts on regionalization said they saw Mr. Herenton's proposal as a welcome, but surprising, echo of a kind of thinking that flourished in the early 1960's.
 
Idea Stalled by Realities
 At that time, the talk was of better allocation of resources in metropolitan areas, and such consolidations were seen as magic pills that would cure some ills born of urbanization. Cities like Indianapolis, Nashville and Jacksonville, Fla., embraced a metropolitan form of government.
But the idea ran into the political reality of established government structures, as well as suburban whites jealously guarding their racially and economically homogenous enclaves and urban blacks benefiting from a rising tide of political power.
"The way American politics is set up, it encourages a kind of defensive localism that runs counter to consolidation," said Margaret Weir, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. "But this is a bold gamble by Herenton, and if he wins, he is going to mayor of someplace that has resources to work with."
David Rusk, a consultant and author of "Cities Without Suburbs" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), said that while "it is not a sinking ship, Memphis has sprung some leaks" in recent years, much as Detroit, Cleveland and Newark had at one time. An opening to the suburbs, he said, was the only real alternative for such cities.
 
Barriers to Annexation
 In the 40 years from 1940 to 1980, Memphis managed through annexation of suburbs to capture 54 percent of the population growth in its metropolitan area, picking up new taxable properties and middle-income subdivisions. But by 1980, annexation became a more difficult and litigious process, and it virtually stopped.
Consequently, in the last decade Memphis lost 36,000 people, or nearly 6 percent of its 1980 population of 646,000. By contrast, the population of surrounding Shelby County more than doubled to 215,000 people from 1970 to 1990. Total jobs in Memphis declined slightly over the decade while they more than doubled in Shelby County.
These were some of the grim trends that greeted Mayor Herenton when he came into office nearly two years ago and a large part of why he said he had been forced to raise taxes each year. While the city is holding on now, he said, analysts project that the city will face a budget deficit of nearly $50 million in three years.
At the same time, Lakeland, a city of 12,000, moved to annex a mostly white, unincorporated area between it and Memphis, which the larger city sought to annex. Lakeland countered with a lawsuit that was supported by a suit by the more than 10,000 residents of the area to be annexed.
 
Sharp Change of Course
 That was when Mayor Herenton made his proposal to consider consolidation rather than the slow, piecemeal annexation route to expanding the city's tax base.
Mr. Herenton said he did not know what measures the city could legally take in a drive to consolidation, but he named a committee of lawyers, state legislators and others to look at the options, which could include a direct vote in the city and county, the city's surrender of its charter or some entirely new route.
Lest anyone think that he was surrendering politically, Mr. Herenton, who before being elected mayor served as the city's first black school superintendent, made it clear that if the city and county consolidated, he would quickly declare himself a candidate to lead the new municipal entity.
He reasoned that the entire county was 44 percent black, and that that percentage could increase over the next eight years, possibly making Memphis the first area with a metropolitan government to have a black majority. If that did not happen, he said, he believed that he could put together the right combination of black and white support to win.
He noted with some satisfaction that whatever the gaps in his proposals, he had at least started people thinking and talking about the idea and looking at the city's future.
"If we can't employ some sort of consolidation to recapture our tax base, then we will go back to using annexation," he said. "But in the end I believe that the progressive cities of the future will be those that will not allow the growth of the suburbs to strip them of their own potential for growth."
The proposal's supporters are largely white business leaders and white middle-class residents of Memphis, although most have decided to remain on the sidelines for now.
J. R. (Pitt) Hyde, the chairman and chief executive of AutoZone Inc., a Memphis-based chain operating more than 800 auto parts stores in 23 states, said that in many ways the fate of the idea is largely dependent on Mr. Herenton and his perseverance and political standing.
"Herenton has the confidence of a good percentage of the white community and business community," Mr. Hyde said, "and he is perhaps the person who can head off fears among blacks about the dilution of power. It is no small feat, but he may be the unique individual to bring this off."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF IN HAITI;
Terror of Duvalier Years Is Haunting Haiti Again

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 17

 BODY:
When President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled in 1986 after a popular uprising, Haitians thought for sure that they had rid themselves of the family dynasty that ruled the country with a tight grip for 29 years.
But the Duvalierists, once operating clandestinely, are now out in the open, in a sort of recurring nightmare. In the last month, several military-backed political organizations have been formed with the common goal of preventing the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President, who was ousted two years ago in a violent coup. 
 Haitian political analysts and foreign diplomats say these groups have mounted a campaign of intimidation and terror, exemplified by the shooting of Justice Minister Guy Malary, who was killed in broad daylight last week, along with his chauffeur and a bodyguard.
But Emmanuel Constant, a leader of the Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress, an organization suspected of being behind some of the killings, denies any involvement.
 
'We Want Peace and Stability'
 "The violence comes from the clashing of the extreme political ideologies," Mr. Constant said. "We want peace and stability. We want to care for our sick and we want to teach our young."
Mr. Constant said his organization had used only traditional means of protest, like strikes and marches, to express opposition to Father Aristide. While Mr. Constant's organization and other groups like it are given police escorts when they call a protest, supporters of Father Aristide are routinely beaten when they try to congregate.
For example, Antoine Izmery, a wealthy businessman and supporter of Father Aristide, was shot and killed at St. Jean Bosco Church, Father Aristide's old parish, after refusing to cancel a church service mourning the anniversary of a massacre.
 
'Mockery of Patriotism'
 On Saturday, when another shadowy group called for a night of "patriotic mourning" and a demonstration at Haiti's largest public square, the Champ Mars, only a lavalas, or torrential rain, dampened the rally, which was sparsely attended.
"They are perpetrating a huge fraud," said Jocelyn McCalla, executive director of the National Coalition for the Haitian Refugees, in New York. "They are not fooling anyone in Haiti. They are making a mockery of patriotism. They're trying to cast themselves as the symbol of democracy."
While leaders of these groups have told foreign journalists in Haiti that they are not Duvalierists, they have given interviews to Haitian journalists welcoming followers of the Duvaliers into their groups.
The Duvalier reign began in 1957 after the election of Francois Duvalier, known as Papa Doc. He proclaimed himself President-for-Life in 1964. After his death, his son, Jean-Claude, called Baby Doc, inherited the title and presided until 1986.
Francois Duvalier's deeply conservative ideology, which he called Duvalierism, began as an effort to uplift Haiti's black masses but quickly reached a social pact with the lighter-skinned elite. It justifies total control over the state by a single party and the use of violence to perpetuate its power.
To carry this out, Mr. Duvalier developed the Tontons Macoute, a paramilitary group using illiterate peasants, responsible only to him and armed them with weapons. Their trademark attire was denim shirt and pants and dark glasses.
 
Sign of Terror: Red Bandanas
 The new group of armed civilians are also illiterate peasants, but they wear civilian clothes and red bandanas around their necks. Called attaches, the carry out terror under the command of the city's police chief, Lieut. Col. Joseph Michel Francois.
An attache who gave his name only as Raymond said he had joined the group because he believed that Father Aristide had sold Haiti to foreigners. Until a month ago, he said, he was unemployed but now he is paid $40 to $50 a week. Raymond, a lanky 29-year-old, said his work was "to protect the sovereignty of the nation."
In a 30-minute interview at a downtown restaurant, Raymond spoke in monotone and gave what seemed to be well-rehearsed responses to questions.
 
With the Aid of Lobbyists
 "Aristide is a criminal," he said when asked why he did not like him. "He wanted to burn people alive."
While Raymond's answers may be simple, the leaders of the political organizations, who control the attaches, are sophisticated and have studied in the United States and Canada.
They have carefully cultivated lobbyists and politicians to feed doubts about Father Aristide.
"He speaks like a sheep, but he acts like a wolf," Reynold Georges, a leader of one organization, the Alliance for the Liberation and Advancement of Haiti, said about the deposed President.

HEADLINE: MISSION IN SOMALIA;
Amid Cheers for Pilot, Tears for Dead

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLARKSVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 17

 BODY:
Along the road leading to the entrance to Fort Campbell, the signs in front of dozens of businesses read "Welcome Home Michael Durant, NSDQ." In this most military of towns, only an outsider and the uninitiated had to ask what NSDQ meant, and when they did, the answer was uttered like some magical incantation.
"N.S.D.Q. are the initials of the motto of the 160th, Mike's unit," said Loretta South, the wife of another member of the unit. "The unit is called the Night Stalkers and the motto is 'Night Stalkers don't quit.' " 
 The joy of Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant's return home late Saturday from 11 days as a hostage in Somalia was still fresh today, although the mood was more somber and meditative than it was amid the flag waving and cheering of the night before.
 
Mindful of Other Casualties
 Many of the people leaving church services were mindful not only of the Durant family, but of the families of those still stationed in Somalia and the families of eight Fort Campbell soldiers who died in Mogadishu.
"A yellow ribbon is not enough for them," said the wife of one soldier who is still in Somalia as she stood with glistening eyes outside of Bethel United Methodist Church. "President Clinton called the Durants, but he didn't call the families of those who died," said the woman, who asked not to be quoted by name. "A crisis is over for the Durants, but those other families' crisis will go on and on."
Balancing the joy at return and sadness of loss is tricky in places like Clarksville (population 70,000) and Hopkinsville, Ky., (population 27,000), the two communities bordering Fort Campbell. Maj. Gen. John M. Keane, commander of the installation, said having a hero in Michael Durant was important because "it lets us take a burden off our shoulders and feel genuinely good about something."
 
Puts Arms Around a Widow
 But he said he had made it a point during the jubilation on Saturday night to speak to a widow of one of the soldiers who died in the fighting in which Mr. Durant was injured and "put my arms around her and tell her how much I respected her and her courage for being there."
There are more than 25,000 military men and women at Fort Campbell, which is the home of the 101st Air Assault Division, or the Screaming Eagles, as well as Mr. Durant's 160th Special Operations Regiment, many of whose missions are secret. There are also 35,000 relatives as well as 42,000 military retirees, said George Heath, a spokesman for Fort Campbell.
Because there is housing for only 4,200 or so on the base, most of the soldiers and their families live off the base. More than 4,000 children of military personnel attend local public schools. Many of the wives, Lorrie Durant among them, teach in those schools. The base payroll contributes $897 million a year to the local economy.
The euphoria was just too much for some here. Amy Jo Nichols-Redman chose not to go to the welcome home for Mr. Durant, she said, not because he did not deserve it, but rather because it brought back too vividly memories of December 1985, when her husband was among the 248 Fort Campbell troops who died when a plane carrying them home from a Middle East peacekeeping mission crashed near Gander, Newfoundland.
Ms. Nichols-Redman, who is active in military family support programs, recalled going to the airfield then to welcome home others who were not on the plane. She went bravely, caught up in the relief of others, but it all felt awful, she said. She said that during Saturday's events, she kept asking herself, what about the widows?
 
A Memorial Service
 "We had a memorial service for the dead last week while Michael was still a captive, and I remember running into a 12-year-old boy whose father died about eight months ago over there," she said. "He said to me that he hoped Michael Durant got freed, but also said that nobody remembered his dad's name. So I just couldn't go the other night."
It all troubled the Rev. Phil Ross, pastor of New Provident United Methodist Church, where the Durants are members. But today Mr. Ross said he, like General Keane, had found his answer to the problem of sorrow amid celebration late Saturday night at the Durants' home.
He saw some widows of those killed in Somalia stop to visit members of the Durant family. "If they can embrace Lorrie and celebrate even after their loss of loved ones, then we all should be able to," he said.

HEADLINE: Despite U.S. Urging, Arab Lands Hold Firm to Their Israel Boycott

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Diplomats said today that the 43-year-old Arab ban on commercial and financial ties with Israel would not be lifted anytime soon and that the official blacklist of foreign companies that do business with Israel might even be expanded at the urging of hard-line countries.
Arab League officials are to meet in Damascus on Oct. 24 to discuss increasing the blacklist despite appeals from United States officials, who argue that the boycott of 10,000 companies should be lifted soon to add momentum to Middle East peace talks. 
 Assistant Secretary of State Edward P. Djerejian told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Friday in Washington that the Arab blacklist was "totally unacceptable."
 
The Wrong Direction
 He said the Clinton Administration had told several Arab countries, including Syria, that adding companies to the list "would be a step, obviously, in the wrong direction" after the signing of an accord last month by Israel and the Palestinians.
But Arab diplomats in Damascus and Cairo said that hard-line Arab countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya were seeking to widen the boycott, in part because they were unhappy with the accord.
"Any lifting or alteration of the boycott," said a senior Arab diplomat, "would have to be unanimous, and since unanimity is impossible, it will remain in force."
 
States Set Conditions
 Even moderate Arab governments like Saudi Arabia's, which is struggling to contain strong Islamic militant movements, are reluctant to support a repeal because they do not want to give ammunition to their Islamic hard-line critics, the diplomats said. Militant Islamic groups have denounced the pact on self-rule in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho as a sellout that compromises Palestinians' interests.
Several Arab officials said they would be reluctant to give up the boycott as long as Israel has nuclear weapons, continues to occupy Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon and fails to reach an agreement with its neighbors on sharing scarce water.
The boycott was adopted by Arab countries in 1950 to isolate and cripple Israel. The Arab League operates a Boycott Office in Damascus where Arab representatives are to meet this month to consider adding new companies to the list, the Arab diplomats in Cairo and Damascus said. During its last meeting, on May 1, the Boycott Office added 13 new companies to the list, including Rubbermaid and General Dynamics.
"It is too soon to talk about lifting the boycott," Fahem bin Sultan al-Qasimi, the Secretary General of the Gulf Cooperation Council, was quoted today as saying by the Arabic daily Al Hayat.
 
Three Aspects
 The boycott includes a ban on commercial activity with Israel and a "secondary boycott" that blacklists companies doing business in Israel. A tertiary boycott targets companies dealing with blacklisted companies.
The Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce estimates that the boycott has cost the country $20 billion in lost exports and $16 to $32 billion in lost investment. But Arab officials contend that the losses are probably much smaller because of Arab violations of the ban. Saudi Arabia, along with other Arab states, already ignores the boycott when it is commercially convenient, these officials said.
Israel sells agricultural products, furniture and electrical appliances, valued at several hundred million dollars a year, to Arab countries -- including Lebanon, Libya and Iraq -- through third countries, including Greece and Cyprus, Arab diplomats and Israeli officials say.
Most gulf countries buy weapons from American companies that are also Israel's main military suppliers. "When it is in the Arab interest, they turn a blind eye to the sanctions," said Harry Wall, director of the Israeli Office of the Anti-Defamation League, in a telephone interview from Jerusalem.
Ford, General Dynamics, General Electric, Hilton, General Motors, Coca-Cola, Hertz and Avis are among the companies that do business with Israel and some Arab countries. Most major international banks and large financial institutions, however, refuse to do business with Israel because of a fear of Arab restrictions.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said in 1991 that he would push for an end to the "secondary boycott" or blacklist if the Israeli Government, then led by Yitzhak Shamir, stopped building settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But the proposal was never accepted by other Arab nations.
"It was refused by Shamir at the time," Mr. Mubarak said in a recent interview.
Israel's current Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, has said that he will not link the lifting of the boycott to the current autonomy negotiations with the Palestinians.
"Israel cannot at present demand the lifting of the boycott as a condition for talks with the Palestinians," Mr. Rabin said last week.
 
Seen as an Insult
 But Israeli organizations that have tried to fight the boycott said the move was a slap in the face to Israel.
"The continuation of the boycott, the most tangible symbol of the refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist, is incompatible with the goal of the peace process," Mr. Wall said.
The determination to extend the boycott has stirred anger in many Western nations and in Japan. The leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations called last summer at a meeting in Tokyo for an end to the boycott.
Some Arab states, including Kuwait, have already officially eased restrictions on companies that do business in Israel.
Even Egypt, which has been at peace with Israel since 1979, has failed to develop significant trade links with its neighbor, despite numerous commercial agreements.

MIDEAST PEACE TALKS DELAYED
 JERUSALEM, Sept. 17 (Reuters) -- The United States has told Israel that the next round of Middle East peace talks will probably be postponed until the end of November, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
The talks were expected to resume in late October, but an Israeli official said the reason for the delay was a Syrian threat on Saturday not to attend unless Israel was willing to make progress.

HEADLINE: Turks' War With Kurds Reaches a New Ferocity

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, Oct. 15

 BODY:
One year after Turkish generals said they had broken the spine of a Kurdish separatist insurgency in these wild and remote uplands, the war has become more violent and more intractable than ever before.
Since the breakdown in May of a cease-fire declared by the rebel movement, the avowedly Marxist Kurdish Workers Party, more than 1,600 people, many of them civilians, have died, the Government says. That toll amounts to the worst wave of killing in a nine-year war that has claimed more than 7,400 lives and raised fundamental questions about the stability of an area central to regional American policy. 
 The fighting in the hidden war is murky, depicted in the mutually exclusive versions of both sides as either a liberation struggle championing Kurdish rights or outright terrorism. Death tolls, battles and guerrilla attacks in the remote southeastern region are difficult to verify, particularly because of glaring discrepancies in the reports.
[In yet another battle, Turkish troops killed 12 Kurdish guerrillas in a shootout Sunday in Lice, in Diyarbakir province, according to a statement from the regional governor's office. No details were disclosed, and there was no announcement from the Kurdish side.]
Nonetheless, the accounts of Government officials, Kurdish nationalists and diplomats in Ankara suggest that the antagonists are locked in an accelerating spiral of violence, from the torching of villages and kidnappings of Westerners to slayings of civilians and street killings.
The ferocity of the attacks has left the United States and other Western allies of Turkey wondering whether the war can ever be ended without political concessions and a major shift from what the Government in Ankara calls "total warfare."
 
A Popular Insurgency
 "The United States point is that this is an approach that can be predicted to fail if you look at it in exclusively military terms," a Western diplomat in Ankara said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "This is now a popular insurgency," the diplomat said.
But Western governments do not press that argument with the American-armed Turks, in part because they agree with Ankara's depiction of the rebels as terrorists. Equally important, Turkey is a NATO ally playing a crucial role in keeping up economic and military pressure on President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
The rebel movement touches an extremely raw nerve for the Turkish Government, which sees the war as an outright challenge to the very cornerstone of the state -- the model of linguistic, cultural and political unity championed by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the republic.
 
Redefining the Problem
 "No country will shake the hands of those who want to divide the country through killing or terrorism," Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said in an interview before he left with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on her trip to meet with President Clinton and legislators.
"Some of our friends think we have a problem between Turkish and Kurdish citizens," Mr. Cetin said, but "the problem is between the security forces and the killing organization -- the terrorism groups. Turkey is a democratic country and in a democratic country terrorism cannot be tolerated whatever its aim."
Between 10 million and 12 million people, about a fifth of the nation's population, are Kurds. While Turkish leaders permit the publication of Kurdish-language newspapers and acknowledge what they term a "Kurdish reality," the Government does not allow the Kurds to use their own language in schools or in broadcasting, or acknowledge a separate Kurdish national identity. Kurds, who are largely Sunni Muslims, enjoy the same political rights as other Turks but may not express them in a Kurdish linguistic, political or regional context.
For many people in this southeastern region, such restrictions are part of the basic grievance of Kurdish nationalists: while many Kurds probably do not wish to secede from Turkey, as the insurgents do, their identity as a people is denied. The war, though, has brought them neither progress nor hope.
 
Very Bleak Picture

 "The people have had enough," said Fathi Gumus, a Kurdish lawyer and chairman of the bar association here. "The war is bloodier than ever. Both sides are getting rougher and rougher. The picture is very bleak."
The country's Kurds are the largest of the Kurdish populations who live uneasily in Iraq, Iran and Syria, as well as in Turkey.
Up to a half of Turkey's Kurds have emigrated west from their mountainous homelands seeking jobs or peace. But those who have stayed behind have faced the growing violence between some 150,000 Turkish troops, militiamen and the police and an estimated 10,000 guerrillas operating from bases inside Turkey with support from Syria, Iraq, Iran and, according to Turkish officials, Armenia.
The Government in Ankara has long believed that if its armed forces could sever the ties between the rebels and Turkey's hostile neighbors, the battle would be all but won.
 
Rebel Cease-Fire Offered
 A year ago, therefore, Ankara enlisted the tacit support of Kurds in northern Iraq, who have depended on Turkey for their survival since the Persian Gulf war, in a campaign of air strikes and infantry advances against Turkish Kurds who were operating in part from bases just across the border. The Turkish military declared it had dealt the rebels a lethal blow, and when a Syrian-based guerrilla leader, Abdullah Ocalan, offered to stop fighting in March, the move seemed to reinforce Turkey's view.
"The Turkish view was that they had them on the ropes," the diplomat in Ankara said. "If they were on the ropes, then they have rebounded now."
Since the rebels called off the cease-fire on May 24 with an attack in which 33 Turkish soldiers were killed, they have kidnapped and released 26 foreign tourists (and claim to be still holding an American and a New Zealander). They have also dented Turkey's tourism industry with low-level violence in Mediterranean resorts and in Istanbul. Their area of operations has also broadened westward and northward from the Kurdish heartland. On Oct. 5 Kurdish rebels struck in Siirt and Batman provinces, killing 37 civilians.
Strengthened by their own tactics of intimidation and by the resentment caused by the Government's treatment of many Kurdish civilians, the guerrillas cast themselves increasingly as defenders of the Kurdish identity.
Some of the guerrillas say they ultimately hope to establish a Kurdish state in the region. But in offering the cease-fire, the rebels scaled back that demand and told Turkish Kurds they were seeking a negotiated settlement within Turkey that would acknowledge Kurdish rights, said Hatit Dicle, one of 17 Kurds in the 450-seat Parliament.
"As long as Government forces attack not only P.K.K. sympathizers but also those who are living peacefully in their homes, the number of P.K.K. sympathizers will increase," Mr. Gumus said in an interview here, using the Kurdish initials for the Kurdish Workers Party.
"The P.K.K.'s strength lies mostly in the fact that the state has ceased to be a state in this region," he said.
But the rebels themselves have made targets of villages known to be sympathetic to the Government and that are protected by the "village guard" system set up by the Turks to counter the insurgency. Men, women and children in such villages have all been slain without mercy, as they were on Oct. 5.
 
Vulnerable to Both Sides
 Living in small huts and houses with flat roofs, with small herds and farming plots, Kurdish civilians are vulnerable to both sides. Diplomats and Kurdish nationalists say hundreds of villages have been evacuated or torched by Government forces seeking to deprive the guerrillas of help.
In the towns and cities, hundreds of slayings of Kurdish journalists, newspaper vendors and in one case a Kurdish lawmaker remain unexplained.
Yet the Government seems unwilling or unable to consider political overtures or to take control of military decision-making. The killings of Turkish troops in the southeast has deepened the resentment among many Turkish civilians toward the Kurds, so the Government senses it has broad support for its tactics. That does not leave much room for maneuvering.
Prime Minister Ciller found out as much this month when she told a group of Turkish journalists that Turkey might explore a solution similar to the one found by Spain in dealing with Basque separatists, sealing borders to gunmen while offering political incentives. Such was the uproar from the military and powerful politicians like President Suleyman Demirel that she told her followers a few days that she had never said anything of the kind.
"The P.K.K. has been very successful at politicizing and polarizing" Kurdish and Turkish society, said a diplomat in Ankara.
"There's a sense among the Kurds that the Government's focus on a military solution takes away the mask and reveals the antipathy of Turks toward Kurds. So the Kurds are prepared to see P.K.K. as their only voice."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Even as Top Priority, the Health Plan Bogs Down

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
The White House sales pitch for its health care program began to veer off track even as President Clinton was delivering one of the biggest speeches of his career, the address to Congress laying out his goals for the health plan.
By then, Mr. Clinton knew that inflation estimates were creeping upward and that the staff of the health care task force would be forced to revise the financial assumptions. 
 Then, some members of Congress rejected the Administration's offer to draw up a legislative outline that would have given the lawmakers something to work with while the White House gained some breathing room to hash out the final details.
And in spite of persuasive appearances by Hillary Rodham Clinton before several Congressional committees, the momentum that had been building for the health care package began to diminish as foreign policy crises occupied increasing attention. With other matters at center stage, Administration officials began to receive complaints from Congress that health care details were lacking.
 
Clear to Sluggish
 What was supposed to be a clear and simple plan to sell a set of overarching principles to the American people disintegrated into a sluggish uphill effort to keep the message strong and clear.
The President's aides have admitted some tactical errors, one being the public relations vacuum that developed since Mr. Clinton spoke on Sept. 22 and after Mrs. Clinton testified. But they also said attention was siphoned off by events in Russia, Somalia and Haiti.
Administration officials now predict the legislative draft will reach Capitol Hill next week.
"We really didn't think we would be asked, 'Where is the legislation?' when we thought everybody knew we were working as fast as we could to get the legislation up there," a senior White House aide said last week. "We thought more what would be asked would be, 'What's your evidence that this is a good idea?' "
 
Uncharted Territory
 Assuming that members of Congress would follow that game plan, the White House had summoned Gov. John Waihee 3d of Hawaii to Washington to testify about his state's universal health care plan. But Governor Waihee cooled his heels during his time in Washington without being called to testify. Meanwhile, lawmakers took to the floor of the House and Senate, demanded the details about financing and presented their own alternative plans.
White House officials say the Administration has not been given enough credit for attempting to cope with the complexity of putting together a health care plan. When Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, suggested recently that the actual legislation might yet be several weeks away, the howls of complaint from Capitol Hill forced the White House to move up the schedule.
"You are dealing in an area that is kind of new," said Gene Sperling, a White House economic policy deputy. "When we were doing the budget, a lot of the 200 spending cuts we did had been floating around for several years."
Deprived of the opportunity to remain on the high ground and fuss with the details later, Administration officials hope to regain the initiative in coming weeks with a second start to the health care campaign.
 
No Small Test
 The new push will revolve around the release of a revamped version of the plan, which aides said had been changed to reflect some early criticisms about regulation and to include financing mechanisms.
"This is really a question of allocation of time and resources and travel," said Mandy Grunwald, a media consultant who works for the White House.
She added, "Whether health care reform is front and center at any given moment is not going to make or break public support for the health care plan."
The Administration's ability to sell health care is no small test. By linking the prospects for the health care measure to the rest of his domestic initiatives, Mr. Clinton has opened the possibility that if one part fails, the rest will be seriously weakened.
James MacGregor Burns, the political historian, recalled asking Mr. Clinton during the Presidential campaign how he planned to cope with the intractable problems he would face in the White House. "Persistence," the President replied.
Mr. Burns observed: "History shows again and again that if you stick to your guns and don't compromise unduly, your sheer persistence is such that people will come around to you. There is something impressive about someone who is not constantly compromising and retreating."
But now, Mr. Burns added, there had been more compromise than persistence at the White House, and he worried that this would be reflected in the handling of the health care plan.
Some White House aides subscribe to Mr. Burns's theory of persistence and have suggested in recent interviews that compromise on the health care plan can be taken only so far.
Mr. Clinton has concentrated on linking the health care plan to other pressing domestic matters, but it has nevertheless taken a back seat at times. In his weekly radio address on Saturday, he emphasized the importance of passing the North American Free Trade Agreement and did not mention health care.
This does not faze the President's top health care advisers, who say all domestic policy initiatives are interrelated. Their view is that a greater danger, uncontrollable because of its unpredictability, is that foreign policy crises will continue to seize center stage for the indefinite future.
"Everything's been overshadowed," Ms. Grunwald said. "In an ideal world, would you prefer not to have foreign policy issues come up three weeks after the launch of the health plan? Sure. But the world goes on, and the President has to act."

HEADLINE: Republican Leading In Virginia Contest, Voter Survey Shows

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Once behind in the polls, the Republican in the race to be Virginia's next governor now has a wide lead over the Democrat less than three weeks before the election, according to a new poll.
The poll, released Saturday by The Richmond Times-Dispatch and WWBT-TV, showed 50 percent of voters surveyed supporting the Republican, George F. Allen, and 33 percent backing Mary Sue Terry, with 17 percent undecided. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. 
 The two are fighting to succeed L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat and the nation's first black elected governor, who is prevented by state law from seeking a second consecutive term.
The next governor's race in Louisiana, however, will feature a familiar player: Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, who on Saturday declared his intention to seek a fifth four-year term.
 
Repeat of '91 in Louisiana?
 Despite polls earlier this year that showed his popularity at an all-time low, Mr. Edwards, 66, said a boost in the state's economy from legalized gambling would help him win in 1995.
He also predicted that the 1995 race would mirror that of 1991, ending in a runoff between him and David Duke, the former Klu Klux Klan leader and state representative. Mr. Duke and former Gov. Buddy Roemer have both hinted that they will seek the office.
A major issue in the Virginia race has been gun control. Ms. Terry, a two-term state attorney general, is pressing for a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases. Mr. Allen, a former Congressman who is the son of the late Washington Redskins coach George Allen, opposes additional gun control in Virginia, which requires a computerized background check for gun buyers. He advocates fighting crime by abolishing parole and building more prisons.
Ms. Terry has also worked to distance herself from President Clinton. Virginia supported George Bush in the last Presidential election.
The telephone survey of 554 registered voters was conducted Monday through Thursday by the research division of Media General Inc., The Times-Dispatch's parent company.

A BARRIER TO HEALTH-CARE PLANS
Two weeks ago, Earn J. Lloyd of Morris Heights, the Bronx, staggered into the emergency room at Montefiore Medical Center nearly comatose, nearly blind and barely able to walk. Doctors discovered he had severe diabetes, which kept him in the hospital for 10 days. But Mr. Lloyd's more serious medical problem was the lack of a decent general doctor, which for him and hundreds of thousands of others in New York's poorer neighborhoods turns treatable outpatient diseases into life-threatening conditions. This severe deficit of doctors in poor urban neighborhoods will make President Clinton's health-care plan, or any alternative, difficult to carry out in the areas that most need the help. A1.
 
NEW YORK CITY
 
DIFFERING SHARPLY ON THE ECONOMY
 As New York City struggles to shake itself out of its worst recession in half a century, the mayoral candidates are offering sharply different prescriptions on how to revive the local economy -- a split that mirrors a national debate over economic policy. The Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contends that fiscal conservatism -- keeping a balanced budget, streamlining city agencies and keeping them off the backs of business -- provides the best hope for the economy. But Mayor Dinkins has unveiled proposals that many see as a sort of industrial policy, with the city marshaling resources to aid 12 industries in the hope that they will become centers of economic growth. A1. 

A SPOILER AND A FOIL?
George J. Marlin, the Conservative Party candidate for mayor, could end up costing Mr. Giuliani vital conservative votes in a contest that polls suggest remains too close to call. Though his support has hovered at only a couple of percentage points, that may change after encounters like the one with Mayor Dinkins yesterday on WNBC-TV, and another last Thursday on the cable channel New York 1. B3.
 
THE MAYORAL CAMPAIGN TACKLES RACE
For three and a half years, Mayor Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani bobbed and feinted toward their electoral rematch, the issue of race a mostly unspoken taboo between them, just as it was in their last campaign. But since President Clinton mused aloud three weeks ago that too many New Yorkers were unwilling to back the Mayor because he is black, all boundaries seem to have fallen. News Analysis. B3.
 
RACE AND ETHNICITY: SHIFTS IN POLITICS
In New York, ethnicity has always been shorthand for distinctions in class and in political factions. Race, in a more visible and indelible way, is providing similar symbolism. Metro Matters by Sam Roberts. B3.
 
DINKINS STRESSES RECYCLING PLAN
Speaking before a group of environmentalists at the foot of Pier 26 in lower Manhattan, Mayor Dinkins said that the city would continue an aggressive program to recycle garbage, replace gas-burning city vehicles with those that burn alternative fuels and buy large tracts of land to protect its reservoirs of drinking water in the Catskill Mountains. B3.
 
IMMIGRATION SEEN AS HURTING CITY
With the largest wave of immigration since the turn of the century raising New York City's foreign-born population to 28 percent, most residents say there are too many immigrants in town and add that while most are law-abiding, they have made the city a worse place to live, a new poll has found.

SOUND BITES AND FURY
If this year's race for Suffolk County district attorney sometimes has the feel of a street fight, it is largely because of the intense, combative natures of the two major-party candidates vying to head one of the largest and busiest prosecutor's offices in the state. To some, the race between the incumbent, James M. Catterson Jr., and Patrick Kevin Brosnahan Jr. is a perfect matchup, a convergence of two bulls and one china shop. B5.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
For Race and Ethnicity, Shifts in Roles in Politics

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
RUMINATING on the difference between race and ethnicity in American politics, Representative Charles B. Rangel explained the other day why blacks in particular have not had an easy time inheriting the mantle of municipal power.
"The difference between race and ethnicity is that historically when everyone was out competing they knew at one time their name would get on the ballot," he said. "First the Irish had to wait for the white Anglo-Saxons, and the Italians had to wait for the Irish, and the Jews had to wait for the Italians. But you knew that with party tickets, when your time came, you'd get it. Then they threw away the old rule book because who was up next? The blacks. 
 "While Jews could have pride in seeking a Jew, and the Irish could have pride in Kennedy, when the blacks in Chicago had pride and sought Harold Washington, the white Democrats went bananas and found an unknown -- a Jew, I think -- to run against him as a Republican. What does that mean? Is that ethnicity? I don't think so."
Then what is it? And is it fundamentally different from the social and political resistance that punctuated every racial and ethnic succession since New York City's first minority, the Dutch, achieved hegemony over indigenous Indians?
In New York, ethnicity has always been shorthand for distinctions in class and in political factions. Race, in a more visible and indelible way, is providing similar symbolism.
Immigrants were the major ingredient that perpetuated the Democratic political organizations for generations, spanning the 19th and 20th centuries -- beginning with the Irish, whose peasant values of deference and personal dependency, Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote, made them ideal cogs for the party machine. Cogs grew into big wheels, though, only with the indulgence, or the defeat, of earlier immigrants.
When Irish-Americans presumptuously demanded a regular role in New York City politics a century ago, Mayor Abram S. Hewitt angrily declared that "the danger line has been reached when it must be decided whether American or foreign ideas are to rule this city."
Reformers episodically interrupted the regular organization's reign by uniting nervous business interests with newly arrived immigrants who had not been co-opted by the party machine.
The first Irish Catholic Mayor, William R. Grace, was elected in 1880. Fiorello H. La Guardia, who had adopted the Anglicized name Frank when he first settled in New York in 1906, won in 1933 and was re-elected in spite of, and because of, ethnicity. "In exploiting racial and religous prejudices," Robert Moses wrote, "La Guardia could run circles around the bosses he despised and derided."
The first Jewish mayor (La Guardia was half-Jewish and considered himself Episocopalian) was not elected until 1973. The first black, David N. Dinkins, won in 1989, although the first black candidate for countywide office on a regular party ticket, the Republican nominee for Manhattan borough president, was selected in 1953. If elected, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins's Republican-Liberal challenger, would be the first mayor with two parents of Italian heritage and who had not (like Vincent R. Impelliteri) served as acting mayor first.
"The difference between racial politics and ethnic voting," former Mayor Edward I. Koch wrote in his book, "Politics," "is this: in racial politics, no distinction is made and you vote simply on the basis of race. In ethnic politics, if the candidates are roughly equal, as perceived, an ethnic group will quite naturally vote for someone they identify with."
Nathan Glazer, the Harvard professor who wrote "Beyond the Melting Pot" 30 years ago with Mr. Moynihan, draws a more subtle distinction. "What was the dominant division in people's minds during previous ethnic successions was not ethnic succession: it was the machine versus the progressives," Mr. Glazer said.
"There was always an underground knowledge, but I just don't believe the whole public discussion was in those terms," he said. "It was a reality, but it wasn't treated that way. This became the surrogate for all class and economic factors. The difference today is the degree of public attention -- the almost total concern. The elements are the same, but the conflict is preserved in a different form.
" The participants are more vividly distinguished" -- meaning more visible but still emblematic of class and economic factors associated with race.
"Glazer and I argued," Mr. Moynihan said, "that ethnicity was the organizing unit of New York politics. When you're talking issues of race, you're talking issues of caste. This is ethnic politics. Race has acquired the pattern of an ethnic group interest."
The city, Mr. Moynihan added, managed to survive every other episode of ethnic politics with minimal dislocation, although party tickets, another victim of political reform, no longer prevail to smooth the transition.
"You're not changing the nature of New York society when there's an Italian mayor finally, or when at long last there's a black police commissioner," the Senator said. "It doesn't require the 82d Airborne."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Plan for Japan's Media Lab Is Stalled

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 16

 BODY:
A bold and much-debated attempt to establish a Japanese version of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's famous Media Laboratory is suffering from financial and organizational problems and faces an uncertain future, many people involved in the project say.
The idea for the laboratory goes back to 1987, when a Japanese university and business executive signed a contract with M.I.T. The goal was to build a research facility in Japan with the creative atmosphere of M.I.T.'s lab, which is known for its free-wheeling style and ground-breaking developments in multimedia technology and other areas. 
 The project became a symbol in the debate about the proliferation of relationships between American universities and foreign companies. Proponents said the laboratory would promote scientific cooperation between the United States and Japan. Critics called it a crass sale of M.I.T.'s expertise that would lead to Japanese innovations and undermine American competitiveness.
But those arguments are becoming moot because the project is floundering. "The truth is, it never got off the ground," Nicholas Negroponte, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, said recently.
The travails show that the collaborative research efforts for which Japan is famous are not always successful. They also demonstrate that the current economic slump in Japan is starting to crimp the ability of its industries to spend money on advanced research, even as they acknowledge that they must make their own breakthroughs if they are to continue to prosper.
In fact, the planned laboratory has not attracted the anticipated financial support of Japanese companies. There has also been a culture clash -- not over research styles, but about organizational strategy -- between some Japanese organizers and Mr. Negroponte.
M.I.T.'s five-year contract to help develop the Japanese lab ended in June 1992. Early this year, Mr. Negroponte resigned from the board of directors of the International Media Research Foundation, the Japanese organization that is trying to establish the lab. That ended M.I.T.'s official connection with the project.
"It was just too slow," Mr. Negroponte said. "It's not my speed. They would not move fast enough."
About the same time, Dr. Tadashi Sasaki, the chairman of the media foundation and one of Japan's most prominent engineers, also quit, in part because of criticism from Mr. Negroponte. Six other Japanese directors followed him off the board.
Construction has not yet started on a big laboratory that was to be built outside Tokyo to house 100 researchers. Instead, there is only a temporary laboratory, staffed by five researchers, in the foundation's office in the basement of a small Tokyo office building. They are working on projects including how to make a computer discern musical rhythms and how to make appliances easier to use by analyzing the workings of the human mind.
 
No Pledges From Companies
 Seiichi Koizumi, secretary general of the foundation, said it still plans to build the laboratory by 1996. He conceded that no companies have yet pledged money but said that fund-raising cannot begin in earnest until a building permit is obtained. Mr. Koizumi called it "regrettable" that Mr. Negroponte had resigned.
In the 1987 agreement, M.I.T. received $10 million to help Japanese scientists recreate its laboratory, where researchers have been pioneers in areas like digital high-definition television, interactive entertainment and personalized electronic newspapers.
The debate over the project grew when critics in the United States said M.I.T. was selling expertise to Japan, where research had often focused on making constant small improvements in existing products, and not on the bursts of inspiration that lead to new products.
Supporters, however, said M.I.T. was not transferring any specific technology, only advice on how to achieve the proper creative atmosphere in the laboratory. Moreover, they said, the money received would help support M.I.T.'s own research.
M.I.T.'s contracts were with two Japanese interests -- Nihon University and Chiyoji Misawa, a developer of prefabricated housing and an alumnus of Nihon. Mr. Misawa's company, Misawa Homes, paid the $10 million to M.I.T.
But the project was plagued by bad luck from the start. In 1990, a scandal at Nihon University involved charges that the yakuza, or members of Japanese organized crime groups, had intimidated a candidate for university president into withdrawing from the election.
To avoid tainting the media laboratory project with a public controversy, Nihon University dropped out. Without a university's involvement, Mr. Negroponte said, it was more difficult for M.I.T. to cooperate.
In April 1992, the International Media Research Foundation was formed to attract broader participation from other universities and from industry. Misawa Homes made another contribution, this time an endowment of 2.5 billion yen, or almost $25 million.
The foundation had the official blessing of Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Education. Its chairman, Dr. Sasaki, was known as "Dr. Calculator" for his role in developing Japan's electronic calculator industry, and its board included presidents and past presidents of leading Japanese universities. A separate board of advisers included the presidents of 16 big companies, including Toyota, Sony, Sharp and Canon.
But for several reasons, including a downturn in the economy, the foundation did not succeed in raising money, even from companies that had executives on the advisory board.
 
 
Dispute Over Strategy
 Meanwhile, Dr. Sasaki and Mr. Negroponte disagreed on strategies and roles and wound up leaving the project within weeks of each other. Akira Fujii, an assistant to Dr. Sasaki, said that Dr. Sasaki thought Mr. Negroponte was merely trying to get money from the foundation to spend at M.I.T.
Mr. Negroponte said M.I.T. had not asked for money beyond the original $10 million. He did say, though, that he pushed for a chairman who would spend more time on the project than Dr. Sasaki, who is 78 and is involved in other business interests.
Dr. Sasaki would not grant an interview.
Despite the financial uncertainties, efforts to create the lab have continued. And while the official link to M.I.T. has ended, Mr. Koizumi said the foundation was using M.I.T.'s earlier advice in setting a research agenda and style. Three of the foundation's researchers are former graduate students from the M.I.T. lab.
Dr. Edward E. David Jr., who was the science adviser to former President Richard M. Nixon and is a member of the foundation's board, is planning to come to Japan at the end of this month to discuss ways of reviving the project.
"You can't raise money in a vacuum," he said. "So far, we haven't got anything to show and we don't have a good plan."
But Dr. David, who was also head of research and development for the Exxon Corporation, said the project should be able to get back on track.
"I think in the end it will be quite successful," he said. "I don't know when the end will be."

HEADLINE: Researchers Say U.S. Social Well-Being Is 'Awful'

 BODY:
Increases in child abuse and child poverty have driven the nation's social well-being to its lowest point in two decades, according to a study being released today by social scientists at Fordham University.
The scientists also evaluated Americans' confidence in their quality of life, and they said it was strikingly low. 
 The annual report, "The Index of Social Health," attempts to monitor the well-being of American society by examining statistics from reports by the Census Bureau on 16 major social problems, including teen-age suicide, unemployment, drug abuse, the high-school dropout rate and the lack of affordable housing.
 
Highest Rating forin 1972
 Aided by a computer model, the researchers use the statistics from the 16 categories to reach a single figure between 0 and 100, which they call the index of social health.
The report was first produced in 1985, when the scientists measured social health for the year 1970. The index for 1970 was 75, which the researchers said was above average. But in 1991, the most recent year for which complete data was available, the index was 36, down from 42 in 1990 and less than half the highest index rating of 79 for 1972.
The 1991 figure is "awful," said Dr. Marc L. Miringoff, the author of the study and the director of the Fordham University Institute for Innovation in Social Policy in Tarrytown, N.Y.
"These results reveal as much about what is happening to us as the economic indicators that we watch closely every day," he said.
Two major reasons for the drop, Dr. Miringoff said, are that child abuse reached its worst recorded level and that the number of children living in poverty reached its worst level since 1983.
 
Pointing to Decline in Economy
 Also eroding society's health was a decline in average weekly earnings, he said. "The decline in the economy has much to do with the decline in our social health," Dr. Miringoff said. "Especially the economic factors that affect the labor market. Simply, there are a lot fewer jobs now that people can depend on for stable long-term employment."
Two of the indicators used to calculate the social index did improve in 1991: infant mortality and food stamp coverage.
A new feature of the report, the Index of Social Confidence, seeks to show how Americans evaluate national performance in areas that shape the quality of life: education, health care, safety, occupation and living standard. In a national telephone survey, 1,200 randomly selected Americans were asked how confident they felt about those areas.
The result was a confidence index of 34, which Dr. Miringoff called disturbingly low. He said the respondents to the survey saw serious problems in the nation's social well-being and were pessimistic about the future.
Eighty-four percent of those questioned said they believed it was difficult for the average American to provide for his family, while 71 percent said it was difficult for the average person to find a satisfying job.
The telephone survey was conducted with Yankelovich Partners Inc., a research firm based in Westport, Conn., from May 27 to June 7. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

HEADLINE: Thatcher Tells of '89 Plan With Paris to Rein In Bonn

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Worried that a reunified Germany would dominate Europe, the leaders of Britain and France took tentative steps in December 1989 and January 1990 to create a British-French entente to "check the German juggernaut," Lady Thatcher has written in her memoirs.
But the plan, which she said evolved from three private meetings with President Francois Mitterrand, eventually came to nothing because the French leader believed that the reunification of East and West Germany could not be stopped and sought instead to contain a newly powerful neighbor by promoting a more integrated, federated Europe. 
 "He made the wrong decision for France," she says baldly.
Lady Thatcher's memoirs, "The Downing Street Years," go on sale here and abroad on Monday. Advance copies of the 862-page book, which is published by HarperCollins and costs $37.50, were made available to the press today. Excerpts have appeared in newpapers over the last week.
The book begins with her visit to the Queen in May 1979, anxious about details of protocol when she formed a Conservative Government, and ends in November 1990, when she resigned as Prime Minister and looked back at the residence at 10 Downing Street with tears in her eyes.
 
Cabinet's 'Weasel Words'
 In between -- during the years in which she is convinced she changed the course of British history by facing down the unions, fighting the war over the Falkland Islands and forcing a Conservative agenda past lily-livered ministers and a howling Labor opposition -- she sprinkles observations about politics and world leaders.
Much of her bile is saved for members of her own Cabinet, who drove her to resign when one by one she called them in to canvass their views on her chances of winning a leadership struggle. What really hurt, she says, was the "weasel words" of friends and allies masquerading "their betrayal as frank advice and concern for my fate."
Among those who hesitated to back her, she notes, was the current Prime Minister, John Major. Nevertheless, she pretended to overlook his faint-heartedness and supported him to become her successor once it was clear she could not win.
Many men in politics, she concludes, are vain and indecisive -- "precisely those characteristics which they attribute to women."
 
Mixed Words for Carter
 She dealt with three American Presidents. Jimmy Carter, we are told, was likable but had a loose grip on economics and "no large vision of America's future." Ronald Reagan, of course, was a paragon of virtues -- warm, charming, unaffected and, like herself, high-minded. His election in 1980 was "as much of a watershed in American affairs as my own election victory."
George Bush was "easy to get on with" but became exasperated by her habit of dominating the conversation. She learned, she says, to "defer to him" and "not to stint the praise," for the greater glory of England. "If that was necessary to secure Britain's interests and influence I had no hesitation in eating a little humble pie."
The Bush presidency, looking on Germany as the coming power, initially turned its back on the "special relationship" with Britain. But Washington soon learned, during the Persian Gulf war, the value of having London as its prime ally, she insists. At one point, speaking on the phone to President Bush when sanctions against Iraq needed enforcement, she told him, "This is no time to go wobbly."
Mrs. Thatcher was quick to spot Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the rising figure in the Kremlin and in December 1984, three months before he became the Soviet leader, she invited him to visit her at the Prime Minister's country retreat of Chequers for his first trip to the capitalist West. Though they argued the merits of their respective systems, she found him confident, personable and not at all like "the average Soviet apparatchik." As was widely reported at the time, she became something of an advocate for him at the court of Mr. Reagan.
 
Denigration of Kohl
 Among international leaders, Chancellor Helmut Kohl is denigrated as someone who "has the sure touch of a German provincial politician." But it is perhaps Mr. Mitterrand who comes off the worst. Although Lady Thatcher takes pains to point out that he is cultivated, cosmopolitan and a lively dinner partner, she notes a "tendency to schizophrenia" on the German question, meaning that while publicly endorsing German reunificiation, privately "he is driven by a fear of the consequences of German domination."
She writes that at the French President's suggestion, she met twice with him in private during a meeting of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in December 1989, at a time when Mr. Kohl had make public a 10-point plan leading to German reunification. Mr. Mitterrand, she writes, "observed that in history the Germans were a people in constant movement and flux."
"At this I produced from my handbag a map showing the various configurations of Germany in the past, which were not altogether reassuring about the future," she recalls. A special concern was over eventual German hegemony over the countries of Eastern Europe.
"He said that at moments of great danger in the past, France had always established special relations with Britain, and he felt that such a time had come again. We must draw together and stay in touch."
 
'The German Giant'
 Despite a subsequent meeting and plans for foreign and defense ministers to confer on the topic, the proposed axis fell away, largely because Mr. Mitterrand "said he was at a loss as to what we could do," she says. Instead of defending French sovereignty and interests through alliances, he chose to "move toward a federal Europe in order to tie down the German giant."
Mrs. Thatcher's jaundiced view of German reunification was well known at the time, but Mr. Mitterrand's private thoughts have not been disclosed before. A spokeswoman for the French President said there would be no public comment on Lady Thatcher's assertions but added that Mr. Mitterrand's positive attitudes toward Germany were well known and a matter of public record.
The memoirs have caused a storm in Germany, where extracts have appeared in Der Spiegel under the headline "Stop the German Monster." The magazine said that Lady Thatcher could be "deemed an incorrigible German-hater and mocked as the last warrior of the cold war" but that such a characterization would probably not even offend her.

HEADLINE: Palmas Journal;
Brazilians Rush West, to Citadel of Self-Reliance

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALMAS, Brazil

 BODY:
Blueprints in hand, Walfredo Antunes de Oliveira Jr. watched officials lay this frontier city's founding stone and wondered nervously: What if we build a capital and no one comes?
Then, looking across the table-flat savanna on that day in May 1989, he noticed dust plumes in the distance. Slowly, they converged on this patch of wilderness on the east bank of the Tocantins River. 
 "There was one family with a bakery tied on the top of their truck; there was another family from Rondonia, where the soil had given out," Mr. Oliveira, an architect, recalled today.
From 130 hardy pioneers less than five years ago, the youngest and smallest of Brazil's 26 state capitals currently counts its swelling population at 85,000.
"The city recalls Brasilia at the end of the 1950's," gushed a reporter from a Brazilian picture magazine who recently trekked here from Brasilia, the federal capital, 400 miles south of here.
 
An Ideological Gulf
 But red dust, a master plan, and dreams of taming Brazil's West are about all that this new city shares with Brasilia, Brazil's planned city of the 1960's. More than a generational gap, the difference is an ideological gulf.
Designed by Oscar Niemeyer, a lifelong member of the Brazilian Communist Party, Brasilia celebrates supremacy of the state. Seeking to use architecture to create a new citizenry, Mr. Niemeyer initially ruled out private property and housed Government employees in Soviet-style apartment blocks.
But in later years Brazil's central Government went broke.
With inflation raging today at 35 percent a month and Government services deteriorating steadily, Brazilians expect less and less from the federal Government, and this new spirit of self-reliance is especially strong here on Brazil's agricultural frontier.
While attention focused in recent years on Brazil's attempts to colonize the Amazon, a thriving farming and ranching region emerged in the midwest savanna states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goias. To promote growth through investment in basic services like roads and electricity, Brazil's Congress in 1988 lopped off the northern half of Goias and created this state, Tocantins.
With about one million people scattered over an area slightly larger than Colorado, Tocantins has an economy based on cattle ranching and on rice cultivation. Rice plantations here rank among the world's largest.
Forging a new relationship between public and private sectors, Palmas, the new state capital, is being built without special federal aid.
"Of the 15,000 buildings that have sprouted here since 1989, I would be surprised if more than 100 were financed by the state," Mr. Oliveira said. His architecture and engineering firm, Grupo Quatro Ltda., drew up a plan for Palmas that covers 519 square miles of urban areas, farming belts and an ecological reserve.
Under a pay-as-you-go system, Tocantins state sells housing and commercial lots to raise money for paving streets, installing electricity and building government buildings. Grandiose projects have to wait. The airstrip is a section of highway used by propeller planes until a macadam strip can be built for jets.
In a raw, orange brick neighborhood called Liberdade, or Freedom, new electricity wires hang from temporary poles and freshly opened trenches line subdivision streets, waiting for plastic pipes from the city water company.
"When I got here, this was just savanna, and now we have electricity," Edilson Pereira Silva, a 24-year-old migrant from southern Brazil, said, proudly surveying the two-room core of a new house he was building. "In a new city, you grow along with the city."
In the center of town, Jair Correa Jr., from Goias state, recalled how his father impulsively decided in 1990 to buy a lot a few yards from where bulldozers broke ground for the state governor's palace.
"We had just sold a ranch and we decided to invest immediately," said Mr. Correa who now runs the Girassois, the city's largest and busiest hotel. "In Brazil, it's very dangerous to keep your money on hand."
As hotel patrons dug into plates of steamed river fish, the diversity of accents in the dining room reflected the boom town atmosphere here -- cattle ranchers from central Brazil, executives from a coastal Brazil department store chain, and Canadian engineers from a cellular telephone company.
 
Some Success Stories
 In a self-confident city where the first baby, born in 1990, was baptized Palmerio, success stories include Divino Jose Pereira, who parlayed money earned as a pizza deliverer in San Francisco into a Palmas bar and clothing boutique. Cosme Neves Barbosa, another entrepreneur, tapped a need for prefabricated swimming pools in a climate where summer temperatures routinely rise over 100 degrees.
At City Hall, a fax machine burps into life at least 20 times a day, delivering requests for information from small and medium investors across Brazil.
"We get a lot of people looking for a fresh start -- civil servants taking early retirement, divorced people," said Mayor Eduardo Siqueira Campos, an optimistic 30-year-old in blue jeans. "People call up and say: 'I have $80,000. What can I do with it in Palmas?"

HEADLINE: Heads of H.M.O.'s Have Concerns on Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 17

 BODY:
Because President Clinton's health plan seeks to increase the number of Americans in health maintenance organizations, White House officials expected the directors of H.M.O.'s to be among the plan's most enthusiastic supporters.
But the people who run these organizations, while generally favoring the President's ideas, nevertheless express many concerns and doubts about the proposal. 
 The directors worry about Federal regulation of their premiums, about 50 different sets of state rules, about their ability to handle a surge in membership and the difficulty of bringing poor people into their networks. They doubt that Federal payments and subsidies will cover the costs they expect when they enroll Medicaid recipients, homeless people, drug addicts and people with chronic illnesses like AIDS.
And they worry about losing the expertise that employers have developed over decades of purchasing health care for their employees. They say such employers have given H.M.O.'s the impetus to be more efficient.
 
Staking Out Positions
 Meeting in Washington last week, medical directors of the health maintenance organizations said they strongly supported Mr. Clinton's goals, including medical insurance for all Americans with an emphasis on preventive care. But, like other sectors of the health care industry, they want to shape the President's plan to address their concerns and are staking out positions for the struggles ahead.
Mr. Clinton's proposal would give all Americans a choice of joining an H.M.O. and would create financial incentives for people to do so. Under Mr. Clinton's plan, H.M.O.'s, which provide comprehensive medical care in return for a monthly payment, would need to be certified by the states where they were operating, and states could set widely differing criteria.
For H.M.O.'s operating in more than one state, as most do, "that would be a nightmare," said Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, medical director of the United Healthcare Corporation, whose H.M.O.'s serve 2.4 million people in 14 states, including Illinois, Minnesota, Ohio and Rhode Island.
Mr. Clinton is intent on preserving state power to regulate H.M.O.'s within a Federal framework.
 
Call for National Standards
 But Dr. Don Nielsen, associate medical director of Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest H.M.O., with 6.6 million members in 16 states, said, "We want a common set of national standards for certifying health plans and for reporting data in all 50 states."
Karen M. Ignagni, president of the Group Health Association of America, a trade group for H.M.O.'s, said, "It is not in the consumer's interest to have multiple conflicting standards." Instead, she said, "there has to be regulatory uniformity," with the Federal Government setting nationwide standards in categories like financial management, the quality of care and the reporting of data.
Membership in health maintenance organizations exploded in the last decade, to 41.4 million in 1992 from 10.8 million in 1982. Doctors who work at these organizations worry about whether they can expand much faster without harming the quality of care.
Dr. Jesse H. Jampol, medical director of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, which has more than a million members, said it would be difficult, though not impossible, to accommodate a surge in membership.
 
'Adds to the Paperwork'
 "We have 47 medical centers in New York City," Dr. Jampol said. "We don't want to dilute the quality of care by putting more people into a center than it was designed for. If we get 100,000 new patients in a year, we'll have to build another three or four centers at a cost of $8 million to $12 million apiece."
Mr. Clinton would require H.M.O. members to pay $10 for each visit to a doctor, and similar amounts for other services. Dr. Jampol's organization does not make such charges, nor does it want to.
"We are not eager to pocket little bits of money and set up a whole new system of billing and accounts," he said. "It adds to the paperwork and the bureaucracy."
Prof. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University, said the H.M.O.'s of today provide a model for the way health care will be delivered in the future. "Under the Clinton plan," he said, "there will be more H.M.O.'s, and some of them will be bigger. But their profit margins will be smaller because they will face fiercer competition."
Kathryn Langwell, a health economist at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting and consulting firm, said: "Today's health care reform initiatives are favorable to H.M.O.'s. They should be relatively happy, but their concerns are reasonable."
 
'Rationing of Health Care'
 Commercial and nonprofit H.M.O.'s both criticize Mr. Clinton's proposal calling for the Government to regulate premiums.
Dr. John M. Ludden, medical director of the Harvard Community Health Plan, which serves 547,000 people in New England, said, "Premium caps will drive capital out of this business and will drive us straight to the rationing of health care."
Dr. Newcomer said: "Premium caps will make us get rid of care that has no proven value, and that's good. They may also force us to limit access to care that is effective and valuable but expensive, and that's not good."
As employers prod workers to join H.M.O.'s, doctors across the country are rushing to affiliate with such networks.
For years, the Government has been trying to increase the use of health maintenance organizations by poor people on Medicaid and elderly people on Medicare. But only 2 million of the 30 million Medicaid recipients and fewer than 2.5 million of the 36 million Medicare beneficiaries are in such organizations.
It is unclear whether these patterns will change. Dr. Howard L. Bailit, senior vice president of Aetna Health Plans, said: "Government has underfunded Medicaid for 20 years. I think that's going to continue. It will be a real serious problem for us." Aetna operates 26 H.M.O.'s with 1.2 million members.
 
Little Control for Employers
 Middle-income consumers can be enrolled in large groups through their employers. But Dr. Newcomer said H.M.O.'s needed a different strategy to recruit and serve poor people. "In parts of Chicago," he said, "we have door-knocking sales people to enroll Medicaid recipients one by one."
In addition, he said, large numbers of Medicaid recipients fail to keep their medical appointments, and these patients often need special help with transportation. "We have to find clinics on public bus lines and sometimes buy bus tickets or pay cab fare," Dr. Newcomer said.
Dr. Ludden said the Harvard Community Health Plan had many patients who cannot speak English. The H.M.O. has interpreters in more than 25 languages. If millions of uninsured people get coverage under Mr. Clinton's plan, other H.M.O.'s will need to provide similar services, Dr. Ludden said.
Under the Clinton proposal, employers would have to pay health insurance premiums for their workers, but they would have little control over the cost of care. Insurance purchasing groups, known as regional health alliances, would collect the premiums from employers, negotiate with H.M.O.'s and buy coverage for millions of people.
The H.M.O. directors lamented the loss of the employers' expertise in this transaction. Dr. Ludden said: "Employers are a powerful voice for health care consumers. They have really become sophisticated customers. They know what to ask for and how to ask for it. They set goals for us -- clinical goals, not just cost goals."
Under Mr. Clinton's plan, employers with more than 5,000 workers could still serve as their own health insurers or buy coverage from insurance companies. But most employers would have little or no role in selecting insurers for their workers. That decision would be made by the alliance.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Amid upgrades, Greyhound finds profits are behind schedule.

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

 BODY:
GREYHOUND LINES, the venerable bus company, must have some serious engine trouble. How else to explain the fall of its stock from $22 in early August to about $12 in late September, where it has remained since?
One reason: Its problems are exaggerated. 
 The sputtering of the stock was prompted by Greyhound's weak summer, when it faced the inevitable headaches of introducing a computerized reservation system. Heavy calling on the system's new toll-free number created high hopes about summer traffic, despite two warnings by the company of a weakness in short-haul markets.
Still, investor hopes were dashed in late September with an announcement that August traffic had slumped 12.3 percent and earnings would be flat to slightly improved over 1992. The disclosure was botched, with some company analysts receiving the news before others. Wall Street, with its distaste for surprises, punished the stock. And the shares have languished.
Greyhound Lines, after all, is into its slowest period of the year, the fourth and first quarters. And there were few hopeful signs in employment statistics for its many customers with an average annual income of $25,000 or less. While many regions of the country showed jumps in help-wanted ads in the Conference Board's help-wanted index for August, the index showed a decline in West Coast states like California, where Greyhound gets 15 percent of its business.
Throw in the unwelcome surprise of softer-than-expected earnings, and the stock belongs in the low teens, according to some Greyhound watchers like Allan S. Roness of Fahnestock & Company.
"What do you give a stock that really disappoints?" he said. "It should only get 10 to 12 times earnings."
But the turmoil over the summer has clouded Greyhound's hyperkinetic effort to modernize its outdated operations, which is expected to continue to drive down its operating costs and improve profit margins.
"It's been overpenalized here," said Vivian Lee, an analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, who said she thought the stock ought to be in the $17-to-$18 range, representing a multiple of about 17. That is still considerably below the current market multiple of more than 24 for the Standard & Poor's 500.
Indeed, the speed with which Greyhound is overhauling its operations makes some rapidly restructuring airlines look as if they are standing still.
Greyhound is closing garages -- to 12 by year-end from 30 in early 1992 -- to improve economies of scale. The new computer reservation system should help the carrier schedule its fleet more efficiently, and it expects to take delivery of 400 new buses through the first quarter of next year.
The company, based in Dallas, is introducing various levels of fares to grant discounts on advance purchases. In August, it started testing an Easy Riders program that looks in many ways like a frequent-flier mileage program, offering discounted tickets, food and drinks to repeat customers.
The company has also developed a stock-option plan for drivers and mechanics, letting them earn shares based on performance reviews.
Greyhound's troubled summer has basically lost the company a year. Analysts who had been predicting $1.40 in earnings a share this year are now predicting the same for next year, down from the $1.75 or so they had been expecting for 1994. In other words, the stock lost more than 40 percent of its value after its earnings forecasts were lowered about 25 percent.
So attention, passengers: The bus is coming. It's just going to be a little late.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Shifting Perceptions of a Presidency

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
Presidential reputations are protean things, continually revised and annotated by shifting values and historical developments that vindicate or repudiate an individual President's decisions and world view. Among the many factors that both shape and reflect popular perceptions of a President are biographies, memoirs and historical accounts of an administration.
The second volume of Robert A. Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson ("Means of Ascent," 1990) left readers with an image of Johnson not as an architect of civil rights legislation, but as a politician of "utter ruthlessness" who "stole" his 1948 Senate election. In contrast, David McCullough's affectionate 1992 portrait of Harry S. Truman ("Truman") served as the culmination of an ongoing process of rehabilitation, transforming an unpopular President (who left office with a 31 percent approval rating) into a kind of folk hero. 
 It is probably more than coincidence that the best-selling "Truman" arrived in bookstores in June of 1992, at the height of the Presidential campaign, and that George Bush soon traded in his former role model, Theodore Roosevelt -- who happened to be the subject of an earlier McCullough biography, "Mornings on Horseback" -- and began comparing himself to Harry Truman.
Bill Clinton also invoked the Truman mantle, as well as that of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but as newspaper, magazine and television accounts attest, he has most insistently cultivated comparisons to John F. Kennedy.
The 14-minute Bloodworth-Thomason film screened at the Democratic National Convention last year showed a teen-age Mr. Clinton shaking hands with President Kennedy at a 1963 Boys Nation reception, using the image twice as a kind of symbolic passing of the torch. The day before he was sworn in, Mr. Clinton made a pilgrimage to Arlington National Cemetery to lay roses on the grave of President Kennedy, and in his inaugural address he used self-consciously Kennedyesque language to call for public service and self-restraint. A recent speech on national service invoked Kennedy by name, praising his creation of the Peace Corps for changing "the way a generation of Americans look at themselves and the world."
Although such speeches by Mr. Clinton conjure up an image of the idealistic founder of the New Frontier, Kennedy's actual place in history remains open to debate. While books by former Kennedy associates -- Arthur M. Schlesigner Jr. and Theodore C. Sorensen -- attempted to cement the Camelot myth, later volumes by historians like Garry Wills and Thomas C. Reeves provided decidedly less flattering portraits of Kennedy as a manipulator obsessed with image.
The latest book about Kennedy -- "President Kennedy: Profile of Power" by the political journalist Richard Reeves (Simon & Schuster) -- draws a portrait of him as a highly pragmatic politician who was intelligent, disorganized and careless. It is less a full-fledged biography of Kennedy than a study of his Presidency, and it unwittingly sheds new light on Kennedy's young emulator, William Jefferson Clinton.
Although Mr. Clinton appears only once in the book (and in a footnote, no less), it's hard for anyone who has read about his Presidency or followed it on television to finish "Profile of Power" without drawing comparisons, and comparisons that tend to have less to do with vision than with circumstance, temperament and managerial style. These inadvertent parallels are not always flattering; indeed, they sometimes leave the reader wondering why Mr. Clinton has chosen to make Kennedy such a favorite role model.
To begin with, there are the obvious similarities of youth and qualified popularity. Although both men were highly skilled politicians and both were hailed as avatars of a new generation, they were both elected with less than 50 percent of the vote and no guarantee of a Congressional majority for their legislation.
Kennedy entered office almost totally focused on foreign policy, and found himself forced by circumstance -- namely, the rising civil rights movement -- to deal with domestic issues. Mr. Clinton entered office almost totally focused on domestic issues and has found himself forced -- by developments in Bosnia, Somalia and the former Soviet Union -- to deal with foreign policy.
In the early months of their Presidencies, both Kennedy and Mr. Clinton were needled by the press about the slow pace of their appointments. Both made close family members -- Robert F. Kennedy and Hillary Rodham Clinton, respectively -- trusted Administration confidants. And both got off to a rocky start with the military: Kennedy losing its respect after his embarrassing summit with the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1961; Mr. Clinton starting off with scepticism because he had not served in Vietnam.
During their first months in office, both Kennedy and Mr. Clinton struggled with disorder resulting from their White House management styles. According to Mr. Reeves's book, President Kennedy described his White House organization as a wheel with many spokes and himself at "the vital center." Nearly the same words were used last January by a Democratic Party official who told Time magazine that the Clinton White House "has been structured as spokes of a wheel leading into the President."
Mr. Reeves writes that Kennedy's love of rambling meetings and hallway conversations had the effect of "a movable feast, a floating bull session." Reporters have similarly noted that Mr. Clinton's open-door policy in the Oval Office has nurtured the seminar atmosphere he loves.
Indeed Presidents Kennedy and Clinton seem to share certain personality traits that incline them toward such a loose work arrangement: a personal mastery of detail, a capacity to thrive on chaos, a distaste for being alone.
Certainly some of the similarities one might discern between the two Presidents are fairly generic to the office or to the successful politician: confidence, verbal facility, an ability to wing it when necessary. Kennedy, Mr. Reeves observes in his book, delivered his famous 1963 civil rights speech with only a partly finished text. Mr. Clinton made it through the first seven minutes of his recent health care address with the wrong speech in front of him on the prompter.
Other similarities are superficial, the stuff of gossip: allergies, a fondness for the telephone, a penchant for watching movies when under stress. Kennedy, Mr. Reeves notes, watched "Roman Holiday" late one night during the height of the Cuban Missile crisis. Mr. Clinton, Newsweek reported, channel-surfed between "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "Zorba the Greek" and "The Crucifer of Blood" while waiting for the Senate vote on his economic plan.
Other parallels, however, are more revealing and potentially consequential, from the cultivation of image to both men's easy ability to charm those around them.
Kennedy's gift, in Mr. Reeves's words, "for convincing others that, whatever he did or had to do, he was at heart with them" appears to have led to misunderstandings within his own Adminstration, while Mr. Clinton's ability seem to to empathize with assorted constituencies has already led to hurt feelings -- over such matters as homosexuals in the military -- when his actions have failed to live up to perceived intent.
Mr. Reeves argues in "Profile of Power" that Kennedy "had little ideology beyond anti-Communism and faith in active pragmatic government," that he "never made a decision until he had to," that "invariably he chose the most moderate of available options," and that he was "often willing to suspend" what convictions he did have "if that avoided confrontation with Congress or the risk of being called soft." Mr. Clinton, who has tried to avoid having the liberal label pinned on him, has been repeatedly criticized during his first nine months in office for his willingness to compromise and conciliate.
Of course one of the biggest differences between Kennedy and Mr. Clinton is that Kennedy's Presidency is a matter of history now; though open to the revisions of historians, his decisions belong to a closed book. Mr. Clinton's record is still very much a work in progress, though the process of assessing him and his Administration has already begun. "Promises of Change: The Clinton Administration and the Politics of Renewal," by Roger Morris, is due out in February. Also in the works are a biography of the President by David Maraniff, and books on his Administration by Bob Woodward and Elizabeth Drew. And this after just nine months in office.

Unemployment

 BODY:
The average length of unemployment claims is at an all-time high in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in what state labor department officials say provides one of the most graphic indications of a job market that continues to shrink. The average length of claims gives a picture of the job prospects of the recently unemployed but does not account for those entering the job market or the long-term unemployed. While unemployment rates have fallen, after soaring to their highest levels in a decade last year, employment remains flat in the region largely because jobs are not being created. New York's Labor Department currently estimates the average worker who loses their job will be out of work for more than a year.

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Campaign -- At Issue: The Economy;
Fixing New York's Sick Economy

 BODY:
New York City's economy is limping along, with high unemployment and rising welfare rolls. Voters naturally demand solutions from their leaders. Mayor David Dinkins and his challenger, Rudolph Giuliani, have responded by offering development plans that promise to turn the local economy around.
The plan put forward by Mr. Dinkins promises too much: 185 pages of proposals to channel money into biotechnology, business services, jewelry, apparel and about 10 other high- and low-tech industry clusters that often seem to have no more claim on taxpayer dollars than the fact that they hire lots of voters. Mr. Giuliani promises too little: Cut taxes to make it cheaper for business to operate in the city -- but leave it to some other time to figure out how to cut spending. 
 New York voters have a choice between a challenger who provides no direction and an incumbent who wants to shoot in 14 different directions -- guaranteeing that none of the money would land with clout.
New York's economic fortunes are swept along by national and international forces that are beyond local control. City government didn't cause the real estate bust of the 1970's or the stock market boom of the early 1980's. It didn't cause the telecommunications boom that added jobs, or the manufacturing bust that eliminated jobs. It didn't create the influx of poor families; nor did it tell Congress to abandon its responsibility to take care of America's poor. But even if city policy can't reverse economic tides, it can help make the economy work better for millions.
Mr. Dinkins's plan is motivated by a single idea: By combining private and public money, city policy can propel industry growth. Mr. Dinkins proposes, for example, a venture-capital fund for biotechnology and information technologies, a center to house computer software companies and a so-called business incubator that would develop companies in the fashion and apparel industries.
Some of these ideas are worthy, but they aren't powerful. High-tech venture-capital funds and business incubators are atop the agendas of many big-city mayors, and where they've been tried, there is no pattern of success. And why does a mature industry like fashion need incubation? In special circumstances, private-public partnerships can overcome obstacles that businesses can't overcome themselves. But Mr. Dinkins's strategy aims at too many targets and could easily turn into taxpayer bailout of politically powerful business groups.
Mr. Dinkins's plan does contain useful ideas. He would create a new financing mechanism to rebuild deteriorating infrastructure. And he would build a network of neighborhood facilities to provide primary health care for the poor -- an innovative and humane policy that would also boost employment.
Mr. Giuliani's plan is simpler to describe because of its scantiness. The first half of his 40-page booklet laments the state of the city economy and criticizes Mr. Dinkins's policies. He then proposes a series of tax cuts. That would be a potent idea if Mr. Giuliani had made it more believable by telling voters how he would cut spending -- without eviscerating the quality of city services -- to make way for the tax cuts. But, as described in yesterday's editorial about each candidate's budget policies, Mr. Giuliani didn't step up to this challenge.
He also promises to cut bothersome regulations and bureaucratic waste. But he doesn't provide details or explain how he, unlike all his predecessors, would ram the changes through the City Council, let alone Albany.
Mr. Giuliani offers some of the same platitudes found in the Dinkins plan about investing in infrastructure and improving schools. But he provides no focus, no numbers. He would loosen zoning requirements to spur residential construction and promote enterprise zones. But he does not explain how subsidizing business in one blighted area of the city, which almost certainly would take business away from companies in nearby neighborhoods, amounts to a strategy for citywide growth.
There are limited circumstances in which it is useful to use taxpayer money to support private enterprise. But the best strategy would be for the city to focus on what it uniquely provides. Studies of metropolitan areas show that the most effective plans channel public money into improving infrastructure, such as transportation facilities, and educating a skilled work force. That's what businesses look for when they start up or relocate.
But it's a hard message to sell to voters. The mayoral candidates would have to ask city taxpayers to spend today but wait for at least a decade -- long after the winner leaves office -- to reap the reward. Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani have failed to deliver that message.

HEADLINE: Has France Gone Bonkers?

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is senior columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
It's a molehill threatening to be a mountain. Compared to the economies involved, the European-America -- really French-American -- farm war heading toward a decisive battle is strictly marginal. But the martial music has grown deafening.
The cohesion of the European Community and relations with the U.S. are at stake. Leaders on both sides have proclaimed that they will never surrender, provoking warnings that the whole Western structure of accommodation that won the cold war could be brought down. 
 Absurd as it sounds, it has to be taken seriously. Internal politics -- links established between seemingly unrelated issues such as wheat production and world currency markets -- along with mythic imagery have made the farm issue a serious danger for international relations.
The French feel under mortal attack. Most everybody else feels the French have gone bonkers. Agriculture accounts for 3.6 percent of France's gross national product and involves 6 percent of its labor force and, while it accounts for 16 percent of French exports, most of that goes to Community partners, and only a quarter of those exports are affected by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules at issue.
Why such a fuss? It has to do with what Charles de Gaulle called "a certain idea of France." In French minds, the picture that evokes la patrie is a steepled church, set in a stone village, surrounded by farmland. That's why miners, stock brokers and researchers agree that survival of the familiar countryside implies the survival of France. France's history, a misty-eyed banker told me, is the story of a thousand years of clearing and cultivating the land. The French see something immoral in leaving good land fallow.
It makes matters worse that pressures to reduce farm production come at the same time as the inexorable necessity to abandon the other part of the "certain idea" -- France as a great power. That's been fading over the years, but the country has been in a particularly bad mood since the unification of Germany, now undeniably bigger and stronger than France.
But partnership with Germany remains essential. Paris can hold out on GATT only if Bonn succumbs to French demands for "loyal" support. So the demon is the U.S., all the more of a threat since George Bush pronounced Germany America's major European partner.
French politicians are aware of the factual weakness of their case. The Community's common agricultural policy, which was de Gaulle's condition for not pulling France out of the Common Market, has led to drastic overproduction, dumped on world markets, thanks to monumental subsidies. Community subsidies add up to eight times as much per hectare as those in the U.S.
"Every advanced country subsidizes farmers," a French agriculture minister said, but nobody here knows how much French taxpayers and consumers pay for it. Nor is it said aloud that rich farmers get most of the benefits and that poor ones, who are being driven off the land, get least.
Nor do Germans know that a Government study showed it would cost the federal budget half as much to end its subsidies and give every farmer the equivalent of a midlevel civil servant's salary.
So the public responds overwhelmingly to the emotional issue of saving the land and its way of life, and the Government gets cheers when Prime Minister Edouard Balladur says if that means a crisis in the Community and the U.S., "so be it."
This small issue can blow up the chances for expanding world trade and even political cooperation. Rural life in industrial countries is worth preserving for the sake of poetry and the environment. But let each country admit what it's doing, and bear its own burden.

HEADLINE: How Pennsylvania Succeeds at Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The States' Stakes in Clinton's Health Plan" (The Week in Review, Oct. 10) graphically illustrates that Pennsylvania is one of only five states with a rate of uninsured workers of under 10 percent. And Pennsylvania has, by far, the largest population of the five. 
 There are several reasons why Pennsylvania has maintained a low rate of uninsured workers compared with most other states, despite the economic dislocations that have occurred across the state in the last decade.
A system of voluntary purchasing organizations and community-rated insurance pools has been in place in Pennsylvania for many years -- through unions, trade and professional organizations and individuals -- through which small employers, the self-employed and others can purchase health benefits. More than 1.3 million Pennsylvanians, primarily those who are employed at small companies, obtain extensive health benefits through these pooling arrangements.
Children have also received special attention in Pennsylvania. Over the last decade the private and public sectors have worked together to encourage, develop and finance special health care benefit programs for the children of economically disadvantaged families.
Longstanding practices and policies of the private insurance industry have also played an important role. All individuals in Pennsylvania can obtain coverage, regardless of their age, occupation or medical condition, through Pennsylvania's Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. Coverage is not canceled because of a major illness.
The thrust of your analysis is clear: the emerging national health care policy can't be so rigid as to preclude the states from charting health care policy and from organizing medical delivery systems to meet the needs of their local populations.

HEADLINE: Candidates' Views on Economy Reflect U.S. Debate Over Policy

SERIES: Mayoral Agenda: A periodic report on major issues facing the election winner. -- 4. The Economy

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
As New York City struggles to shake itself out of its worst recession in half a century, the mayoral candidates are offering sharply different prescriptions on how to revive the local economy -- a split that reflects their philosophical differences over the limits of city government and mirrors a national debate over economic policy.
The Republican-Liberal challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani, contends that fiscal conservatism -- keeping a balanced budget, streamlining city agencies and keeping them off the backs of business -- provides the best hope for the economy, allowing private enterprise to flourish on its own.
 
Venture Capital Funds
 But Mayor David N. Dinkins has unveiled proposals that many see as a sort of municipal version of an industrial policy, with the city marshaling resources to the aid of 12 specific industries, ranging from garbage recycling to biotechnology research, in the hope that they will become centers of economic growth. 
 Mr. Dinkins would also create two large venture capital funds that would invest city tax money directly in small and risky start-up companies.
His plan differs sharply from the policies of previous mayors who have used tax incentives to lure business to the declining areas of the city but made no attempt to pick out industries with the best potential for growth.
The timing of Mr. Dinkins's distinct change of direction over economic policy seemed clearly calculated to add luster to his re-election campaign. But his advisers say it has been prompted by the fact that the city's economy has only now reached bottom after a deep five-year recession. They say new, innovative city programs are needed to accelerate a period of slow, painful expansion that is expected over the next four years.
Mayor Dinkins's plan, which was announced in late September, appears to be gaining support among some corporate executives, a group that has traditionally been quick to criticize government intrusion into private enterprise. The plan has also been praised by President Clinton, whose support may be critical since the Mayor is seeking infusions of Federal funds.
Still, critics say the Democratic Mayor's proposals embody a high degree of experimentation that the city cannot afford at a time when there is no assurance that its long economic slump has come to an end.
The prospects of increased municipal involvement in business also underscore a wide philosophical difference with Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Giuliani has proposed the creation of small community development banks in poor neighborhoods and says he would use tax incentives to set up business enterprise zones.
But the main tenets of Mr. Giuliani's economic policy call for cutting the city work force and other forms of municipal spending, reducing red tape for small businesses and seeking to lower taxes.
"This administration can't even run city government properly," said Stephen Kagan, who is one of Mr. Giuliani's top economic advisers. "How can we expect it to run the economy?"
Mr. Dinkins, meanwhile, is proposing a program that asserts that City Hall can and should do more than keep its own fiscal house in order and that government incentives can be strategically honed to spur promising industries.
Advisers to Mr. Dinkins condemn Mr. Guiliani's economic platform as "municipal Reaganomics." They say the Republican candidate's proposals are both simplistic and impractical in a city whose diverse population and business community require economic development strategies that are finely tuned to meet widely divergent needs and timed to conform to cycles in the city's economic activity.
"We are proposing a fundamental change" in economic development strategy, said Barry F. Sullivan, the former bank chairman who was hired by Mr. Dinkins as his deputy mayor for finance and economic development in May 1992. Mr. Sullivan has headed a group of economists and policy analysts who have been preparing the Mayor's new economic development plan for more than a year.
Many business leaders "are surprised by the scope, the risk taking and the willingness to be aggressive in the Mayor's plan," said Ronald Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, a business group whose members include the chief executives of more than 150 of the city's largest corporations.
Although neither candidate has a clear lead among executives, he added, "business is supportive of the Mayor's approach because of a conviction that we have to do more now than we normally would to improve the local economy."
 
Unanswered Questions
 To be sure, many experts feel critical questions remain unaddressed by both candidates. One is whether City Hall should rely on huge tax incentives to keep large employers from leaving the city, a practice that was initiated by Mayor Edward I. Koch and employed more often by Mayor Dinkins.
The Mayor says the incentives are necessary and takes credit for saving thousands of corporate jobs that might have otherwise moved to the suburbs, Mr. Giuliani counters that too many companies have left during the Mayor's term despite the incentives.
But neither has responded to criticism from some officials, including Mark Green, the Democratic candidate for public advocate, that the city is doling out far too many tax breaks in a game of bluff with large corporations that simply threaten to leave.
And neither candidate has yet convinced fiscal experts that he has a workable plan to eliminate a huge gap that is expected in the city's budget for the next several years.
"Neither one has addressed the issue of how you eliminate the city's structural deficit," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group. According to the city's own estimates, it will face deficits of at least $1.7 billion a year in each of the three fiscal years beginning next July.
The two candidates' postions on the economy are based on sharply constrasting stategies for dealing with the deficits.
While Mr. Dinkins suggests that City Hall can stimulate business growth -- thereby creating a larger tax base and reducing the need to cut government spending -- Mr. Guiliani maintains that the role of government is to cut its own expenses and reduce taxes so business can expand on its own.
Mr. Guiliani says he would freeze hiring in several city departments and cut the city work force by 34,000, to 180,000 workers, in four years. He has also called for a "private sector working group" composed of business people to advise city agencies on where cuts should be made. The agencies would have to make cuts of 2 percent to 4 percent a year in spending for equipment, rent, vehicles and other non-personnel expenses.
He has also identified four taxes that he wants to reduce or eliminate. They include three levies that have long rankled business leaders: the unincorporated business tax, the commercial rent tax and the hotel occupancy tax. He says he also wants to reduce the surcharge on personal income.
Mr. Guiliani's approach reflects a widespread belief among fiscal experts that cities must put their own financial house in order before creating new ways to spend tax funds.
 
Harsh Criticism
 But there is no assurance that he can deliver on his pledge to cut taxes. And critics of the proposals say any reduction in taxes, even levied on businesses, may be impossible because of the budget deficits that must be closed.
Mayor Dinkins has been criticized through most of his first term for reacting to the threat of fiscal problems, rather than taking preventive measures.
The Mayor encountered harsh criticism within months of taking office in 1990, when some analysts objected to the size of pay raises won by city teachers while the city was grappling with severe economic problems. Complaints mounted weeks later when Mr. Dinkins said fiscal constraints could force him to lay off other city workers.
The Mayor regained support and confidence among many business people in 1992, when he delivered a balanced budget, froze city property tax rates for four years and hired Mr. Sullivan as deputy mayor.
As for the Mayor's plan to assist businesses, advocates of the proposals say they are based on the belief that what is good for New York City business is good for City Hall since expanding business activity will generate more taxes and lessen the need to cut government programs. They say it is being proposed now for reasons that have more to do with economic cycles than the timing of a mayoral campaign.
In an interview, Mr. Sullivan said the Mayor's economic plan is based on forecasts that the city's battered economy is only now beginning a slow expansion. The city would gain 100,000 jobs over the next four years even without incentives from City Hall, according to the Mayor's forecasts. The proposed economic stimulus package would create an additional 110,000 jobs.
In the largest single outlay -- $250 million over five years -- the Mayor's proposal calls for the creation of a Economic Development Bank to finance large city projects, like the renovation of the Staten Island home port for non-military uses and development of an industrial park along the Brooklyn waterfront.
Analysts say the development bank would bear little resemblance to a commercial bank because it would simply pay for public improvements instead of issuing loans. But its creation would mean that huge amounts of city funds would be clearly designated for economic development projects and could not be redirected for schools, highway improvements or other expenses.
The Mayor's sharpest departure from past policy comes in designating 12 industries to be courted by the city. They include biotechnology, computer software, apparel, jewelry, film and television production, recycling, health care, retailing, telecommunications, electricity and gas distribution, tourism and nonprofit groups.
Among the inducements would be real-estate subsidies to establish laboratories and plants.
Mr. Dinkins's plan also calls for two venture capital funds. One would make investments in small high technology companies, primarily in biotechnology and software. The second would have authority to invest in small businesses of any type.
Ultimately, each of the funds would raise $60 million. Although the plan is modeled on programs created by a handful of states, no other large city has tested them, and no government agency in the nation has attempted a venture capital program as large as those proposed by the Dinkins administration.
The proposal's success depends on the city's request for allocations from the Federal Government's Small Business Administration. Advisers to Mayor Dinkins said they expect $700 million in Federal funds to be made available to cities and states over the next four years.
Despite research by Dinkins aides, officials of the Federal small-business agency said last week that his plan for the venture capital funds was flawed when he announced it in September. The plan, which envisions raising $20 million initially for each of the funds, called for half of that to come from the city and half from private investors.
But Federal rules require that at least two-thirds of such funds come from private sources. On Friday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sullivan, Jeanne Nathan, said the plan had been changed to conform to Federal guidelines.
Once the initial money is raised, the city would seek $40 million More for each fund from the Federal Government.
Mr. Sullivan said the funds would be managed by Wall Street professionals who would be hired by the city, but would be independent of influence from City Hall.
 
 
 
THE SERIES SO FAR
 The Mayoral Agenda series began on Sept. 27 with a report explaining that whoever wins the election will confront a looming budget crisis. An article on Oct. 2 compared the candidates' views on social-services issues, and an Oct. 11 article looked at their different approaches to the crime problem.

HEADLINE: Montana's Sky and Its Hopes Are Left Bare After Logging

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MISSOULA, Mont., Oct. 14

 BODY:
Throughout the 1980's, the Champion International Corporation went on a tree-cutting spree in Montana, leveling entire forests at a rate that had not been seen since the cut-and-run logging days of the last century.
Now the hangover has arrived. After liquidating much of its valuable timber in the Big Sky country, Champion is pulling out of Montana, leaving behind hundreds of unemployed mill workers, towns staggered by despair and more than a thousand square miles of heavily logged land. 
 In one of the nation's biggest private land deals, Champion this month is selling all 867,000 acres of its Montana land -- for $300 an acre -- to the Plum Creek Timber Company, based in Seattle. Plum Creek has been called "the Darth Vader" of timber companies by former Representative Rod Chandler of Washington, a Republican, but it now says it is committed to a less destructive type of forestry.
The deal has revived a century-old complaint about large, distant corporations exploiting Montana for its natural resources and then leaving after the land is exhausted. For all the glamour that has been attached to the state in recent years with the arrival of movie stars and the state's celebration on screen and in print, Champion's final chapter in Montana is evidence to many people here that much of the state's economy still resembles that of a third world country.
 
Evidence of Exploitation
 The sell-off of Champion's land and mills, which are expected to close at the end of this month, could not come at worse time for Montana's economy, which has been racked by layoffs by other out-of-state corporations.
"Champion came in here promising they would be here forever, and then just overcut all the trees and left," said Dr. Thomas Power, chairman of the economics department at the University of Montana in Missoula. "We are left paying the piper."
The company speaks of changing goals, not broken promises. Champion, which is based in Stamford, Conn., and had $5 billion in sales last year, says it is getting out of Montana because its best corporate interests lie elsewhere, in pulp and paper mills in the South and the East. It will pay severance for people who lose their jobs, and it will contribute to a community fund.
"For Champion to leave has been very difficult, and we are very sympathetic to those people and very sad," said Tucker Hill, a spokesman for the company. "But I don't think you can hold a company's feet to the fire for everything they did over the last 20 years."
The company will leave behind much anger and pain, evident in everything from the Champion sign outside Missoula over which has been scrawled the words, "No more rape and run," to the merchants in the small mill towns of Bonner, five miles east of here, and Libby, in northwestern Montana, who say they may have to close up shop.
One thing the sale has done is brought environmentalists and timber workers together. When business was good, few complaints about overcutting were heard from timber workers, while environmentalists warned that eventually both the trees and the jobs would disappear. Now they have joined in a common cry of outrage.
"I've been in the timber industry since 1951, and this is the biggest single blow I've seen -- far worse than any cutbacks from environmental restrictions," said James A. Hill, a Missoula native and a leader of the Western Council of Industrial Workers, which represents various timber unions.
 
1,500 Get Layoff Notices
 In ending its operations in Montana, Champion will lay off nearly 1,500 workers at two mills at the end of this month. About half of those workers expect to be hired back, at an undetermined wage with a different company, the Stimson Lumber Company of Portland, Ore., which bought Champion's Montana mills. Plum Creek will buy the land, giving it 2.1 million acres in the Pacific Northwest.
While most of the battle over logging has focused on Federal land, the big private companies have been cutting timber on their own land -- particularly here in Montana -- at a pace that would be against the law if it had happened on public land.
A study made public last month by the University of Montana found that for Plum Creek and Champion had logged their forests in Montana at a rate nearly three times faster than new trees could grow back -- abandoning the industry's frequently stated principle of cutting at a sustained yield. Federal law requires the Forest Service, a branch of the Department of Agriculture, to log at a sustained rate.
As a result, western Montana is a checkerboard with huge, clear-cut tracts where all the trees were cut down during the roaring 1980's. And biologists and some Montanans say that some of the state's premier trout streams, like the Big Blackfoot River, the site of Norman Maclean's fishing memoir, "A River Runs Through It," are in peril from soil erosion.
 
Mountains Without Trees
 "I came here as a war bride, in 1947, and it was just paradise in these mountains," said Maria Fraser of Libby, a timber town of 2,500 people that is facing an exodus because of cutbacks at the Champion mill. "The mountains are still here, but they look like a desert after Champion and Plum Creek cut all the trees down."
Libby is a place "where people were raised to think if they take care of the woods, the woods will take care of you," said Andrew H. Malcolm, a spokesman for Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican.
"Then along came these pressures from outside the region, changing the rules, and these people are the lost souls," he said.
Most of the clear-cut land has been replanted. But because of Montana's harsh climate and the high elevation of most of its forests, it can take a century to grow trees big enough to be cut.
Champion decided to close its Montana operations as part of its overall strategy to concentrate on paper manufacturing rather than lumbering, corporate officials said. Two years earlier, the company closed a big mill here in Missoula. It says it is doing everything it can to make life easier for the people who will be out of work and for the communities that will lose their only major employer.
 
$1.2 Million in Compensation
 Under pressure from Montana political leaders, Champion, Plum Creek and Stimson have agreed to pay $1.2 million to help the communities that will be hit hard by the land sale and subsequent layoffs. But critics say the overall compensation is a pittance, particularly from a corporation like Champion.
Champion bought most of its Montana land in 1972 from Anaconda Copper, a company that used to control the state's resources and its newspapers with an iron grip. Before that, the land was part of a 40-million-acre parcel that Lincoln, as President, gave to the railroad companies as an incentive to build a rail line across the country. It will now go to Plum Creek, which is a corporate descendant of the original railroad company that got the biggest piece of Federal largess.
The 1864 railroad land grants still haunt much of the West. When the land was given away, the railroads were awarded every other square mile in a corridor. A map of the land resembles a checkerboard, with Forest Service property in Montana interspersed with Champion or Plum Creek land. That pattern on the map looks the same on the ground in some parts of the state after a decade in which the two big private timber companies clear-cut their square mile patches.
"The land has been replanted," said Mr. Hill, the company spokesman. "Not that it's a perfect situation. But it's a well-managed forest. And it will be in production in years to come."
Plum Creek officials say they will cut about 100 million board feet a year on the land they are are buying from Champion. But some environmentalists say there are not enough trees to provide that volume. "What I suspect they will do is cut what they can and then subdivide some of the land into ranchettes," said Michael Scott of the Wilderness Society in Bozeman, Mont.
Rick Holley, who has just been named as Plum Creek's next president and chief executive, said in an interview that "only a very small amount" of land would probably be sold as subdivisions.
The excessive cutting on private land has prompted timber managers in the adjoining Lolo National Forest to place some public land off limits to logging. They say the overall ecology of certain areas is at risk.
"Champion's legacy is a disaster in certain river valleys," said Professor Power. "Environmentalists warned of this, and now it's come to pass."

HEADLINE: HOUSE REPUBLICANS REBEL OVER TAXES IN FREE TRADE PACT

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 18

 BODY:
With the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement turning on a few undecided lawmakers, the Clinton Administration is now threatened with the loss of a group that is central to the White House's legislative strategy: conservative Republicans.
House Republicans have rebelled at the prospect of $2.37 billion in higher taxes over five years to replace tariffs eliminated by the free trade agreement, inflicting a serious blow to the pact's prospects with the vote only a month away. 
 The increases, amounting to $5 a ticket, would be on the international airline and cruise ticket tax for travelers entering the United States by air or sea, and on fees for trucks and trains entering the country.
 
A Get-Tough Letter
 The free trade agreement cannot pass without strong Republican support because a majority of House Democrats oppose it. Twenty-seven House Republicans, including Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip, sent a letter this afternoon to President Clinton threatening to withdraw their support.
"It would be difficult for many of us to support a Nafta which included tax increases," said the letter, which was signed only by Republicans who had endorsed the agreement or had been leaning toward endorsement.
The opposition is to the tax increases, not the agreement itself. The stance is a Republican bargaining position in the struggle over how to raise money, and it reflects resentment at the White House for expecting Republicans to bear most of the burden of voting for an unpopular pact.
 
The Straw and the Camel
 The Administration proposal last week for the higher ticket fees "could be the straw that broke the camel's back," said Representative Thomas W. Ewing, the Illinois Republican who organized the letter.
The letter called for spending cuts to replace the fees on travelers, trucks and trains, an approach that the Administration has rejected so far because it creates many political and procedural problems.
If approved by both houses of Congress, the pact would gradually remove tariffs and other trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States beginning on Jan. 1.
The dispute over paying for the pact is already delaying Congressional consideration of the agreement, members of the House and Senate say.
The House Ways and Means Committee, the lead committee in the House because it handles tax and tariffs issues, is scheduled to vote Tuesday on legislation putting the agreement into law. Representative Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat and committee member who is leading House supporters of the agreement, said this evening that the committee would probably act without having the financing in place.
 
Looking at the Options
 "I think it is serious," he said. "We're going to have to look at a number of different options." Mr. Matsui added that the Administration was almost certain to retreat from forcing transportation industries to bear the full burden.
An Administration official said tonight that Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, would present the tax increase proposal at the committee hearing but would stress that no final Administration decision had been made.
Mr. Matsui said he was optimistic that a new method of financing the trade pact could be found that would be acceptable to the conservative Republicans. "If we decided to drop Nafta because we couldn't raise $2.4 billion over five years for tariffs, or because we couldn't afford a $100 million retraining program, it would really send a signal throughout the world that this country is not an economic power," Mr. Matsui said.
The pact was negotiated by the Bush Administration and has the support of Republican leaders in both houses. Mr. Kantor said today at a breakfast with reporters that the Administration hoped to win over 100 House Democrats, suggesting that the support of 118 House Republicans would be needed.
Conservative Republicans, who loathe tax increases, have been the bedrock of that support because of their enthusiasm for free markets and free trade.
Critics and supporters of the agreement say that the Senate is more likely to approve the pact. But the House is scheduled to vote first, most likely on Nov. 17.
The problem of financing the trade agreement arises because Congressional budget rules require that tax and tariff cuts be offset by higher taxes or cuts in mandatory spending programs like Medicare.
The pact would reduce American revenues from import tariffs by $2.36 billion over the next five years, a sum that the Administration proposes to raise by doubling customs inspection fees on international travelers, trucks and rail cars and eliminating certain exemptions from the fees.
The proposal has prompted vociferous lobbying by the nation's travel industry, particularly major airlines, because the fees are included in the price of airline and cruise tickets. Because the airlines employ tens of thousands of highly organized workers and because of their history as a regulated industry until the late 1970's, the airlines maintain strong connections to members of Congress.
Mr. Gingrich's district included the headquarters of Delta Air Lines until the district lines were redrawn before last year's election, and he still represents many airline workers.
 
Where Cuts Might Come
 Mr. Ewing suggested that cuts should be made instead in automatic spending programs, notably food stamps. Tony Blankley, the press secretary for Mr. Gingrich, said the Republican leader would like to see an exception made to the House budget rules to allow the use of cuts in discretionary spending programs to offset the lost tariffs.
But while House rules are easily changed, Senate rules in effect since the 1990 budget agreement effectively require that such an exception win the support of 60 senators. Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's trade panel and supports the agreement, said that 60 votes were too many to find.
Mr. Blankley said Mr. Gingrich still wanted to support Nafta and was confident that a procedural solution could be found.
Mr. Kantor said the free trade agreement would actually increase Federal tax revenues by several billion dollars by stimulating extra economic growth in the United States that could be taxed. But the budget rules forbid the use of such secondary effects in calculating how to offset lost tax revenues.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chase Posts 52% Jump In Third-Quarter Net

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation said yesterday that it earned $267 million in the third quarter, up 52 percent from a year earlier on the strength of high trading profits, fewer problems from bad loans and a wide spread between what it pays for deposits and what it charges for loans.
Also yesterday, the PNC Bank Corporation, the holding company for Pittsburgh National Bank, reported record profits, and Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., posted a drop in earnings. 
 Chase's third-quarter profit was the latest in a long string of reports showing that Chase has rebuilt its business after suffering losses totaling nearly $1 billion in 1989 and 1990. Through the first nine months of this year, profits totaled $653 million, or more than it earned in all of last year.
 
 
Stock Drops
 Despite the strong performance, which was in line with results reported by other large banks recently, Chase stock fell sharply yesterday to $34.125 a share, down $1.75. Investors and traders who have worried for months that bank profits could be undermined by higher interest rates reacted yesterday to the cut in the prime rate by Morgan Guarantee Trust to 5.5 percent from 6 percent -- a move that reduces bank revenues even if there is no increase in the general level of interest rates.
At a meeting with analysts yesterday, E. Michel Kruse, Chase's chief financial officer, told analysts that a drop of half of a percent in the prime rate would reduce Chase's revenues by about $46 million, or 1.25 percent of the $3.7 billion of its interest spread, the difference between the rates it pays on deposits and other borrowed money and the rates it earns on loans and investments.
Nationsbank said yesterday that profits from its basic banking business were at a record level, though special charges kept third-quarter profits slightly lower than a year ago.
The company said its $341 million profit in the quarter ended Sept. 30 was reduced by $30 million for special charges relating to its merger this month with MNC Corporation, a Baltimore-based banking company. The $350 million profit it reported a year earlier was increased, the company said, by a special gain of $55 million from the sale of part of its home mortgage business.
 
 
Diminishing Problems
 Nationsbank, whose acquisitions in recent years have made it the country's fifth-largest banking company, has been pushing hard to increase its business lending in recent quarters. Total loans grew at a rate of more than 10 percent in the second quarter, and diminishing problems with bad loans allowed the company to set aside just $100 million of profit for its loan-loss reserve, down from $150 million a year earlier.
PNC, the 10th-largest banking company in the country, said yesterday that it earned a record $217.7 million in the third quarter, up 64 percent from a year earlier.
The company, which has one of the industry's best records for controlling costs, said noninterest expenses fell to $345.9 million from $362.3 million a year earlier. At the same time, it said, loans grew to $27.4 billion from $24.4 billion.
Costs of troubled loans also continued to decline, as the company put only $50 million into its loan-loss reserve, down from $69.9 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: In France, It's How You Cross the t's

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 15

 BODY:
Increasingly tormented after six months of unemployment, Michel Malat, a 40-year-old former furniture sales manager, made an unusual decision: he decided to have his handwriting analyzed by an expert.
"I had sent over 250 applications for jobs, all written by hand, and I knew that my writing was being analyzed by companies in order to gauge my character," Mr. Malat explained. "And the more rejections I received, the more I worried my handwriting was suspect." 
 As French unemployment has soared to a rate of 11.7 percent, or 3.2 million people, an increase of more than 10 percent in the last year alone, more and more people here are worrying about their handwriting. Because a growing number of French corporations routinely subject the handwritten letters from job applicants, particularly for management positions, to graphological tests, the loops, slants, margins and flourishes of handwritten letters have assumed considerable importance.
In Mr. Malat's case, the analysis was generally positive. He was judged intelligent, balanced and caring. But, the report noted, "he may lack flexibility and inventiveness because of a tendency to reject what he judges to be over-imaginative or idealistic."
Poppycock? Graphology, or the analysis of handwriting as a means to understand character, has no proven scientific value and is not widely used by American companies. Some German companies have used graphology, but it is among French corporations that a job applicant's script has become a crucial indicator of personal qualities and flaws. As competition for jobs has grown, the technique's use has spread as a way to narrow the field and even to choose between finalists -- prompting some heated debate on its merits.
"Graphology is useless, psychological nonsense," said Bernard Krieff, the owner of a large Parisian recruiting consulting firm that bears his name. "Only if a company really insists will we have an analysis done. I personally sent the same handwriting to a graphologist on two separate occasions, and received two totally different results."
But the majority of companies, including other recruiting consultants, have a different view. "It would be very badly viewed if a job applicant sent a typewritten letter," said Jean-Pierre Verdier, the head of management recruitment for the state-owned cigarette manufacturer Seita. "We would have the impression that the person is trying to hide something."
Seita, which has annual sales exceeding $2 billion, routinely analyzes the penmanship of potential corporate managers. On Mr. Verdier's desk, piles of handwritten letters could be seen. Sometimes the company merely wants a "grapho flash," a quick, two-sentence assessment of a candidate's principal traits based on the letter; at other times, when important positions are to be filled and a handful of applicants remain, a full analysis of the letter is requested.
Mr. Verdier insisted that the method was generally good and reassuring to French managers raised to value instinct and impressions over the sort of rational scrutiny used in American multiple-choice tests. But, he said, handwriting was only one element among many used in making a choice. "Only if the graphology revealed something bizarre would we think again," he added.
Martine Clement, a Seita spokeswoman, said, "You may suddenly find that a person you are about to hire as an accountant has a tendency toward deviousness."
Not all French companies are willing to reveal their reliance on graphology, although almost all advertisements for jobs request a handwritten letter.
An Air France spokeswoman acknowledged that the company used the technique, but said she was unable to talk about it at a time when the money-losing carrier was trying to cut more than 4,000 jobs. At FNAC, a large chain of record and book stores, an official also said graphology was used but declined to elaborate.
Pascale Slama, a spokeswoman for Moulinex, the manufacturer of household appliances, said the company began using graphological analysis for management jobs two years ago.
 
Qualifications Questioned
 In France, there is no official recognition of graphology, which was invented 122 years ago by a French priest named Jean-Hyppolite Michon. The closest thing to a formal qualification is admission to the French Society of Graphologists, which imposes a stringent exam for which at least three years of study and a university degree are required. Only about 300 people, mostly women, have passed the society's exam, but thousands of other self-styled experts are known to practice graphology.
"I am shocked by the people I see calling themselves graphologists these days," said Marie-France Szymanek, who is a member of the Society of Graphologists. "The fact is you need long study to become familiar with the over 270 types of writing -- and unqualified people are bringing our profession into disrepute."
Mrs. Szymanek is a full-time employee of the Lille-based L'Office du Nord, a manager of low-rent housing. She earns her salary doing graphological analysis for all the company's job applicants, but she also does freelance work. Graphology, she concedes, is not a science, but is, she says, 70 percent effective in uncovering character traits.
One candidate for a job at L'Office du Nord was summarized in Mrs. Szymanek's report as "an earthy individual, who likes contact with people; a little disordered, with a lack of perspective, but conviction in his way of getting a message across."
As such reports pour into French companies, which are being urged by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to stem the rising tide of unemployment, graphology is being widely questioned in a spate of newspaper and magazine articles. Le Nouvel Observateur noted recently that writing leaning at more than 45 degrees to the right was regarded by some experts as a sign of an uncontrollably passionate nature.
Mrs. Szymanek conceded that graphologists were under fire. "I know we cause some anguish," she said, "but the real cause of anguish is the state of the economy."
What seems clear is that French companies have no intention of dropping their graphological inclinations. "Americans use figures," Le Nouvel Observateur concluded, "while we prefer impressions. We like grace, emotion, approximation. Instinct. We are probably not made for the modern world."

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. Opens Research Laboratory for AIDS

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
New York University Medical Center, providing what some experts hope will be a cornerstone for an expanding biomolecular research industry in New York City, yesterday opened a $75 million laboratory devoted entirely to scientists who will seek new treatments for cancer, AIDS and other diseases.
The laboratory, part of a new, 23-story university building on First Avenue off 30th Street, is to employ 70 to 80 scientists in full-time research, university officials said. 
 In a city that is already home to a vast network of hospitals and medical schools, the New York University project is considered important to both scientific research and economic development. Many officials, including Mayor David N. Dinkins, have pointed to biotechnology as a growth industry that should have a larger presence in New York City than it now has.
Recent studies show that the city has been losing out to other parts of the country in the type of laboratory research that leads to new treatments, products and private companies. A report last November by the New York Academy of Medicine found that the city's share of grant money from two of the Federal Government's largest medical research agencies had fallen to 7.3 percent in 1990 from 8.1 percent in 1987.
 
Philanthropic Gifts
 The report said that biomedical research remained a large industry for the city, responsible for 32,600 jobs and $2.3 billion in economic activity. But as measured by the volume of Federal grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, it said New York City had been surpassed by Boston as a research center.
The New York University Medical Center laboratory "is not only a major commitment to the future of medicine, but also a commitment to help New York City retain its position as the nation's leading biomedical research center," said Thomas S. Murphy, chairman of the medical center's board of trustees.
The laboratory, named the Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, has been financed by philanthropic gifts, mainly from the Tisch family of New York and the Skirball Foundation. It fills four floors of the new building, where the other floors are largely meant for staff and student housing.
Besides the New York University laboratory, another research project, financed at $26 million in a joint venture between the city, state and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, is scheduled to be completed in late 1994. It will provide space for several commercial biotechnology companies at the Columbia-Presbyterian site in upper Manhattan.
Although the New York University laboratory has been built with university money, experts said the research it supports is most likely to attract financing from other sources, including the Federal Government and venture capital funds.
One such fund has been proposed by Mayor Dinkins, who, as part of his re-election campaign, has proposed a new economic strategy in which 12 industries, including biotechnology, would be designated for city assistance. The Mayor wants to channel $120 million, most of it from the Federal Small Business Administration, into a venture capital fund, for investment in high technology concerns.
"Nobody at New York University Medical Center will turn their backs on venture capital," said Martin S. Begun, the center's associate dean. He added that the intent of the new institute was to "get the stuff that comes out of our laboratories to the market."

HEADLINE: Can a Governor Really Save Jobs?;
New Jersey Candidates Debate Role of State's Top Official

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LINDEN, N.J., Oct. 15

 BODY:
Two newly minted pickup trucks in dazzling colors are on display in front of the General Motors assembly plant here, and what they represent depends on who is doing the telling.
To G.M., the new S-line trucks represent the latest entry in the wildly popular sports-utility vehicle market. To Bill Wisk, a 47-year-old assembly line worker, they represent a return, after a long layoff, to a highly paid manufacturing job. 
 And because the state helped G.M. to retrain Mr. Wisk and 2,400 others, state officials regard the trucks as a small but promising part of its effort to keep good jobs from leaving New Jersey.
It is efforts like these -- from worker retraining programs to huge, state-financed construction projects -- that Gov. Jim Florio touts as he seeks a second term. His Republican rival, Christine Todd Whitman, meanwhile, consistently blames Governor Florio for the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in New Jersey since he took office in January 1990.
Beyond the campaign oratory, there is a broader question: How much can a governor, or any state official, do about a state's economy, especially when market forces operate not only nationally but internationally?
 
Questioning a Governor's Impact
 "If you got elected governor of this state and you went to Maine for four years instead of to Trenton, the economy when you got back would not be very different from what it was when you left," said Bruce Coe, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, a lobbying group. "Governors themselves aren't going to create that many jobs, and they aren't going to lose that many jobs."
But Mr. Coe said that does not let Mr. Florio off the hook.
"I don't think when Governor Florio became Governor that he had the business community and what their needs are very high on his priority list," Mr. Coe said, contrasting Mr. Florio with his predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, who consistently declared that a healthy business climate was the foundation for other state economic efforts.
 
Taxes Against Growth
 That is the thrust of Mrs. Whitman's argument when she maintains, in commercials and debates, that Mr. Florio is responsible for the loss of 280,000 jobs in the state. In fact, the decline in nonfarm employment from January 1990 to last August, the most recent figures available, was 205,300 jobs, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"I would argue that the Governor has not used the tax structure of this state to encourage jobs growth, and that in fact he has used it to discourage growth," said Carl Golden, Mrs. Whitman's spokesman. "When you take $2.8 billion out of the economy and send it to Trenton for some not totally specified purpose, that money is not going to be spent in the private sector."
Moreover, Mr. Golden added, it is inconsistent for the Florio administration to blame the recession for the state's punishing job losses while taking credit for the bright spots.
Governor Florio's spokeswoman, Jo Astrid Glading, defended his record.
"No governor can change the course of a national recession that has hit the Northeast particularly hard," she said, "but Jim Florio has in fact made his priority the creation of jobs, whether it be a small business confronting a credit crunch and needing assistance to grow, or a large business who needed help upgrading the skills of its work force."
An official who has served in both the Kean and Florio administrations said that there are things state leaders can do -- within limits.
"States can do a lot, but they clearly can't do it all -- they can be very effective around the edges," said Bob Hughey, who was Mr. Kean's Environmental Protection Commissioner and who spent the last year as head of the Office of Economic Recovery, a program put together by the Governor and the Republican-controlled State Legislature.
Mr. Hughey calculated that the state has laid the groundwork for the creation of 30,000 jobs through its major economic development programs, including the Economic Development Authority's low-cost loan program to small businesses and the Commission on Science and Technology, which provides seed money for high-technology start-up ventures.
 
Workers Are Grateful
 State economic development officials are used to taking credit for "saving" the Linden General Motors plant by helping the company pay for worker retraining. But Richard A. Monkaba, the plant manager, said the money from the state was only a fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the company has invested to modify the ancient plant, which once built World War II Grumman fighters, he said. The company spent a total of $16 million in training its 2,400 workers, he said. The $4.5 million from the state was welcome, he added, but not the deciding factor.
"The money from the state allowed us to do the kind of training we wanted to do in the time frame we wanted," Mr. Monkaba said.
Whatever the source of the training money, the workers inside the plant spoke gratefully of being given a chance to view their jobs from a new perspective. And state officials said they hope such efforts will ultimately give the state a better work force, new investment and more jobs.
"Used to be, they'd hand us a part and say, 'It goes on like this,' and sometimes it did, and sometimes it didn't," said Mr. Wisk, who checks the electrical systems of the newly assembled trucks. "In the training sessions, right from the get-go, we were talking to engineers, we were going over training vehicles with them, talking about how to do things. It makes you feel good about the job."
New Jersey spends $50 million a year, partly from the state unemployment insurance fund, to retrain workers through cooperative ventures with companies and grants to individuals. The figure per worker is higher than in all other states but California and Iowa, according to a recent study sponsored by the University of California. In the last year about 45,000 New Jersey residents have undergone retraining.
But as Joseph Capobianco of Roselle Park has found out, being trained for new jobs does not guarantee employment.
Mr. Capobianco, 56, an electrical draftsman with 30 years' experience, was laid off last fall from his $48,000-a-year job at I.T.T. Avionics in Nutley. He took two college courses in computer-aided design last year, with the state paying the $1,274 tuition, but since then has found work for only five months. Now he is looking again.
An audit of the United States Labor Department's $200 million retraining program found that only 20 percent of retrained workers found jobs that paid close to their former salaries. New Jersey, like many other states, is looking to high technology as a way to replace some of the jobs lost as older industries shrink and die.
Since 1985, the Science and Technology Commission program founded by former Governor Kean has given money to start-up companies that develop new products, hoping that new employment will follow. Several years ago, the program awarded a $40,000 grant to Envirogen Inc. of Lawrenceville, a 5-year-old venture to develop new ways to dispose of hazardous waste.
"Large companies are downsizing, they're getting rid of people, not growing, and New Jersey certainly has a large number of large companies," said Roger Colley, the president of Envirogen, which employs 90 people. "So the state's theory is that the small companies like mine will grow to fill the void, and that's where state programs can do the most good."

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Gain as Most Others Drop

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
After a wobbly start, blue-chip stocks racked up modest gains yesterday, driven by spurts among the pharmaceutical and transportation issues. But broader indicators slipped as uneasiness over interest rates and fears that the market could not sustain its recent highs seemed to take their toll.
Bank stocks suffered after the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company reduced its prime lending rate to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. Investors appeared worried that the move would chip away at the growing profits of banks like the Chase Manhattan Corporation, whose stock dropped 1 3/4, to 34 1/8. Citicorp, the most active stock on the Big Board, fell 1 3/4, to 35 5/8. 
 The Signet Banking Corporation, Wells Fargo & Company, the First Chicago Corporation and the Banc One Corporation also declined.
 
Telecommunications Stocks Ease
 Telecommunications stocks, which surged last week on the news of the merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc., lost ground, as did financial-service stocks. Bell Atlantic dropped 2, to 65, and U S West fell 1, to 48 7/8.
Over all, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.58 points, to 3,642.31, led by the Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Company, Allied Signal, and the General Motors Corporation. Because those companies' balance sheets are generally tied to the health of the economy, the gains seemed to reflect some optimism among investors that the pace of the recovery may soon pick up, some analysts said.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 329.6 million shares, down from 366.1 million shares on Friday. Declining stocks led advancing issues, 1,048 to 1,021. Pushed by rises in airline stocks, the Dow Jones transportation average increased 14.96 points, to 1,655.91.
The Amex composite index dropped 2.13 points, to 481.10. After a week of record highs, the Nasdaq index dropped as investors cashed in some of the gains. The Nasdaq composite was off 4.51 points, to 782.91.
"The belief is growing that the market is getting a little overheated," said Harry W. Laubscher, a senior vice president at Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York. "This has been evidenced by the rapid runoff on the Nasdaq stocks. They are off today because of profit taking."
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago, described yesterday's trading as "ho-hum," noting that the long-term bond market, where interest rates rose, dragged the stock market down. The stock and bond markets often move in tandem because the lower yields that come with higher bond prices make stocks more attractive.
"The engine for the most recent rally, interest rates, seems to be absent," Mr. Chalasani said.
Stock in pharmaceutical companies, particularly Merck & Company, the world's largest drug concern, rose yesterday after Merck reported third-quarter profits that exceeded analysts' predictions. Merck shot up 1 1/4, to 32 1/4, while the American Home Products Corporation closed unchanged at 63 1/8.
 
Other Active Stocks
 Among other active stocks, Liz Claiborne dropped 1 1/8, to 20, after it said its income fell for the third quarter. ITT, which said last week that it would trim 1,100 jobs from its executive payroll, declined 2, to 90 7/8.
Unicare Financial Corporation surged 7 7/8, to 27 5/8 after the Wellpoint Health Networks said it would buy Unicare. Wellpoint dipped 1/4, to 26 1/2.
Caremark International was down 1 7/8, to 16 1/8, after The Wall Street Journal reported that a two-year investigation was focusing on the company's dealings with the University of Minnesota Hospital.
In Nasdaq trading, Spectrum Information Technologies soared 3 1/2, to 11 1/8, after the company said that John Sculley, who resigned Friday as chairman of Apple Computer, had been named Spectrum's chairman and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Shell Joins Chemical on Credit Card

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The Shell Oil Company and the Chemical Bank will offer a joint Mastercard on Nov. 1 under which drivers will be able to save 3 percent when they buy Shell gasoline or 2 percent on other purchases for rebates of up to $70 a year on Shell gasoline purchases.
After they reach $70 a year in savings, customers could then get only 1 percent off their purchases of Shell gasoline. 
 The move is the largest yet by an oil company, many of which have increasingly been allowing their customers to use what are called "co-branded" bank cards -- that is jointly sponsored cards -- to buy gas.
 
Seeking Brand Awareness
 Robert K. Heady, publisher of the Bank Rate Monitor, of North Palm Beach, Fla., said that sponsors of co-branded credit cards, including General Motors, A.T.& T. and General Electric, "are trying to create more brand awareness and move more products" by offering rebates or other incentives. "The upshot for consumers is that it is putting downward pressure on rates," he said, but it is also adding to saturation and confusion.
With General Motors cards, users can get 10 percent off the purchase of new G.M. cars; with A.T.& T. users can get a 10 percent discount on long-distances calls, and General Electric cards offer rebates at a variety of stores. In addition, G.M. has teamed up with some partners, including Mobil, for additional rebates.
General Motors is expected to announced today that it will allow its card to be used in some foreign countries, but no further enhancements are expected, according to an industry executive who did not want to be identified.
Studies have shown that the average household credit card user buys about $3,000 a year on credit cards. Thus, Shell estimated that the typical user's gasoline rebates could be about $60 to $70 a year, provided the card is used not only for gas but also for most other credit card purchases.
However, Mr. Heady cautioned, consumers should look beyond the rebates and compare cards' annual fees, interest rates and grace periods on purchases in deciding which cards to use. Cards with no annual fees are best for customers who pay off their charges each month, he said, while those with low interest rates are best for people who carry balances.
 
Annual Fee Rules
 With the Shell-Chemical card, there is no annual fee for the first year for those who sign up before April 30, 1994, and the annual fee will be waived thereafter if the card is used at least six times a year. The initial interest rate will be 15 percent -- prime rate plus 9 percent. The grace period is 25 days on gasoline purchases, but interest is charged immediately on other purchases, partly offsetting the 2 percent interest rates.
In comparison, Mr. Heady said, the average rate on credit cards issued by the 100 largest banks and thrift units is 17.95 percent, and most have a grace period of 25 to 30 days. However, he added, much lower rates are available for people with good credit ratings. For example, Arkansas Federal Card Services, Little Rock, Ark., in conjunction with the Wachovia Corporation, Winston-Salem, N.C., offers variable rate cards that are now at 7.75 percent and have a $50 annual fee.
As the oil companies install automatic equipment at their stations where drivers can fuel up and pay by credit card without the need for an attendant, they have expanded the types of cards customers can use to buy gas. This has made most oil company cards, which offer no rebates, less competitive.
Bill Schutzenhofer, the vice president of marketing for Shell, said that "the future of oil company cards hangs in the balance. It's not that people don't like them or use them, but there are so many new potential offerings."
Shell will continue to offer its own card, he said, but he predicted that most people would chose the combination card with the rebates.
Chemical will offer the card to about 9 million customers by direct mail, including about 4 million of the 6 million current holders of a Shell card.
 
Ad Campaign Planned
 Charles R. Walsh, the executive vice president who heads Chemical's retail card servicers group, said that it would be one of the biggest introductions of a credit card, accompanied with a nationwide advertising campaign.
The average consumer buys about 500 to 600 gallons of gasoline a year. Thus, Shell estimated, if the average card user earns rebates of $70 a year, it would amount to a 10 percent reduction of the user's annual gasoline bill.
The rebates would be awarded each month and would be automatically applied to future purchases of Shell gasoline, except in New Jersey.
Shell spent about $1 million in market research on the card. Shell, which has about 8,700 service stations in the United States, is one of the largest gasoline retailers in the country.

HEADLINE: Prime Rate Cut to 5 1/2% By Morgan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Morgan Guaranty Trust Company reduced its prime lending rate to 5 1/2 percent from 6 percent yesterday, the first among the nation's largest banks to take that step.
While the rate cut matters little to Morgan's customers, millions of individuals and small businesses could benefit if other banks follow. Because Morgan's business is concentrated in trading and in advising large companies -- with little consumer or business lending pegged to the prime, other bankers and analysts said the large New York bank was cutting the price of something it does not sell. 
 "It's very bizarre, and can only hurt their brethren at other banks," said George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities. "Maybe they are looking for some favor from Washington," he added, noting that the Clinton Administration is counting on low interest rates to stimulate the economy.
 
Matched by Harris
 The first bank to match Morgan's 5 1/2 percent rate was the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, a $10 billion asset bank owned by the Bank of Montreal.
"We want to compete aggressively for new business, and lowering the prime rate is one way to do that," Donald S. Hunt, president of Harris Trust, said. Since Harris broke ranks on Sept. 17 by lowering its prime to 5 3/4 percent, Mr. Hunt said, it has experienced a "strong increase in customer inquires."
Even if the inquiries do not result in enough new loans to compensate immediately for the decline in revenue caused by the lower rate, Mr. Hunt said, the rate-cutting approach is best for the bank because it builds good will among customers. "I sure have not had any customer call me to say 'I wish you hadn't cut the prime,' " he said.
Several large banks, including Chemical in New York, decided yesterday morning to hold their prime rates at 6 percent. But the idea that banks would eventually cut the prime rate and suffer reduced profits as a result was widespread enough to push bank stocks lower. Among the biggest losers, apart from Morgan, which fell $1.625, to $74.50, were Citicorp, down $1.75, to $35.625, and the Chemical Banking Corporation, down $1.5, to $42.
Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimated that a half-point cut in the prime would not be devastating to bank profits. Those profits have been at record levels the last year partly because of an unusually wide spread between the rates banks pay for deposits and the rates they earn on loans and investments. At Citicorp, whose credit card business helps give it more loans linked to the prime than any other bank, they estimated that the cut could cost $75 million after taxes, or about 3 percent of the profits analysts expect next year.
According to Federal Reserve surveys of bank lending, the proportion of business loans tied to the prime has declined in recent years. In August, the Fed's most recent survey period, about 33 percent of loans issued by banks were tied to the prime rate, excluding overnight loans, which are assumed to be for very large companies and tied to other interest rates. In the mid- and late-80's, up to half of the business loans made for longer than overnight were tied to prime.
 
Growing Consumer Impact
 While businesses are shedding ties to the prime, consumers are becoming more closely linked to it, through home equity loans and credit cards. About 38 percent of credit cards issued by banks carry interest rates pegged to the prime, according to Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research.
Richard Mahoney, a spokesman for J. P. Morgan & Company, the holding company for Morgan Guaranty, said the rate cut was based on loan demand, which has been weak; the cost of funds, which has been well below what the bank earns on loans and investments, and the outlook for continued low inflation.
Those conditions have prevailed in the last year, with the exception of inflation, which was higher earlier this year but seems to have subsided. Last week, the Government reported that consumer prices were flat in September.
Morgan, like other large banks, adopted the 6 percent prime in July 1992. At 5 1/2 percent, the prime is at its lowest since 1972.
Mr. Mahoney declined to elaborate on how many loans the bank has pegged to prime, though he noted that "obviously it is not as great as other banks."
Morgan's cut in the prime was not the first time it has made other banks uncomfortable. In 1989, it set aside reserves to cover all its remaining loans to less-developed countries, a move that many other banks could not afford to match because they were not as strong financially as J. P. Morgan.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A First Boston analyst sees great things for Crown Cork and Seal.

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
BOTTLE caps and aluminum cans, on the face of it, are pretty mundane items. But a First Boston analyst says that many on Wall Street "just don't get it" by not jumping at shares of Crown Cork and Seal, the world's No. 2 plastic bottle and aluminum can maker.
Timothy P. Burns has broken ranks with his analyst brethren who have neutral ratings on the Philadelphia-based packaging company. He claims Crown Cork is a "strong buy" based on the company's good showing during difficult times for its industry and because of some strategic decisions that are reshaping the $3.7 billion company. Though his opinion is in the minority, it carries a lot of weight, largely because Mr. Burns snared the No. 1 spot in the latest rankings of packaging analysts by Institutional Investor magazine. 
 "This is absolutely the time to buy," said Mr. Burns, in a telephone interview from Paris, where he was calling on some of Crown Cork's overseas rivals. "This is one of the worst cycles for rigid- packaging companies, and Crown Cork is doing so much better than the others. Wall Street just doesn't get it."
Other analysts such as John Tumazos, a leading analyst in the mining and metals industry at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, are far less enthusiastic. "It's a company for conservative investors," said Mr. Tumazos, who calls the stock moderately attractive. "These aren't markets that fluctuate wildly, like a steel company that can lose millions in a quarter, and this company is aware of changes taking place."
Crown Cork has historically been one of the "crowns" of American investing. Located in industrial North Philadelphia, the company's array of bottle caps, fasteners and cans led to a 19.3 percent annual growth rate in its share price for the 36 years beginning in 1956. Not surprisingly, the company had a cultlike following among investors, including, for a long time, Peter Lynch, the legendary former manager of the Magellan Fund.
But times have changed. The master of Crown Cork's success, John F. Connolly -- also known as the "iron man" for his attention to cost control -- died in 1990 and William J. Avery replaced him. Under Mr. Avery, the company has expanded from a regional player to become the leading supplier of traditional metal packaging and a mover in the new world of plastics. This follows a shift in consumer taste away from imbibing soft drinks in aluminum cans to drinking sparkling water and new "clear" drinks in rigid plastic containers.
To meet this demand, Crown Cork has recently acquired three plastic container manufacturers and has shifted its product mix so that now 22 percent of its sales come from plastic containers, compared with 2 percent in 1990. For this reason, Mr. Burns touts the stock. "They are aware of the new environment and have dramatically altered their product mix at the right time when traditional beverage cans have run out of steam," said Mr. Burns, who estimates that the company will earn $2.05 a share in 1993 and $2.40 in 1994; it earned $1.79 in 1992. Crown Cork's shares closed yesterday at $37.75, 18.4 times his 1993 earnings estimate.
At the same time, Mr. Burns says Crown Cork has weathered industrywide problems better than its global rivals, whose operating profits have declined while Crown Cork's continue to rise. These problems include hold-the-line prices paid by the beverage industry for containers, industry productivity gains that have exceeded growth in product demand and depressed economies in many countries.
Richard Palm, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who tied for third among packaging analysts on the Institutional Investor list, is unconvinced. He sees Crown Cork earning $2.05 in 1993 and $2.30 in 1994, similar to Mr. Burns. But Mr. Palm gives Crown Cork a "neutral" rating and believes it will not outperform the stock market. "Management has an excellent record," he said. "But that's already reasonably reflected in the price of the stock."

There was no big news event to prompt the selling, but traders said that after the strong rally late last week the market was due for a correction. 
 "That's all this is," one trader said. "We have had a very large rally, and the market finally got beaten up."
 
 
Market 'Got Carried Away'
 Jay Goldinger, a principal in Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif., said: "The market was smoking something on Friday. People were euphoric beyond belief and got carried away. Today they woke up."
Traders looking to justify a round of profit taking were talking about an article in USA Today yesterday that said George Soros and Michael H. Steinhardt, two of the country's biggest money managers, had turned sour on the bond market.
And the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company's decision to cut its prime lending rate to 5.5 percent -- a move that some economists said was a sign of economic weakness -- was interpreted as a negative by some market participants.
Morgan's decision "could mean they are going to be more aggressive in pricing loans," another Treasury securities trader said, "and that they now think it is more profitable to increase their loan portfolios rather than keep on buying Government paper."
In recent years Morgan has veered away from traditional commercial bank activities like prime-based lending to focus on activities more commonly associated with investment banks, like securities underwriting and trading.
 
 
Concerns About Demand
 Still, with interest rates at such low levels, traders are concerned about whether commercial bank demand for Treasury securities will remain strong.
Purchases of Government bills, notes and bonds by banks, which have faced weak loan demand and financial difficulties of their own, have surged in recent years.
As of August, banks owned $714 billion of Government securities, according to Federal Reserve statistics. That figure is up roughly 13 percent from a year ago, which in turn was up 24 percent from August 1991.
Aside from these factors, traders said coming auctions of new two-year and five-year Treasury notes -- expected to be announced on Wednesday -- created selling pressure on outstanding short-term securities.
"At the rates we were trading at on Friday, there is no way that paper could have been absorbed," another trader said. "The market is getting beaten up to make it a reasonable buy again."
 
 
Treasury Auction
 On Wednesday, the Treasury is expected to announce that it intends to sell $16.5 billion of new two-year notes and $11 billion of new five-year securities.
Interest rates rose slightly at yesterday's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 3.06 percent, up from 3.04 percent a week ago.
Six-month bills were auctioned at an average rate of 3.14 percent, compared with 3.12 percent at last week's auction.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 6 1/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2023 were offered in late trading at a price of 10522/32 , down 27/32 , to yield 5.84 percent, up from Friday's record 25-year low of 5.78 percent.
Among note issues, the Treasury's 5 3/4 percent 10-year issue was offered at 10327/32 , down 19/32 , to yield 5.24 percent. And the 4 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 1/2, down 9/32 , to yield 4.63 percent.
 
 
Corporate Debt
 A number of corporations priced new issues yesterday despite the rise in market interest rates.
The Phillips Petroleum Company and the CIT Group were among the companies selling new debt.
Phillips offered $250 million of 30-year 7.20 percent debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The securities were priced at $100, or par, 1.22 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent 30-year bond at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is not callable, is rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
CIT offered $200 million of 15-year debentures through Morgan Stanley & Company.
The 5 7/8 percent securities were priced at 99.27 to yield 5.949 percent, 75 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is not callable for life, is rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Arbitron Decides to Pull Out Of the TV Ratings Business

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
With yet another pebble in its pouch proving a dud, the Arbitron Company left the battlefield of television ratings yesterday, unable to trip up the industry Goliath, the A. C. Nielsen Company.
Arbitron said that by the end of the year it would lay off 700 employees nationwide -- 58 percent of its staff of 1,200 -- and discontinue its ratings of syndicated programs and cable television in local markets. More than 400 of those layoffs will be in Laurel, Md., where the company's television ratings operations are based. 
 Arbitron has dominated the radio ratings business since the 1970's, but its various attempts to breach the Nielsen stronghold have made little progress.
Many broadcast executives and some advertisers are frequently critical of the accuracy of Nielsen ratings, particularly when their own programs lag, but few have been willing to support a competing service. So the ratings compiled by Nielsen, a division of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, remain the basis of more than $15 billion in advertising decisions a year.
"Much to CBS's frustration, the industry has not supported any innovation in this field," said David F. Poltrack, CBS's senior vice president of planning and research. "I can't believe there's anybody out there foolhardy enough to venture into this area."
Paul Schulman, president of the media buying company that bears his name, commented: "This is unfortunate for the industry, because we'll have only one measure. And without competition, the cost may well escalate. Everybody wants Arbitron to challenge Nielsen, but nobody wants to pay for it."
Announcing the changes, Lawrence Perlman, chairman and chief executive of the Ceridian Corporation, which owns Arbitron, said: "Arbitron has not been achieving acceptable financial results from the service and had no near-term prospects for getting it back on a profitable track. Competition in the local television and cable ratings market has been intense."
 
'Deeper Pockets'
 Stephen B. Morris, the president of Arbitron, said in a telephone interview: "We did well in TV in the 80's. But as the business got squeezed, they went down the path of one service only." Nielsen "was more aggressive and had deeper pockets," he said, adding that the competitor was better able to withstand the price competition that broadcasters had pushed for.
John A. Dimling, the president of Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings division of A. C. Nielsen, said that despite the competition, Nielsen had continued to make money on its local service. He declined to confirm Mr. Schulman's fears that Nielsen's prices would now go up, saying, "We have no specific plans to raise prices."
At a news conference in New York, Mr. Morris of Arbitron also said, "We are abandoning ratings, but we are not abandoning television." He said the company was developing qualitative research into the buying habits of television viewers and radio listeners.
"We are gathering information in five markets, selling it in those markets," he said later in a telephone interview, declining to identify the markets. "By January, we expect to have a demonstrable product, and we expect to roll it out next year."
 
 
'Pocket People Meter'
 A year ago, Arbitron announced that it was ending Scan America, a television ratings and product-buying survey that it began locally in 1987 and nationally in 1991. While CBS backed Scan America, it attracted little support from other networks and large advertisers.
Last December, Arbitron announced that it would develop for use in television ratings a "pocket people meter," to be worn by viewers. The device would record what its wearers watched by "reading" an inaudible code etched into television program sound. Mr. Morris said yesterday that the project was proceeding on schedule and could be introduced in 1995 if Arbitron found demand for it.
Ceridian said it would take a $67 million charge in the fourth quarter because of the Arbitron layoffs.
Also yesterday, the company, which is based in Minneapolis, said third-quarter net income rose 15 percent, to $10.7 million, or 25 cents a share, from $9.3 million, or 22 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.8 percent, to $208.9 million.
The company's share price ended the day yesterday down 25 cents, at $19.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Dollar Up on Expectation Of Lower Rates in Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against most leading currencies yesterday as investors expected Germany and other countries to lower their interest rates.
"The dollar seems to have won on a default basis," said Belal Khan, a senior dealer for the Bank of Tokyo in New York.
 
Money Supply Under Control
 In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.6395 German marks, up from 1.6165 on Friday. The dollar also rose to 107.45 Japanese yen, from 107.10. 
 Currency traders said the dollar was bolstered by expectations that Germany would ease its tight monetary policy. They expect a drop this week in the repurchase rate, the Bundesbank's main instrument to influence money market rates.
Peter Michaels, an assistant vice president at Fuji Bank in New York, said the market also expected that the latest German money supply figures would fall within targets. The Bundesbank has maintained high interest rates to choke a rise in the money supply and inflation.
David Gilmore of MCM Currencywatch said the change in the repurchase rate was not expected to be large.
"It's more an indication of an easier monetary policy stance having been adopted," he said.
Other European countries were also expected to lower interest rates to stimulate their recession-bound economies. Lower rates overseas make United States rates, and in turn the dollar, more attractive to investors.
"It's not as much strength on the U.S. side of the ratio, it's weakness on the European side" that's benefiting the dollar, Mr. Gilmore said.
The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, one of the largest banks in the United States, dropped its prime lending rate half a percentage point, to 5 1/2 percent yesterday. The move did not affect the dollar because the prime is considered a lagging rate that responds to established interest rate trends.
In New York trading, the British pound slipped to $1.4860, from $1.5105 on Friday.
Other rates in New York late yesterday, compared with late Friday, included: 1.4465 Swiss francs, up from 1.4263; 5.7965 French francs, up from 5.7265; 1,599.00 Italian lire, up from 1,588.00, and 1.3250 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3315.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
A Bank's Prime-Rate Cut Spurs Another Gain by Gold

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The price of gold rose yesterday to the highest level since the beginning of September, after Morgan Guaranty Trust Company lowered its prime lending rate, a move that could help increase the demand for gold.
Morgan Guaranty, the nation's fourth-largest bank, cut its rate on loans for its most creditworthy customers, its prime rate, to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. Traders said this aided gold prices, as did speculation that German interest rates would be cut in the next few weeks. 
 Lower interest rates often buoy economic growth, and, traders say, can increase the demand for gold from industrial users and jewelry makers.
Alluding to gold prices, Ronald Spurga, vice president for commodities finance at ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. in New York, said yesterday: "The primary reason for the rise was Morgan's cut in the prime rate. Lower interest rates lower the cost of carrying inventories, including gold and precious metals."
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery gained $3.40, to $369.60 an ounce.
The prices of other precious metals rose, too, with December silver picking up 7 cents, to settle at $4.425 an ounce on the Comex. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, January platinum gained $3.50, to $372.90 an ounce, and December palladium increased $1.75, to $132.80 an ounce.
Gold traders remain focused on supply and demand, analysts said. "It's a continuation of what we saw last week," when commodity funds bought gold in the hope of an upturn in the economy, said Michael Martin of Sinclair Group in New York.
The traders assume that a stronger economy would translate to greater demand from jewelry makers. October and November are the months of peak demand for gold, as jewelers prepare for the Christmas season. Jewelry makers account for about 75 percent of demand for delivered gold, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd.
On the oil market, prices for crude oil fell for the fifth consecutive session, as traders dismissed reports of increased confrontation on the Iraq-Kuwait border and instead focused on big supplies and weak demand. Light crude oil for November delivery lost 14 cents, to settle at $18.13 a barrel. Oil prices have fallen roughly 3 percent in the last week, after surging in the wake of an agreement within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit production.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Gap Widens

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 18

 BODY:
The high yen and continued demand for Japanese exports helped to increase Japan's trade surplus by 5.4 percent in September, to $12.73 billion, the Finance Ministry announced today.
It was the 33d consecutive month in which Japanese exports exceeded imports by a larger amount than a year earlier. 
 Japan's surplus with the United States rose 17 percent, to $5.67 billion, the ministry said. America's gradual economic recovery has encouraged consumption of Japanese products, while economic sluggishness in Japan has dampened Japanese demand for imports.
The September surplus was larger than expected. Many economists in Japan had predicted it would fall below the $12.08 billion registered in September 1992, ending the long expansion trend.
The ministry said exports rose 6 percent, to $33.52 billion, while imports grew 6.4 percent, to $20.79 billion.
Japan's trade surplus has ballooned in recent years as the nation's domestic economic slowdown has reduced demand for imports and the yen's rapid rise has increased dollar-denominated trade figures.
Exports to the United States rose 13 percent, to $10.19 billion, while imports grew 7.5 percent, to $4.52 billion, the ministry said.
Japan measures trade on a customs-clearance basis, which means that freight and insurance charges are included in imports but not in exports.

Pass the Hoagies And Cheese Steaks

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
When former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston once said that he'd rather be a lamppost in Denver than the mayor of Philadelphia, probably not a lot of people argued. The same probably applied when W. C. Fields said if the choices were either being dead or being in the City of Brotherly Love, then perhaps, all things considered, he'd rather be in Philadelphia.
Unfortunately for the city stuck in the backbone of the country's East Coast corridor, the identity crisis and the fight for respect have always been somewhat losing battles. 
 Well, the battles have ceased, for now. The Philadelphia Phillies, with their anti-Club Med flavor and aversions to conformity and compromise, have shown an entire city the way.
Forget conventional wisdom, white wine and the hair mousse, dude. Pass the cheese steaks and the hoagies and get on with life. That, the National League champion Phillies have let it be known, is what they intend to do as they continue their funny-bone tickling ride through the World Series.
That they fit Philadelphia as well as they contrast with the Toronto Blue Jays, their staid World Series opponents, is obvious. And that they enjoy the differences on the field as much as the blend with their city off the field has made the Philadelphia story all the more special.
"The people care about this team more than any team in my recollection," said Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia. "Because they're hard-working guys who aren't afraid to get dirt on their uniforms, who aren't afraid to be a little unconventional. Because they're so different from the athlete of today. They're something special."
And they have apparently succeeded in making Philadelphia feel special. "Cities operate in great part on feel and perception," Rendell said. "And I think it really helps if people feel real good about themselves and their city. And it also helps in terms of visitors. So this thing has some direct economic benefits for us. But the indirect and the sort of psychic benefits far outweigh it."
So it is that the city, which will be host to its first Series game in 10 years tonight at Veterans Stadium, will celebrate not only the winning of the National League pennant and a possible World Series championship, but also a team that reflects the area's blue-collar, workmanlike approach. A team with a down-to-earth nature that so well reflects a metropolis in many ways more than geographically at arms length from both the cosmopolitan nature of New York to the north and gentility of Baltimore to the south.
The Phillies, with John Kruk and Pete Incaviglia, Mitch Williams and Darren Daulton as poster boys, like Philadelphia, may invite comic critiques at first glance. But respect is usually not too far behind. Atlantans, from the cosmopolitan center of the Deep South, jested about hiding their women and children from the Phillies during the National League Championship Series. But the Phillies did not purge or burn Atlanta. Merely the Braves' pennant hopes.
And Blue Jays' fans participated all week in contests that invited them to find the "Phat Phillie" or complete sentences about how "the Phillies are so ugly . . ." Ultimately, the ugliest development may well be that the Jays allowed the Phillies to return home with a satisfying split of the first two games played in Toronto's Skydome.
Like Atlanta, Toronto failed to keep the Phillies cornered. Now they must deal with the Phillies, in Philadelphia, in Games 3, 4 and 5.
The knocks will still come, of course. Which all seems to delight Philadelphians. Nothing that has unfolded has been too humbling, too close to the bone, too ethnocentric to knock what seems like hundreds of thousands of smiles that went into place the instance the Phillies clinched the pennant.
It's like they all know a wonderful secret. Rendell is convinced that they do. The Phillies are special, he believes, as much for who they are not as for who they are. "It's just that when you watch sports these days it's so disheartening to see athletes who are all blow-dried, who only care about their agents, who all tailor their image to get the maximum endorsements," Rendell said. "They're all sort of like business people. So it's great to see guys who are more like old-time ballplayers."
So it was that Rendell got no arguments, only praise, last week when he allowed the iron workers' union to put a giant red Phillies cap on top of the city's statue of William Penn, which sits atop Philadelphia's nine-story City Hall. Nothing, not even eradicating a $450 million deficit without raising taxes was such a hit, Rendell said.
That the Phillies are beloved cannot be argued. Why it should matter to a public figure should not be ignored. Rendell has read into that love a safety net in which all of Philadelphia benefited. For Rendell, like every mayor knowing his city was sitting on the verge of a big celebration, also wondered what else it was sitting on in terms of anti-social over-exuberance.
"But it was easy for both myself and the city to persuade the citizens of the city not to have any destruction after we won the pennant," he said. "Because we said, 'if you destroy property it's going to detract from the team's win.' And after all the trouble in Montreal, Chicago and Detroit, we went with one arrest and one broken window the entire night. It was awesome. And I'd like to think it was because of the team's feelings for the city."
And the city's feelings for the team.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Those Three Words

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Now here is a Government document with a lot of potential -- including the potential to make the incumbent President and his successors yearn for these safe days of Somalia, Haiti and the gulf war.
The document has to do with three words. Proliferation -- as in third-world nuclear bombs. Dual use -- as in: I sell you a chemical to make fertilizer and you use it to make biological weapons, which, to tell the truth, is what I expected you to do all along, but a dollar is a dollar. 
 Americans don't like to think much about those three words. It certainly is not because they do not bring excitement to our lives. Saddam Hussein had such a fine supply line of nuclear and dual-use items from the West that he was getting close to nuclear weapon production and felt strong enough to take on the U.S. and survive, which he did.
Maybe it's all so frightening that we prefer to push it out of our minds. Anyway, some time ago I decided to become one of those people who make themselves pests about those three words, so to work.
The document consists of replies to questions put by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, headed by Senator John Glenn, to R. James Woolsey, the C.I.A. Director.
Question. [Questions compressed by me for space reasons.] Can wars be made less likely by new regional nuclear balances of terror?
Answer. I can think of no example where the introduction of nuclear weapons has enhanced that region's security. . . . Emerging nuclear-capable states lack the strict command and control and doctrine of the superpowers.
Q. From the evidence, how effective is military force as a solution to nuclear proliferation?
A. Military force can slow nuclear weapons development programs in the short term but cannot permanently stop [them]. . . . Without international scrutiny, continued inspections, Iraq probably could rebuild, with available expertise, its nuclear weapons program and manufacture a device in about five to seven years.
Q. After the B.N.L. and B.C.C.I. scandals, will U.S. intelligence concentrate more on the financial and banking aspects of proliferation?
A. Yes. . . . Banks play a key role in facilitating arms-related gray-market deals.
Q. Can nuclear material be smuggled out of the former Soviet Union?
A. If the situation were to deteriorate and since nuclear materials are in so many different places, some of them could fall into the wrong hands and be exported and, potentially, without our knowledge.
Q. Where has the technology for proliferating countries come from?
A (condensed). Some American companies have been involved but by and large to the Mideast it was a "free flow" from Europe. Some European nations have tightened control. Principal concerns now focus on China and North Korea. Beijing has consistently regarded a nuclear-armed Pakistan as a crucial regional ally and vital counterweight to India.
Q. How many nuclear weapons do India and Pakistan have?
A. India and Pakistan have the capability to assemble . . . a small number . . . within a very short period of time. . . . The distinction between whether or not these weapons are in fact assembled or only able to be assembled within a few days is a very small distinction.
Q. About Pakistan, what would be the delivery system -- the F-16's we sold them?
A. Our best judgment right now would be the F-16's.
Q. Does Egypt have a biological weapons capability?
A. Yes, a program.
Q. Are you confident we can detect the use of biological weapons?
A. No. . . .
Q. How far ahead can you predict intentions and capabilities of nations with stockpiles of nuclear materials?
A. Substantial uncertainties could harm our ability to forecast -- especially beyond 10 years.
The U.S. has a list of "special countries" that cannot receive material that they could use or transmit to a third country for nuclear purposes, without special study and clearance.
On Oct. 6, the Administration removed 11 countries from that list. They were Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, Kuwait, Malawi, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria and Yemen. No advance notice was given to Congress.

HEADLINE: Linking Exports to Aid

 BODY:
At first glance, the Clinton Administration's new export policy is dismaying. Mr. Clinton wants to reinstitute a practice, known as tied aid, whereby the U.S. would give development aid to poor countries on condition that they purchase U.S. goods. For example, the U.S. would give Paraguay cash to help build a dam; the U.S. would also provide subsidized loans with which Paraguay would be required to buy the needed construction equipment from U.S. companies. The U.S. largely abandoned this practice 20 years ago because linking aid to exports isn't good for recipient countries or fair trade.
At second glance, however, Mr. Clinton's policy is defensible as a means to pressure other donors to cut back the suspect practice. Mr. Clinton hopes that if we play the game just a little, our trading partners will play it a whole lot less. 
 The biggest knock on linking aid to exports is that it encourages donor countries to give underdeveloped countries the wrong type of aid. Rather than paying for projects that generate the most growth, donors are tempted to pay for projects that generate the most exports. And the practice sneaks around trade rules that prohibit countries from unfairly subsidizing exports.
Distinguishing aid from export subsidies isn't easy. A donor that grants a poor country $15 million tied to a requirement that the recipient country spend $10 million on exports from the donor qualifies as substantial aid; but when the required purchase is hiked to $50 or $100 million, the package has more to do with subsidizing the sale of exports than promoting development.
Mr. Clinton is aware of these dangers and does not propose sending U.S. policy careening in the wrong direction. He will leave existing aid programs virtually unchanged so that current recipients won't be threatened by new conditions. But he would also create a small fund, of about $150 million, that the Export-Import Bank would use to match offers of other donor countries that link export sales to aid projects.
The policy would try to recapture export sales for U.S. companies lost to foreign subsidies. The hope is that other donors would then see less advantage in pursuing the policy -- compelling them either to cut back on the practice or at least to pay strict attention to guidelines that the U.S. and Western allies have recently negotiated to limit the use of export-linked aid.
Mr. Clinton proposes using tied aid to discourage its widespread use. That's a reasonable, though dangerous, tactic. The threat is that the U.S. could get carried away; not content merely to match offers by other donors, it would launch a trade war to capture new exports.
Congress should keep a sharp eye on the program to insure it doesn't degenerate into a tit-for-tat competition with U.S. trade rivals. But the threat seems farfetched. Mr. Clinton wants to use the fund prudently to convince fellow donors that there won't be much profit in the worrisome practice.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform? First Improve Child Care Aid.;
A 'Community School'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You do a tremendous service for children in your report on the neglected health needs of the city's students ("Too Ill to Learn," news article, Oct. 10). In human and in real financial terms, we pay a huge price for these false economies. 
 Two years ago, after five years of planning, the Children's Aid Society, School District 6 in Washington Heights/Inwood and the Board of Education opened a prototype public school, called a "community school," to address these health and family needs that keep children from learning. The problems can be fixed, and not always by spending more or new money. We also need to change the way we think about the school as a public institution.
In Washington Heights, for example, the community school has a health clinic that challenges all the traditional definitions of "school." It is open until 6 in the evening. It is open year round. It primarily serves the 1,300 students in the school, but it also serves their siblings and others who need care. It is staffed by Children's Aid professionals, plus parents who have been trained to give vision and hearing examinations. It uses medical and nursing students from a local hospital to offer additional services, and the hospital in turn uses the clinic as a training center. All of the school's before- and after-school programs, weekend and parent programs rely on similar partnerships and nontraditional approaches.
The result is not only a new model for public school services, but also a new financial model: one that shifts public spending from existing health, clinic and human services programs -- often redundant -- into the school, and uses it more effectively. In a community school, social service agencies become eligible for funding in school-based services, and schools qualify for funding in child protection, job training and health. There is essentially no net increase in public spending, only in child and family benefits.
If we can change the way we think about public education, we can change how we pay for it too. And what better way to manage health care than to have it cost-effective and located in the one facility, the school facility, that is so central to child and family life?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Consumer product companies seek better methods to gauge the effect of marketing on their sales.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

DATELINE: NAPLES, Fla.

 BODY:
THE more strenuously advertisers labor to achieve success in marketing consumer products, the more insistent the clamor grows to find methods to measure the effectiveness of advertising. So the 84th annual meeting and conference of the Association of National Advertisers is trying to offer some solutions.
"Advertising, as a marketing and communications tool, will never command the respect it deserves until correlation between share of voice and profitable growth is firmly established," said DeWitt F. Helm Jr., president of the association, whose members account for more than 80 percent of annual spending on national and regional advertising. 
 Peter H. Coors, vice chairman and chief executive at the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colo., explained why.
"With the economic climate as tough as it is, C.E.O.'s, board members and shareholders are looking more and more at bottom-line results," Mr. Coors told the audience at the general session yesterday. "Our marketing and advertising people must explain the short- and long-term benefits of what we're presenting to the public and be prepared to measure results, not only in sales but in profits."
Mr. Coors, who is featured in image-building campaigns for his 120-year-old family-owned brewery, praised the Silver Bullet advertising for his Coors Light brand, created by Foote, Cone & Belding of Chicago. The ads "consistently communicate our product attributes," he said, while simultaneously delivering "consistent brand volume and profit growth."
Gary M. Stibel, founder and principal at the New England Consulting Group, a marketing consulting company in Westport, Conn., shared the initial results of a study of the accountability of advertising.
If the effectiveness of advertising cannot be measured, Mr. Stibel warned, "someone is likely to insist we spend as little as possible on advertising."
"Agencies must and can be held accountable," he added. "The great agencies will welcome this."
Based on data from 1980 to 1990 provided by 15 leading association members including A.T.& T., Coors, General Electric, General Motors and Procter & Gamble, the study concluded that "advertising has a quantitative positive impact" on sales and market share, Mr. Stibel said, and is profitable "at least most of the time."
"On balance, the evidence is reasonably clear," he concluded. "Advertising works; it drives profits."
Lorraine C. Scarpa, senior vice president of marketing services at Kraft General Foods of Rye Brook, N.Y., discussed the role that "market intelligence," as she called marketing research, could play in enhancing advertising performance.
After joking that a marketing research executive's epitaph reads, "He may have helped to sell Jell-O," Ms. Scarpa praised the benefits of the new "high-tech dimension in marketing information," like the analysis of consumer purchase data reported from supermarket scanners.
For instance, scanner data revealed that of the 43 million households that buy the company's Oscar Mayer cold cuts, she said, 20 million also buy Jell-O gelatin, 20 million buy Jell-O pudding, 18 million buy Kraft salad dressings, 16 million buy Stove Top stuffing and 250,000 buy Postum grain beverage.
Ms. Scarpa described how a huge project to analyze the purchase behavior of 12,000 households last year benefited Kraft General Foods tremendously by enabling the company to focus on how it would spend $1.6 billion in advertising and consumer promotions across its 61 categories of products.
The data enabled Kraft General Foods to hone in on households that are heavy users of the products it sells, she said, by identifying that 2 percent of them "account for 50 percent of all our volume." Those households buy an average of $600 worth of Kraft General Foods products a year, she added, more than twice as much as the $250 that an average household buys.
Research from 90 Kroger supermarkets in Columbus, Ohio, found that of the average 23,000 items in a store, Ms. Scarpa said, 6,700 sold in a day, 13,600 sold in a week and 17,500 sold in a month -- leaving 5,500 that sold nothing in that month.
The shudder that swept through the audience, as advertisers pondered the prospect of marketing one of those 5,500 items, was almost palpable.
The conference, at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here, concludes today.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 21, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transmission error, the Advertising column in Business Day on Tuesday, about the effectiveness of advertising for consumer products, misstated data supplied by Lorraine C. Scarpa, senior vice president for marketing services at Kraft General Foods. Based on a survey of 12,000 households, she said, 50 percent of the company's sales volume in 61 product categories came from 20 percent of the nation's households, not from 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Achieves Fund-Raising Success

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The last time Rudolph W. Giuliani ran for mayor, he had to struggle hard in the last six weeks of the race to raise even half the amount of money that was flowing to the Democratic nominee, David N. Dinkins. He was forced to borrow $200,000 from the Republican State Committee and he asked President Bush to help coax donations from the Republican faithful.
This time, Mr. Giuliani raised all the money the law would allow him to spend with two weeks to go, even as Mayor Dinkins continued to worry about fund raising. 
 This difference reflects an impression among many of the contributors who support mayoral campaigns that he is a stronger candidate this time around. Four years ago, he trailed badly in the polls, though he ultimately lost by a thin 2 percentage points. Recent polls show a tight race.
Until about 10 months ago, most of Mr. Giuliani's money was still coming from thousands of small contributors. But as his campaign emerged with a serious chance to win, Mr. Giuliani began drawing significant support from New York City's traditional well of large contributors -- lawyers, business owners, contractors and real-estate developers who every four years bear the brunt of the election's cost. Even executives on Wall Street, where Mr. Giuliani made a number of enemies while he was United States Attorney, have contributed significantly to his campaign.
Republican strategists and fund-raisers say Wall Street has been contributing more to Mr. Giuliani's campaign because he is no longer seen as a crusader out to lock up white-collar criminals, but as a politician with whom the financiers and bond traders believe they can do business. In addition, the financial services world, by its nature, tends to back politicians who are seen as having a chance of winning, which Mr. Giuliani does this year.
"They see Giuliani's stock very differently than they saw it in 1989," said Jay Severin, a Republican political consultant. "What they saw as a contribution in 1989, they now see as an investment in someone who can win. That's what these guys live and die by. Making investments."
Mr. Giuliani's sources of money in some cases reflect some of Mr. Dinkins's political difficulties. In the last three weeks of August, for example, while the Mayor was taking a political beating over allegations that his administration steered a parking-ticket contract to a scandal-tainted company, Mr. Giuliani reaped about $852,000 in contributions and saw a surge of support from Wall Street and big business, campaign records indicate.
A group of 62 Korean owners of small businesses has collected $15,075 for Mr. Giuliani because they were angered by the Mayor's hands-off approach to a black-led boycott of a Korean grocer in Brooklyn in 1991. In another example, about 190 electrical contractors who assert that they have been excluded from city contracts have banded together to raise $42,196 for the Republican-Liberal candidate.
Fund raising is not as crucial a battleground in this year's race as in past years because both candidates have agreed to participate in the city's campaign finance program, limiting their overall spending to $8 million -- not including some expenditures that are exempt from the rules -- and agreeing to keep each donation under $6,500 in return for public funds. While the rules of the program are complex, political strategists say candidates can generally expect public funds to cover about a third of their $8 million in spending.
Since neither campaign appears to be in danger of falling short of the $8 million limit, how and when the candidates spend their funds has become a more important question in the last three weeks than who is raising and spending the most.
By Sept. 27, the most recent filing date for campaign finance reports, Mr. Giuliani had raised $6.6 million from about 16,000 contributors, compared with the $2.5 million from 9,300 donors he had raised at this point four years ago. Since July 11, the Republican campaign has outstripped Mr. Dinkins in raising money by almost a 2-to-1 ratio, collecting about $2.7 million to the Mayor's $1.5 million.
Mr. Giuliani had approximately $3.5 million in the bank for the last three weeks of the campaign, said the deputy campaign manager, Tamra Roberts Lhota.
Mr. Dinkins still has approximtely $700,000 left to raise, though his aides predict he will meet that goal with several fund-raisers, including a benefit concert tonight by Bette Midler and an event tomorrow with Vice President Gore.
One reason the Giuliani campaign has been more successful raising money this time around is that the candidate began earlier and has spent far more time going to small fund-raisers, Ms. Lhota said.
The current drive began nearly two years ago, in November 1991, and Mr. Giuliani has so far attended almost 289 events to raise cash, ranging from tiny house parties to large $1,000-a-plate dinners. He made it a habit to hold breakfast meetings with partners at law firms, for instance.
 
Well-Known Contributors
 Ms. Lhota said Republican contributors were heartened by Mr. Giuliani's showing in 1989, and were convinced that he could win this time. "People felt with a little more money sooner in 1989 we could have won," she said.
Mr. Giuliani's largest contributors include some well-known names among Republicans. Members of the Rockefeller family and its foundation have donated a total of $31,100. Robert A. Mosbacher, the former Secretary of Commerce under President Bush, and his wife, Georgette, a cosmetics executive, have given $11,500.
Mr. Giuliani has also garnered strong support from prominent law firms where he has friends and former associates. Partners at Rogers & Wells -- which represents the city in bond negotiations -- have given a total of $20,325, and several lawyers at Leboeuf, Lamb, Leiby & McCrae have funneled $14,200 to the Republican campaign. Members of Mr. Giuliani's own law firm -- Anderson, Kill, Olick & Oshinsky -- have contributed $19,375, and $13,950 came from members of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn, where Mr. Giuliani's professional mentor, former Deputy Attorney General Arnold I. Burns, is a partner.
Bond underwriters, investment bankers and other Wall Street executives have channeled heavier financial support to Mr. Giuliani than they did in 1989, though all told the financial-services world appears to be tilting toward the incumbent, records show. Employees of the 30 firms that are in the city's syndicate of bond sellers have given a total of about $344,000 to Mr. Giuliani, including $64,930 from Merrill Lynch & Company employees and $60,338 from traders at Bear Stearns & Company.
Mr. Giuliani also raised a significant amount of money from some Wall Street firms that do little or no city business. The partners in Forstmann, Little & Company and their families, for instance, have given a total of $28,500. In another example, Edward J. Rappa, the founder of R. W. Pressprich, a small, three-year-old bond house, has given $27,960 to Mr. Giuliani through personal contributions, his employees and his wife.
"I got a real stake in this city, an emotional stake, an economic stake, and I really can't stand what's going on," Mr. Rappa said.
A few real-estate developers and management companies have thrown their monetary heft behind Mr. Giuliani, though most of them are also giving to Mr. Dinkins. Among Mr. Giuliani's top contributors are the owners and principals of the Mendik Company, the Mack Company, Fisher Brothers Development and Grace Industries. Donald Trump, though he has yet to contribute himself, has raised more than $19,500 from other people for the Giuliani campaign.
Construction companies and contractors have given in large numbers to Mr. Giuliani as well. By Sept. 20, at least 347 contracting companies or their employees had donated a total of $237,820 to Mr. Giuliani's election effort, records show.

World Bank Issues Bond in Marks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The World Bank began selling its first global bond issue denominated in German marks yesterday, and officials said demand was very strong.
Kenneth G. Lay, director of the financial operations department at the World Bank, said the lead underwriters for the 3 billion mark ($1.83 billion) 10-year issue, Salomon Brothers and Deutsche Bank, were telling investors that the deal was oversubscribed several times, so they would not get the bonds they had requested. 
 He also said the new issue, which will be formally priced this morning, was likely to be at the bottom of a range of 6 to 8 basis points above the yield on the 10-year German bond, which was at 5.87 percent yesterday. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Traded Globally
 A global bond can be traded in any big markets, from New York to London to Tokyo. Most global issues are denominated in dollars, but the World Bank has also done four of them in Japanese yen.
For the World Bank, which has done 14 global bond issues since 1989, such offerings provide a way to diversify and expand its pool of investors. In addition, Mr. Lay said, a global issue is designed "to bring to bear on a single issue the full range of investor demand." If the bank is successful, then the broader demand will lower its borrowing costs.
But a global bond issue presents challenges as technicians at the World Bank figure out how to hurdle legal and other obstacles that could keep the offering from being successful or make its trading difficult. "Each of these cases present a special set of problems," Mr. Lay said.
The work that Mr. Lay and his staff do is is necessary, he said, "to establish the link that allows bonds to flow from Germany to the United States and to Japan."
This issue has been in the works since the summer of 1992. Mr. Lay said that was partly because of the time it took to work out the differences in laws in the United States and Germany so that investors who buy the bonds here and in Germany can buy them and trade them easily.
Mr. Lay said one benefit of all the technical work is that it is now easier for wealthy individual investors in the United States to hold these bonds. The World Bank has worked out a system that allows investors to pay for the bonds in dollars, which will be converted to marks by an intermediary bank, in this case Citicorp. In addition, all interest payments made in marks are automatically converted into dollars.
The investment, however, is still subject to the gains and losses that can come with fluctuations in the value of the dollar against the mark.
The other American buyers of the this bond, Mr. Lay said, are portfolio managers with large funds that include European and Japanese bonds in addition to American Treasury issues.
Because the yield on the World Bank bond is so close to that of the German 10-year bond and because of the high credit quality of World Bank paper, the new issue will trade very much like a 10-year German bond.
The issue is also expected to be attractive to managers who want to bet on the expected decline in interest rates in Germany, which will push the prices higher on German bonds and bonds denominated in marks. Because the issue is so large and should be relatively easy to trade, it can be simpler to sell than a actual German bond.
Some of these managers are likely to hedge the currency risk by selling marks for dollars when the bonds are bought.
 
Treasury Market
 In the Treasury market, prices and yields were little changed yesterday after three hectic trading sessions in a row. The yield on the 30-year bond finished at 5.84 percent, unchanged from Monday. The price of the bond, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 3/32 .
The only economic news of the day was the report that housing starts rose 2.8 percent in September, which was a much stronger performance than expected. There was selling after the report, but then buyers came in and the bond rebounded. Treasury notes were unchanged on the day, and the discount rates on the three- and six-month bills stayed at 3.04 percent and 3.12 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Flat as Traders Await Activity in European Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished little changed against most leading currencies yesterday as traders awaited news on whether Germany and other European countries would drop interest rates.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6411 German marks, up from 1.6395 marks. But it slipped to 107.16 Japanese yen, from 107.45 yen. 
 Meanwhile, gold prices rose in the United States after falling in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery closed at $370.30 an ounce, up 70 cents. And the Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $368.75 an ounce, up 75 cents.
Traders said most currencies moved within narrow trading ranges. "Today is what you might call a calm-down day," said Robert Ryan, a vice president at Bank of New York. "We haven't made any progress up or down."
He said the strength of the dollar resulted from a number of factors. One was the weaknesses in the economies of France and Belgium, which are expected to lead to interest rate cuts in those countries.
Drop in Currencies Likely
Such actions might stimulate the economies, but will probably drive down the value of the currencies in those countries because investors will get lower returns.
Also supporting the dollar, Mr. Ryan said, were the predictions by some economists of stronger United States gross domestic product figures for the fourth quarter.
Other traders said the market was awaiting figures on the German money supply, which indicate the strength of inflation in that country. If the numbers are low, Germany might loosen its tight monetary policy.
Germany could lower its securities repurchase rate or -- a less likely possibility -- cut the key discount rate on Thursday, when the central bank's policy-setting Central Council meets. The lower interest rates would probably cause the mark to fall.
"People are pretty much gearing up for statements from Germany," said John Nelson, the director of foreign exchange at Barclays Bank in New York.
The British pound, meanwhile, was quoted in New York at $1.4897, down from $1.4980 on Monday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper, Stockpiles Rising, Hits Lowest Level in 6 Years

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Copper fell sharply for the second straight session yesterday, tumbling to its lowest level in six years amid rising stockpiles and weaker-than-expected demand.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for December delivery fell 0.70 cent, to 73.15 cents a pound. Over the last six weeks, prices have fallen about 15 percent. 
 The London Metals Exchange reported yesterday that stockpiles had risen by about 2,500 tons, to 603,700 tons, their highest levels since 1984. The last time copper stockpiles were this high prices were about 10 cents a pound lower, at about 63 cents a pound.
A global recession, particularly in Europe and Japan, has depressed industrial demand for copper, while mine production has held steady.
"We've got a very significant overhang of excess metal on the market," said John Gross at BICC Cables in West Nyack, N.Y. "The market will continue to deteriorate, unless something dramatic happens to increase demand."
 
Counting on a Price Rise
 Copper companies have been counting on a rise in prices as growing economies, especially China's, soak up production.
Placer Dome Inc. said yesterday that it would spend $600 million to develop a copper deposit in Chile.
On other futures markets, lumber prices slipped for the first time in six sessions even though the Government reported unexpected increases in housing starts and construction. November lumber closed $3.50 higher, at $320.50 per 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Lumber had risen almost 7.5 percent since Oct. 7 as mills marked up prices to take advantage of improved demand from builders.
Elsewhere, crude oil fell for the sixth consecutive session. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light crude for November delivery slipped 7 cents, to $18.06 a barrel.

Los Angeles Times Offers A 3d Buyout

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19

 BODY:
In its latest effort to cope with a persistent advertising slump, The Los Angeles Times is pursuing yet another voluntary employee buyout program to reduce overhead, Times officials confirmed today.
Under the program, announced internally at the paper on Monday, The Los Angeles Times said it hoped to eliminate at least 100 jobs and save $5 million a year. Newsroom, transportation, mailroom, fleet operations, security, finance and prepress employees are eligible for the program. 
 The Times has undertaken several cost-cutting measures since the recession hit Southern California in 1990. Through attrition and two other buyout programs it has reduced its work force by 23 percent, to 6,700 people, resulting in an annual saving of $105 million, the paper said.
In addition, it closed its San Diego edition last November and is considering selling its downtown Los Angeles headquarters and moving into a high-rise office tower.
The Times, which with a circulation of 1,138,353 is the flagship paper of the Times Mirror Company, also plans to turn its regional sections into tabloids and reduce the frequency of publication for some of them, Times officials disclosed.
 
Less Frequent Publication
 The Times publishes its San Gabriel and Southeast/Long Beach sections twice a week and its South Bay section four times a week. After January they will be weeklies. The Westside section, serving the city's most affluent areas, including Beverly Hills and Westwood, will continue to appear twice a week.
"The Times is fortunate to have been able to reduce staffing levels through voluntary means, unlike so many other United States companies," David Laventhol, publisher and chief executive, said in a statement. "We remain committed to the goal of avoiding layoffs of full-time staff."
It is offering the buyout program to all full-time employees on its regional sections. In a buyout program earlier this year, Times editors said they were surprised by the number of employees -- including about 130 in the newsroom -- who chose to leave. There are now just over 1,000 news employees and the paper expects about 30 to take the new buyout offer.

HEADLINE: Low Mortgage Rates Push Up Housing Starts

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Construction of new housing was at its highest in three and a half years in September as low mortgage rates helped place the sector on solid ground, the Commerce Department said today.
Starts on new single-family homes and apartments rose 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million -- the strongest since 1.44 million in February 1990. 
 That followed a 6.7 percent jump in August building activity, revised down from a previously reported 7.8 percent gain.
 
 
Optimistic Outlook

 
 Also, a third consecutive monthly increase in building-permit applications signaled even more construction activity ahead. Permits edged up eight-tenths of a percent in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.25 million, after increases of 6.9 percent in August and 4.2 percent in July.
"We mean jobs," said Roger Blunt, a Pittsburgh-area construction executive and president of the National Association of Home Builders. "Every 100,000 housing starts means 175,000 jobs."
September's construction increase was concentrated entirely in new apartments, which boomed 52 percent to an annual rate of 210,000. They fell 17.9 percent in August.
Construction of single-family homes fell 3 percent last month, down from a 10.5 percent jump in August. This crucial category measures consumers' willingness to take on long-term commitments.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the report "gives us confidence that the housing rebound triggered by lower interest rates is being sustained."
Starts increased in every region of the country last month except the South, where they fell from August levels.
 
 
A Boom Sector
 Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, noted that housing starts in the third quarter rose 4 percent from the second quarter, as housing added impetus to the economy's slow recovery from the 1990-91 recession.
"Let's put it this way," he said. "If the rest of the economy in the past two years had recovered at anywhere near the same rate that housing has, we would be experiencing a boom right now."
Financing options remain exceptionally favorable, with mortgage rates at their lowest in a generation. Rates for a 30-year loan were under 7 percent through September and dipped last week to a 25-year low of 6.81 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
The National Association of Home Builders reported Monday that a survey of its members found buoyant expectations for sales over the next six months. Some 62 percent saw sales on the rise, the most upbeat assessment by builders in years, the association said.
The Government said overall starts in September were up 12.3 percent in the Northeast, up 5.3 percent in the Midwest, and up 2.8 percent in the West. They fell five-tenths of a percent in the South.

O'Hare Airport Refunding

 BODY:
The largest negotiated municipal offering yesterday was a $642.97 million airport bond refunding by the City of Chicago, which was initially priced to yield a maximum 5.30 percent for a bond due in 2016 through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Proceeds from the bond sale of $323.2 million in general airport revenue refunding bonds and $319.8 million in general airport second-lien revenue refunding bonds for O'Hare International Airport in Chicago will be used to redeem bonds that were sold when interest rates were higher and to lower debt-service payments. 
 For investors in a 31 percent tax bracket, the taxable bond equivalent yield for a bond due in 2016 is about 7.68 percent.
The general airport revenue refunding bonds include serials with shorter maturities priced to yield from 4.80 percent in 2004 to 5 percent in 2006, with an issue due in 2013 priced to yield 5.34 percent. Assuming a 31 percent tax bracket, the taxable bond equivalents would be about 6.96 percent in 2004 and 7.25 percent in 2006, with the issue due 2013 at about 7.74 percent.
Underwriters said the general airport second-lien bonds were initially priced to yield 5 percent in 2007 to 5.12 percent in 2011, with an issue due in 2018 at 5.29 percent. The taxable equivalents would yield about 7.25 percent in 2007 to 7.42 percent in 2011, with a taxable equivalent yield for an issue due in 2018 at about 7.67 percent.
The general airport revenue issue carries an A-1 rating from Moody's Investors Service and an A+ rating from Standard & Poor's, while the second-lien revenue issue is rated triple-A because of insurance coverage by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation.

HEADLINE: Yankees Would Create Environmental Nightmare in Midtown

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York's Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Urban Development Corporation propose to build a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan to keep the ball club from moving to New Jersey. But why should New Yorkers give the Yankees even $20 million a year, the cost of financing a new stadium, to congest and pollute Manhattan? 
 The Governor is willing to find the Yankees $500 million to appease their owner, George Steinbrenner, who blackmailed Mayor John V. Lindsay into spending $110 million in taxpayer dollars to refurbish Yankee Stadium two decades ago and who is doing it again to Mayor David N. Dinkins and Governor Cuomo. Enough!
Overlooked is the Clean Air Act. New York and New Jersey are in "severe non-attainment" for ozone pollution. They must show they can meet Federal clean-air standards by 2007. Right now both are in default.
In midtown, a stadium with a parking garage for 7,800 cars would make attainment of standards more difficult. If the states cannot demonstrate compliance, both face severe sanctions. In New York, this means the loss of $1 billion in highway funds annually, including $400 million now transferred to transit. Under these conditions, it is unrealistic to expect that a garage of this size could get a state permit in Manhattan.
What should be done? Make Yankee Stadium work where it is. Build the proposed Metro North access. Promote "subway specials." Provide safe parking. Use new technology to move traffic better on the Major Deegan. Invest in the Bronx to make it inviting. Instead of abandoning cities endowed with transit, we must strengthen them.
The legal hurdles a Manhattan stadium would face demonstrate that for any major new project to go forward, New York must move more effectively to develop and implement clean-air plans. Both New York and New Jersey must cut auto use by 20 percent to meet clean-air standards, not increase it as a new stadium would do.
If the Governor wants to help New York's economy, he should focus on meeting clean-air goals. A new Yankee Stadium will do no more to save New York than circuses did for ancient Rome.

HEADLINE: Yankees Would Create Environmental Nightmare in Midtown;
Cut Stadium Prices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding the latest proposal to relocate the Yankees in midtown, if you ride the trains when the Yankees are playing, you see a curious thing: the trains to Yankee Stadium coming from Manhattan are packed with fans, while the trains to the stadium coming from the Bronx are empty. Why do so few people from the Bronx come to see the Bronx Bombers play? 
 I think it's economics, pure and simple. Low-income people, which means most of the people living near Yankee Stadium, just can't afford to spend $10.50 for the cheapest reserved seat, let alone the outlandish prices for food and drink.
My solution to the attendance problem at Yankee Stadium is to lower the ticket prices to what you'd pay for a movie, and food prices to what you'd pay in a shopping mall. What George Steinbrenner would lose per seat would more than be made up in volume.

HEADLINE: Florio's Ratings Slipping in Poll, But He's Ahead

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio's standing with the voters has begun to erode in New Jersey's race for governor, according to the latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll, but he still maintains a commanding lead over Christine Todd Whitman.
With less than two weeks to go before the Nov. 2 election, the poll shows Governor Florio leading Mrs. Whitman 49 to 34 percent among registered voters, a lead that is wider still among those who said they will definitely vote. But his performance rating has slipped, his trust rating has slipped and so has his reputation for honesty and integrity. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents think their taxes would go up if he is re-elected. 
 But even fewer people believed that Mrs. Whitman would have the necessary honesty or could be trusted to make the right decisions in office. And fully two-thirds had concluded that Mrs. Whitman herself did not really believe her tax proposals were feasible.
 
A Cynical Electorate
 The poll results paint a picture of an electorate that is deeply cynical about the candidates' motives, offering only lukewarm support for each, and that is skeptical about the contenders' major policy positions. Campaign experts, when told of the poll results, suggested that negative television advertising has begun to be reflected in a more generally negative view of the race by the voters, a trend that could depress the eventual turnout.
The poll, conducted Saturday through Monday was based on telephone interviews with 1,153 adults throughout the state, of whom 925 said they were registered to vote. The margin of sampling error for voters was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Governor Florio's lead in the trial heat over Mrs. Whitman among all registered voters represents a slight decline from the level of his support in the previous New York Times/ WCBS-TV News poll, which was conducted during the fourth week of September with 804 registered voters out of 1,010 adults. The September poll was conducted during a period that proved to be a bad week in Mrs. Whitman's campaign. The result is consistent with the results of other statewide polls taken this month.
The new survey also shows that the Governor continues to win a good deal of acceptance for his major 1990 tax increase, with the voters splitting evenly on the question of its wisdom, despite Mrs. Whitman's double-pronged charge that the taxes have both depleted the voters' finances and contributed to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the state since Mr. Florio took office in 1990.
In last month's poll, 49 percent of the voters had said the tax raises, totaling $2.8 billion annually, had been the right thing for New Jersey, while 42 percent said it had been wrong. In the new poll, 45 percent said it had been the right thing, while 47 percent disagreed.
 
Reaction to Whitman Tax Plan
 Meanwhile, the centerpiece of Mrs. Whitman's economic program, a promise to cut income taxes for most voters by 30 percent over three years, has clearly fallen on barren electoral ground: as many voters said such a cut would be wrong for the state as said it would be right; and 65 percent said the tax cut idea was a promise Mrs. Whitman knew she could not keep, while 24 percent disagreed.
By a ratio of more than 2 to 1, they said they believed Mr. Florio knew he would have to raise taxes during his 1989 campaign, despite his position at the time that he saw no need for new levies.
But perhaps the most telling story of the new poll lies in the evidence that the previous poll's high level of "don't knows" and "no answers" have begun to coalesce into distinct political opinions, and that Governor Florio's standing has suffered, however slightly, on every measure in the new poll compared to the old.
The evidence of rising negativity is exactly why no one should consider today's polling results conclusive for the race, said Lee Seglem, managing editor of New Jersey Reporter, an independent, nonprofit public affairs bimonthly. Flux in public opinion that reveals itself in the final weeks of a campaign, he said, will likely increase in volatility as the days count down to the vote, and as the clangor of the campaign rises in pitch.
"I wouldn't bet on this race even now," Mr. Seglem said. "This is a very volatile campaign, it's really going to tighten in the last 10 days, and I think it's going to be decided by 2 or 3 percentage points when we're all done."
Indeed, opinion-poll leaders have turned into election-day losers several times in New Jersey's turbid political atmosphere. Mr. Florio lost to Thomas H. Kean in 1981 after leading in the opinion surveys for most of the race, and Brendan Byrne staged a come-from-behind upset in his race for governor four years before.
With that background, the Whitman campaign is likely to read the portents of softness in Mr. Florio's armor with particular care.
"We still have two weeks to go," said Carl Golden, Mrs. Whitman's spokesman, when apprised of the latest Times/WCBS-TV News poll. "There's enough time for her to drive home her message about creating new jobs in a healthy economy."
In the new poll, fewer voters had a favorable opinion of the Governor than in the last poll, fewer of them approved of his performance in office, fewer thought that he understood their needs and problems, or that he has offered specific proposals to solve the state's problems.
On the question of Mr. Florio's competence, which the Governor has made a keystone of his campaign against an opponent he characterizes as inexperienced and out of touch, the poll respondents reversed themselves since the last survey. Then, by a ratio of 51 to 40, they said Mr. Florio could be trusted to avoid making serious mistakes in office; this time, 42 percent trusted him to avoid mistakes, and 50 percent did not.
 
Scorn for Ads
 The voters scorned the negative television advertising they said they saw coming from both sides, but they blame Mr. Florio for the negativity more than they do Mrs. Whitman.
Mrs. Whitman's standing in most categories also suffered when compared to the September opinion survey. Where she has improved -- on issues of familiarity with voters' concerns, the voters' general impression of her, trustworthiness and ability to avoid mistakes in office -- the improvements tended to be meager ones on top of already relatively small percentages, leaving her far from striking distance of the Governor in most categories.
It is a political truism that in the absence of an overriding issue, re-election campaigns tend to be referendums on the incumbent, and to that extent Mrs. Whitman clearly benefits from the kind of anti-Florio sentiment that has dotted New Jersey with bumper stickers saying "Dump Florio," and "Florio Free in '93." While only 16 percent of Governor Florio's supporters said they back him because of dislike of Mrs. Whitman, 45 percent of those supporting Mrs. Whitman said they did so not because they favor her, but because they disliked Governor Florio.
Bob Lundin, a printing supplies salesman from Roselle, was a respondent who agreed to be interviewed after the poll. He explained his support for Mrs. Whitman in straight anti-Florio terms.
"Florio has been a disaster for this state," Mr. Lundin declared. "Anybody who has a business will tell you that they're just hanging on with the taxes and the regulations that are coming down, and if we're looking at four more years of this, I don't know how anybody is going to survive -- there won't be anyone left."
In contrast, several Florio supporters who were re-interviewed after the poll pointed to positive changes in the lives of their families or their communities as the basis for their views.
Jackie Kerrigan of the shorefront community of Beechwood, who described herself as being "in the Mom business right now," said her general opinion of politicians is not a good one.
"I'm not hard-core for Florio, but I happen to live on the ocean, and in all my days of living here I find that the shore is much cleaner than it used to be, and that is really important to my friends who depend on the shore business," she said.
 
A Reason to Vote
 If Mrs. Whitman can take heart from the poll's evidence that she has inflicted some damage on Governor Florio, said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider College, she still faces the task in the remaining days to lift her own positive attributes among voters.
In that task, Dr. Rebovich said, the Republican has started late:
"You can attack all you want, but the other half of campaigning is giving voters a reason to vote for you, and I think she has done less than that," he said. "This is the point where you use television to reinforce your message, and if you don't have one at this point, I think you're in trouble."
Both sides are paying close attention to evidence of the firmness of each candidate's support, as well to the level of voter interest, which will drive turnout on election day.
For example, when registered voters who said they would definitely vote were analyzed, Governor Florio's support increased slightly to 52 percent, while Mrs. Whitman's increased by one point to 35 percent.
When this group of voters was reduced to those who also said they were paying at least some attention to the campaign, the Governor's support increased another 2 points to 54 percent, while Mrs. Whitman's support remained unchanged at 35 percent.
 
How Poll of New Jersey Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/WCBS-TV News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 16 to 18 with 1,153 adults throughout New Jersey. Of these, 925 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of New Jersey exchanges. The exchanges were chosen in a way to insure that each area of the state was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines in each residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to race, sex, age, and region of the state.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Jersey residents.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 4 percentage points for registered voters who say they will "definitely" vote on Election Day.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.
And in a poll conducted more than two weeks before an election, like this one, there are additional potential difficulties, such as dramatic events, debates, or campaign appeals that occur after the interviewing, unusual patterns of voter turnout, and the ultimate decisions made by those voters who were undecided at the time of the poll or said they might change their mind before Election Day.

HEADLINE: Local Governments May Pay More in Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Administration officials disclosed today that President Clinton's health plan would require some state and local governments to pay more than private employers for workers' health insurance.
Private employers would not have to contribute more than 7.9 percent of their payrolls. But no such limit would apply to public employers, the Administration officials said. 
 The President's decision to exempt state and local governments from that limit alienates some of his natural allies, including public employee unions, which strongly supported him in the 1992 campaign and have pleaded for a ceiling on their health insurance costs.
Officials of the United States Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the National Governors' Association and public employee unions all expressed concern about this decision.
 
At Least 10 States Affected
 They said it appeared that at least 10 states would pay more than 7.9 percent of their payrolls to provide the package of health benefits required under Mr. Clinton's plan. The states are New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Medical costs and health insurance premiums tend to be higher in states with high personal income, large numbers of doctors, a large proportion of medical specialists and a high concentration of elderly people.
Administration officials said part of their reason behind the decision not to put a limit on the cost to public employers was that state and local governments could impose taxes to help pay for employee health benefits.
In response to a question last week, Kevin Anderson, a White House spokesman, said: "The 7.9 percent cap does not apply to public employers. Their low-wage employees are eligible for the same kind of assistance on their premiums and copayments as anybody else. But the cap does not apply to them."
Administration officials disclosed details of the financing and subsidies in the President's plan as they rushed to draft legislation for submission to Congress next week.
The officials said there would be some limits on the amount of Federal money available for subsidies to small businesses and their low-wage workers. Low-income families would have a legally enforceable right to such subsidies. But the officials said it was not clear what would happen if demand for such subsidies exceeded the amount available because of a recession, an epidemic or other unforeseen events.
 
'Capped Entitlement'
 Using the jargon of budget analysts in Washington, the officials said Mr. Clinton's subsidies would probably not provide an absolute, open-ended entitlement to benefits as in the case of Social Security or Medicare, but would establish a "capped entitlement." Congress would need to appropriate additional money if claims exceeded the expected amount.
Stan Dorn, who has represented low-income people as a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, said the subsidies should not depend on the vagaries and politics of the annual budget process. "If forced to compete for money with other, better established interest groups, low-income consumers and small businesses may lose out," he said.
There were these other developments today as politicians staked out positions for the coming debate over the future of health care in America:
*A new national survey found that the public is confused and generally uninformed about the nation's health care problems. The survey, designed by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard University School of Public Health, found that people were equally divided on whether the nation spends too much or too little on health care.
*The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said there was "little empirical evidence" of savings from managed care networks. President Clinton is counting on such networks of doctors and hospitals to control health costs.
*The Republican National Committee unveiled a television commercial criticizing Mr. Clinton's health plan on the ground that it would lead to "Government price-fixing, rationing and delays." The Administration denied the accusations.
White House officials said that Mr. Clinton on Monday ruled out any cap on the health insurance costs of the employees of state and local governments.
Douglas D. Peterson, senior policy analyst at the National League of Cities, said tonight: "Municipal employers would like to be treated in the same manner as private employers. We fail to see why private employers would have a cap on their health care costs while public employers would not."
Barbara Shipnuck, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Counties, said: "All employers, public and private, should be treated alike. We should not have to spend more for our employees than private employers spend for theirs."
 
'Fiscal Safety Valve'
 Ms. Shipnuck, who is chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors of Monterey County, Calif., said Mr. Clinton was using counties as "a fiscal safety valve" for his health care plan. She complained that counties were being asked to pay "more than their fair share."
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees was the first union in the country to endorse Mr. Clinton for President, in January 1992, before all the primaries. But its members say they fear they will be hurt by the President's health plan because they might have to pay higher premiums for health insurance.
Administration officials said it was inappropriate for the Federal Government to subsidize the personnel costs of state and local governments. Moreover, they said it would cost the Federal Government at least $20 billion over five years if it guaranteed state and local authorities that they would not spend more than 7.9 percent of their payrolls on employee health benefits.
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton's proposal would help state and local governments in other ways, by reducing the projected cost of health care for uninsured people, for Medicaid recipients and for retirees who formerly worked for state and local agencies.
 
Pooling Purchasing Power
 Under Mr. Clinton's plan, public employees and most private employees would pool their purchasing power and get insurance coverage through large groups known as regional health alliances. State and local officials and public employee unions said they feared they would bear a disproportionate share because there would be a limit on health insurance costs for private companies, but not for public employers.
Health alliances are a cornerstone of Mr. Clinton's proposal. But the Kaiser survey found that only 22 percent of Americans knew what such entities were.
Similarly, only 31 percent said they knew the meaning of "managed care," and just 20 percent knew the meaning of "managed competition," the blend of market forces and government regulation that Mr. Clinton has embraced.
Many people in the survey said they thought the uninsured were poor, unemployed or elderly. In fact, most of the uninsured are above the official poverty level, are employed and are not elderly.
Forty percent of people in the survey said they thought the United States spends too much on health care, while 41 percent said it spends too little. Only 38 percent said they believed that Federal spending for health care was an important cause of the Federal budget deficit; 54 percent said it was not an important cause.
 
'Public Poorly Informed'
 "The public is still poorly informed and uninvolved," said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "Unless that changes, the spin controllers and special interests will dominate the debate."
The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,200 adults, was conducted Sept. 30 through Oct. 5 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The survey found large numbers of people were unsure about whether they would be better off under the Clinton plan, Republican proposals or the current health care system.
The Republican National Committee is trying to shape public opinion on this question with its new television commercial.
The advertisement shows pictures of a doctor's office and a nurse with children. An announcer says "there's a way" to provide health care for all "without Bill Clinton's Government-run system, or his 100 new Government bureaucracies, without his Government price fixing, rationing and delays, without his mandates on small business that would cost up to 3 million Americans their jobs."

HEADLINE: CLINTON ASKS HELP ON POLLUTION GOAL

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton appealed to businesses and individuals today to help prevent global warming as he announced his plan to reduce the nation's emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.
"In concert with all other nations, we simply must halt global warming," Mr. Clinton said in a White House ceremony. "It is a threat to our health, to our ecology and to our economy." 
 The goal of the Climate Change Action Plan is to reduce the nation's emissions of so-called greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Mr. Clinton assigned a study group to look at further reductions beyond that.
Some scientists believe that global temperatures will rise because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other man-made gases will trap and retain heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a hreenhouse. Such a warming trend could lead to rising sea levels, cause severe droughts and severely disrupt the earth's biological systems.
 
Reliance on Volunteerism
 The President's plan relies mainly on voluntary cooperation by businesses and industries to undertake energy efficiency measures and curb emissions that are caused in large part by burning fossil fuels.
Some environmental groups have criticized the plan, whose outlines had become known over the last week, as not tough enough.
The plan calls for $1.9 billion in Federal spending, most of it diverted from other areas of the budget, and seeks $60 billion worth of voluntary participation by business and industry. If the companies do not fully embrace the plan, the Administration held out the prospect of tougher regulation.
"If this doesn't get it, we'll go back and find out how to get it through mandates," said Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary. She said, however, "Voluntary is not a dirty word."
The Administration said that 60 companies had already pledged to reduce emissions and that 40 motor industry representatives had agreed to promote use of more efficient electric motors.
 
Ntionwide Cooperation Urged
 Responding to environmental critics, Mr. Clinton called for nationwide cooperation. "We frankly must all take more personal responsibility," he said. "It will take all of us to make it work. So I say to all the American people, if your utility offers you help in conserving energy in your own home, seize it."
Similarly, he called on businesses to take advantage of help offered by the Environmental Protection Agency's expanded effort to encourage more efficient lighting, and by the Department of Energy's new efforts to promote more efficient industrial motors.
"You will save money, and you will help your country and your fellow citizens," Mr. Clinton told the audience on the South Lawn. The audience included many utility and business representatives, who praised the initiative.
Mr. Clinton was joined by Vice President Al Gore, who had criticized former President George Bush for not taking strong action against greenhouse gases.
Mr. Gore called global warming "the highest-risk environmental problem the world faces today," and said the plan "will do the job, effectively protect our environment, establish the United States as the world leader we must be in confronting this problem and at the same time enhance our economic strength."

HEADLINE: Customs Overhaul Offered In Move to Aid Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
The Administration and Congressional supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement today tied a sweeping revision of Federal customs regulations to the proposed pact after failing to resolve a dispute over how to pay for the agreement.
Today's proposed revision of customs regulations was part of an effort by the pact's supporters to mollify transportation industries. The nation's airlines, cruise lines and trucking companies are vigorously lobbying against an Administration proposal to double customs inspection fees to offset $2.35 billion in tariffs that would be eliminated over five years under the agreement. 
 Some House Republicans who vehemently oppose tax increases are also trying to block the fee proposal. A group of 27 Republicans sent a letter to President Clinton on Monday contending that spending should be cut instead of adding transportation taxes to offset the lost tariffs.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is the ranking minority member on the Ways and Means Committee, said today, "We continue to tell the Administration that the ball is in their court, and they need to come up with some spending cuts if they don't want to lose some votes."
 
Budget Requirement
 The fee increase was proposed because Congressional budget rules require that revenue reductions be offset by higher taxes or cuts in mandatory spending programs.
The Administration proposal called for an increase by $5 in the tax on a ticket for an international flight or cruise. The proposal would also double border-crossing fees, to $10 for trucks and $15 for rail cars.
The revision of customs regulations proposed today would allow customs documents, now required to be typed and hand delivered, to be filed by computer over telephone lines. Trucking and air freight executives have sought such a change for years.
But the initial reaction was unenthusiastic, with trucking and airline industry representatives immediately dismissing the proposal as inadequate and saying it was likely to go through Congress as a separate bill anyway.
Before the fee proposal, the airline industry had been neutral about the trade agreement, while the trucking industry had been lobbying the Administration to change some provisions that affected it. Both groups opposed the fee increase, and James Landry, the president of the Air Transport Association, an industry group based here, has said that the higher fees proposed by the Administration would also violate international air agreements. White House officials deny this, citing State and Transportation Department legal opinions.
 
Carrot and Stick
 The customs revisions were proposed at a Ways and Means Committee meeting this morning. Representative Sam M. Gibbons, Democrat of Florida, used an amendment to attach the customs revisions to legislation putting the free-trade agreement into law. The Customs Commissioner, George Weiss, endorsed the move in brief testimony to the committee.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, the California Democrat who is leading House backers of the free trade pact, said that if transportation industries did not rally to the agreement's defense then the provision might be dropped.
The Ways and Means Committee also discussed the dispute over how to raise money, but reached no decision. Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said the Administration still wanted to raise the transportation fees but would like to discuss new ideas at a closed session with committee members.
At the end of the hearing, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the committee, said that he would probably meet on Wednesday with Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director, to review a number of budgetary options.
An Administration official said that the White House was now looking at ways to pay for the agreement through improved tax collections, but had only found $700 million so far that it thought could be raised by such a move.
Budgetary squabbles are hurting efforts to build support for the agreement, lawmakers favoring the trade agreement are saying. "It's just another problem the opposition can point to -- the sooner they can resolve these, the sooner they can pick up votes," Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's trade panel and supports the agreement, said last Thursday in an interview.
 
Tariff as Tax
 President Clinton told reporters this morning that the Administration was still working on how to raise the money to offset tariffs eliminated by the free trade pact. If approved by the House and Senate, the agreement would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers over the next 15 years.
"We still have to work through the whole issue of how we deal with the fact that if we pass Nafta, we have to reduce tariffs," the President said. He emphasized that the current tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods represented a tax on Americans now buying these goods.
"That's a $2.5 billion tax on American consumers today," President Clinton said.
Mr. Kantor and House supporters of the free trade pact contend that it will increase overall Federal tax revenue by stimulating economic growth in the United States. "Every $1 billion increase in exports is another 20,000 well-paying jobs here," said Representative Philip M. Crane, Republican of Illinois."
But Congressional budget rules do not allow economic growth and other secondary effects of legislation to be used to offset revenue losses.

HEADLINE: In Haiti, There Is No Shortage of Fear

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 19

 BODY:
People familiar with Haiti's economy say that the international naval blockade that began today may cause severe damage but that it is uncertain whether the hardships will force the military leaders to restore democracy.
Concerns about the impact of the embargo grew as an international flotilla, including six warships from the United States, gathered on the hazy blue horizon off the coast to prevent fuel and arms from entering Haiti. 
 The sanctions were approved by the United Nations Security Council last week in an effort to force the military to allow the return of the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In the first action of the blockade, the United States Navy frigate Klakring stopped the cargo ship San Antonio today, the Defense Department said in Washington. The ship, registered in Belize and bound for Haiti, carried cement, which is not prohibited under the embargo, the Pentagon said.
 
Oil May Last 10 Weeks
 Diplomats and Haitian economists estimate that without rationing, the country's oil supply could last 6 to 10 weeks. During a similar embargo this summer, draconian conservation stretched supplies dramatically.
If many Haitians in the capital are worried about possible violence if the military retaliates against its enemies because of the blockade, development experts and others say the embargo could pose dangers for many in the countryside even without more bloodshed.
"I was talking to a priest in the northwest the other day, and he told me that if they are going to blockade this country he hopes they send a lot of wood," said Chris Conrad, the director of CARE's relief programs in Haiti. "When I asked him, 'Wood?,' he said, 'because that's what you'll need to build all of the coffins.' "
The arid northwest is the poorest region of Haiti, which is the hemisphere's poorest country. Mr. Conrad, whose organization feeds 620,000 people in Haiti at least one meal a day, said that after two years of political turmoil and international isolation, many in the region, particularly women and children, were barely holding on to life.
 
Where Measles Is Fatal
 "Anything that comes down the pike at this point, be it measles or diarrhea or upper respiratory disease," he said, "the kids up there who have very little resistance already are just going to be wiped out."
Like others, Mr. Conrad said provisions in the embargo that allow relief supplies to enter Haiti would be of limited consequence because transportation will soon be frozen as the fuel supply dries up.
Alberto Favilla, a former World Bank economist who led efforts to draw up a recovery program for Haiti that is to begin once President Aristide returns, said: "Because of all this country has been through recently, essential inputs like spare parts, pesticides, fertilizers and drugs have reached the bottom already. This new embargo doesn't have to go very much further to paralyze the whole country. The only remaining question is the power of the Army to suppress opposition by threatening to kill everybody."
During the last two years, he said, Haiti's economy had shrunk by more than 15 percent.
 
The Intimidation Campaign
 Since its September 1991 coup against President Aristide, the Army has proven highly effective at intimidation. Several hundred people are thought to have been killed in the coup, and many more have perished since, either as a direct result of army terror or lost at sea in attempts to flee the country. The violence of the past two years led 40,000 Haitians to flee the country in a chaotic rush.
In recent days the terror campaign has focused on close supporters of President Aristide and on members of the transitional Government of Prime Minister Robert Malval, who was appointed by the President six weeks ago.
With that in mind, Washington dispatched the Assistant Secretary of State for Security, Anthony C. E. Quainton, to Haiti today to consult with the Government on protective measures. Diplomats said the Government would be given armored vehicles and secure radios to communicate with each other.
"If this military leadership knows that it is facing defeat, these people are going to be slaughtering people even as they go down the exit escalator," said a former Haitian official with extensive knowledge of the armed forces.
 
The Promises Unkept
 The former official, like several diplomats here, said he expected the military to bide its time, seeking an exit only if its situation becomes critical. The problem then, he said, becomes one of holding the commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, to whatever bargain he negotiates.
Diplomats portray General Cedras as a deeply dishonest figure who believes he is more clever than any of the foreigners sent to seek his removal. Last Friday, even as the blockade loomed, General Cedras reneged on a commitment to retire to make way for Father Aristide's scheduled return on Oct. 30.
"If strictly enforced, this blockade will definitely bring the Army back to the table," the former official said. "The problem is that there may not be anything to prevent them from reneging again."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Moynihan on Health: Cure Social Ills

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Health care hearings at the Senate Finance Committee under Daniel Patrick Moynihan's chairmanship are unlike any other health care hearings.
The talk today was not of how health care alliances would work under President Clinton's plan, nor whether small business could afford to pay premiums. There were no emotional accounts of children denied treatment, no special pleading for victims of this disease or practitioners of that treatment. 
 Instead, the committee discussed the soaring rates of illegitimate births in the United States, a topic that for more than two decades has concerned Senator Moynihan, Democrat of New York.
He began the hearing by noting that 30 percent of all births now were to unmarried women, 71 percent in Detroit, 66 percent in Washington and 45.2 percent in New York.
Then Lee Rainwater, a visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation, said that "by the time we get our health care plan," in the year 2000, "they will be a little over 40 percent."
What does this have to do with health care?
Senator Moynihan tried to make a direct connection when he observed that the increase was occurring, but, he said, "so far as we can tell, no one in the vast health bureaucracy of the Federal Government seems to have noticed it." And that, he added, made it likely that the issue would be ignored under Mr. Clinton's program.
But that was a stretch. After the hearing, the Senator said his point was that the nation's cities will be intolerable if few children in them have two parents. "I don't want another vast social program that makes no difference to the fact that our cities are becoming unlivable," he added.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It wasn't a hearing devoted to finding solutions to the problem of illegitimacy, however. Instead, it was intended to raise questions about whether health care was the big problem the nation ought to be wrestling with when it seemed to be ignoring social decay that would undercut any progress it might make on health.
One witness, Dr. Leroy Schwartz, president of Health Policy International in Princeton, even argued that health care costs were not the problem they seemed to be, since so much of them went toward solving the consequences of social problems.
That argument puzzled Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who said a patient with a gunshot wound had to be treated by doctors no matter what caused the shooting -- whether it was violence on television, as Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa contended, or the failure of Congress to pass the handgun ban proposed by Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island.
But there was a thoughtful theme throughout the session: that trying to fix the health care delivery system directly might not be worth the trouble if nothing was done to cure the social ills that increased medical costs.
As Senator Bradley said, the Finance Committee has taxes in its jurisdiction. And some social ills, like drinking, can be curbed by making alcohol more expensive.
One witness made the same point. Ted R. Miller, director of the safety and health policy program of the National Public Services Research Institute in Landover, Md., urged that alcohol be taxed at $1.38 an ounce. He estimated that that was the cost to society of drunken driving and other problems caused by drinking.
And Senator Bradley again urged higher taxes on guns and gun dealers to help pay for health care.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Two floors above the room where the Finance Committee was meeting, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee was hearing testimony about how the President's health care plan would affect the economy. This afternoon it heard witnesses argue that having the Government run the system and pay the bills would be better than going through insurance companies.
That committee, led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, does not doubt that health care is the problem to solve in the next year. For that matter, neither do several members of Mr. Moynihan's committee, including Senators Chafee and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, or the Senate majority and minority leaders, George J. Mitchell of Maine and Bob Dole of Kansas.
But on this question the chairmanship of Mr. Moynihan is an intellectual journey, testing his concern that "we don't have a health care problem, we have a social problem."

HEADLINE: Universities Scrambling As Investment Incomes Fall Short of Past Levels

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Colleges and universities across the country are eliminating jobs or freezing hiring, declaring construction moratoriums and trimming student financial aid because of the declining return on endowments, a source of income that is often second only to tuition.
At Stanford Law School, a student loan program was saved only because three jobs were cut. At the University of Texas, building maintenance has been cut sharply. And at the University of Pennsylvania, three departments were closed last week and their professors moved to others. 
 For the last three years, the return on endowments has averaged about 9.9 percent, well below the 25 percent returns in the best years of the 1980's. Last year, the return was 13.1 percent, still down a full point from the average for the 10 preceding years, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers. With a total university pool of $73.9 billion, a one-point drop in return represents nearly $1 billion.
The financial difficulty lies not in stocks and bonds, which grew in value about 20 percent last year, but in the continuing bust in real estate and oil and gas prices. While these investments have languished for years, many institutions keep these assets, hoping for better returns in the future and hedging their bets in the stock market. They are also making riskier investments overseas.
 
Real Estate Blues
 At Harvard, with a $5.8 billion endowment, the largest in the country, officials complain about depressed real estate values. The endowment income in fiscal 1992, ending June 30, provided about 22 percent of Harvard's $1.3 billion in annual operating expenses. Tuition pays for 31 percent.
The one bright spot is that the institutions can refinance debt at lower rates, but the savings come nowhere near making up for the shrinking return on endowments, a significant problem in an overall difficult time of less Federal support and already-high tuitions.
And while no major university is doing the unthinkable by dipping into the principal, many are spending more of the interest for operating expenses, rather than plowing the money back into the endowments.
The standard rule for institutions has been to spend just 4 to 5 percent of an endowment's total return and save the rest. But as returns have fallen, institutions must spend more of this money or cut their budgets.
The University of Texas system, with the nation's second-largest endowment at $4.4 billion, is a case in point. Investment income from the endowment -- which includes royalties from 21 million acres in West Texas with oil, gas and mineral deposits -- slipped to $247 million for the fiscal year, which ended Aug. 31, from $257 million for the previous year. Income is expected to drop by an additional $9 million in the current year.
 
More Cuts Expected
 This is not good news to the University of Texas at Austin, the system's flagship campus with 48,500 students. The institution shares proceeds from the endowment with 14 other campuses and the Texas A&M University system. After several years in which its share of the endowment income increased annually by about $2 million, the Austin campus saw its share drop by $2 million to $78 million this year, with a cut of $3 million expected next year.
"What this means is that we have less money to educate a very large student body," said Robert M. Berdahl, president of the University of Texas at Austin. "It means that already stretched resources are going to have to be stretched even more."
Although the university has got some relief from refinancing close to $1 billion in debt, the savings are not enough to stop the university from asking students to start paying for the university health clinic. A building moratorium was declared. And last year's $24 million maintenance budget was clipped to $10 million this year.
Officials also voice fears that less money may be available for the university's 800 endowed chairs and professorships on the campus, which are backed with as much as $1 million each. These positions have attracted people like Steven Weinberg, a physics professor and the 1979 Nobel Prize winner for physics, and former Representative Barbara Jordan, a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs.
 
Bidding for Professors
 "It is a very significant problem," said G. Charles Franklin, the university's vice president for business affairs. "These funds are key in attracting top, key people."
Perhaps the most striking impact has been on individual gifts or legacies, established to create or support specific academic programs and separate from the general endowment funds. Many small funds do not produce the income necessary to support the activities required by the donors. At the Stanford University Law School, for example, a student loan-forgiveness program, created in 1987 by an initial $300,000 grant and enhanced by subsequent gifts, cannot meet the $100,000-a-year cost.
The program was intended to pay back part of the student loans of graduates who pursued public interest jobs. The longer the service, the larger the portion of the debt that was repaid. About 10 students from each class qualify, but the program faces a a 50 percent cut in money for the program.
Because of student protests, according to Associate Dean Frank Brucato, the program was spared, but other cuts were made, including shorter hours at the law school library and 3 of 45 teaching positions.
 
Ivy League Affected
 Not even the Ivy League is immune. With the oldest and biggest endowments of any of the nation's colleges and universities, Ivy institutions like the University of Pennsylvania are also feeling the strain.
Last week, the university's school of arts and sciences moved to eliminate its religious studies, civilization and regional science departments, fold its astronomy department into physics and bring outside administrators to overhaul the Slavic languages department.
The university's school of arts and sciences -- the largest division, with 28 departments -- has a small endowment that has not generated enough income to maintain services at current levels, said Rosemary A. Stevens, dean of the school. "We have a very keen awareness that we are living in a period of resource constraints," she said.
The flip side to the lower interest rates is in savings available from refinancing debt at more favorable terms. The University of Michigan recently refinanced $500 million, for a $15 million savings over the life of the loan. The slower economy has also resulted in an inflation rate of about 3 percent, which has helped institutions stretch taut budgets a little further.
 
Someplace With More Money
 "I would argue that the lower interest rates have benefited us," said Robert Taylor, the treasurer at Wesleyan University, which refinanced $37 million in debt and will save a little more than $1 million a year in interest payments.
These gains, however, do not offset the declining income from endowments and other gifts, prompting growing numbers of colleges and universities to invest more money abroad. Wesleyan University five months ago, for example, put $20 million of its endowment into stock markets overseas, in a trend that endowment managers say is expected to grow, risky though it may be.
"Sure you're nervous," said Farris Womack, the University of Michigan's executive vice president and chief financial officer, which recently invested 15 percent of its $797 million endowment overseas. "But it's important to recognize that stocks in foreign companies represent real opportunities to gain."
Institutions have tended to invest in established foreign companies, like the Mexican telephone company monopoly, and in large and growing European or Asian firms representing an array of fast-growing industries. "It reduces the risk," Mr. Womack said, "because it's unlikely that every market is going to experience its ups and downs simultaneously."

HEADLINE: Ukraine Now Says It May Keep Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Oct. 19

 BODY:
In a sharp change of tone, President Leonid M. Kravchuk said today that Ukraine may keep some of the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union, and he accused the West of not providing enough financial assistance to dismantle the 176 strategic missiles on Ukrainian territory.
President Kravchuk's statement, that Ukraine may keep 46 SS-24 missiles, came only five days before Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to arrive here for talks in which Ukraine's nuclear weapons will feature high on the agenda. 
 Previously President Kravchuk had repeated his intent to dismantle all nuclear weapons on its territory, ratify the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) and become a non-nuclear state.
Though Kiev has pressed the issue of financial compensation before, the threat of not complying with its agreement to disarm is new.
Ukraine is the third-largest nuclear power, with 1,656 warheads, larger than the combined arsenals of France, Britain and China. The SS-24 missiles, which can carry 10 warheads each, are the most modern weapon in the old Soviet nuclear arsenal.
President Kravchuk made the surprise statement to reporters in the corridors of Parliament during a closed session on national security.
"After the ratification of Start," he said, "we will immediately proceed with the destruction of the 130," a reference to the SS-19's. "But we can approach the remaining 46" -- the SS-24's -- "from a different standpoint. We can only remove them from active military alert and remove the codes so that they will not be aimed at the United States."
Ukraine's turnaround comes only a month and a half after Russia announced that Ukraine had agreed to transfer all its nuclear weapons to Russia. The agreement fell apart weeks later when the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry insisted that the agreement called for the transfer of only some nuclear weapons to Russia, not all of them.
Since the Russian-Ukrainian disagreement, the Clinton Administration has stepped up its contacts with Kiev in an attempt to address Ukraine's security concerns and financial needs. In addition to Secretary Christopher's visit, the Ukrainian Foreign Minister. Anatoly M. Zlenko, met with President Clinton earlier this month.
Ukraine has been asking the United States for $2.5 billion to dismantle and destroy its nuclear weapons. Today President Kravchuk reiterated that Ukraine wanted to be non-nuclear, "but we need help to be non-nuclear."
Kiev secured $175 million from Washington last year but the money has yet not been disbursed because of a delay in signing an umbrella agreement that governs how the missiles are to be destroyed.
Congress has earmarked another $400 million this year and United States officials have said more may be available later if the umbrella agreement is signed.
Assistant Defense Secretary Graham T. Allison has said Kiev is not required to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in order for the money to be disbursed.
A Western diplomat said the delay in signing the umbrella agreement is due simply to "a few technical issues, and the gap is narrowing." Kiev and Washington have been negotiating for months and the agreement may be signed during Secretary Christopher's visit here on Monday.
Kiev did not consult with the United States prior to President Kravchuk's announcement today, and the Western diplomat said, "This is a corridor conversation, not an official position."
"It is a change from what he has said previously but we need to find out how much he means it," the diplomat said. "Our position is that President Kravchuk has openly committed himself to destroying all nuclear weapons."
While Kiev would like to see considerable economic assistance before nuclear disarmament, a senior United States official here noted that "ultimately, the basis for our relationship in the future rests on Ukraine becoming a non-nuclear state."

HEADLINE: Benazir Bhutto Returns as Leader of a Poor and Troubled Pakistan

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's first woman Prime Minister, returned triumphantly today to the office from which she was banished in 1990 on charges of corruption and incompetence.
Assuming office a second time, Ms. Bhutto faces a desperately poor Pakistan and confronts a hostile India and severe economic and military sanctions by the United States because of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. 
 Although her first administration was marked by paralysis and charges of ineptitude, there are some expectations that Ms. Bhutto may have learned from her first failed government.
"This is a moment for the rehabilitation and stabilization of democracy," Ms. Bhutto told Parliament, which only moments before had elected her over her archrival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose party came in second in the elections this month.
 
'Doubts in Their Hearts'
 "The country is passing through a severe economic crisis," she declared. "People have doubts in their hearts. A change in the system is called for. The people's government will be a government of reforms."
The expectation that Ms. Bhutto might do better in her second try as Prime Minister was based in part on a feeling that she and Pakistan's military and business establishment may have learned to live with each other.
"The fundamental difference between today and 1988 is that she has cobbled together a majority, but she no longer faces a hostile establishment," said Maleeha Lodhi, the editor of The News, a newspaper based in Rawalpindi. "Then she faced a hostile President, a scheming army chief and a civilian bureaucracy that had not come to terms with her party returning to power. This has all changed now."
 
After Transitional Leader
 Ms. Bhutto succeeds the three-month transitional government of Moeen Qureshi, a former vice president of the World Bank. In his tenure, Mr. Qureshi made sweeping economic and legal changes, including higher taxes for large feudal estates, which are widely acknowledged to have returned Pakistan's Government to solvency and created a framework for recovery.
Mr. Qureshi said that Pakistan's economic future depended to a great extent on the determination of the new Government to continue his policies.
"The economy today has been consolidated," said Mr. Qureshi. "We have initiated changes and reforms that are likely to bring about long-term improvements, but those changes and those reforms need to be adhered to by the elected Government. We are hopeful that will be the case."
Ms. Bhutto's return to power culminates a three-year political struggle with the country's powerful army and president, and re-establishes her at the center of the country's politics. By virtue of her gender and education, she is also likely to take her place once again on the global stage.
 
Moving Among Differing Views
 Yet, despite attending Harvard and Oxford universities, an education that persuaded many Western leaders and analysts to take an often benevolent view of her, Ms. Bhutto's political instincts and practical policies are embedded in the ruthlessness and opportunism of Pakistani politics since the country's creation in 1947.
Since she was dismissed as Prime Minister in 1990 by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Ms. Bhutto has moved effortlessly among conflicting political tactics and principles. From having denounced Mr. Ishaq Khan as a traitor to the Constitution for forcing her from office, three years later she was able to join with him in an alliance to attack, and force the resignation of her successor, Mr. Sharif.
And despite her intense hostility toward the country's military -- General Zia ul-Haq, who ruled the country as one of its military dictators, had her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto executed -- she made it clear during the last year that she would support any military action to remove Mr. Sharif.
 
Other Family Members
 In the election this year, other members of the Bhutto family attempted to unsettle Ms. Bhutto's monopoly of her father's popular legacy. Her brother, Murtaza, who had taken refuge in Syria after being accused of terrorism here, ran for several parliamentary and provincial assembly seats from exile.
He won a place in the assembly of Sindh province. Their mother, Nusrat, who was allied with Ms. Bhutto in 1988, switched allegiance this year to her son. The switch created a political rift in the family that was evident today when Ms. Bhutto failed to acknowledge her mother's presence in Parliament.
In large measure, Ms. Bhutto learned her political skills at the knee of her father, the country's first elected Prime Minister and a man riddled with contradictions of his own. One of the country's largest landowners, a member of what the landed gentry known here as "feudals," Mr. Bhutto drank Scotch, was a notorious philanderer and yet professed his adherence to Islam and socialism.
Ms. Bhutto accomplished little in her 20 months in office and introduced almost no legislation. Under her administration Pakistan's economy deteriorated, its people remained among the world's poorest and the oppression and mistreatment of the country's women, widely deplored by human rights organizations, continued.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Campaign to Pay Party Panel for Some Ads

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Under pressure from the city's Campaign Finance Board, the Dinkins campaign has agreed to reimburse the State Democratic Committee for more than $226,000 worth of political advertisements that the Giuliani campaign had complained were intended to circumvent spending limits.
The agreement was applauded by advocates of public financing as a sign that the board, created in 1988, was forcefully executing its mission. In agreeing to pay for the ads, the Dinkins campaign averted possible sanctions or fines from the board. But the payments are a blow to the Dinkins campaign because they will reduce the amount of money the campaign has to spend in the crucial last days of a tight race, city officials and mayoral aides said. 
 The dispute over the ads began two weeks ago, when the Republican-Liberal candidate, Rudolph W. Giuliani, complained to the board that the State Democratic Committee was flaunting the spending limits by buying radio and direct-mail advertments that attacked Mr. Giuliani and lauded Mayor David N. Dinkins.
Under the city's campaign finance law, mayoral candidates cannot spend more than $4 million on the primary and $4 million on the general-election campaign if they wish to receive matching public funds. But political committees are permitted to spend whatever they want as long as the candidate can prove the campaign did not coordinate the extra advertising.
Such advertising is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, even though state political committees do not have to abide by the city's contribution limits of $6,500 per contributor. By comparison, state law allows contributions as large as $62,500 from a single donor.
The Mayor's campaign did not concede that it had asked the state committee to pay for the ads, Harold Ickes, a lawyer for the Dinkins campaign, said. He maintained that the advertisements, which attacked Mr. Giuliani's stands on abortion and urged Mr. Dinkins's re-election, were independently produced and consequently did not violate the Campaign Finance Board's regulations. But he said the Dinkins campaign did not want questions about the ads to divert attention from other issues in the mayoral race.
"It is our position that the expenditures were in fact independent," Mr. Ickes said. "But given that this is the last two weeks of a hard-fought campaign, we made a decision we did not want to take the time and resources to litigate this."
But lawyers for the Giuliani campaign portrayed the compromise as a defeat for the Mayor. "What we had here was the Dinkins campaign realizing it was nailed, caving completely and being forced to pay back the money," Mr. Giuliani's lawyer, Randy Mastro, said.
Nicole A. Gordon, executive director of the Campaign Finance Board, said that even though the board never officially ruled on Mr. Giuliani's complaint, it has ruled in the past that spending by political committees is presumed to be tied to the party's candidate unless the candidate can prove otherwise.
 
Dinkins Campaigns in Harlem
 Mayor Dinkins campaigned yesterday at a meeting of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce among some of his oldest, most loyal allies. The talk was of the pain and rejection they would feel if Mr. Dinkins, a lifelong Democrat in an overwhelmingly Democratic town, lost to Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Dinkins's mentor, Percy E. Sutton, an entrepreneur who was once one of Harlem's most prominent politicians, said in introducing him that race "is forever present" in New York City politics and pointedly noted that blacks in general and Mr. Dinkins in particular have supported Irish, Italian and Jewish candidates for mayor and governor.
"If the Democratic Party and its leadership is unable to engender support for someone as mild and nice and honest as David Dinkins, then what is the future for us with the Democratic Party?" Mr. Sutton said in an interview after the meeting. He added: "We have other places to go. We can organize a new party or join other existing parties or stay home."
Mr. Sutton, a former borough president, and other members of the Harlem chamber said the loss of support from such high-profile Democrats as Robert F. Wagner Jr., scion of a New York Democratic family, and Herman Badillo, who is running for comptroller on Mr. Giuliani's ticket, as well as diminished support from Jews, were particularly bitter pills.
The president of the Harlem chamber, Lloyd A. Williams, said many blacks think the Mayor has "been disproportionately concerned and supportive" of Jewish causes and are resentful that Jews have harshly criticized the Mayor's handling of the violent clash of blacks and Hasidic Jews in 1991 in Crown Heights.
Mr. Dinkins has called the stabbing of a rabbinical student by a group of young blacks in Crown Heights "a lynching," but many officials have said the Mayor did not act quickly enough to stop the violence.
Several chamber members said a Dinkins defeat could seriously undermine the prospects for future interracial voting coalitions.
Mr. Dinkins did not directly address the themes Mr. Sutton raised, but he did set aside his prepared remarks to "share a few stories" about his struggles to become the city's first black mayor and to speak proudly of how he has helped other blacks rise to influential positions -- themes that Mr. Dinkins rarely discusses and that some black ministers and officials have said they wished he would address more bluntly.
He told the audience that it was Mr. Sutton and Paul O'Dwyer, a City Council president, who salvaged his career after he had to withdraw as the city's first black deputy mayor in 1974 because he had not filed income-tax returns. Mr. Sutton helped persuade Mr. O'Dwyer to have Mr. Dinkins appointed city clerk.
"That's why I'll always love Paul O'Dwyer and Percy Sutton," Mr. Dinkins said.
 
A Light Day for Giuliani
 Mr. Giuliani eased his hectic campaign schedule yesterday for his lightest day on the stump in weeks, spending most of the morning and afternoon in private meetings.
At lunchtime, however, he emerged for a walking tour of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, stressing his concern for the environment as he spoke with pedestrians and shop owners.
Walking down Grand Street, he hugged women, kissed babies and paused in a shop that makes hot onion bialis. Yet he avoided giving a standard campaign stump speech, and kept his comments brief at every stop.
Responding to reporters' questions, Mr. Giuliani did not shy from restating his position on debates with Mr. Dinkins, saying he would debate the Mayor "anytime, anywhere" as long as it was one on one.
"Enough of the chickens and the comedy acts," he said, referring to the use of a rubber chicken to draw attention to Mr. Giuliani's refusal to participate in a debate on Sunday because the program was shared with the Conservative Party candidate, George J. Marlin.
"Mr. Dinkins has run away from 12 debates in 1989, and so far this year has run away from 8 of them," Mr. Giuliani said.
Mr. Giuliani also said he wanted three debates -- one on the economy, one on crime and one on education -- and urged television reporters coverng him yesterday to arrange debates at their stations.
Mr. Giuliani would not say with whom he met yesterday. But he has a full schedule for today.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE FLOOD WITH: Elizabeth Hanford Dole;
Power Player, Playing Cautiously

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

DATELINE: DES MOINES

 BODY:
ELIZABETH HANFORD DOLE, a smile fixed on her face and her charm at the ready, picked her way around the tangle of lumber and oozing mud, searching for flood victims.
Although the flood waters have receded here, the need has not. But the Red Cross van bearing coffee and sandwiches was drawing few takers that day, so Mrs. Dole, trim in a Red Cross T-shirt, khakis and smudgeless pink sneakers, marched gamely door-to-door. 
 "Red Cross here," she called. "Are you all hungry?" A 97-year-old woman, Bethel C. Anker, appeared at the screen door, telling her how grateful she was for all the help. Mrs. Dole said, "That warms my heart."
Mrs. Anker launched into a spirited description of her trials during the flood, and could have clearly gone on for some time, but Mrs. Dole gently eased herself away after some sympathetic murmurs and tongue-clucking. "Here we are, three bags for you," she said. "You take care. 'Bye now."
This was Elizabeth Dole at her very public best: effusive yet efficient, a woman who threads her way around obstacles with the same care, meticulous preparation and determination that have won and sustained her in visible jobs. She has been president of the Red Cross since 1991. Before that she served as United States Secretary of Transportation (1983-87) and Secretary of Labor (1989-90).
Watching her, it's easy to see why she won raves on the stump in 1988 during the brief Presidential bid of her husband, Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is now Senate minority leader. She has an ability to connect, to make people feel heard even as she moves on to shake the next hand. But watching Mrs. Dole is to sense that she is also a woman of great control and caution, one who never loosens the tight rein on her spontaneity, never says the wrong thing, never reveals too much.
At 57, she has won praise for her stewardship of the Red Cross: fund raising, cost cutting, instituting more stringent blood screening tests and responding to a string of natural disasters, including Hurricane Andrew and the Midwest floods.
Her life with her husband has striking parallels to another Washington power couple, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom the Doles will face if the Senator choses to run for President in 1996, as is rumored. Like Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Dole has a career and is respected for her intelligence and drive. She is also said to be a more appealing campaigner than her husband, often able to disarm his opponents.
Senator Dole acknowledges his wife's drawing power. "Everywhere I go -- and I've been in four states this weekend -- people talk about Elizabeth," he said recently.
On the public stage, both Mrs. Dole and Mrs. Clinton have played out their struggles to reconcile their careers with their husbands' political ambitions. Mrs. Dole left her job as Secretary of Transportation in 1987 to campaign for her husband; Mrs. Clinton emerged from the campaign caricatures, which depicted her as a strident co-President or a subdued cookie-baker, to become a groundbreaking First Lady.
Mrs. Clinton's ability to be a substantive rather than ornamental First Lady suggests that Mrs. Dole could have done the same thing. But when Mrs. Dole resigned her post in 1987, many women spoke out against her choice. And at the time, her public comments suggested a trace of resentment about leaving her job. But today, she defends her decision in almost exactly the words she used then.
"To me, that's what we've been fighting for, for women to have opportunities to do what works best for themselves and their families," she said, sitting in a Red Cross regional office. "We don't have to fit into a mold. It would have been almost unthinkable not to be a part of the high point to date in my husband's career."
Mrs. Dole will not be drawn out on the subject of Mrs. Clinton or on Senator Dole's plans, and quickly returns to safe generalities, often using the same sentences and anecdotes she has in earlier interviews.
Mrs. Dole on life's purpose: "When you're in your 90's and looking back, it's not going to be how much money you made or how many awards you've won. It's really what did you stand for. Did you make a positive difference for people?"
On the need to acknowledge all of women's choices, she emphasizes "the women who choose to stay at home as full-time working mothers, volunteers -- oh, put a lot of stress on volunteers -- the ones who decide that should be valued every bit as much as what you and I are doing."
These answers are hardly surprising, coming from someone who has been interviewed countless times and has spent most of her professional life under public scrutiny. Why should she place her trust in a reporter? Why take a chance on spontaneity and slip up?
"People who are exposed to the media constantly tend to have tapes in their head," said an old friend and supporter of Mrs. Dole, who asked to remain unidentified. "Her nature is to be prepared and in control of the message she is sending."
During this interview Mrs. Dole is quick to list her accomplishments at the Red Cross and in previous Cabinets. But she is most animated talking about how she and her husband have forged a partnership that combines freedom with intense loyalty. The couple were married in 1975 and have no children. The Senator has a daughter by a previous marriage.
"When we first met and married, he felt, definitely, go on with your career," she said, describing her husband as an instinctive supporter of women, who needed no training from her. "There was never any hesitation. Sure, at times it would have been nice if I could have been at things that were important to him. But we just went forward together."
Her husband calls her a "sensible feminist," meaning that "she doesn't threaten anybody."
Both avoid the power dinner parties in Washington -- partly, Senator Dole said, because they are just too busy. A typical week's schedule: a late night at the Senate for the Senator on Monday, an attempt to eat together on Tuesday, an out-of-town trip for Mrs. Dole on Wednesday and meetings in New York for the Senator on Thursday. When they are both at home, they watch movies or work out on a treadmill, saving part of Sunday, when he is not on a talk show, for church and friends. "It seems to work all right," Senator Dole said.
Sometimes their jobs put the couple at public loggerheads, but that does not appear to bother either of them a bit. This year, her husband opposed President Clinton's bill on national service. Mrs. Dole, as the president of an organization dedicated to volunteerism, backed it. They didn't consult each other about their stances in advance, she said, and didn't talk about them afterwards.
Years ago, such public differences between spouses were more novel. When Mrs. Dole was a member of the Federal Trade Commission, she read that her husband was opposing the creation of a consumer protection agency.
"I remember calling him up and saying, 'What are you doing?' " she said. "You didn't tell me about this." She was about to give a speech and asked him whether he would join her and debate the pros and cons. They were asked to repeat the performance on "Good Morning America," and she recounted the reaction:
"We got an awful lot of mail. Someone wrote Bob, 'If you want to get anywhere in politics, you better get her to shut up.' And one man wrote in and said, 'I do hope you'll be able to resolve your marital difficulties.' " With that, she broke into a loud laugh.
It is evidently the only kind of marriage she can envision, because she bucked the conventions of her Southern childhood and even the expectations of her mother, who wanted her to major in home economics, marry and stay in North Carolina. But she chose to study political science at Duke University and declined a marriage proposal from her college boyfriend.
After Harvard Law School, she embarked on a career in government, eventually serving on the Federal Trade Commission and as head of President Reagan's office of public liaison before joining the Cabinet. Originally a Democrat, she became an Independent and then, about the time of her marriage, a Republican.
"She's always been a woman of a lot of power and force," said Mari Maseng Will, the principal of Maseng Communications, a Washington public relations firm, who served under Mrs. Dole as an Assistant Secretary of Transportation. "And she has retained some of the grace and charm of the world she was brought up in. I've often thought of her as a role model -- how she carved out a role as a strong and effective woman, how she did not threaten people and could still be a leader."
This quality is apparent in her interchanges with the Red Cross staff in Des Moines. People light up when they see her. The camaraderie built in the worst days of the flood is evident as she hugs the workers. But she also presses her management agenda, asking nearly everyone she meets what they think of a new disaster-services plan and an ambitious effort to raise standards for all local Red Cross affiliates.
Mrs. Will says the Red Cross post is the most fulfilling her friend has ever had. Mrs. Dole herself demurs at suggestions that the presidency of the Red Cross, with its highly visible opportunities to help people in distress, is a perfect launching pad for a future First Lady or even for a run for public office.
"I don't have plans to run for office right now," she said. "I enjoy people, I'm an extrovert. If the option presents itself someday to run for office, it's a possibility. It's not something I must do or I will not feel fulfilled in life."
Yet, Mrs. Dole understands that being a player means not just having ideas, but having power.
"Some people really have almost a distaste for that word," she said. "They feel it is alien to conscience. Power for power's sake, no. But the positive use of power for positive purposes is very important. You have to understand that. You've got to have a seat at the policy table if you want to make a difference. "

HEADLINE: 42d Street To Get A Theater For Youth

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The Victory Theater, an empty 93-year-old Times Square house with an illustrious past but no future until now, will become the city's first major midtown theater offering year-round programming for young audiences.
After a $7.9 million renovation, the Victory will become the first of nine historic theaters on West 42d Street to be restored and reopened, the project's organizer, the New 42d Street Inc., announced yesterday. 
 If renovation, which is to begin in February and end one year later, is finished on schedule, the theater -- on the north side of 42d Street west of Seventh Avenue -- will be the first tangible evidence of years of planning to overhaul the nation's most famous theatrical street. In addition, project planners announced, two other 42d Street theaters are to be renovated and will become the New York Information Center, a commercial venture that will offer sightseeing advice, hotel and restaurant referrals and a multi-media show for tourists.
The announcement follows by several weeks a report that the Walt Disney Company is considering presenting productions in the New Amsterdam Theater, a graceful 10-story Art Nouveau building in disrepair that was once the home of the Ziegfeld Follies. Disney is still negotiating with the New York City Economic Development Corporation, but no agreement has been reached.
 
The Oldest Established . . .
 After its renovation, the Victory will be renamed the New Victory. It will be "the oldest functioning legitimate theater in New York," said Hugh Hardy, the renovation's principal architect, from the firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates.
Programming at the theater will be primarily for teen-agers, pre-teens, and children with their parents. An audience of 150,000 a year has been estimated by the planners.
"This is the greatest concentration of theaters on any block in the world," said Cora Cahan, president of New 42d Street, a not-for-profit group founded by the city and state of New York in 1990 to determine new uses for six theaters situated within the 42d Street Development Project. "The replacement of X-rated films with family fare within a single theater will communicate a message of hope up and down the block."
Among the programs planned by New 42d Street for the inaugural season at the New Victory are productions by the Night Kitchen, a national children's theater company founded by Maurice Sendak and Arthur Yorinks; a free summer program by Theaterworks/USA; presentations by the Crossroads Theater Company, a black company in New Brunswick, N.J.; classical and contemporary plays for young people and adults by Theater for a New Audience, a New York-based company run by Jeffrey Horowitz, and work by Urban Bush Women, an ensemble of black theater artists.
Also planned is a film series assembled by Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese; a puppetry series from the Jim Henson Foundation, and a series of third-world films under the direction of Warrington Hudlin and the Black Film Maker Foundation.
Ms. Cahan said that turning the Victory into a legitimate Broadway theater was rejected because "it would probably have left the theater dark more than it was lit, and our mission was to get people on the street all year round."
She added that her organization had decided on a theater devoted to family-oriented productions because "it will be the first centrally located large-scale family theater in New York devoted solely to offering low-cost presentations." She said that large, centrally located children's theaters in Minneapolis, Seattle and Honolulu had become financial and popular successes.
When asked whether parents would feel comfortable taking their children to the hard-core precincts of Times Square, Ms. Cahan replied: "We have to prove to families that it's safe, and we believe it is. The area is cleaner and safer than it's ever been, and it's going to get better."
Many in the Times Square neighborhood have tired of "studies and plans and studies of the plans" for future development on 42d Street, Ms. Cahan said, "and it was time to jump-start development on the street by operating a visible symbol of its revitalization. We hope the New Victory will be a catalyst for other activities."
 
Historic Guidelines
 The reconstruction of the Victory is governed by historic-design guidelines imposed by the city and the state. Mr. Hardy said the theater's original brownstone stoop would be reconstructed, the cornice replaced, and the interior plaster and woodwork restored.
The Victory was opened as the Republic Theater on Sept. 27, 1900, by Oscar Hammerstein (its greatest hit was "Abie's Irish Rose," one of Broadway's longest-running plays) and was named the Victory after World War II. In the early 1970's it became a pornographic movie theater, and by 1990 was empty except for occasional theatrical productions.
The planned annual operating budget of the New Victory will be $3 million, half of it supplied by earned income and half to be raised by donations. The chairman of the New 42d Street is Marian S. Heiskell, and its members include Linda LeRoy Janklow, Bill Irwin and Terrence McNally.
The renovation will be paid for by Times Square Center Associates, a private real-estate partnership comprising Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America. In 1988, the Center Associates signed leases with the city and state to construct four office towers at the corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, plans that were shelved in 1992 because of the recession's effect on office construction in Manhattan.
 
Financing Nonprofit Ventures
 The agreements required that the Associates provide $18.2 million to New 42d Street, with most of the money earmarked for nonprofit venues. Renovations for the New York Information Center will be paid for by the commercial leaseholder.
Ms. Cahan said that the concept for the New York Information Center had come from the design firm of Edwin Schlossberg, which had proposed a gathering place for tourists in Times Square featuring current information on Broadway and Off Broadway theater offerings, museum exhibitions, gallery shows and sports events.
Appoximately half the space of the information center will stand within the Times Square Theater, built in 1920 by the impresarios Edgar and Arch Selwyn. The other half will occupy one of two adjacent theaters: either the Academy (formerly known as the Apollo), a theatrical house built in 1920 and now used for for pop-music concerts, or the Lyric, built in 1903, which was most recently a movie theater and is now unused.

HEADLINE: For Blacks, Chef Jobs Finally Call

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
FOR hundreds of years there have been black cooks in America. Now there are also black chefs.
In the last few years, more blacks have begun achieving prominence and recognition as professionals in fine restaurants, diversifying a field that was once almost exclusively white, male and, in the most prestigious restaurants, European. 
 In the past, few blacks sought admission to the top cooking schools, which funnel graduates into the best restaurants.
"There was a tendency to look down on being in the kitchen because that's where we were relegated for so many years," said Doreen Thompson, a food-loving lawyer in Washington who founded the African-American Chefs and Cookbook Authors Association last April. "Now, it's being seen as an economically viable profession, and it's percolating up."
Historically, young blacks have not been able to look around and see many inspiring role models. That is changing, too, as blacks, like members of other minority groups and women, gradually move into jobs that are more visible and more powerful. Ms. Thompson's group is one of a number of new nonprofit organizations that support blacks in the food field through education, financial aid and publicity.
Significantly, black head chefs in fine restaurants -- like Steve Simmons of One Market, in San Francisco; Patrick Clark of the Hay-Adams Hotel, in Washington; Walter Hinds of Lolabelle, in Manhattan, and Jacqueline Cholmondeley of Livanos, in White Plains -- have generally found restaurant kitchens to be colorblind.
"When you're in the kitchen trying to turn out the food, there is no time for attitudes," said Mr. Simmons, the chef at One Market, a new restaurant. "In this kitchen we're chefs and cooks first." A graduate of Bates College who has been in the food business for 12 years, Mr. Simmons started as a busboy in San Francisco and eventually attending the restaurant program at City College there.
At the same time, this generation of chefs is also turning out food that tends to be colorblind. Prominent black chefs are cooking the way their white counterparts are cooking: contemporary American, with French, Italian, Asian and Caribbean influences.
While a great number of black cooks are still preparing soul food and barbecue, maintaining a culinary tradition for which blacks have long been celebrated, that kind of food does not lead to executive chef positions in top hotels and restaurants. Nor does it lead to the kind of acclaim that is showered on chefs like Mr. Clark, the executive chef at the Hay-Adams, who is regularly invited to cook alongside Wolfgang Puck and Larry Forgione at benefit dinners.
In the words of Mr. Hinds, the executive chef at Lolabelle, "A black cook is not a chef." A chef, he said, runs a kitchen and is responsible for more than just cooking. As soon as he finds the necessary financial backing, he plans to open his own restaurant, preferably in TriBeCa.
Mr. Hinds, who was born in Panama -- where his father was a chef -- and grew up in Port Jefferson, L.I., attended Peter Kump's New York Cooking School. His first job was in the kitchen of Safari Grill, a now-defunct restaurant on Third Avenue owned by David Keh. "There were many ethnic groups in that kitchen, so from the beginning, I haven't had any problem with discrimination," he said.
He calls his food, which features dishes like pepper-seared tuna with stir-fried Asian greens, crisp rice noodles and a soy-tomato vinaigrette, contemporary American. Some of his food also reflects his heritage. He often serves a side dish of mashed plantain and puts dandelion greens in his roast garlic risotto. "But I've gone way beyond any stereotype," he said.
Lola Bell, the owner of the restaurant where he works, studied at the French Culinary Institute to avoid being stereotyped. "Just because you're black doesn't mean you have to serve curried goat or black-eyed peas and smothered pork chops," she said.
At One Market, Mr. Simmons's specialties include a fried onion salad with smoked salmon and chervil creme fraiche and a beef tenderloin with a red wine reduction and bone marrow sauce.
This new group of young black chefs is proving, often to skeptical parents and high school students alike, that becoming a chef or embarking on a career in the food service industry can lead to success and financial independence, not a return to the servitude of generations past.
Statistics compiled by the National Restaurant Association, a trade group in Washington, show that blacks, who represented 10 percent of the total work force in 1992, held a higher-than-average proportion of jobs in food preparation and service, 13 percent.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that in 1992, blacks held about 44,000, or 13.2 percent, of the 338,000 supervisory positions in food service and preparation. In 1983 they held about 25,000, or 10.6 percent, of 239,000 supervisory positions.
"Maybe we'll start to bring a sense of the prestige you can have in this field," said Mr. Simmons, who was one of a group of black chefs honored in August at a benefit dinner held by the Sonoma County chapter of 100 Black Men. This group, a national organization, is dedicated to promoting positive role models and raising money for scholarships.
"The jobs are not just in the kitchen," Mr. Simmons added. "There are also careers in the front of the house, in management, but kids don't know what the opportunities are."
Ms. Cholmondeley, the executive chef at Livanos, a seafood restaurant, said: "We have to convince people that this is a creditable profession. They think of McDonald's and they're not aware of the possibilities."
A native of Guyana, Ms. Cholmondeley originally wanted to be a textile designer but became interested in food and decided to attend the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. She helped organize a new chapter of black alumni of the school, which is often considered the Harvard of professional cooking schools. The group hopes, among other things, to establish three full-tuition scholarships.
Jane Wallace, a director of the school who heads the enrollment committee, said blacks make up 4 percent of the student body. Over all, the minority enrollment, including Hispanics, Asians and American Indians, is 12 percent.
Industry observers also point out that high school guidance counselors need more information about opportunities in the food-service field. "Many of them do not understand that home ec can lead to management positions," said Michael Hurst, a restaurateur in Fort Lauderdale and former president of the National Restaurant Association, who is advising guidance counselors in Florida. The first black president of the restaurant association, Herman Cain, takes office next year. He is also the chief executive of the Godfather's Pizza chain.
Ms. Bell, the owner of Lolabelle, who started working in restaurants to supplement her income as an actress, regularly talks to high school students.
"The restaurant business is wonderful because you can be a success without a college degree," she said. "Where else can you start with nothing and wind up owning a business?"
Ms. Bell has also started an apprenticeship program in her kitchen, a step not without its disheartening aspects. One apprentice, she said, wound up selling drugs in the kitchen. "That was the downside," she said. "But then when I saw the progress made by one young man who could not look you in the eye at first, I knew it's worthwhile."
Many successful black chefs came from close-knit families. Where the family structure is fragile or nonexistent, mentors become even more essential.
Susy Davidson, the executive director of the new International Association of Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, said, "You have to have role models and actively network so you can help each other." Her group also plans to reach out to minority men, because they face problems similar to those confronting women.
Black women have long been professional cooks, a vocational track that evolved from the days when they were domestic employees. A number of them have become extremely successful, like Sylvia Woods, the owner of Sylvia's, a soul-food restaurant in Harlem, and Leah Chase, whose mother opened Dooky Chase, a Creole restaurant in New Orleans, in 1941.
If today's chefs have broadened their culinary horizons, they have not abandoned tradition. Edna Lewis, for many years the chef at Cafe Nicholson, a restaurant serving Continental food in Manhattan, is now the executive chef at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn and is serving some Southern specialities.
Joe C. Randall, who was an instructor at California State Polytechnic Institute and is now promoting black chefs through cable television programs called "Cookin' With Soul," also started a group called A Taste of Heritage Foundation to highlight black contributions to the American table and to raise money for scholarships.
Ms. Thompson, the founder of the new African-American chef and cookbook author association, is hoping that as blacks become increasingly powerful in the food field, the status of black cooking will also rise.
"We need greater recognition of the African-American contribution to the American table," Ms. Thompson said. "There are very few upscale restaurants serving African-American food, and we need to encourage them."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
WITH the peak wine-buying season coming up in the next few months, the wine industry in the United States shifts into high gear in October, with everyone from winery presidents to retailers asking the same question: will wine sales this year surpass those of 1992, the best year for sales since 1985?
The consensus is that, with the recession receding, 1993 should be slightly better than 1992. 
 In 1992, the industry reversed a seven-year decline. Shipments were up about 7 percent over those of 1991, at 185 million cases, compared with 173 million, according to Impact, a trade publication in New York. (Each case has 2.38 gallons of wine.) Wine consumption showed a modest increase: 2.43 gallons for every adult 21 or older, up from 2.32 gallons in 1991. That was still far below the levels of 1980, when the average wine consumption was almost 3.2 gallons for every adult American.
Wine industry leaders and economists who follow the business are chary about predictions because the industry's performance in 1992 was something of an anomaly. Americans bought more wine from Europe than usual in a panic buying spree. They were trying to avoid tariffs that the United States threatened to impose because of a dispute with the European Community over French farm subsidies.
The issue was resolved, temporarily at least, last November but not before importers had indulged in several months of panic buying. Imports of table wine from the European Community in 1992 were up 21 percent over those of the previous year -- but much of that wine has yet to be sold.
Not all import increases were driven by the tariff threat. Imports from Chile were up 50 percent in 1992 over those of 1991. Australian imports were up 30 percent, but with just 930,000 cases sold, it was a modest figure compared with the nearly two million cases from Chile. Australian wine's performance in this country is something of a mystery given the high quality and reasonable prices of so many Australian wines.
The industry continues to benefit from the effects of the so-called French paradox -- the theory, given immense publicity in late 1991, that the French, who consume a relatively high-fat diet, have a relatively low rate of heart disease. Noting that the French drink more red wine than Americans, the theory held that the moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages, red wine in particular, may be what lessens the incidence of heart disease in France.
The impact of the French paradox on wine consumption has been remarkable. According to a report prepared for the Seagram Classics Wine Company by Infoscan, a service that tracks consumer preferences from supermarket sales, red varietal wine sales were up 42 percent last year in the United States, while white varietals were up 13 percent. White zinfandel, the most popular of the so-called blush wines, a separate varietal category, was also up 13 percent, the report said.
Varietals, which bear the name of the principal grape from which they are made, were once an insignificant portion of this country's total wine market. The market has been dominated by the inexpensive generic wines that are blends of various grapes, with generic names like Burgundy and Chablis.
In 1992, generic wines accounted for 51 percent of all table wines sold in the United States, with varietals making up the balance. That was a 16 percent jump for varietals over 1991, while generic wines continued their long slide by dropping 1 percent, the Infoscan report said. This year, industry observers predict, varietals will probably dominate the market for the first time. The surge of varietals can be attributed to several factors: a more sophisticated public, immense plantings of premium grapes in recent years and the blush-wine phenomenon.
A decade ago, wine consumers were still conditioned to ask for a glass of white wine. Gradually, that gave way to a glass of Chablis and more recently to a glass of chardonnay. In spite of the French paradox, Americans prefer white wines by a wide margin. In sales of varietals in the United States last year, red wines accounted for 21 percent of sales; whites, 43 percent, and the blush wines, 36 percent.
One of the blush wines, white zinfandel, is America's favorite varietal. It is made from the red zinfandel grape, but most of the color is removed, resulting in a wine that is pale pink or salmon, usually sweet and often slightly fizzy. It is immensely popular, often with newcomers to wine who are put off by the dryness and astringency of traditional wines. Some 16 million cases of white zinfandel were shipped last year, according to Impact, an increase of almost 10 percent over 1991.
The most popular varietals after white zinfandel are chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon. Chardonnay shipments were up 26 percent last year, to 13.1 million cases, while cabernet sauvignon was up 33 percent, to 8 million cases. According to Infoscan, chardonnay accounted for 40 percent of all white varietal sales in the United States in 1992.
The surprise wine of the year turned out to be none of the above; it was merlot. While it accounted for only 11 percent of the red varietal category, its sales were up 92 percent over those of the previous year. Merlot is the second-most important grape of Bordeaux, after cabernet sauvignon, and is actually the principal grape in legendary wines like Chateau Petrus. It has been grown in California for many years but has come to prominence there only in the last decade, both in Bordeaux-style blends and on its own.
 
TASTINGS
Hargrave Vineyard chardonnay 1990 Lattice label, Long Island; about $14.
 
 It shouldn't, but it still comes as a surprise each time someone notes that Hargrave Vineyard has been making wine on the North Fork of Long Island for two decades. The North Fork has come of age. Should there be any lingering doubts about this achievement, here is a wine to put them to rest: a truly first-rate chardonnay from some of the oldest vines on the Island. This is a multidimensional wine, but it doesn't give up its charms easily. There are none of the by-now-familiar attractions of so many highly praised California chardonnays, like too much oak or alcohol and in many cases an initially pleasant roundness that often belies a lack of character. This chardonnay hints at minerals rather than apples and pears; Chablis rather than Montrachet. The wine spent spent time in small French oak barrels, but the effect is not intrusive. At Hargrave, there is talk of the wood "focusing" the wine's aromas. Well said. The wine should age elegantly.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Supports Fed's Secrecy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 19

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, testifying alongside 15 senior Federal Reserve officials, said today that the economy would be hurt if Congress forced the central bank to operate with less secrecy.
Mr. Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said proposals to require detailed disclosure of its discussions would discourage the central bankers from speaking freely. 
 "Monetary policy would suffer, and the economy with it," Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.
His views were echoed, as if by a Greek chorus, by 5 other members of the Federal Reserve Board and 10 of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks. More openness could upset a system that works well and could injure the economy, they said.
Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Banking Committee, called today's unusual mass hearing to ask for the bankers' views on his legislative proposals to require the Fed to disclose its decisions within a week of the meetings of its main policy-making committee. He has also called for videotaping those meetings and releasing the tapes, with detailed transcripts, within 60 days.
The Federal Reserve currently releases a summary of these meetings six weeks after they take place.
Mr. Gonzalez asserted that financial markets were injured by delays in announcing Fed decisions as well as by leaks of its decisions.
"Accurate information does not undermine markets," he said. "Partial information and leaked information undermines market efficiency."
Mr. Greenspan and several other Fed officials said that if meetings were videotaped Fed officials would not debate freely, but would instead rely mostly on prepared statements. Videotaping or requiring detailed disclosure, he said, "would so seriously constrain the process of formulating policy as to render those meetings nearly unproductive."
"The candid airing of views, the forthright give and take and the tentative posing of new ideas likely would disappear," he said.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, also opposed videotaping, saying "participants would hesitate to use hypothetical or speculative examples to explain points because these examples could be misinterpreted and cause unnecessary volatility in the financial markets."
He said policy discussions would tend to take place outside committee meetings, with Fed officials coming to meetings with preconceived views far more than was now the case.
Several central bankers said the rapid disclosure of the Fed's policy decisions -- which often call for raising or lowering interest rates conditioned upon an event that might not happen -- could make rates jump or drop when the central bank did not want any immediate change.
Several Fed officials seemed willing today to accept one change: to allow the release of highly detailed minutes five or so years after policymaking meetings. But these officials said sensitive material, like dealings with foreign central banks, should be omitted from the minutes.
The Fed released such minutes before 1976 but now releases much shorter summaries of its meetings.
Mr. Gonzalez said those summaries were not nearly detailed enough and often did not say which official argued which point in discussions.
James A. Leach of Iowa, ranking Republican of the House Banking Committee, asked the presidents of the regional banks which of three proposals they favored to assert more democratic control over the Fed: that they be appointed by the President, rather than by boards of local bankers; that they be stripped of their votes on the Fed's policymaking committee, or that the Federal Reserve Board appoint them.
Although most of the regional bank presidents opposed any change, the one they found most palatable would be having the Federal Reserve Board appoint them because that would leave the Fed less subject to political pressures than other proposals.

HEADLINE: Ex-Chief of State Fed Joins Goldman

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company announced yesterday a prize catch: E. Gerald Corrigan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Starting in January, he will become a high-profile Goldman executive and concentrate on lining up new business -- mostly overseas -- for the firm. As the Fed's point man abroad, Mr. Corrigan dealt frequently with foreign central bankers and ministers, developing relationships that will undoubtedly be useful to Goldman. 
 The announcement, at a news conference, lacked the fanfare that accompanied the arrival on Wall Street in 1988 of another Fed leader, Paul A. Volcker. After serving as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Volcker joined Wolfensohn & Company as chairman and partner. Mr. Corrigan has hired on at Goldman as a salaried executive, not a partner.
"It is a role that does not involve him in line management," Stephen Friedman, Goldman's chairman, said in an interview. "There is flexibility designed into his role, to fit his druthers and ours."
Mr. Corrigan, who earned $250,000 a year as president of the New York Fed, will earn more in the new job, although neither he nor Mr. Friedman would say how much more.
Mr. Corrigan took pains yesterday to explain how flexible his new job would be. Until next July, the first anniversary of his departure from the Fed, he will stay away from securities trading and dealing with banks, although the law does not require this effort to avoid conflict of interest.
"The orientation of my work will be project driven," Mr. Corrigan said, adding that he would tailor his duties for a while "to make sure the umbilical cord with the Fed is unequivocally severed."
Even after next July, Mr. Corrigan said, he would stay away from trading and banking, acting mostly as a project adviser to help line up merger business, financing for corporations and governments or funds for a big construction project like an airport. "It is like being in a candy store and being 5 years old," Mr. Corrigan said, explaining that by nature he prefers to be where the action is.
The Goldman job is Mr. Corrigan's first in the private sector; he joined the Federal Reserve in 1968 while still getting his Ph.D. in economics at Fordham University. In his new career, his title will be chairman of the firm's International Advisers, a group of people in different countries who meet periodically to counsel the investment bank on strategy.
Mr. Corrigan, 52, said he would also continue, at least until year's end, as chairman of the Russian-American Enterprise Fund, formed last summer by the Clinton Administration, with $340 million in Federal money to invest in small and new Russian enterprises. Because of the potential conflict of interest, Mr. Corrigan said, he will recuse himself from doing business in Russia for Goldman.
 
Role in Helping Russia
 More than anyone else in the Federal Reserve system, Mr. Corrigan has played a role in helping Russia make the transition to free enterprise. He is still engaged in a project to reorganize Russian banking practices, and on trips to Moscow, he has met frequently with Boris N. Yeltsin, developing what American officials have described as a close relationship with the Russian President.
As president of the New York Fed for nearly nine years, Mr. Corrigan had regulatory responsibility for banks in the New York region, and he announced months ago that he would not take a job at a bank. He also played a role in the 1991 downfall and reorganization of Salomon Brothers, after that firm submitted false bids in Treasury auctions supervised by the New York Fed.
Salomon Brothers did not bid for Mr. Corrigan's services, Wall Street officials said. The negotiations with Goldman started in early August, two weeks after he left the Federal Reserve bank presidency.
"He had, as you would expect, several very nice opportunities on Wall Street and thereabouts," said Mr. Volcker, who was Mr. Corrigan's mentor at the Fed. "From all the sounds of his new job, they made it nice and flexible for him."

HEADLINE: Plan Seeks Improvement Package for Financial District

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
A two-year study of lower Manhattan concludes that a broad package of renovation, construction and marketing is needed to improve the area that includes the Financial District, Battery Park City and the South Street Seaport.
The 96-page plan for the area, released yesterday by the city Planning Department, proposes bolstering the business community and the tourist industry through a combination of tax breaks, city financing, zoning changes and a special business tax to finance promotion of the area. 
 Specific proposals include continuing the esplanade from the southwest tip of Battery Park City to the Brooklyn Bridge, building a tourist center off Battery Park and linking historical sites through a clearly marked path reminiscent of the Freedom Trail in Boston.
The plan, which is the first for lower Manhattan since the 1960's, combines projects already under construction with others in the planning stages and still others, like the long-discussed Second Avenue subway, that may be little more than wishful thinking. The commission has no authority to finance or carry out the plan, but says it has the support of city officials. And Robert R. Douglass, vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank and chairman of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association, says that the area's business executives are likely to adopt many of the proposals.
Richard L. Schaffer, head of the planning department, said that the proposal "puts the local government and the business community on the same track." William Rudin, a local developer whose family owns four downtown office buildings, called it "a blueprint for reestablishing lower Manhattan as a viable financial, cultural and residential community."
The area bounded by Chambers Street and Brooklyn Bridge to the north, and by waterfront on the other three sides, has lost 100,000 jobs since 1988, when employment peaked at 475,000 people. More than 22 percent of its available office space is empty, and many of its buildings are technologically obsolete.
As telecommunications have made it feasible for companies to relocate their back-office operations, jobs have moved to New Jersey and elsewhere. Lehman Brothers announced last week that it was moving 900 jobs to Jersey City, to the same building that captured 2,500 back-office jobs from Merrill Lynch last year.
The plan recommends tax incentives for companies that turn empty lots into clean open spaces. It proposes simplified zoning to encourage new uses for old buildings. It pinpoints streets that should be converted to pedestrian malls, piers that need renovation and routes that could use new bus service. And it proposes a marketing effort to attract more international business.
Beyond business incentives, the plan proposes renovating Battery Park and marketing the area to tourists, probably through a proposed business improvement taxing district. Most of downtown's attractions, including the trade center, the stock exchange, the Woolworth building, the seaport and Trinity Church, can be seen in a day or two, but the street grid is so irregular that many tourists do not realize they can walk from one to the other.
The lower Manhattan plan is vastly different from the last one for the area, issued in 1966. Back then, more than a third of the businesses downtown were in manufacturing. The city envisioned a bustling 24-hour community with 40,000 residents. Today there are 14,000 residents in the area, half of them in Battery Park City.
The projects that are already in the works include replacing the Whitehall Ferry Terminal, which was destroyed by fire, at a cost of $112 million. And many prominent office buildings, including the World Trade Center, are being upgraded.
About 150 architects, engineers and other private sector figures are to attend a half-day seminar on Empty Building Syndrome, to "develop concepts and ideas on how to use old, empty buildings that can't support today's technologically advanced businesses," said Louis J. Coletti, a senior vice president of Lehrer, McGovern, Bovis, a construction management firm that is one of the event's sponsors.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Paper Maker Turns a Cleaner Page

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKLIN, Va.

 BODY:
At a time when many in the paper industry are resisting environmentalists' calls for more recycled fiber and less use of chlorine in paper making, the Union Camp Corporation stands out as a company that has voluntarily taken these steps.
At the sprawling paper plant here on the bank of the sleepy Blackwater River, a few miles from the North Carolina border, a confluence of history, geography and economics has led to the "greening" of Union Camp. 
 To ease the burden on the shallow river, the company last year started a bleaching line that uses ozone, a form of oxygen, instead of chlorine, a toxic water pollutant. And the company is now installing equipment that will remove ink from paper that is retrieved from trash bins, so the recycled fibers can go into new paper.
That means fewer trees will have to be cut -- no small consideration at a factory that is one of the world's largest producers of fine-finish writing and printing paper, rolling out 2,000 tons of the products each day.
Such actions by a big paper company delight environmentalists, who say the moves refute industry arguments that eliminating chlorine and adding a substantial amount of recycled paper are either technically impossible or not economic.
"It is important to recognize that this is one of the largest and most profitable fine-paper mills in the world," said Lauren Blum, a staff scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "It shows that this environmental stuff makes economic sense."
Indeed, Charles H. Greiner Jr., a Union Camp vice president and manager of its fine-paper division, described the investment of $108 million in the recycling equipment as "a market-driven decision."
"Customers want recycled products," he said. "There is a growing awareness that waste is a form of pollution, and that will keep demand for recycled paper high."
The paper industry and environmental groups are often at odds, if only because of the nature of the paper-making process. It involves chopping down trees and boiling and bleaching them in strong chemicals until the brown wood has been converted into white paper, consuming and discharging large volumes of tainted water in the process.
Environmentalists prefer to see trees standing in forests, and they put a high value on clean water and air.
Indeed, the two groups have been squabbling since last April over a pending Presidential order intended to promote recycling by directing Federal agencies to purchase paper with at least some recycled content.
The industry, represented by the American Forest and Paper Association, has argued that it cannot incorporate more than 10 percent recycled paper without disrupting paper mill operations. A coalition of environmental advocacy groups have said anything less than 20 percent would be ineffective in developing markets for recycled products.
President Clinton was expected to sign an order mandating the 20 percent standard for paper purchases by the Government. But no action has yet been taken, and the lobbying from both sides continues.
Union Camp plans to have its Franklin plant produce paper with 30 percent recycled content when the de-inking line goes into operation in February 1995. The company could increase that to 50 percent if market demand warranted it.
With $3.06 billion in sales last year, Union Camp, based in Wayne, N.J., ranks 11th among American paper companies, far behind the industry leader, International Paper.
Mr. Greiner said Union Camp was consciously trying to stay ahead of the bulk of the paper industry in recycling to gain additional sales. It also wants to take advantage of the mill's relative proximity to the urban "forests" of Washington, Philadelphia and New York, where used office paper is available in abundance.
"We are situated in a place with an advantage," he said. "That helped make this project feasible."
Environmentalists have also argued that the Government should buy chlorine-free paper because use of chlorine and chlorine compounds as bleaching agents results in discharges of dioxin, chloroform and other toxic materials. The industry has countered -- apparently successfully, in the case of the pending Clinton order -- that chlorine is an integral part of the process and that modern technology has reduced toxic discharges.
But at the Franklin plant, only the oldest of the three bleaching lines still uses chlorine. The second oldest uses an oxygen bleaching process, and the newest works with ozone. Union Camp's other fine-paper plant, a newer factory in Eastover, S.C., only uses oxygen bleaching.
Six paper machines, each a city block long, run almost continuously at the Franklin plant, making paper from a mixture of Southern pine and hardwoods.
As part of its recycling program, Union Camp is increasing the capacity of some of its paper-making machines. That means the additional recycled fiber can be used to raise the plant's overall output and will not require the company to curtail its existing pulping operations.
One reason the paper industry has resisted higher recycled-content standards is the fear of upsetting the finely tuned balance between pulping and paper-making operations at many mills. It is a use-it-all process in which a tree trunk goes in one end and a finished roll of paper emerges at the other.
While Union Camp's recycling effort has been motivated by hopes for increased sales, development of the ozone bleaching process was part of a longtime effort to solve a local environmental and logistical problem: the level of the Blackwater River is too low most of the year to absorb the 33 million gallons of water a day used in making paper.
"If you were to site a mill like this today, you would not put it here," said Norman C. Shroyer, technical director of the fine-paper division. "There is very little flow in the summer, so we have to store our effluent for eight months and release it in four months."
The mill's location is a historical accident, starting with a pre-Civil War sawmill that used the river as a convenient means of transporting logs. The company still has extensive lumber operations here, with scraps from the sawmill serving as a source of raw material for the paper plant.
With the chlorine-bleaching process, the used water must be discharged because it is too corrosive to metals to be re-used in other parts of the paper-making process. This meant that billions of gallons of water had to be stored in a pond covering 1,500 acres until the river was high enough to absorb the outflow. And even during the river's highest seasons, the dark colored water from the bleaching process was running afoul of regulations on water clarity.
Lately, environmentalists and pollution control officials in many states have been paying attention to another problem with chlorine bleaching: the formation of chlorinated organic compounds, many of them toxic. The Union Camp plant has not completely rid its paper-making operation of chlorine, but the use of chlorine has been significantly reduced.
Union Camp officials said they had been actively looking for substitutes for chlorine since 1980. The bleaching ability of ozone, an acrid gas formed by lightning and other electrical discharges, has long been known. But it was considered impractical for making paper because it weakened the wood fibers as it brightened them.
But company researchers developed a more refined process they say can bleach moist wood pulp without harming the fibers by carefully limiting the exposure to ozone. Last year, Union Camp replaced two of its old chlorine bleaching lines with a single one using ozone, which is capable of processing 1,000 tons of Southern pine a day and has been running ever since.
One advantage of ozone bleaching is that the residues from the process are not corrosive, so the water can be recycled and chemicals that are pulled out of the pulp can be recovered. That, and the virtual certainty of Federal rules eventually limiting the discharge of chlorotoxins drove the company to develop the process, officials say. It is not totally chlorine free, since chlorine dioxide is used to brighten the pulp, but the majority of the substance has been removed.
Mr. Greiner said the addition of the ozone process might give the company a competitive advantage when regulation tightens because the system was added as the old lines were becoming obsolete anyway.
"We may not eliminate chlorine completely," he said, "but we are headed in that direction."

Diagram: "How Paper Is Made"
Paper mills like Union Camp's begin with logs whose bark is removed in a rotating drum. The stripped logs are ground into chips before loading in a digester -- a pressure cooker that uses heat and chemicals to separate out the cellulose fibers from which paper is made. After washing, bleaching and refiners the fibers are combined with water and piped into the "head box" of the paper-making machine. From here, the slurry flows onto a moving screen that allows the water to drain off and the fibers to mesh. A series of rollers use pressure and heat to drive off the remaining water and the The finished paper is wound onto a big reel, ready for cutting into smaller rolls for shipment.
 
"Whitening Agents"
Bleaching is the process that transforms brown wood fiber into the bright white fiber required for most printing and writing papers. Traditionally, chlorine, a potentially toxic water pollutant, been used to bleach paper pulp. But Union Camp has developed a bleaching process that uses ozone, a form of oxygen.

HEADLINE: Small Stocks Battered, and Dow Falls 6.99

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Investors abandoned stocks in small companies yesterday, slicing away at the gains that had pushed the Nasdaq market to record highs last week.
The declines on the Nasdaq hit technology issues particularly hard and also seemed to spread pessimism to stocks in other areas, including the blue chips. 
 Few investors, however, seemed concerned that yesterday was the sixth anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash.
Lower third-quarter earnings results of companies like Philip Morris apparently had more influence on stock trading yesterday than did the Government's report that construction of new homes had reached a three and a half year high in September, traders said. That report might point to a strengthening of the recovery, but it did not touch off a strong rally in stocks sensitive to the economy.
 
Worst Drop Since April
 Dragged down by technology stocks like Microsoft, which fell 2 3/4 to 80 1/4, the Nasdaq composite index declined 14.20 points, to 768.71. The 1.8 percent drop was the worst one-day dip since the index declined 1.9 percent last April 26.
The American Stock Exchange's composite index also fell sharply, giving up 5 points, to 476.10.
After a late-morning rally, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.99 points, to close at 3,635.32.
Transportation stocks were one of the market's few brights spots. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 8.98, to 1,664.89, apparently because investors were anticipating strong third-quarter profits from railroad and airline companies.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, a broader indicator of trading on the Big Board, dropped 2.24, to 466.21. Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2. Volume was active at 304.4 million shares, but down from 329.6 million on Monday.
Some traders traced the decline in small stocks, which began on Monday, to investors who were cashing in on the record highs of last week. The drop does not indicate that the Nasdaq market is entering a prolonged period of retreat, these traders maintained.
"You did have four or five consecutive highs last week, so you certainly have profit taking thrown in there," said William Rothe, head of Nasdaq trading at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore.
 
'A Premium on Growth'
 "If you are looking at a truly low-growth, low-interest-rate environment, then the market is going to put a premium on growth," he said, explaining his optimism about Nasdaq issues. "In most circumstances, small-capitalization stocks are in a better situation to turn in growth than large, unwieldy companies."
Over all, analysts noted that the stocks that were battered most yesterday -- including those of banks and technology and communications companies -- were among those that have performed well recently.
Citicorp was the most active on the Big Board, rising 1/8, to 35 3/4, after it reported that its profits had more than tripled in the third quarter, coming in higher than analysts had predicted. Among other bank stocks, Chemical declined 1 1/8, to 40 7/8, after reporting a 78 percent jump in its earnings. And Chase Manhattan, which posted a 52 percent earnings gain on Monday, lost 3/8, to 33 3/4.
Philip Morris dropped 1 1/8, to 52 3/4 after it said its profits dropped 24.8 percent in the third quarter.
Shares of Polaroid fell 1 1/2, to 32 5/8, after the company reported a 10 percent drop in third-quarter earnings and said it would not meet its sales projections for its new medical imaging system.
Spectrum Information Technologies was the most active on the Nasdaq market for the second straight day. It lost some of its gains of Monday, falling 1 5/8, to 9 1/2. The company on Monday named John Sculley, the former chairman of Apple Computer, as Spectrum's chairman and chief executive.

HEADLINE: Florio-Whitman Debate Zeroes In on Ethics

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHIPPANY, N.J., Oct. 19

 BODY:
Meeting in their second debate of the campaign tonight, Gov. Jim Florio and his Republican rival, Christine Todd Whitman, traded sharp accusations over ethics and took swipes at each other's records and proposals.
Trailing by double digits in a series of independent polls -- including a 15-point spread in the most recent New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll -- Mrs. Whitman was under greater pressure to perform well in both debates before a statewide audience. 
 Asked to comment on the negative campaigning that both camps have adopted -- including a Whitman ad that proclaims Mr. Florio "maybe the worst Governor New Jersey ever had" and a Florio ad that suggests his rival is "out to lunch" -- and whether things would get dirtier in the final two weeks, Mrs. Whitman responded:
"I do owe the Governor an apology. He's probably not the worst Governor. I give that honor to Benjamin Franklin's son, who was taken out of the state in handcuffs for supporting King George's tax increases."
Mrs. Whitman, aided by the Republicans who control the Legislature, has spent the last two weeks peppering Mr. Florio on ethical issues -- including the state's bond business and purported violations of campaign spending law -- and the G.O.P. candidate took up that club from the outset of tonight's debate.
 
Sharp Give-and-Take
 "I'm glad to hear the Governor talk about credibility, because he has none," Mrs. Whitman said in her response to the first question from a panel of journalists.
Mr. Florio gave no ground. "If we are going to talk about ethics, who it is on the right side of the law, I have not been accused and fined for failing to pay my income taxes, Mrs. Whitman has," he said in response to a question about Joseph C. Salema, his former chief of staff who resigned in May amid media reports of a Federal grand jury investigation of state bond business. "I have not hired illegal aliens, I have not been charged and found guilty of breaking the campaign law.
"I'm more than happy to match ethical levels with anyone in the room," he said.
That brought an angry retort from Mrs. Whitman.
"Just once I wish the Governor would get his facts straight, but given the fact that this administration has so many things hanging over it, I guess it is not surprising to make up things about us," she said. "We have never, ever been fined for non-payment of our income tax, Governor. Get that straight. I also understand that we are talking about an administration that has two grand juries investigating it.
"It's staggering how much has been going on and he stands here and has the gall to say to me that I have lower ethical standards. That's outrageous."
Tonight's debate was the second debate for Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman. The debates are required because both accepted state funds for their campaigns. The candidates have agreed to a third debate at 11 A.M. Sunday on WNBC-TV (Channel 4) in New York City.
The candidates were questioned by a panel of journalists -- Ren Scott of Channel 2, Ken Matz of Channel 10 and Michael Aron of the New Jersey Network, the state-sponsored public television system. A network anchor, Kent Manahan, was the moderator.
 
Allowed One Question
 But each candidate also was allowed to ask one question of his or her opponent, and both tried to throw the opponent off stride.
Going after what is perceived to be Mrs. Whitman's weakest political point, policy matters, the Governor asked her to explain how her proposed plan for a 30 percent income tax cut would "interact with that specific provision of the New Jersey Constitution that talks about income tax revenue distribution."
Mrs. Whitman appeared dumbfounded by the question, but recovered quickly and went into one of her rehearsed attacks on Mr. Florio.
"Income tax revenue distribution is going obviously to be affected by the amount of the decrease in over- spending," she said. "What it is going to do is to enable us and require us to have a discipline that we have not seen to date. We have not seen a discipline of controlling the rate of growth of government spending."
 
Jobs Questions
 Mrs. Whitman questioned the Governor over the state's unemployment and her contention that the state under his administration had become anti-business, citing a Wall Street Journal report to support her claim.
"In the light of these statistics, what can you possibly tell the people of New Jersey that you will do differently to reverse these trends and stop the hurting?" she asked.
Mrs. Whitman's campaign had attacked Mr. Florio over those very issues in a news release on Monday and the Governor seemed well prepared for the question tonight.
"I was troubled by that report in the Wall Street Journal and I went to check on it," Mr. Florio said. "It turns out that the article was based upon an article that was written in 1986 in the middle of the Kean administration that you were a member of."
Tonight's hourlong debate was sponsored by the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and televised live over WCBS-TV (Channel 2) in New York City, WCAU-TV (Channel 10) in Philadelphia and the New Jersey Network. An audience of nearly 900 chamber members and their guests was gathered at Birchwood Manor, the banquet hall that served as the site of the debate.
The candidates left immediately after the debate and left it to their campaign strategists -- James Carville for Mr. Florio and Edward Rollins for Mrs. Whitman -- to continue the face-off.
Mr. Carville honed in immediately on the constitutional question Mr. Florio put to Mrs. Whitman.
"That's kind of important," he said. "She doesn't know what the state Constitution says. That's sad."
Mr. Rollins stood not five feet away in the middle of another cluster of reporters, where he was playing down poll results and talking up his candidate.
"She did well," he said. "She made her points. She talked about what's critical to the voters of this state."
The Florio campaign was prepared before both debates to minimize any boost the Republican candidate might glean.
On the day after the first debate, President Clinton came to the state with Mr. Florio at his side in a headline-grabbing visit that the Governor and the White House billed as official and the Whitman campaign angrily criticized as blatantly political.
Only hours before the start of tonight's debate, the Florio campaign announced that the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, would visit New Jersey tomorrow to campaign for the Governor and other Democratic Party candidates in events in Cherry Hill and in Teanack.
About the same time that Mrs. Clinton is stumping for Democratic votes, an administrative law judge in Newark is to hear arguments over a challenge by Mrs. Whitman's campaign that her Democratic rival should be forced to use campaign funds to pay for President Clinton's Oct. 8 visit to New Jersey as well as visits by Attorney General Janet Reno, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala.
Mrs. Whitman plans to begin the last two weeks of her campaign on Wednesday with the start of a three-day bus tour that will take her through 14 of the state's 21 counties.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
7,000 Drug Jobs to Be Eliminated

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Amid growing pressure to restrain health care costs, three large drug makers announced plans yesterday to cut 7,000 employees over the next three years, adding to tens of thousands of pharmaceutical-industry jobs eliminated in recent months.
Many of those jobs will be lost in New York and New Jersey, where large multinational drug companies maintain headquarters, research laboratories or factories. But the three companies, Pfizer, American Cyanamid and Upjohn, declined to say how the cuts would be distributed across their worldwide operations until they tell the workers affected. 
 Pfizer said yesterday that it was eliminating 3,000 jobs to prepare for changes, which, it said, had transformed drug making into "a very fragile industry." The company said it had already eliminated 1,000 jobs in previously unannounced reductions after it sold or spun off 14 businesses.
Pfizer is one of the largest manufacturers still based in New York City, which has lost at least 270,000 manufacturing jobs since 1987. The company has 3,400 employees in the city and nearly 13,000 in the three-state region, and yesterday it said it would not leave New York.
 
Spreading the Pain
 "There will just be fewer of us here," said Henry A. McKinnell, a Pfizer executive vice president.
He added that the new cuts would be spread over 40,000 workers in 70 nations and would include early retirements and dismissals. Those leaving will get extra pay and benefits.
American Cyanamid, based in Wayne, N.J., said it would cut 2,500 jobs -- about 9 percent of its workers -- over three years. Most of those will be in medical divisions, which include Lederle Laboratories units in Wayne and in Pearl River, N.Y.
Upjohn, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said it would eliminate 1,500 jobs through early retirements by December 1994 and close or reduce the size of 14 of 31 factories. Upjohn has cut its work force 17 percent, to 17,500, since early 1989 in preparation for the expiration yesterday of patents on two drugs -- Xanax, used essentially to treat anxiety, and Halcion, essentially for insomnia.
Trading in the three companies on the New York Stock Exchange was somewhat greater than usual yesterday. Upjohn gained 37.5 cents to close at $32 a share. Pfizer lost 75 cents a share, closing at $63. American Cyanamid closed at $57.50, down 37.5 cents.
Job reductions have spread through the industry, as buyers of managed health care use their growing strength to enforce price limits, cutting sharply into drug profits.
Last week, Bristol-Myers Squibb, which also has its home office in New York City, said it was offering voluntary retirement to 2,600 more employees based in the United States. The company had already cut 2,300 from its pharmaceutical and infant-formula divisions in the last year. And Eli Lilly & Company announced that it would cut 4,000 employees, mainly through early retirements in Indiana, where it is based.
"About 50 percent of the United States drug business now goes through price-sensitive Government and private buyers," said Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Securities. In the 1980's, drug companies could raise prices almost at will. Many physicians did not consider the costs, which were often routinely covered by insurance.
 
A Pre-emptive Effect
 President Clinton's health care proposals include sanctions to punish drug makers that do not restrain prices. Many companies have already limited price increases to general inflation rates.
The actions by the drug companies yesterday followed job reductions announced over the last 12 months by Merck & Company, Johnson & Johnson, Marion Merrell Dow, Monsanto's Searle unit, Syntex and Ciba-Geigy.
Pfizer, one of the strongest companies, said it would report a $525 million after-tax charge against earnings in the third quarter for consolidating manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions. With the charge, it said it lost $214 million, or 65 cents a share, in the quarter. Revenue rose 2 percent to $1.87 billion, taking account of the sale of a minerals unit spun off last year.
Still, William C. Steere, Pfizer's chairman, said the company had strong operating results. Sales from continuing operations rose 9 percent to $1.87 billion in the quarter.
Mr. Nordmann said pharmaceutical sales, the most lucrative part of the business, rose 12 percent in the United States and 13 percent overseas in spite of unfavorable changes in currency rates. He said Pfizer's earnings gains were far ahead of other American-based drug makers'.
With half a dozen new products showing sales gains, Mr. McKinnell said, Pfizer is cutting costs to make the company "even stronger."
Mr. Nordmann said that "unlike companies forced into down-sizing to maintain any growth whatsoever, Pfizer is taking this prudent move before its back is to the wall."
Upjohn said it would take a $183 million charge after taxes in the third quarter. Including the charge, Upjohn said it lost $30 million, or 19 cents a share in the quarter. Sales were $899.9 million, up slightly from $894.4 million the year before.
American Cyanamid said it would take a restructuring charge of $150 million to $200 million in the three months ending Dec. 31.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 28, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Oct. 20, about plans by Pfizer Inc., the American Cyanamid Company and the Upjohn Company to eliminate a total of 7,000 jobs, misstated the number of manufacturing jobs lost in New York City since 1987. It is about 94,000, not 270,000.

HEADLINE: U.S. TELLS HAITIANS OF EMBARGO TERMS

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Sharply raising the stakes for the Haitian military, United States diplomats announced a stringent series of conditions today that they said must be met before international sanctions placed on Haiti this week can be lifted.
The conditions, which begin with the retirement of Haiti's army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, include an end to political violence and human rights abuses and call for the army to get rid of the fearsome police auxiliaries, known as attaches, who roam the streets here terrorizing neighborhoods. 
 In a news conference today a spokesman for the United States Embassy said that in order for the Haitian military to be considered in compliance with the agreement which it signed last July, the Army must request the return of an international human rights mission that was evacuated from Haiti amid rising violence last week.
 
Other Guarantees Required
 The embassy spokesman said that the Haitian Army must also guarantee security for a special session of Parliament, guarantee security for Government ministers and maintain order.
The demands came amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at rescuing a settlement that would restore Haiti's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Father Aristide was scheduled to return after two years of exile on Oct. 30, but the refusal of General Cedras to resign has thrown plans into disarray.
To punish the military, the United Nations on Monday reimposed an embargo on oil and military supplies to Haiti, and the United States and other countries have sent ships to make sure that it is respected.
 
Conservative Critics Sought
 At the same time as they pressed the military, representatives of the United Nations and the four so-called "friends of Haiti" -- the United States, Canada, France and Venezuela -- have begun to press Father Aristide to open his transitional Government to include conservative critics close to the military.
Father Aristide's Government, headed by Prime Minister Robert Malval, was named six weeks ago, and is dominated by figures who are close to the deposed President.
In recent interviews, Evans Francois, the brother of the powerful Port-au-Prince police chief, Lieut. Col. Joseph Michel Francois, has said that Colonel Francois and the country's other military leaders would cooperate with United Nations efforts only if Father Aristide's Government were to concede several key ministries.
General Cedras has said in recent interviews that he is awaiting the passage of a broad amnesty law by the National Assembly before he will consider retirement. Diplomats have repeatedly countered that the country's negotiated political settlement only calls for Father Aristide to issue a presidential amnesty, which has already been done.
The Haitian Parliament has been unable to meet because of the climate of violence and Haiti's Justice Minister, Guy Malary, was assassinated last week.
In an interview today, the United Nations special mediator for Haiti, Dante Caputo, said that the Malval Government had been asked to "open the Cabinet to some other people." He denied that this meant inviting allies of the military into the Government.
A senior aide to Mr. Malval said tonight that gasoline sales in the country would be prohibited starting Thursday in keeping with the international embargo.

HEADLINE: 3 Congressmen Seek to Change Senate Filibusters

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Three House liberals today called on talk show hosts and editorial writers who have demanded changes in House procedures to join them in demanding an end to the Senate filibuster rule that permits unlimited debate.
Raising an issue that House rules forbid them to mention in floor debate, Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts, David R. Obey of Wisconsin and Mike Synar of Oklahoma, all Democrats, said at a news conference that Americans wanted changes in procedures not for their own sake but so that Congress could deal with their problems. 
 Mr. Frank said filibusters were routinely invoked, not over major issues as they once were, but over such issues as "the fundamental right of cows to eat cheap grass," a reference to a threatened filibuster over legislation that would raise grazing fees on Federal land.
The Congressmen said the Senate filibuster rule was the biggest single obstacle to Congress's doing its job.
Mr. Frank said the rule had "more to do with gridlock than all the other procedures put together." He said the filibuster had forced Democrats to water down several major bills this year, blocked President Clinton's bill to stimulate the economy from even coming to a vote and imperiled health care legislation.
Under Senate rules, it takes 60 votes to end debate and bring a measure to a vote, except for rules changes, which require 67. If the 44 Senate Republicans stick together, they can keep the Senate from voting.
Mr. Obey said the change in the filibuster rule should be accomplished as part of the work of the current Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress. He said he and his two colleagues, along with 32 other Democrats, hoped to enlist public opinion to put the same kind of pressure on the Senate as the House felt recently before it decided to open up procedures for forcing bills to a vote.
There is no way the House can use the joint committee to force Senate action; under the Constitution, each chamber makes its own rules. But the Democrats said they would oppose proposed rule changes to give House Republicans "more leverage" unless Senate Republicans accepted majority rule.
 
'Stone Age Rules'
 The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said filibusters had been used by both parties and by bipartisan alliances over the years. A filibuster, he said, "doesn't just protect the interests of a partisan minority, but also the interests of economic and geographic minorities, including individual states."
Indeed, the rules of each body severely restrict discussions of the other's. House rules preclude members from even discussing Senate rules on the floor, unless they are relevant to a pending measure. So Mr. Obey could not even have raised the issue, let alone spoken of "arcane and ridiculous Stone Age rules," if he had been speaking in the House rather than holding a news conference a few yards away. Nor could Mr. Synar have called the filibuster rule the "single most onerous rule" in Congress.
The three indicated that they would be satisfied with a change that gradually lowered the number of Senate votes needed to halt debate, so long as a majority could act in the end. They also insisted that the Senate end its practice of allowing a single senator to impose an anonymous "hold" that prevents a bill or a nomination from being brought up at all.

HEADLINE: Clinton Uses Japan to Sell Mexico Pact

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Gearing up for the final weeks of an uphill battle to win Congressional support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Clinton has settled on a provocative strategy that treats Japan, not Mexico, as the most severe threat to American jobs.
The new approach emerged today at the White House, where Mr. Clinton was joined by Lee A. Iacocca, the retired chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. The two appeared under one of two giant tents erected on the muddy South Lawn for a sort of political yard sale showcasing businesses that support the trade agreement. 
 Surrounded by business people and lobbyists in dark suits promoting things as dirverse as hot dogs and forklifts, both men predicted that if the trade agreement failed, Japan would make its own deal with Mexico to flood the United States with goods that undercut American products.
"What would we do in America if we turn away from this and they make this sort of arrangement with Japan, or with Europe, and they make the investments there, and then we have to deal with their products coming through the back door from Mexico?" Mr. Clinton said, referring to actions the Mexican Government might take if the trade agreement is rejected. "What will happen to our job base? I'm telling you, everything people worried about in the 1980's will get worse if this thing is voted down, and will get better if it's voted up."
Mr. Iacocca, who is loathed by many in Japan for his frequent criticism of Japanese trade barriers, was even more blunt than Mr. Clinton.
In television advertising on behalf of the pact, Mr. Iacocca has described a vote against the trade agreement as a vote in favor of Japan and Europe. "The Japanese and the Europeans think Nafta is a bad deal," Mr. Iacocca says in the commercial, which began to be shown this week. "Why? Because it's good for us and it's bad for them."
And in his remarks today, Mr. Iacocca dismissed criticism from opponents of the trade agreement like Ross Perot who argue that jobs will be lost to Mexico.
"I'm perplexed by a lot of my friends, be they Ross Perot or others," Mr. Iacocca said. "They say we can't compete against little old Mexico when we're beating the hell out of Japan in the auto business."
Mr. Iacocca said that those who supported the trade agreement had failed to convince Americans that it would help the economy. "It's nuts," he said of opposition to the agreement. "It's absolutely nuts."
For weeks, the Administration has been seeking an effective approach to use in selling the agreement after opponents got off to what one official described today as a "head start" in the battle.
 
Trying to Use Old Habits
 Because Americans are more accustomed to seeing Japan as the enemy on trade matters, the Clinton Administration has seized on that as an opportunity to simplify the argument for the trade agreement and add an emotional element to it.
"If this does not work, then what you see happen is that Mexico turns to Japan," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on Tuesday. "They turn to Europe."
Hadeaki Domichi, the economic counselor at the Japanese Embassy, said that the Japanese Government had taken no position on the trade agreement.
"Certainly we would expect Mexico and other Latin American countries would be very much disappointed if Nafta does not succeed," Mr. Domichi said. "They may look to other countries, including Japan. That is a natural reaction. But our relationship with Mexico will go on, regardless of Nafta."
If the the trade agreement is accepted, Japan could make investments in Mexico, for instance, in a factory making goods that could be exported to the United States free of tariffs.
Sen. Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, announced that he would vote in favor of the pact after meeting with the President this morning. The House, where the vote is more critical, will vote first, on Nov. 17.
Members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. tried to counter the President's appeal by arguing that the benefits of the trade agreement would not be as great as the Administration was projecting. The current American trade surplus of $5.4 billion with Mexico, union officials argued, has comes from transfers of plants and equipment, not from any increase in consumer purchases.
Saying he did not want Congress to "adopt this out of fear," Mr. Clinton criticized opponents of the agreement, saying, "There's been too much fear-mongering on the other side and all kinds of ridiculous statements made."

HEADLINE: Russia Threatens to Veto Any Sanctions West Seeks Against Libya

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct 20

 BODY:
Russia has threatened to use its Security Council veto to block new sanctions that the United States, Britain and France want to impose on Libya for refusing to hand over two citizens accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, United Nations diplomats say.
The strongly worded threat, made in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher that arrived last weekend, surprised and angered Administration officials. A total of 270 people died in the blast over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
 In response to Russia's move, Secretary of State Christopher will seek during a visit to Moscow later this week to find a compromise to insure that Libya will be able to repay its substantial debt to Russia after the Council has approved the new sanctions, diplomats said. The new penalties include a freeze on Tripoli's estimated $6.5 billion in overseas assets.
As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia, along with Britain, the United States, France and China, has a veto over all Security Council decisions.
If Mr. Christopher's effort succeeds, the Council will vote next week on the new sanctions, which also ban the sale of oil drilling equipment and aviation services to LibyaAmerican officials say. The Security Council has already banned all civilian airlines from flying to and from Libya because of its refusal to surrender the suspects for trial.
Russia's objection to the current draft resolution is that it would prevent Libya from using its overseas assets to pay off these debts, which amount to more than $1 billion and are mainly owed for arms. If Libya is allowed to transfer some of these assets to Russia in settlement of these debts, the sanctions will be weakened because Libya's leader, Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi, will be under less financial pressure to comply with the Security Council's order and hand over the suspects..
Mr. Christopher is expected to try to find a way of forcing Libya to pay its debts to Moscow out of its current oil revenues instead of by liquidating foreign assets, the officials said.
It is unclear why Russia would challenge d the United States, Britain and France after their governments gave President Boris N. Yeltsin their full support in his recent confrontation with a rebellious Russian Parliament. But diplomats said that Mr. Yeltsin might still find it politically necessary to show that he is standing up for Russian interests rather than submissively acceding to the wishes of the West.
Russian diplomats at the United Nations have been telling their Western colleagues that they believe they can detect the influence of the Russian generals who helped Mr. Yeltsin win his struggle against hard-line lawmakers.
The new sanctions were originally supposed to come into effect on Oct. 1, if Libya had not handed over the two accused agents for trial in Scotland and agreed to cooperate with a French judicial inquiry into a terrorist explosion aboard a French airliner over Niger in 1989 that left 171 people dead.
But the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, saying that the Libyans were becoming more flexible, asked for a delay while he continued negotiations. Libya now says the two accused men are free to go to Scotland for trial if they wish, but refuses to hand them over. The British, American and French Governments increasingly believe it will never do so.
Under the new draft resolution, the Security Council offers to "suspend" all economic sanctions against Libya if it changes its mind and surrenders the suspects. But it also threatens to reimpose them after 90 days if the United Nations Secretary General does not report that Colonel Qaddafi's Government has renounced support for international terrorism.

HEADLINE: At Flashpoint of Rioting, Now Banality Is Jarring

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Nothing very remarkable happened today at the infamous corner of Florence and Normandie Avenues in South-Central Los Angeles. The regulars came to get their chili dogs at Art's Famous Chili Dogs ("Since 1933"), neighborhood women got their hair done at Goldie's Beauty Salon, and all day long photographers and reporters came.
It was difficult to tell that this was the flashpoint, the epicenter where years of racial resentments exploded into the deadly disorders that rocked Los Angeles last year. It was difficult, under a warm hazy sun, to visualize the terror of Reginald O. Denny and other white and Asian drivers who were pulled out of their vehicles that day and brutalized. 
 Brian Weaver, a 34-year-old black man who works for a Christian relief organization, saw it happen, and he said it was evil incarnate. "The most remarkable feeling I had when I pulled up was the total absence of goodness; it was like evil, demonic," he said of the mobs of youths who terrorized the streets.
Today, Mr. Weaver came by to perform the mundane task of having his car washed.
 
Nonchalance Amid Ruins
 Indeed, the sheer banality of the intersection today is jarring. The northwest corner, where there was once a radiator shop, is nothing but a vacant lot with a tattered chain link fence festooned with hand-lettered commercial posters ("bathtubs reglazed"). Across the street are the boarded-up remains of a Shell service station.
Tom's Liquor store on the northeast corner and a Unocal service station on the southeast corner have both reopened. Above it all, incongruously, is a billboard from the Bank of America showing a middle-aged white farmer standing in front of rows of green crops.
Even if the men who beat Mr. Denny were as evil as Mr. Weaver said, they did not get off too leniently, in the view of the score or so of black passers-by interviewed today. No, they said, Damian M. Williams and Henry K. Watson, the two men charged in the beatings, only got the kind of gentle treatment that would have been accorded whites in similar circumstances.
"If it were two whites, they would have been charged with assault and battery, and there would have been a plea bargain," said Mr. Weaver, who can remember his youth when he was taught by friends to consider whites as "prey."
Nearby, James Scott, a 29-year-old unemployed handyman, sat on a stoop on Florence Avenue with a friend, Diane Williams. They also ratified the verdicts.
"It was cool," said Mr. Scott, adding that he knew one of the defendants, Damian Williams. "I feel they got justice." He recalled seeing the bloodied Mr. Denny in the street next to his 18-wheel truck and "felt sorry" for him. "It was awful," he said. "But what those police officers did to Rodney King was pretty awful too."
And Ms. Williams observed that very little had improved around Florence and Normandie, one of the poorest parts of the city. "They were going to put money in the community," she said. "I ain't seen nothing rebuilt."
Over at Art's, the blue-and-white chili joint, a black-owned establishment spared in the looting and arson, the counterman today pronounced the episode over. "It's all behind us now," he said, loading relish and mustard on hot dogs for two customers.
"I thought it was fair both ways," 27-year-old said Richard Wood, one of the customers, said, referring to the 30-month sentences given two police officers in the beating of Mr. King. "The cops got off easily, so why shouldn't these guys."
Rodney Walton, 34, the other customer, said shrugged and said, "Life goes on. I think everybody in the city is satisfied except Daryl Gates." Mr. Gates is the former chief of police, who personally arrested Mr. Williams last year.
They scanned the landmark intersection and wondered if there would be a monument erected there. Mr. Woods pondered the notion and then, with perverse humor, suggested a suitable monument: an 18-wheel diesel truck.

HEADLINE: BHUTTO STANDS BY NUCLEAR PROGRAM

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct. 20

 BODY:
In comments that seem certain to unsettle Pakistan's already fragile relations with Washington, the new Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, said today that her country would continue to pursue its nuclear program, which American intelligence officials maintain is devoted to the development of nuclear weapons.
"We will protect Pakistan's nuclear program and will not allow our national interest to be sacrificed," Ms. Bhutto said in a recorded television address that was broadcast tonight. 
 Her remark was consistent with those of previous Prime Ministers, who have adamantly rejected demands that Pakistan dismantle its weapons development programs yet never explicitly acknowledged that the country has nuclear arms.
But it was a change in emphasis for Mrs. Bhutto, who promised the United States in 1989, during her previous term as Prime Minister, that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear weapon and had no intention of developing one.
 
Warning to India Seen
 Though ambiguously worded, her statement today seemed intended mainly to assure the country's powerful military that it would retain nuclear options and to warn India, with which Pakistan has fought three wars, that her country is not about to scale back its military capabilities.
Coming a day after she took office, Ms. Bhutto's statement nettled the Clinton Administration and suggested that Washington's relations with Islamabad would remain distant.
A senior Administration official in Washington described Ms. Bhutto's statement as "not very helpful."
Under a measure approved by Congress in 1990 and known as the Pressler Amendment, no American aid can go to Pakistan until the President of the United States certifies that Pakistan does not possess nuclear weapons.
After a three-year battle to regain the office from which she was dismissed in 1990, Ms. Bhutto returned to power on Tuesday, heading a minority Government.
 
Little Elaboration
 Ms. Bhutto did not elaborate on Pakistan's nuclear intentions in an interview today in her office. But she said she intended to raise the issue of the aid cutoff with the Clinton Administration.
"We will be examining the aspect of regional non-proliferation, and we will also be examining the questions of taking up the issue with the United States on the whole question of Pressler and how it can be removed," she said. "The first thing is to start a dialogue on this issue."
Ms. Bhutto also said today that she would re-examine many of the economic changes introduced by her predecessor, Moeen Qureshi, a former vice president of the World Bank who had served as interim Prime Minister for the last 90 days. Many of those changes, including taxes on feudal estates and an end to some Government subsidies, have won praise from international bankers and aid donors.
Pakistan stepped up its nuclear program in the 1980's in response to reports that India was rapidly expanding its nuclear capability and amid tensions between the two nations over the disputed territory of Kashmir. India conducted an underground nuclear explosion in 1974.
 
Pakistani Forces Deteriorate
 Since the cutoff of American aid in 1990, Pakistan's conventional forces have deteriorated as parts for American-supplied equipment dried up.
Pakistan has scoured the globe for new military supplies. Lately, scores of arms dealers from Europe have visited Islamabad, including an Italian team that is now here trying to sell a missile system.
Already Ms. Bhutto has begun distancing herself from the sweeping economic changes begun by Mr. Qureshi. Among his changes were a devaluation of the overvalued rupee, steps to make the central bank independent of political influence, elimination of many price subsidies and an agricultural tax on the country's rich landowners. Many of those steps were intended to win back assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and to insure that the country can repay its international debts.
 
Support From Landowners
 Ms. Bhutto, who comes from a family that has been one of the country's largest landowners and who has broad political support from the landed aristocracy, or feudals as they are known here, said she would re-examine the agricultural tax.
She also said she was troubled by the nine percent devaluation of the currency, intended by Mr. Qureshi to stimulate exports by making them cheaper, discourage imports and pave the way to the convertibility of the rupee.
Ms. Bhutto's first term as Prime Minister ended after 20 months with her dismissal on charges of corruption and incompetence in 1990. She was widely criticized by women's groups in Pakistan for not introducing any policies to enforce women's rights or lessen the economic and legal disadvantages they face.
Though she rejected the criticism, Ms. Bhutto said that she intended to repeal discriminatory legislation against women now that Islamic fundamentalists have been resoundingly defeated in this month's elections.

HEADLINE: A Wary Reply to South Africa's Call

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Sprung from its economic shackles after more than a decade of sanctions, South Africa is seeking foreign investment to help cushion its transition to a multiracial democracy. But many American companies are so leery of the country's volatile politics that they are staying away and, it now appears, will not play a major role in shaping the start of this new era.
Despite recent pleas from leaders like President F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, who last week shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end the apartheid state, many of these companies say they face a host of obstacles to doing business in South Africa. And some point out that they are wary of entering the country not only because of conditions there, but also because of concerns about the reaction in the United States to such moves. 
 "There is no doubt that there is a tremendous amount of promise in South Africa," said Witney W. Schneidman, a senior vice president at Samuels International Associates, a consulting firm in Washington that specializes in South Africa. "But there are also a lot of questions that need to be resolved before that promise is realized."
 
Many Inhibiting Concerns
 Some American companies are worried about the policies of the African National Congress, which is expected to take power after the transition and once espoused hard-line socialist views -- particularly about nationalizing important industries like mining -- before its recent disavowal of them.
Others fear factional violence. Still others note that South Africa is competing with many emerging markets for capital, including those in Eastern Europe. The Ford Motor Company, which sold its assets in South Africa in 1988, says that whatever the political situation, the South African vehicle market is too depressed for it to make money by building or buying factories there.
And some companies that do business with state and local governments in the United States emphasize that they cannot seriously consider South Africa until those jurisdictions lift their sanctions, which helped force more than 200 American companies to leave the country in the 1980's.
Citing these factors, big conglomerates like the General Electric Company, the Procter & Gamble Company, Citibank and Eastman Kodak are expressing little enthusiasm about returning immediately to South Africa. The Mobil Corporation, which left in 1989, when it had $400 million in assets in South Africa and was the largest American company there, also says it has ruled out replanting roots for now.
There appears little chance in the near future that an American company will commit itself to the kind of investment South Africans seek: construction of factories or other projects that create new jobs for a recession-ridden economy saddled with an unemployment rate estimated at 45 percent.
 "In our business and other businesses that are capital intensive, you just don't move in and out according to the political winds," said an executive at a major American industrial company that left South Africa in the late 1980's.
 
A Tempting Market

 
 Even as the large American conglomerates are shying away, their European and Japanese counterparts, which faced much milder sanctions from their governments in the 1980's, continue to invest heavily in South Africa. Their interest shows that despite the drawbacks, the market is tempting.
South Africa has a population of nearly 40 million people with a growing black middle class, an excellent transportation system, abundant natural resources like coal, a stock exchange and a sturdy network of banks and other financial services companies. English is widely spoken. The country can be also used as a base to pursue other opportunities on the continent.
South Africa is particularly eager to do business with American banks, which called in loans to the Government in the 1980's, preventing it from rolling over its debt, as most countries periodically do. The Government then had to begin paying off principal, so it became a net exporter of capital and had to deprive its own industries of financing.
And in an odd twist, some analysts predict that by the end of the decade, the American companies that were once pressed to leave South Africa by some stockholders and elected officials may find that they are being pressured by the same people to establish a presence there to insure a peaceful transition. Already, some institutional investors, like the Calvert Social Investment Fund, are looking for business in South Africa for that reason.
So the country may be attractive to some companies, particularly privately held ones, which do not have to contend with shareholders still sensitive to dealings with South Africa. The Investor Responsibility Research Center, a monitoring group in Washington, says that at least 28 American companies have gone into South Africa since July 1991, including 11 computer or software companies. Fifteen of the 28 are privately held.
The Digital Equipment Corporation, the second-largest American computer company, said in May that it would open an office in South Africa for the first time. Its subsidiary will sell and service its products, employing about 50 people in its first year.
The Pillsbury Company, the Minneapolis food processor now owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain, said last month that it would invest $25 million in a joint venture with Foodcorp, a South African company, to modernize existing plants. The new company, Pillsbury Africa Ltd., will make and distribute vegetable products and frozen pizzas in South Africa. And the H. J. Heinz Company, the food conglomerate, says it is also ready to return.
 
A Likely Path: Nonequity Links
 Analysts say that because of doubts about South Africa's stability, American companies that do enter the country will probably take the route of Digital and Pillsbury, gingerly investigating the market through exports, joint ventures or licensing agreements.
That seems to be why the number of American companies pursuing nonequity links to South Africa -- like licensing or distribution agreements -- has jumped from 109 in 1987 to 430 this month, the Investor Responsibility Research Center says. The number of companies with direct investments has barely changed.
Such arm's-length investment may be prudent for American companies, but it does not draw an enthusiastic response from South Africans, who have less interest in undertakings in which Western goods are imported or manufactured at existing plants than in those ventures that create jobs.
"I would not be surprised if you find that investment-intensive companies might go quite a bit more slowly than others because of the need to insure that the return on investment is there," Kenneth Brown, a spokesman for Ford, said. "Setting up a branch of an international tourism company is much different than building an automotive plant or setting up a diamond mine."
 
Dismantling Sanctions
 Beyond economic issues, there is the legacy of sanctions. From Mobil to General Motors to RJR Nabisco, American industry fled South Africa in the 1980's, hastily selling or closing down hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. The restrictions have been eased over the last two years as the white Government has agreed to give up power.
Earlier this month, the United Nations General Assembly called for the end of nearly all sanctions and Congress is about to repeal the last Federal ones. But hundreds of state and local sanctions remain, though Los Angeles and Massachusetts have already repealed their laws and New York City is expected to follow soon.
"We hope that the actual repeal of U.S., state and local laws happens quickly, because so long as these sanctions remain on the books, we and other U.S. companies will be inhibited from doing business in South Africa," William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, recently told a group of African finance ministers.
But the effect of sanctions will linger even after they are repealed, some executives say. If they want to return, American companies that left South Africa by spinning off subsidiaries will have to decide whether to buy them back or, in perhaps an awkward alternative, compete with them. Some South African workers are resentful toward American companies that abandoned the country.
And Daniel O'Flaherty, executive director of the United States-South Africa Business Council, said he believed that some cities or states would replace their sanctions with laws requiring codes of conduct for companies doing business in South Africa. Such regulations would certainly dampen some executives' interest, he said.
"If you have to comply with a multitude of codes of conduct and reporting requirements and you're not making that much money," he said, "there is a limit to how much compliance and supervision is acceptable before you will invest instead in, say, Malaysia or Thailand."
Mr. Schneidman, the consultant, agreed, stressing that many American companies still needed to be convinced about South Africa.
"Though Mandela has called for the lifting of sanctions, there is still anxiety about whether this is the right time," he said. "All this hoopla has signaled the end of one era and the beginning of a new era -- the post-sanctions era. It has not signaled the onslaught of capital going into South Africa."

HEADLINE: Odd Couple: Iran and Iraq in First Talks Since 1990

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Deputy ministers from Iran and Iraq ended two days of official talks in Baghdad today, the first between the Persian Gulf antagonists since 1990, when they agreed on a limited exchange of prisoners of war.
The negotiations, which took place in the context of much talk in both Teheran and Baghdad about a new alliance to confront "American hegemony," have aroused some anxiety in Israel and a few Western capitals. 
 Officials from both countries said the talks focused on an exchange of prisoners from their eight-year war, which ended in 1988. Iran holds about 20,000 Iraqis; Teheran says Iraq is holding about 5,000 Iranians.
 
United in Hostility
 If the two countries unite in their opposition to a Middle East peace accord and their hostility toward the West, and the United States in particular, the regional political balance would be radically changed. But Iranians, Saudis, Egyptians and Persian Gulf Arabs interviewed today played down the significance of the meeting.
The delegations were led by two deputy foreign ministers, Mohammed Javad Zarif of Iran and Saad Abdelmeguid al-Faisal of Iraq.
Iraqi newspapers and Iranian radical leaders have argued loudly that it is in the vital interests of both countries to team up to resist pressure from the West. But experts interviewed expressed doubt that the two countries could overcome the deep ideological and territorial disputes that led them to war, or the ties between the Shiite Muslim Government in Iran and the Iraqi Shiites, a relationship that the Sunni Muslim leaders of Iraq see as threatening.
"I don't see these talks as significant," said Baqer Moin, an Iranian affairs expert with the British Broadcasting Corporation. "They are largely meant to tie up some loose ends. Otherwise there are too many ideological, religious and political differences separating the current regimes."
 
'I Don't See It Happening'
 Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the first President of Iran after the Islamic revolution and now an exile in Paris, said: "The idea of a comprehensive strategic understanding between the two countries has been touted a lot by the radical clergy in Teheran, and I suppose that in theory it can be done, as both regimes are totalitarian enough to decree peace, so to speak. But I don't see it happening. Too much has happened to allow this.
"The two countries are still at war, with their border dispute unresolved. There are thousands of prisoners of war on both sides unaccounted for. The war waged by Iraq has destroyed a whole generation of nearly a million people in Iran. I think the Iranian leadership would have great difficulty persuading its own clergy, let alone the population, to forgive and forget Iraq."
There are other profound disagreements. These include some $100 billion in war reparations demanded by Iran and Iran's insistence on obtaining equal navigation and ownership rights in the Shatt al-Arab estuary, which forms the border between the two countries at the head of the Persian Gulf.
 
'Marriage of Convenience'
 Baghdad also continues to support Iranian anti-Government guerrillas.
Iraq has demanded the return of 148 planes that were sent to Iran for safe-keeping during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Iran has refused to do so, saying it was confiscating the planes as part of its compensation claim.
But Iranian affairs experts said the two nations had been drawn closer by the impact of economic sanctions and the "dual containment" policy advocated by Western nations.
Some experts said that the two countries could be trying to give the impression of a potential alliance largely to fend off common enemies rather than to seek a real peace, but that such a fragile arrangement could not blossom.
"In terms of the long run, I would find it very difficult to see this as more than a temporary marriage of convenience," said Medhi Verzi, an oil expert who closely follows Iran and Iraq.
Oil experts argue, for example, that it is not in Iran's interest to help Iraq sell its embargoed oil because this would give the West an excuse to impose official sanctions on Iran. Also, they say, with oil prices depressed, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the other oil-producing countries along the Persian Gulf worry that Iraq could flood the oil market and depress prices even more.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Once Again, Burger King Shops for an Agency

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Burger King, which changes advertising agencies practically at the flip of a Whopper, is doing so again.
The company, the No. 2 fast-food chain behind McDonald's, said yesterday it would put into review the bulk of its domestic advertising account, which has been handled by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York. 
 Burger King's decision epitomizes the fierce competition among the nation's fast-food chains, which is intensifying as customers, more value conscious than ever, insist they want the steak instead of the sizzle.
D.M.B. & B., which has been responsible for an estimated $150 million to $175 million of Burger King's $250 million account, created the current campaign carrying the theme, "I Love This Place!" The agency said it would probably not participate in the review.
D.M.B. & B.'s expected absence sets up, you should pardon the expression, a feeding frenzy among other agencies. One shop eagerly tying on its bib is Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York, which has shared the account with D.M.B. & B. since 1989.
Trade publications had speculated for some time that Burger King would join the ranks of agency changers among advertisers in competitive consumer-product categories like restaurants, soft drinks and automobiles.
The company's penchant for switching shops and slogans has been accelerated by often quarrelsome relations with its franchisees, who have been notably vocal in complaining about D.M.B. & B.'s work.
This time, however, the change stemmed from a decision to seek "a fresh approach to our advertising campaign that will reflect the company's 'back to basics' philosophy," Sidney J. Feltenstein, executive vice president of worldwide marketing at the Burger King Corporation in Miami, said in a statement.
His reference was to a marketing strategy that the company adopted only two and a half weeks ago, focusing on an "everyday value" approach to pricing that emphasizes lower-priced basic fare and specially priced combination meals.
Burger King has long been reluctant to stress value rather than glitzy advertising or gimmicky giveaways, even though consumers, feeling economically pressed, have been signaling for some time that saving money takes precedence when eating out. Chains like Taco Bell and Wendy's, which advertise menu items at everyday low prices, and regional chains like Rally's and Checkers, with pared menus emulating 1950's drive-in restaurants, have blazed a trail their larger rivals find themselves forced to follow.
Indeed, Burger King's belated value-oriented approach marks an about-face after a year spent trying to give the chain, with more than 7,000 company-owned and franchised outlets, a more upscale persona by selling higher-priced fare like dinner baskets and offering table service. The image-building effort centered on a youth-oriented campaign by D.M.B. & B. that imitated the rapid-fire pace and irreverence of MTV. Not only did the television commercials use the slogan "BK Tee Vee," they featured Dan Cortese, a hunky MTV host, as the pitchman.
But according to Technomic Inc., a restaurant industry consulting company in Chicago, Burger King last year achieved the weakest sales gains, and lost the most market share, of the four biggest burger makers. Burger King's systemwide sales of $5.3 billion rose only 2.7 percent, compared with a 7 percent gain for the overall market, and its market share fell to 16 percent from 16.6 percent in 1991.
Burger King's adoption of the everyday value strategy reflects a realization that "we're in the hamburger business," Cori Zywotow, a spokeswoman, said.
"It's not a matter of whether 'BK Tee Vee' was or wasn't working," she added. "In a marketplace like today's, where one year ago is a completely different environment, we owe it to ourselves to see what else is out there."
That is a feeling Burger King has acted on frequently in recent years as it lurched from campaign to campaign and agency to agency. In 1987, the company left J. Walter Thompson, its agency since 1976, after Thompson produced a campaign, called "Herb the Nerd," that became one of the most notorious flops in marketing history. Burger King then hired Ayer Inc., which was dismissed in 1989 after creating a confusing campaign carrying the theme "We Do It Like You'd Do It."
Burger King then doubled its agency roster, dividing the account between D.M.B. & B. and Saatchi. The balance between the two has tilted toward D.M.B. & B., which was awarded national creative assignments; regional account service, through a field force that worked with Burger King franchisees; media planning and buying, and the international Burger King account.
D.M.B. & B., which also handles accounts for Anheuser-Busch, Kraft General Foods, General Motors and Procter & Gamble, was told of Burger King's decision on Tuesday night. Roy Bostock, chairman and chief executive at D.M.B. & B., said yesterday: "The issue of whether we'll participate is under discussion. No decision has been made yet, but it's unlikely."
Michael Keeshan, Saatchi's president and chief operating officer, had a different response.
"Needless to say, we would love to participate," he said. In addition to its current duties for Burger King, he added, his agency has also worked previously for Wendy's and Arby's. Saatchi's responsibilities now involve creating advertising and promotional campaigns for the Burger King Kids Club, a program aimed at wooing children to the chain's restaurants.
Ms. Zywotow said the review would be handled by a committee including Mr. Feltenstein and franchisees. Richard Roth Associates, a consulting company in Chappaqua, N.Y., will be involved in sending questionnaires to participants, she added, and asking finalists for marketing briefs. A decision is expected by early next year.
It is possible, she said, that the account might be "unbundled" as a result of the review, meaning that one agency might be awarded the creative portion and another other responsibilities like media services. If that should occur, D.M.B. & B., even if it decides against participating in the review, might yet retain those other duties while another agency assumed the creative assignment.

HEADLINE: As Bills Flourish and Symphony Suffers, Some in Buffalo Ask Why

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Every autumn, as the first cold gusts whip off Lake Erie, this area begins to swagger. During football season Buffalo is in the same league as New York and Los Angeles, and when the Bills win, Buffalo gets a chance to call those towns losers.
This year, however, some are asking whether Buffalo is deluding itself about how it stacks up with other big cities. While the region cheers its team toward a possible fourth straight Super Bowl, its philharmonic orchestra is in danger of shutting down. 
 Last week, a member of the Erie County Legislature, Joan K. Bozer, proposed postponing improvements to county-owned Rich Stadium, where the Buffalo Bills play, until the Legislature convenes a "summit meeting" of political and business leaders to solve the philharmonic's problems.
Nobody -- not even Ms. Bozer -- is proposing taking money from the stadium and giving it directly to the philharmonic. In fact, the stadium would pay for itself, while the orchestra does not.
 
What Price Culture?
 But even though Ms. Bozer's proposal is expected to be rejected by the county Legislature on Thursday, the plan has provoked the city to take a look at the price it is willing to pay to accommodate sports and the arts.
Alan M. Ross, a violinist and head of the orchestra musicians' negotiating committee, said that while the philharmonic has toured Europe and played Carnegie Hall, it feels unappreciated at home -- something that could never be said about the Bills.
"Whenever any sports team needs anything here, millions of dollars gets thrown into that pot right away, whether they're tax dollars or not," Mr. Ross said. "But when the orchestra is struggling for its existence with a million-dollar gap, everyone says, let's cut the orchestra size down."
The orchestra, which Mr. Ross said has been ranked among the top 15 in the nation, has been in financial trouble for years, battered by recession along with other orchestras around the country that do not have major endowments to get them through lean times. This year it faced a $900,000 deficit -- despite getting county aid of $792,000. Last month orchestra management laid off the 80 musicians and canceled the Sept. 10 opening performance of Verdi's Requiem.
The musicians were rehired and performances resumed earlier this month with a temporary arrangement under which management and musicians will seek ways to increase revenues and reduce the orchestra's $7.5 million budget. Among the proposals are reducing musicians' base salary of $34,000 and reducing the number of musicians.
If there is no resolution by Nov. 4, the orchestra will shut down Nov. 22.
Ms. Bozer, a former Republican who is seeking re-election as a Democrat, has been accused of grandstanding with her proposal linking the Bills and the philharmonic, and she concedes there is no direct relationship.
 
Question of Conscience
 But she said she could not vote "in good conscience" for stadium improvements while the philharmonic is foundering. "I think it would be a very negative message that we don't care about music, we only care about sports," she said.
The Legislature is to vote Thursday on a Rich Stadium plan that includes a $11.6 million county bond for a video scoreboard, new luxury seating and other improvements. Principal and interest on the bond would be repaid by surcharges on stadium tickets and parking fees, and revenues from the new seating.
The project comes several months after the county agreed to contribute $20 million toward a new $115 million hockey arena for the Buffalo Sabres. County officials said the money will come from an existing 5 percent tax on hotel rooms and a quarter-percent surcharge on arena tickets.
The County Legislature's Chairman, Leonard R. Lenihan, a Democrat, said the Rich Stadium work is important because "it begins the process of renegotiating the lease to keep the Bills here."
The Bills' 25-year lease on Rich Stadium expires at the end of the 1997 season, and renewal talks are to start in January 1994.
Mr. Lenihan said Ms. Bozer is wrong to link the philharmonic to the Bills. "The two issues are just unrelated," he said.
Even philharmonic supporters are uneasy with a proposal that would appear to make lawmakers choose between the orchestra and the football team.
"I think it's a very unpopular move," said Peter Walsh, a 32-year-old stockbroker. "People will do anything to keep the Bills in town."
 
'A Sense of Pride'
 Dennis Gorski learned that in 1988, when at the start of his first term as Erie County executive he said there was no big rush to start lease renewal talks with the Bills. The telephone lines to the sports-talk shows nearly melted.
"We all make mistakes in public life," Mr. Gorski said this week. He now finds himself in the more comfortable position of supporting the Bills. "I'm not saying that sports is the be-all of our existence in Buffalo," Mr. Gorski said. "But the Buffalo Bills have given us a sense of pride.
Bills fans hardly seem put off by the team's three consecutive Super Bowl losses, a record. "The way the Buffalo fans look at it is, we're going to do it until we get it right," Mr. Lenihan said.
Ms. Bozer, who attended two of those Super Bowls, said she did not think her proposal would hurt her re-election bid.
But Ms. Bozer said she merely wants local leaders to put more emphasis on solving the philharmonic's problems. "I believe once the commitment is made we'll find a way to do it," she said.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN TRAIL;
Rabbis Criticize Dinkins For Passing Up Forum

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
The president of the 800-member New York Board of Rabbis, in the past staunch supporters of Mayor David N. Dinkins, criticized the Mayor yesterday for turning down an invitation to appear at a forum with Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The board's president, Rabbi Jeremiah Wohlberg, said the Mayor's campaign had pressed the board to include the Conservative Party candidate, George Marlin, in their forum and had finally "pleaded the presence of Vice President Al Gore" in declining the invitation to speak. 
 Mr. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal challenger, attended the Board of Rabbis meeting on the Upper East Side yesterday.
The Board of Rabbis has been an influential force among Jewish New Yorkers and was a staunch supporter of the Mayor until late last year. A break between City Hall and the board occurred when its leaders accused the Mayor of making a "rush to judgment" in the beating of a 25-year-old black man, Ralph Nimmons, in Crown Heights. Mr. Dinkins called that case a bias crime, a conclusion that was disputed by the board.
"We asked the Mayor and his campaign managers, as a sign of respect," Rabbi Wohlberg said, "to go to the rabbis represented by this board -- who are over 800 in number and represent the entire spectrum of the New York metropolitan area rabbinical community of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform -- to go to them and show concern for the constituents that they represent."
Responding to Rabbi Wohlberg's complaint, Leah Johnson, the press secretary for the Mayor's campaign, said yesterday that Mr. Dinkins had always insisted that Mr. Marlin be included. "Since the original request came in," she said, "we have maintained all along that we would participate in a three-way forum. That never wavered. That never changed." She said Mr. Gore's presence in the city was not used as a last-minute excuse because their position had not changed and Mr. Marlin had not been invited.
Rabbi Wohlberg stressed that yesterday's meeting was never intended as a debate, "but rather, consecutive appearances" by the two leading candidates, sharing their views with the board members and taking questions from them.
Asked by the Mayor's campaign team to accept a surrogate in Mr. Dinkins's place, Rabbi Wohlberg said the board "could not accept those restrictions or those guidelines."
Rabbi Wohlberg said his group kept pressure on the Mayor's office "until the very end."
Appearing alone, Mr. Giuliani revived his jokes about the WNBC debate to which Mr. Marlin toted a rubber chicken. Then Mr. Giuliani gave his standard speech about the need for safer streets, an end to violence within the school system and the city's overall need to turn away from the tyranny of special-interest groups and toward a legal and political system blind to differences in race, sex, religion, sexual preference and ethnicity to embrace a single standard for all New Yorkers.
Asked what specifically he would do to diminish racial, ethnic and religious tensions in the city, Mr. Giuliani said the city is more divided today than it was four years ago and promised to work with community groups to ease tensions. "You are not going to find the same excessive partisan political separation," he said, promising an administration representing all parties and all groups.
 
Just In From Washington
 Campaigning with Mayor Dinkins yesterday, Vice President Al Gore joined the long line of Clinton Administration officials who have flown to New York City in the last month to assure voters that Mr. Dinkins, "this great and good man," will have special influence in the White House.
Through the visits, the Clinton team also seems to be trying to convince New Yorkers that the President himself has a vision for America's cities, despite the defeat of its economic stimulus package, which Mr. Dinkins says would have provided $400 million for New York.
In a speech to the City Council yesterday, Mr. Gore announced a new Federal plan to promote recycling, presenting it as a major boon to cities, and credited Mr. Dinkins with persuading the President to go forward with it.
"This new policy on recycling would not have come about except for the vigorous and able leadership of David Dinkins," Mr. Gore told reporters after his speech.
The executive order signed by the President requires that the hundreds of thousands of tons of paper purchased by the Federal Government contain at least 20 percent recycled paper. Mr. Gore said the policy will be important to cities like New York because it will create a market for the waste paper they collect.
The appearances over the last month by Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary; Mr. Gore, his wife, Tipper, and his parents, Al and Pauline, and what seems to be a Cabinet officer a day are part of a coordinated effort to bolster Mr. Dinkins's claim in stump speeches that the city needs a Democratic Mayor to work with a Democratic President.
The day followed the usual rituals of a visit from a Washington big shot. Mr. Dinkins stood under an umbrella in the rain to embrace the Vice President as he descended from his plane. They then posed, thumbs up, with Mr. Dinkins's running mates, Mark Green and Alan G. Hevesi.
And Mr. Dinkins listened appreciatively as the Vice President praised him for lowering the crime rate, balancing budgets and helping to keep the peace in a multiracial city.
"His voice in the White House is the loudest, clearest and most sensitive, especially when it comes to providing solutions to the problems of America's great urban centers," Mr. Gore said.
Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Gore also courted Jewish voters, a critical constituency in this election, with a joint appearance at the dedication of the America-Israel Friendship Grove in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Flushing, Queens.
Mr. Dinkins sat beaming on the stage next to the Vice President as Colette Avital, Consul General of Israel, said of the Mayor, "We know this friendship is sincere and so it is inscribed in our hearts." She later added, "He repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism, often by his own people."
 
Giuliani Urges Hiring Freeze
 Challenging Mr. Dinkins to establish firmly the amount of an expected deficit in this year's budget, Mr. Giuliani yesterday called for a hiring freeze within the city government, tighter controls on administration spending and a broad effort to reduce expenditures in overtime for New York City workers for the remainder of the fiscal year.
He also recapitulated arguments that he has made for months chastising the Mayor for using "phony numbers" to create the impression of a balanced budget.
At an afternoon speech at the Sheraton New York Hotel, Mr. Giuliani singled out anticipated revenues from the sale of the Off-Track Betting Corporation, two prison barges and "an illusory $150 million check for unrestricted Federal aid" as "one-shots and wishes that will never materialize." The speech was made before an audience of supporters and those who have made financial contributions to his campaign.
Mr. Giuliani said he would consider a hiring freeze himself, if elected, but said his overall policy of backing cuts through attrition with a variety of exemptions "has not changed."
He also repeated earlier campaign pledges to trim the Mayor's staff by 10 percent.
Little in his speech was new to his campaign. And several of his comments during a brief question-and-answer period afterward were clearly planted by supporters handing him openings for some of his most standard campaign lines. Questions focused on crime, the Mayor's reaction to the riot in Crown Heights and how he would help small businesses.
The woman who questioned Mr. Giuliani about how his response to reports of a disturbance in Crown Heights would have been different from Mr. Dinkins's had spoken on Sept. 7 at The Jewish Center at 131 West 86th Street, where Mr. Giuliani had said he would have arrested the first rioter on the first day. Yesterday's question was the same. So was his answer.

New Price Reports With Caveats

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The next couple of reports on the Consumer Price Index could prove a little disturbing for the bond market because adjustments used to smooth out seasonal price variations could exaggerate an actual increase in prices.
The report that the index was unchanged in September was the factor that propelled long-term interest rates to new 25-year lows last week. 
 But analysts, including those at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which assembles the C.P.I., say the index could now jump as much as four-tenths of a percent in October because of the seasonal adjustment. Earlier this year, that kind of a jump was enough to send the bond market reeling.
 
A Neutralizing Factor
 Patrick Jackman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that for the rest of the year seasonal adjustments would add four-tenths of a percent to the index. This means if there were no actual price increases over these three months, the seasonally adjusted index that is reported would still rise about four-tenths of a percent.
The reason for this adjustment factor is that many prices, like those for energy, usually decline at this time of the year, Mr. Jackman said. Thus, the seasonal adjustment factors that are used to smooth out regular price fluctuations effectively neutralize the impact of normal price declines.
So an actual decline that is expected in the seasonals will not help lower the overall seasonally adjusted index, while any increase in actual prices would be even larger after the index is seasonally adjusted. The seasonal factors are based on the performance of prices last year.
Seasonal adjustment factors affect the index every month and can often be a cause for actual price increases being understated. But good news on inflation is not a worry to the bond market, so less attention is paid to the problem then.
But for the rest of the year, if jumps in the index of three-tenths and four-tenths of a percent are reported each month, it would appear that the annual rate of inflation, which is 2.7 percent through September and below last year's 2.9 percent, is accelerating. And that would worry the bond market.
 
Energy Fluctuations
 One of the big contributors to this problem will be energy prices, which are normally assumed to be falling at this time of year. Mr. Jackman said the adjustment factors assume a decline in energy prices over the next three months that would bring the index down about three-tenths of a percent.
But instead of falling this year, energy prices are expected to rise, especially this month. One reason is the introduction of the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax that was part of President Clinton's deficit reduction plan. In addtion, the reformulation of gasoline to lessen air polution is likely to add to prices.
It is also unclear what will happen with apparel prices, which the seasonal factors assume will decline in December.
While investors and traders should be aware that the seasonal impact could be exaggerating the actual rate of inflation, a large jump could still be enough to disturb the credit markets when it is at the lowest yields in 25 years.
"If it comes in at four-tenths, people should know it is overstated," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chemical Securities. "Still the market does tend to react to these kind of things."
At the least, he added, such a report might "temper any gains until we see the next number."
Mr. Fine is forecasting a four-tenths of a percent increase in the October C.P.I. But he does not think that it represents in any way an acceleration in inflation. All that is really happening, he said, is that some of the earlier over statements on the downside are now being smoothed out.
For example, he said, a four-tenths of a percent increase in October combined with the unchanged index in September averages to a two-tenths of a percent rise. That is closer to the pace at which inflation is moving and is a rate, he said, that should keep long-term interest rates in their trading range of 5.75 percent to 6 percent.
 
Treasury Market
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 10/32yesterday, as the yield fell to 5.82 percent, down from 5.84 percent on Tuesday. Prices of Treasury notes were little changed as the market remained in a tight trading range after long-term yields broke to new 25-year lows at the end of last week.
In the when-issued market, the two-year note to be auctioned on Tuesday was trading at a yield of 3.86 percent, while the yield on the five-year note to be auctioned on Wednesday was 4.67 percent.
In the corporate bond market, BHP Finance, a subsidary of the Australian mining, steel and oil company, Broken Hill Proprietary, sold $300 million of seven-year notes and $200 million of 20-year bonds. Morgan Stanley & Company was the lead underwriter. The so-called Yankee issue, which is denominated in American dollars, was priced to yield 5.67 percent on the seven-year notes, 68 basis points over the comparable Treasury note, and 6.79 percent on the 20-year notes, 78 basis points over the 7.25 percent 30-year bond due in February 2023. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

A Clean-Air Minuet

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
General Motors and the air pollution chiefs of 12 Northeastern states are engaged in a double-or-nothing gamble over what emission standards will be applied to cars in the region at the turn of the century. The car company is rolling the dice in the courts and lobbying in legislatures for weaker rules, as state officials consider running to the Clinton Administration to lay down the law to enforce the strictest standard available.
But for the first time in a long battle between Detroit and the state capitals, the two sides are approaching negotiations. 
 The complex maneuvering will determine how heavily cleaning the air will fall on drivers, auto makers and fuel refiners, as opposed to electric utilities and other industries -- or directly on consumers by restricting products like lawn mowers and motorboats and maybe even by setting rules on who may drive on which days. The arguments now under way may also determine whether electric vehicles will have a mandated mass market, and whether clean-air policy will be set by Washington or by the states, led by California, whose program the Northeast states want to copy on a regional basis.
 
 
State Officials Meet
 At the moment, the air pollution officials of the 12 states from Virginia to Maine are committed, at least on paper, to adoption of the California Low Emission Vehicle standards, including electric cars. But some legislatures have balked, and in New York the courts have stepped in and blocked at least part of the program.
The state officials met in Mystic, Conn., on Monday and Tuesday under the aegis of the Ozone Transport Commission, an entity formed by the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 to work out regional solutions to smog. The states decided to draft a formal petition to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, to ask it to enforce the California standard in the East; the state officials will meet again in February to decide whether, in fact, to submit the petition.
The double-or-nothing gamble is raised by a new response from General Motors, which is quietly circulating a counterproposal under which Detroit would offer cars cleaner than the current Federal standard -- but not as clean as those that will be required in California. G.M.'s proposal notes that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 allow the Federal E.P.A. to decide late in this decade whether to require something called the Tier 2 car. Starting in about the 2004 model year, it would meet a stricter emission standard in 49 states. (California is allowed to set its own standards, and other states can choose between the Federal and California standards.)
G.M.'s idea is not fully formed, and the company said it would not discuss it because it did not yet have the assent of other car makers. Some, though, are clearly interested.
G.M. is offering the Eastern states something akin to the Tier 2 car. But if the states stick to their guns, they may end up with the California standards, depending on the outcome in the courts. Another risk is the political will of more than 2,000 state legislators in 12 state capitols, facing armies of lobbyists representing foreign and domestic car producers, car dealers and oil refiners on one side, and environmentalists and health advocates on the other.
 
 
Mixed View of Talks
 In lieu of legislative and legal warfare from Richmond to Augusta, will negotiation work?
The chairman of the Ozone Transport Commission this year is Scott A. Weiner, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy. In a telephone interview yesterday, he said: "For the first time G.M. and the other auto manufacturers have said they want to sit down and engage in serious discussions. That's an entree I was happy to embrace." But the commission will move ahead with its petition, he said.
Others are suspicious. Thomas C. Jorling, the New York State Commissioner of Environmental Protection, testified before a House subcommittee in Washington this month that "introduction of this proposal at this critical time is solely designed to divide and divert the states of the Ozone Transport Commission from proceeding with regionwide adoption of the California Low Emission Vehicle program."
At the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an association of air-pollution-control officials from New England, New York and New Jersey, Michael Bradley, the executive director, said, "It's an encouraging sign that the auto industry would come forward with an alternative proposal for a car that's cleaner than what's mandated in the Clean Air Act."
But his position was the legal equivalent of "peace through strength."
"It's obvious that the Northeast states' look toward the California vehicle prompted them to come to the table with a proposal," he said.

BANKAMERICA CORP. (N)

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation, the nation's second-largest banking company after Citicorp, said yesterday that third-quarter earnings fell slightly from the preceding quarter and were only about 3 percent higher than a year earlier.
"They never had the immense buildup of bad loans a few years ago like many other large banks, so their profits have not had the benefit recently of sharply reduced expenses from credit problems," said James Rosenberg of Lehman Brothers. 
 BankAmerica said that its holdings of troubled loans had declined in the last year and that it had provided $175 million to its loan-loss reserve in the third quarter, down from $200 million the previous quarter and $260 million a year earlier.
Profit growth was also hurt by weakness in the California economy and weak loan demand. Total loans at the bank averaged $121.8 billion in the third quarter, down 1 percent from the second quarter and down 6.7 percent from a year ago.

Subdued Start for Tokyo Car Show

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
The gargantuan Tokyo Motor Show began today with the theme of "ecolution," a Japanese-coined combination of ecology and evolution that is meant to refer to cars that do not harm the environment.
But the environment Japanese auto makers really worry about these days is not the earth's but that of their business. "The current business environment is like nothing we have ever experienced," Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of the Honda Motor Company, said Tuesday. 
 Indeed, Japan's auto industry is facing the equivalent of a global climatic change -- from a growth industry to a cyclical one. And unless they can adapt, at least some of the 11 species of car makers here are expected to become extinct. Analysts estimate that as many as 9 of Japan's 11 vehicle manufacturers are now losing money.
 
 
Fewer Models, Fewer Mini-Skirts
 This makes for a very subdued auto show, which opened for press previews today. People who have long attended the show, said there were fewer new car models, fewer female models in colored mini-skirts, and fewer attendees than in the past. Advanced technology, always a focus of attention at the Tokyo show, tended toward fuel conservation, electric vehicles and enhanced safety features, not high power and luxury.
"They are not talking about the market," said Carnie R. Colliver, an analyst at AutoPacific Group Inc., a consulting company in Santa Ana, Calif. "It's almost like they want to hide the problems."
With Japan in a recession, the emphasis this year is on giving consumers good value for their money and on cutting costs by eliminating unnecessary frills. Asked what this meant, a Toyota spokesman pointed under the fender of a new Celica to an unpainted spot that would be hard for customers to see. "It's much cheaper if you don't have to be perfect," he said.
Japan's once nearly invincible auto makers are finding their home habitat is shrinking and their ability to forage abroad is being reduced by political restrictions and by the strong yen. And foreign predators, mainly the American automobile companies, are suddenly becoming far stronger, just as the United States Government is pressing Japan to open its market further and to buy more American auto parts.
 
 
What's New in Midget Cars
 It is this environment that the industry hopes will brighten with the two-week auto show, as 352 auto and parts makers from around the world display the latest in hydrogen-powered vehicles, midget cars, drowsiness monitors and collision-avoidance systems.
"In a sense, a motor show is a festival, and those people who participate in a festival are energized," Yutaka Kume, the chairman of the Nissan Motor Company and of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, said recently.
But almost nobody, including Mr. Kume, thinks the auto show will do the trick. Mr. Kume said the Japanese auto industry, faced with the "most serious predicament since its very establishment," needs "very bold and audacious restructuring."
The reason people are not buying cars, particularly in Japan and Europe, has little to do with a lack of new products and a lot to do with the economy.
"All of these problems will not be solved overnight, even if you introduce three new cars," said Koji Endo, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Japan. "It will take two or three years. And two or three years might be too long for some makers to adjust."
Mr. Endo said only two of Japan's auto makers were clearly profitable -- Mitsubishi Motors, which has a strong position in the popular sports-utility category, and Suzuki Motor, which has a niche selling small vehicles in developing nations.
 
 
Different From U.S. Industry
 Of course, the problems of Japan's industry should not be exaggerated.
"What Japan views as a crisis, the Americans would have liked to have experienced and been able to call a crisis," said Maryann N. Keller, managing director and auto analyst at Furman Selz Inc. in New York. The year-to-year production declines the Japanese are experiencing -- down 5.6 percent this year from a year earlier and off 7.5 percent from a peak of 13.5 million in 1990 -- would be nothing for American manufacturers, whose production is cyclical.
The problem, Ms. Keller said, is that the Japanese "are not prepared for cyclical markets." Becoming prepared might involve scrapping some cherished policies, like lifetime employment, which works well when companies want to hold employees but not when they have to adjust to fluctuating volumes.
Domestic sales in Japan, having grown about 3 percent a year from 1970 to 1990, are in their third consecutive year of decline. And exports, which account for nearly half of Japan's production, are shrinking in part because of export restrictions and in part because Japanese companies are shifting more production abroad for political reasons or to cope with the rise of the yen, which makes exporting unprofitable.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Dollar Has Mixed Showing As Investors Take Profits

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other currencies yesterday as investors sold dollars to lock in profits from its rise against the German mark this week.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6395 German marks, down from 1.6411 marks on Tuesday. But it rose to 107.42 Japanese yen from 107.16 yen. 
 The dollar rose during European trading as expectations mounted that Germany would cut interest rates.
But the German central bank lowered its repurchase rate -- which influences money-market rates -- less than traders expected. The central bank fixed the lowest rate for 14-day securities repurchase agreements at 6.67 percent, slightly lower than the previous 6.70 percent.
Investors sold off the dollar during New York trading after it failed to rise above 1.6210 marks, traders said. But they did not expect the dollar to tumble.
"The market seems bullish on the idea that lower German interest rates are coming, although not this time," said Tom Benfer, senior market representative at the Bank of Montreal's office in New York.
Traders said it seemed likely the German central bank, the Bundesbank, would cut the key discount rate by year's end, as long as inflation stayed in line. Germany's main M-3 gauge of money-supply growth, a key indicator of inflation, eased to an annual rate of 7 percent from 7.2 percent, according to monthly figures released yesterday.
But few traders expect a cut in the discount rate at today's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-setting Central Council.
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Paine Webber, said the dollar still seemed to be in strong demand.
"There's a general assumption of continued Bundesbank easing and U.S. numbers improving," he said.
The British pound edged up slightly yesterday in New York to $1.4899, from $1.4897 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.4500 Swiss francs, up from 1.4465; 5.7920 French francs, down from 5.8045; 1,597.00 Italian lire, down from 1,599.00; and 1.3167 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3253.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A giant in the profession gives a lift to economic history.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
CRACK just about any college history text, and you'll find it is full of economics: hardly anyone these days would write about, say, the decline of Spain in the 17th century without paying obeisance to economic causes.
But try the converse experiment with most introductory economics texts, and you might be left with the idea that the world was created somewhere around 1950. Movers and shakers in economics, it seems, just aren't accustomed to pondering the past. 
 That is why many economic historians find the Nobel Memorial Prize awarded to Robert Fogel of the University of Chicago a double pleasure. For not only do they respect Mr. Fogel for his achievements -- "Fogel has always been in the thick of things," said Gavin Wright of Stanford University -- they see the prize as a sign that economic history now has as great a claim to status in the profession as a dozen other specialties.
Mr. Fogel is better known for what he wasn't than for what he is. As the co-author of the best-selling "Time on the Cross" (Little Brown, 1974), he infuriated some social commentators with what was widely viewed as an apology for pre-Civil War slavery. But Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard and a former student of Mr. Fogel, allows that many of the critics "never opened the book." If they had, she says, they would have discovered a startling, but hardly racist, thesis.
Southern plantations, argued Mr. Fogel and his co-author, Stanley Engerman of the University of Rochester, were one-third more efficient than the small family farms of the North. What's more, plantation owners had the financial wherewithal (and were typically smart enough businessmen) to "maintain" their slaves at material living standards close to those of free Northern workers. Hence, slavery was not doomed as a method for organizing labor. Indeed, the only way to rid the nation of the "peculiar institution" was to challenge it on the ground of morality.
Why, then, the tempest? Greater "efficiency" means more output for a given quantity of inputs. In this case, though, it is unclear whether a unit of slave labor was equal to a unit of free labor. Many economic historians now believe that plantations were only more efficient in the sense that they drove their workers harder -- an interpretation that does not undermine the core implication that slavery was there to stay, but does suggest that the language was unnecessarily provocative.
The storm over "Time on the Cross" has also had the unfortunate effect of obscuring Mr. Fogel's less controversial achievements. "Railroads and Economic Growth" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1964), strongly influenced by the Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets, challenged the foundations of development economics.
Before the book, theorists from Joseph Schumpeter to Walter Rostow had asserted that the rise of single industries brought about the development of whole economies. But Mr. Fogel calculated that the leading candidate in the case of America -- the railroads -- was far from indispensable in the opening of the Great Plains. Ms. Goldin points out, incidentally, that the indispensability theme is as relevant today as it was in the 1960's: the Clinton Administration is now making the case for subsidizing high technology as the solution to America's productivity woes.
Quite possibly, though, Mr. Fogel's most enduring research will be his effort to measure changes in living standards over very long time spans. Certainly it shows him at his most versatile.
Wearing his administrator's hat, he is coordinating the most ambitious project ever attempted in economic history, one involving dozens of researchers and millions of dollars. And wearing his interdisciplinary researcher's hat, he is going where no economist has gone before. Among the tentative findings: In Europe of the early 18th century, malnutrition was such a serious drag on productivity that roughly one-fifth of the adult population did not have the caloric intake to work.
The effort to document changing living standards is extraordinary. But then, Mr. Fogel is nothing if not extraordinary. Donald McCloskey of the University of Iowa notes that he is marrying "biology, the history of medicine, demography, social history, economic history, nutritional history, pediatrics, clinical nutrition, embryology, historical sociology, tropical medicine, public health, historical geography, epidemiology, agricultural history, physical anthropology, gynecology, international economics, industrial history, toxicology, genealogy and development economics to discover the link between nutrition and life chances."
Just where the project will end is unclear. But Mr. Fogel is already up to his old tricks of knocking received wisdom off its moorings: it is plausible, he suggests (if yet to be proved) that the average American's rise in material living standards from the early 1830's to World War II was almost fully offset by the detrimental public health effects of urbanization, industrialization and immigration.
This prize is probably the most controversial handed out in economics. Make no mistake, though: Mr. Fogel is a giant of the profession.

HEADLINE: WORLD SERIES: ON BASEBALL;
Will a Realignment Be Good for the Game?

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
The Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies played Game 4 of the World Series last night. Was it the last game the players would play with integrity? It might be, major league baseball officials and owners believe, if the players received money for the rest of the games. As long as the players play for nothing past Game 4, officials and owners have no fear about the legitimacy of any World Series games.
Players' post-season shares have always come from the net gate receipts of the first four games of a series, whether it be the league series or the World Series. That way, they have no financial incentive to extend a series. 
 Now that the clubs want to introduce a new round of playoffs, adding a division champion and a wild-card team from each league, and now that the owners themselves will be receiving revenue from advertising time that television will sell, the players think that policy should be re-examined. The clubs say the policy is inviolate.
 That's why all the talk about three divisions in each league next year remains premature. The difference of opinion over money, or equity, has prevented the two sides from reaching agreement on the proposed changes. No agreement, no three divisions, no new round of playoffs.
It was supposed to be a simple step, but representatives of the two sides met again yesterday and when they finished, the format for 1994 had not changed.
"We had further discussions," Eugene Orza, associate general counsel of the Players Association, said. "I continue to remain optimistic that more rational heads will prevail."
With the clubs adamantly opposed to increasing the players' post-season shares, Orza's optimism may prove to be unfounded. If it is, the new format will not come about.
While the clubs dwell on the players' integrity, the change in baseball's national television package has spawned a different question of integrity: the owners' integrity.
Through this World Series, the television networks paid major league baseball a rights fee for regular-season and post-season games. Whether a post-season series went four games or seven, the payments were the same.
Beginning next year, rights payments will not exist. The Baseball Network, a newly formed venture of major league baseball and two networks, ABC and NBC, will sell commercial time for the games and divide the revenue based on a formula. In the case of post-season games, the longer a series goes, the greater the advertising revenue.
CBS has sold an estimated average of $18 million in commercial time per game. If next year's World Series attracts similar revenue and lasts seven games, the clubs, under terms of the new agreement, would share approximately $45 million extra over what they would receive for a four-game series. Similarly, they would gain additional revenue from a five-game (instead of three) first-round series and a seven-game (instead of four) league championship series.
Would it not be to the clubs' benefit to have the series run longer than the minimum number of games, just as it would be to the players' economic advantage? If the players' integrity would be subject to question, wouldn't the same perception exist for the owners?
"I'm not sure I agree with that," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said yesterday. "It's always been in the owners' best interest to have the most games possible. The better the networks do, the better the clubs do. And owners aren't playing. They're not on the field. They can't influence anything."
No, the owners cannot throw a fat pitch down the middle of the plate or strike out with the bases loaded or let a ground ball roll between their legs with the game tied and a runner at third. But owners could exert influence to make sure an umpire makes the "right" calls or a pitcher throws the "right" pitches.
Preposterous? Maybe so. But no more preposterous than suggesting that the players would throw a game or two to create higher shares.
If last year's post-season had gone the maximum 21 games instead of 19, the winning World Series share for the Blue Jays would have been $12,284 higher than the share each player actually received. The winner's actual share was $30,703 higher than the loser's share.
 Do the owners really think the Blue Jays would have risked $30,000 and the World Series championship by throwing a game each in the league playoff and World Series to gain an additional $12,000? Not in this lifetime.
Yet Selig said, "One would assume the players' payment should be in the same format as it has always been."
That stance, according to the players association, will guarantee the continuation of the format that has existed for 25 years: two divisions in each league, league championship series and World Series.
Nevertheless, Selig said, "I just hope we get it wrapped up and move ahead on it."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Playing on Uncertainties About the Health Plan

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
SPONSOR: The Coalition for Health Insurance Choices, financed by the Health Insurance Association fo America.
 
ON THE SCREEN: A couple, Harry and Louise, is sitting over breakfast. He is reading a newspaper, she a published version of the President's health care plan. The camera angle changes, and we see the health care plan from above as Louise underlines a passage with a yellow marking pen. At the end of the ad, an 800 number appears along with a tag identifying the sponsors.
 
THE SCRIPT: Harry: "I'm glad the President's doing something about health care reform."....Louise: "He's right. We need it."... Harry: "Some of these details--"... Louise: "Like a national limit on health care?"... Harry: "Really." ...Louise: "The government caps how much the country can spend on all health care and says, 'That's it!"'...Harry: "So what if our health plan runs out of money?"...Louise: "There's got to be a better way."
 
ACCURACY: The implication of the ad is that under the President's plan, only a certain amount of money can be spent on health care, and after that, patients will be out of luck. The President has proposed a complicated set of regulations to limit the rate in increase in health care spending to the inflation rate. Among other things, these regulations would limit the amount that health insurance premiums could rise each year. Many health care providers are concerned that the limits would adversely affect the quality of care and that some health care plans might actually run out of money. The President's proposal also calls for each state to set up contingency funds to bail out insolvent plans.
 
SCORECARD: The ad purports to reflect the concerns of average citizens, and it effectively appeals to a generalized sense that the Clinton Administration's plan doesn't quite add up. But the ad has an melodramatic, overacted quality that may make viewers suspicious. And once they learn the ad is sponsored by the insurance industry, these suspicions are only likely to increase.

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Campaign -- At Issue: Health Care;
New York's Health Challenge

SERIES: The Mayoral Campaign: At Issue: Health Care

 BODY:
New York City's next mayor will confront alarming rates of infant mortality, tuberculosis and AIDS. And he will need to re-invigorate public hospitals and clinics that are understaffed and underfinanced. It will be a daunting challenge when the city must cut its budget.
Mayor David Dinkins and Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal challenger, offer health care proposals that read like pages out of the same hymnal. Both advocate neighborhood clinics, health maintenance organizations, preventive care and turning city medical facilities over to nonprofit groups. The difference between the two is that Mayor Dinkins can also be judged by his deeds. After a shaky start -- and up against the need to make large budget cuts -- Mr. Dinkins has launched innovative programs to improve the health care of the city's poorest families. The health effort may be his strongest program. 
 At the heart of the Dinkins policy is a program to incorporate Medicaid recipients into managed-care plans, like H.M.O.'s. Most of the city's poor seek medical treatment only after they become seriously ill, and then in the most expensive way possible -- at overcrowded inner-city emergency rooms. By enrolling in H.M.O.'s, the families will now have their own doctors and get well-baby visits and other preventive care, largely free. Treating Medicaid enrollees in H.M.O.'s should, by catching medical problems before they fester, improve the quality of the care the poor receive.
The Mayoral Campaign
At Issue: Health Care
The Dinkins administration's program floundered when it was buried in the Human Resources Administration. But since it was moved to City Hall in 1992, enrollments have taken off. Almost 150,000 are now signed up -- putting the program ahead of a timetable set by Albany.
The city has converted 13 neighborhood facilities into full-service medical clinics, staffed by about 100 physicians. Mr. Dinkins also started a program that will tap loans from the state to provide nonprofit groups the capital they need to build 30 clinics in low-income neighborhoods. By placing the Medicaid population in managed care plans, the city can take full advantage of the Federal reforms proposed by President Clinton.
To his credit, Mr. Giuliani also supports the idea of creating nonprofit clinics in low-income neighborhoods, though he reasonably criticizes Mr. Dinkins for moving too slowly. He also blames Mr. Dinkins for pulling too much money out of public health programs early in his term. Mr. Giuliani argues that this added to the increase in tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases and rodent infestation.
Yet Mr. Giuliani's attack lacks credibility because his economic plan -- which relies on a series of tax cuts -- threatens to worsen the fiscal plight that drove Mr. Dinkins to make the cuts in the first place. The tax cuts would increase pressure to cut programs, and there's no assurance that worthy programs like public health would be spared.
Beyond criticizing the Dinkins record, Mr. Giuliani proposes his own reforms, like building comprehensive school-based health clinics. That's an interesting idea that might be usefully coordinated with Mr. Dinkins's neighborhood-based clinics. Mr. Giuliani also proposes privatizing a couple of municipal hospitals to see if turning them over to nonprofit groups would improve care and cut costs.
That is a worthy experiment. But privatization is not likely to generate huge budget savings because the city has already cut its hospital losses in half and much of the remaining expense will still have to be paid to care for prisoners, firefighters, police and others.
Mr. Dinkins, meanwhile, has actually privatized Medicaid clinics throughout the city. Thus on this as on many health issues, both candidates embrace many of the same reforms. The question voters face is which man will more likely institute the sentiments they share.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Laughter After Nafta

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Anything that Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, Ralph Nader and Jesse Jackson line up against -- I'm for.
But that is hardly a high-domed argument for Nafta, which offers the most stupefyingly boring acronym since MEGO (my eyes glaze over) itself. 
 Face it: Only your grim sense of civic duty, or your fear that you will be asked your position on this by your overeducated children, causes you to read about anything with Nafta in its title. I'm the same way, taking sips of supercaffeinated coffee as I write this to keep my forehead from crashing down onto the wrist support of my computer keyboard.
But we hafta. And not because the refusal of Congress to approve the lowering of tariffs negotiated by two Presidents would strangle the Clinton Presidency in its crib. The White House tried that desperate argument with its tax-and-spend budget, and a President gets only one act of mercy from his party per term.
Here, quick and dirty, are the real reasons to support the free-traders and rout the protectionists:
1. Breaking down the barriers may throw some people out of work now, but will help all our kids get better jobs tomorrow.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. can trot out a parade of captive economists to show how, in the short run, jobs will be lost to low-wage Mexico. But to paraphrase Lord Keynes, in the short run we are all exhausted; a counter-parade of the dismal scientists will show you how free trade expands trade, which means more jobs and a higher standard of living for all.
Expert opinion won't settle this debate. Common sense says that opening new markets enlarges the pie, and what is good for all business is good for all workers.
2. Here's our chance to help Mexico, and ultimately all of Latin America, move away from the Socialism and dictatorship that poverty spawns.
The best President Mexico ever had has taken a gutsy stand for free enterprise and all-Americanism; shall we saw off the limb he's on? That would be self-defeating, inviting hordes of hungry Mexicans to swim the Rio Grande and wind up on welfare here. (Clinton is now getting the hang of a little nativist counter-demagoguery.) Better to give Mexico a bright capitalist future, attracting investment that will pay higher wages and create consumers for U.S. goods.
3. Protectionism and isolationism are sisters under the skinheads; if we turn inward and adopt a "Festung Amerika" philosophy, we lose our competitive edge, lose business, lose jobs, lose world leadership and turn into a nation of losers.
Look to the East: a free-trading bloc is forming there that could knock our made-in-China socks off. Look to the West: the French farmers behind "So Be It" Balladur are leading Europe into an us-against-them Common Market, holding a GATT to the head of world trade.
Hey, protectionists: Wouldn't it be nice to have a whole hemisphere with us -- 370 million strong -- to keep the Europeans and Asians from ganging up? (This is not an argument that free-trade purists make, but it's time we gave wider meaning to "America first"; eat your heart out, Pat.)
Perot, Jackson and the rest of the America-lasters (this is not as dull as I thought) would have us believe a free-trade bloc on our side of the Atlantic and Pacific somehow dilutes U.S. sovereignty. Baloney; Nafta's free-trade zone is the free-enterprise answer to the schemes of U.N. bureaucrats and Law-of-the-Seaniks to socialize our system.
4. We can cut from current spending the few billions we now get from restrictive tariffs.
Mr. Clinton wants to put on cross-border fees to make up the difference, which Republicans resist as new taxes. This "don't take us for granted" grumbling is a way to hold the Clinton feet to the fire, lest his wooing of liberals lead him to promise them the moon on environmental spending. "The funding will not kill the Nafta," Mickey Kantor assures me. (Our new trade rep is no Carla Hills, but he'll do; note Mr. Kantor's correct usage in "the" Nafta.)
Principled Republican support against the defeatist fears of America-lasters has this requirement: Clinton more up front and enthusiastically on the line. If he cannot get 130 votes in the House on this from his own kind, the Democrats don't deserve to govern.

HEADLINE: Time Is Ripe for Single-Payer Health Reform

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Partisans of the Clinton health care reforms, most of whom are closet single-payer advocates, have given up on the latter, because they say it is not "p.r." (politically realistic). They and the Clinton Administration might do well to heed the words of their own guru in the White House, Paul Starr, who in his "Social Transformation of American Medicine," wrote about the Medicare battle of 1964 as follows: 
 Medicare "received the highest priority among Great Society programs. However, strategists for the bill, still smarting from past defeats by the [American Medical Association], were against expanding its provisions to include physicians' services or to cover any broader groups than the aged. At a time of expansive reform, they continued to back a measure framed in the more conservative 1950s." It took Representative Wilbur Mills, who paid attention to public opinion polls at the time, to include doctors' services and a program for the poor.
Similarly today, the 80's are mercifully behind us, and as the commentator Kevin Phillips and others have noted, there is a backlash against that profligate decade and a demand for social reform arising from the more hostile economic climate of the 90's.
It is not surprising in this new environment that more than 70 percent of the American people favor a universal, single-tier, single-payer system of national health insurance. It remains to be seen whether there are enough legislators with the courage and ingenuity to go beyond lip service to a Canadian-style plan and wage a serious fight for it. Otherwise we will never know the limits of the possible.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Message: Despite Problems, a City on the Mend

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
As he circulates around New York City in search of a second term, Mayor David N. Dinkins these days seldom uses Rudolph W. Giuliani's name, deliberately mislabeling his opponent as a "Republican conservative candidate" and describing him as a man without compassion for the homeless or appreciation for the city's diversity.
In stump speeches that he delivers several times a day, everywhere from centers for the elderly in Bushwick to catering halls in Bay Ridge to Harlem churches, the Mayor has been working to shift the race from a referendum on his four-year term to one on Mr. Giuliani's politics and ideology. 
 "I want folks to know just who Rudolph Giuliani is," Mr. Dinkins told supporters at a campaign rally last week at the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Harlem in a rare use of Mr. Giuliani's name. Then he rattled off a list of what he called the "different philosophies, different attitudes" between himself and his challenger.
The Mayor told the rally that Mr. Giuliani opposed the all-civilian police review board created last year, that he would dismantle a Dinkins administration program to grant more city contracts to companies owned by members of minorities and women, and that Mr. Giuliani's Republican "friends" in Congress had blocked President Clinton's economic-stimulus plan, which he says would have been worth about $400 million to New York City.
 
A Recurring Theme
 It is a strategy that blends easily with another recurring theme -- New York, while it surely has problems, is on the mend.
At a recent meeting with community leaders in a Brooklyn Heights church, a woman told the Mayor that many of her neighbors had become so discouraged by the city's seemingly insurmountable problems that they were ready to give up and leave.
"Do not give up," said Mr. Dinkins, who had appeared tired at the meeting's outset but snapped alert under the questioning. "New York's best days are ahead of it, not behind it. Some folks talk about the good old days, but the good old days never were, in many instances."
 
Jogging for Hugs
 Mr. Dinkins's own mood has been noticeably more upbeat in recent weeks, in part, no doubt, because the polls have also shown improvement in his standing with voters after a summerlong onslaught of politically damaging developments. Mr. Dinkins, who endured the summer stoically if sometimes petulantly, seems calm and confident now. He appears genuinely to enjoy campaigning, greeting old friends with his trademark, "Hi, buddy," and literally jogging to every baby stroller in sight for hugs and kisses.
While he would never be confused with Fiorello H. La Guardia as a spellbinding orator, Mr. Dinkins has shed some of the stiffness that can make him appear distant and disengaged. He has gone before many campaign audiences without the prepared speeches that he ordinarily favors and that he generally reads dispassionately.
Yes, he admits, he has made some unspecified mistakes, but he has learned from them and now does his job better. Yes, there is a broad perception that crime is pervasive, but he has hired a record number of new police officers and the statistics show crime is falling. Yes, the prolonged recession has cost New York more than 350,000 private-sector jobs, but he has still managed to balance four budgets and carve out some modest but innovative new programs.
The Mayor's stump case against his Republican-Liberal opponent complements his television advertisements, which have highlighted, among other things, Mr. Giuliani's changing views on abortion rights early in the 1989 campaign. It also adds to the standard campaign speech that Mr. Dinkins has been delivering all year, a compendium of achievements in which he shapes his case for re-election.
 
Closing Budget Gaps
 The Mayor tells audience after audience that he has closed huge budget gaps, expanded the police force and cut crime, even in the midst of a crushing recession. And he argues that he needs four more years to complete the job.
In addition to marshaling facts and figures, the Mayor also relies on small group of jokes and stories that he repeats almost verbatim. At the church rally last week in Harlem, he told a story that he has told to great effect many times before in many places.
"We were riding along in a city limousine one day, my wife and I, and I said, Joyce -- that's her name, Joyce -- I said, 'You see that fellow over there with the shovel, digging a ditch?' " Mr. Dinkins said.
"She said, 'Yeah.' I said, 'Isn't that the fellow you used to date?'
"I said, 'Now, wait a minute, don't misunderstand. There's nothing wrong with digging ditches. I have dug ditches, waited tables, worked in factories, did all kinds of jobs. There's nothing wrong with digging ditches. In fact, it is the fellow you used to date, isn't it?' "
"She said, 'Yes, as a matter of fact it is.' I said, 'See, if you'd married him you'd be the wife of a ditch-digger.' She said, 'No, if I'd married him, he'd be mayor.' "
He also used another familiar example of his self-deprecating humor that night, reminding people that he spent a good part of his adult life trying to get elected Manhattan borough president.
"You know, I ran three times," he said. "The people in their wisdom rejected my candidacy on two occasions, and it wasn't until the third time that I won. As a matter of fact, along the way, I'd meet people, they'd say, 'What do you do?' And I'd say, 'I run for borough president.' "
 
Encouraging Youngsters
 Mr. Dinkins also has a set piece in which he encourages young people to study hard and be ambitious. "Kids, listen up," he says, beginning a five-minute homily in which he advises children, especially black and Hispanic youngsters, to respect their parents, shun violence and learn to think. He cites Nelson Mandela, saying it was his ability to reason that helped him survive nearly three decades of imprisonment in South Africa.
Mr. Dinkins tells the children, as he did during a rally at a housing project in East New York, Brooklyn, "You can be anything you want to be." He tells them that they can become doctors, lawyers, teachers and police officers. "And you know you can be mayor," he says, wrapping up his talk with a flourish.
Sometimes the Mayor arrives at campaign events holding notes brimming with statistics -- generally when he goes before groups with whom he might feel uncomfortable, as he did at a forum in Manhattan sponsored by an environmental group and another held by a group of small-business owners in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. But more often he comes to campaign stops these days without notes or a prepared text, giving his presentation more immediacy.
Mr. Dinkins talks of the difficulties of balancing the city budget and always highlights several programs he created in the last two years: new primary-care health centers in poor neighborhoods, the opening of some schools in the afternoons and evenings for programs for children and adults, and the opening of public libraries six days a week.
 
Ideological Differences
 The Mayor has been hammering at these points since January, when he laid out what has become his election-year platform in his State of the City address. Over the last month or so, he has also begun emphasizing his ideological differences with Mr. Giuliani, trying to portray his opponent as a hard-core Republican in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 5 to 1.
The goal is to try to depict Mr. Giuliani as someone unsympathetic to minorities and lacking compassion for the poor, a perception that would help Mr. Dinkins with the coalition that elected him four years ago: black, Hispanic, liberal white and gay New Yorkers.
Whatever the outcome of the election, the Mayor seems at ease. Several aides say he has told them recently that he wants to win very badly but that he thinks he could live with defeat better than Mr. Giuliani could.
Mr. Dinkins, who has long had a wary relationship with the press, has even seemed more relaxed around reporters. He was standing on West 52d Street on a recent Saturday, telling several reporters that four rallies planned for that afternoon in Brooklyn had been canceled. "What will you do this afternoon?" someone asked.
With a twinkle in his eyes, the Mayor, known for his wardrobe and a fastidious attention to fashion, responded: "I'll go back to the mansion and do some housework. Got to press the other suit."

HEADLINE: Economist Takes Reins at University of Chicago

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 20

 BODY:
Hugo F. Sonnenschein, an economist and former provost of Princeton University who almost flunked out of college as an 18-year-old undergraduate, was inaugurated today as the 11th president of the University of Chicago.
Speaking in the Rockefeller Memorial Chapel about the university's "especially fierce commitment" to ideas, including "uncomfortable" ones, the new president defended Robert W. Fogel, a University of Chicago economist who last week won the Nobel Prize in Economics. 
 Mr. Fogel has been criticized for his 1974 book, "Time on the Cross," and later writings in which he contended that slavery, although morally reprehensible, was an efficient means of economic organization. "The clear, correct reading of his work is that as a society we cannot be guided by what is economically efficient," the new president said. "To do so would be to deny our humanity."
Mr. Sonnenschein added, "If you want to seek the truth, then you have to take risks, and it helps to be in an environment that supports truth seekers."
In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Sonnenschein, a 53-year-old specialist in microeconomic theory, said the biggest problem facing the university was sharply curtailed Federal support.
"You have to decide what to do less of," Mr. Sonnenschein said. "You have to ask, Is a given project worthwhile, relative to the most outstanding opportunities?"
 
Faculty Is Happy With Choice
 While declining to cite specific cuts, he said his predecessor, Hanna Gray, had "chosen wisely" in reducing administrative expenses and closing the geography department in 1986 and the Graduate Library School in 1988.
Mrs. Gray plans to return to teaching history next fall.
The faculty appears to be happy with the choice of Mr. Sonnenschein, who has been at Chicago since July. "He has all the right instincts," said Richard A. Epstein, a law professor who serves as the faculty spokesman.
Mr. Epstein recalled that last March, when Mr. Sonnenschein visited the university's Laboratory Schools, a 6-year-old girl made him a gift of a slightly squashed M & M. A few days later, the girl received a thank-you letter from the new president.
"That's the kind of guy he is," Mr. Epstein said.
Born in New York City, Mr. Sonnenschein graduated from the University of Rochester in 1961. During his freshman year there, he said, his grades were so low that he had to take summer courses in mathematics and modern poetry at the University of Chicago. Eventually, he went on to earn a master's degree and Ph.D. at Purdue University.
He was appointed provost of Princeton in 1991 after teaching economics and serving as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania.
 
Past Laurels, Fresh Talent
 Among Mr. Sonnenschein's challenges will be maintaining the talent level of a faculty that has included the physicist Enrico Fermi, who directed the construction of the world's first nuclear reactor; the late ultraconservative historian Allan Bloom, and the novelist Saul Bellow, who was lured away by Boston University last year.
"An institution can't live on what it's been," Mr. Sonnenschein said. "It must celebrate that, but it must also look to the future and continue to attract the finest young scholars and support them."
As an example of fresh talent on the faculty, he cited Shulamit Ran, a native of Tel Aviv and a Pulitzer Prize winning composer who is now composer in residence at the university.
Mr. Sonnenschein said that as an economist, he took particular pleasure in Mr. Fogel's sharing the Nobel Prize with Douglass C. North of Washington University in St. Louis. This was the third year in a row that a Chicago University economist has won the prize.
A T-shirt popular among students here is inscribed with the names of the university's 63 Nobel laureates before Mr. Fogel.

HEADLINE: New Proposal From Cuomo For Yankees

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
A $150 million plan to keep the Yankees in the Bronx through 2032 will be offered in the next few days to George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday.
The new offer follows a far less detailed project proposed by the Governor last month, which offered the Yankee owner a 50,000-seat stadium on Manhattan's West Side at a cost of $530 million. That proposal was quickly opposed by city officials and community leaders as too extravagant and impractical given the traffic congestion in the area. 
 Mr. Cuomo was also sharply criticized by city officials for failing to make a forceful effort to keep the ball club in Yankee Stadium, where the team has thrilled fans since 1923 with 22 World Series titles.
 
Preemptive Move by Cuomo
 The Governor's new proposal is in line with Mayor David N. Dinkins's single-minded strategy of keeping the Yankees in their traditional home, but it is also another preemptive move by Mr. Cuomo, who if the Yankees stay put would be able to take political credit as the man who kept the Yankees from moving to New Jersey.
The plan, which had not been seen by the Mayor, is almost identical to one offered by the city to Mr. Steinbrenner six years ago, and would be the most substantial overture to counter what city and state officials believe is a longstanding informal invitation from the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to lure the Yankees across the Hudson with a $250 million ball park and lucrative financial guarantees.
"Mr. Steinbrenner says it's not economically feasible for him to stay in Yankee Stadium because attendance isn't what it should be," the Governor said. "Maybe he won't sign a new lease, but then he'll have to show why he doesn't like this plan economically. It gives him what he wants."
 
What New Jersey Can't Match
 Whether the plan for a new lease -- the current one runs through 2002 -- equals in economic impact what Mr. Steinbrenner could get from New Jersey "will be argued," Mr. Cuomo said.
"But our plan gives him something New Jersey can never match: that's New York," he said.
A sense of urgency on the part of Mr. Cuomo has been apparent since June, when the Governor concluded that the Yankees might leave the state. The competition with New Jersey, which has never made a formal offer but has repeatedly indicated a willingness to accommodate Mr. Steinbrenner, led Mr. Cuomo to float the possibility of alternative sites in New York, including the expensive riverfront project on the Long Island Rail Road storage yards south of the Jacob Javits Convention Center.
Mr. Cuomo has never stated why he has spearheaded proposals to keep the Yankees, but if he runs for a fourth term as Governor, few announcements could be as debilitating as one by Mr. Steinbrenner that his Yankees were leaving for New Jersey.
The latest proposal was put together by Vincent Tese, the chairman of the state Urban Development Corporation. He expected that it would be presented to Mr. Steinbrenner in the "next four or five days."
The Yankee owner will see a plan almost identical to a $90 million deal he agreed to in principle six years ago with former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
Based on details provided by Mr. Tese, the plan calls for the construction of 24 luxury suites to augment the 18 now leased at the Stadium. Shea Stadium currently has 46 suites selling for about $90,000 each. Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands has 72 suites, which produced $6.5 million in revenues in 1992.
It also addresses Mr. Steinbrenner's demands to provide adequate parking and transportation access to fans, many of whom live outside the city. A new parking garage with at least 3,000 spaces, would be built adjacent to the Stadium.
 
Link to Northern Suburbs
 A Metro-North station would create the first railroad link between the Stadium and fans from northern suburbs.
Access from the Major Deegan Expressway would be improved to ease vehicular access in and out of the Stadium.
Mr. Steinbrenner could not be reached yesterday, and a spokesman for him, Howard J. Rubenstein, said, "He has not received the offer and he'll await it before he makes any comment."
The 1987 agreement was never signed, collapsing a year later over the city's demand to receive a percentage of the Yankees' cable television revenues. At the time, Mr. Steinbrenner said he would agree to a flat fee. Several weeks after the deal fell through, the Yankees signed a 12-year cable deal with the Madison Square Garden Network worth nearly $500 million.
There is no provision for the city to receive cable revenue in the revised proposal.
"It's not intelligent to fight over $1 million in cable money when you could have him sign a lease for 30 years," Mr. Tese said. "That was a big mistake. The city did not see the forest for the trees back then."
 
No Serious Talks Since 1988
 Since 1988, there have been no serious talks about extending the lease on Yankee Stadium, due mainly to Mr. Steinbrenner's two-years-plus exile from baseball, which ended last spring, and the growing litany of complaints by Mr. Steinbrenner and his aides about conditions at the Stadium.
Mr. Steinbrenner has cited parking, security, sanitation and traffic problems for depressing Yankees attendance despite the improved play of the team this past season. Early this season he complained that his attendance lagged the Mets, an inferior team, and challenged fans to show their support for keeping the team in the Bronx by attending important series.
But the drawing power of a winning team was shown as the Yankees stayed in contention for the American League East championship until the final days of the race. Attendance, which totaled 979,218 at midseason, rose to 2,416,941 by the end of the season.
In recent months the city worked aggressively on improving Stadium conditions, a move that has been a prerequisite for Mr. Steinbrenner to discuss a new lease. In June, city and Bronx officials announced an ambitious plan to rebuild the Bronx's downtown. A month later the city announced plans to renovate the Bronx Terminal market, a collection of warehouses and stores just south of the Stadium.
Mr. Dinkins has spoken only of keeping the Yankees in the Bronx. Other city officials, like Betsy Gotbaum, the Parks Commissioner, and Fernando Ferrer, the Manhattan Borough President, have questioned the feasibility or advisability of building a ball park on Manhattan's West Side, insisting that the only viable alternative already exists at 161st Street and River Avenue, Yankee Stadium.

HEADLINE: Reassuring Eastern Europe, Christopher Praises Hungary's Reforms

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher cast himself in the role of diplomatic booster today, praising Hungary's economic and political reforms in Budapest and signaling his staunch support for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
In Hungary, Mr. Christopher's first visit to an Eastern European country in his nine months as Secretary of State, the Secretary sought to assuage Hungarian fears that the United States does not care sufficiently about the problems facing Eastern Europe. 
 "I assure you we would never disregard or in any way underrate the significance of these countries," Mr. Christopher told reporters in a joint news conference with Hungary's Foreign Minister, Geza Jeszenszky.
Mr. Christopher decided to add Hungary to his trip, which includes visits to the four nuclear states of the former Soviet Union -- Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- and Latvia, only after last month's parliamentary elections in Poland in which former Communists won over a number of pro-Western democrats.
 
Two Views of Polish Elections
 The State Department is divided about the significance of the Polish elections. Some analysts fear that Poland and Hungary may turn to right-wing authoritarianism in the next two to three years. These officials have urged the Administration to press for the expansion of NATO to the East. Other State Department officials dismiss that view as alarmist, arguing that liberal democracy has taken root firmly in Central Europe, according to senior officials.
Mr. Christopher is said to have been persuaded that the United States could not take the democratization and economic reform of Eastern Europe for granted and that he needed to display his personal support by paying a visit to the region.
But Mr. Christopher did not come to Hungary with promises of aid or pledges to ease the economic burden of economic sanctions against Serbia, which have hurt the economies of Hungary and other countries who had traded with Belgrade. Nor did he bring an outright promise to embrace Hungary's demand that it join NATO, although one of his top aides told reporters on Wednesday that the Administration wanted to "open the door" to the eventual expansion of NATO that could include Russia and other countries of the former Soviet bloc.
But in meetings with NATO Defense Ministers in Germany, Defense Secretary Les Aspin has played down the possibility of expanding the 16-member alliance, at least in the next few years.
For his part, Mr. Jeszenszky went out of his way to praise the American proposal even though it fell far short of Hungary's demands, saying, "The very idea that there is a possibility or even the need for such an expansion is something that is welcome."
 
'Strategic Partnership'
 Privately, some European officials and diplomats expressed puzzlement that Mr. Christopher allowed Mr. Aspin to make a major policy statement on the future of NATO and did not articulate the policy himself.
En route to Moscow this evening, Mr. Christopher said he was making the trip because Mr. Clinton wanted him to build on the American "strategic partnership" with Russia.
Mr. Christopher, who will join Mr. Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and other senior Russian officials in two days of meetings, also said he wanted to get a sense of the preparations for the December 11-12 parliamentary elections in Russia. He said that his conversations with Mr. Kozyrev have convinced him that the Russian leadership has focused "like a laser" on the elections, to be held in the wake of Mr. Yeltsin's dissolution of Parliament last month and the showdown between the Russian Parliament and President. Mr. Christopher plans to raise the issues of Russia's economic reform and the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Turning to the situation in Georgia, in which the Government of Eduard A. Shevardnadze is facing two rebellions, Mr. Christopher praised Mr. Shevardnadze, who was the Soviet Union's last Foreign Minister, as a leader who "has long exhibited his friendship" for the United States, and noted his "commitment to democratic values." Mr., Christopher said, without elaboration, that the United States hoped to "help him any way we can."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Clinton Offers Georgian Support
 TBILISI, Georgia, Oct. 21 (AP) -- The Georgian Government today released a letter from President Clinton offering Mr. Shevardnadze support and inviting him to Washington. Mr. Clinton also offered to assist in peace talks with Abkhazian separatists.
"I have been following closely the tragic events unfolding in your country and want to assure you of my continued full support for your leadership and for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty," Mr. Clinton wrote.

HEADLINE: Body and Dreams Trampled, a Riot Victim Fights On

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21

 BODY:
The verdicts in the Reginald O. Denny case are in, and this bruised city anticipates a new beginning. But for at least one victim of the mayhem at Florence and Normandie Avenues, who is now broke, sick and scared, the spiral of misery has no end.
He is Fidel Lopez, a Guatemalan immigrant, who after 20 years of toil had seized the American dream for his wife and three daughters, a dream that was dashed in seconds when he drove his pickup truck into an intersection just blocks from his home where fires roared and bedlam reigned. 
 Mr. Lopez was thinking about how well things were going that April afternoon 18 months ago as he unwittingly drove toward the unfolding unrest. He owned a three-bedroom house in South-Central Los Angeles, his small contracting business was getting off the ground, and he was planning his family's first real vacation.
 
Blood, Pain and Terror
 Then, like Mr. Denny, Mr. Lopez was dragged from his truck and beaten senseless by a mob that included Damian M. Williams and Henry K. Watson. His forehead was slashed under the blows of a stereo speaker. His left ear was nearly severed. His genitals were spray-painted black, and his body was doused with gasoline, apparently for the purpose of setting him afire.
A black preacher threw his body on Mr. Lopez's and saved his life. But since that miracle moment, the news has all been bad.
Mr. Lopez is broke because of the months he could not work, the debts incurred replacing thousands of dollars of equipment in his burned truck, the mortgage payments he continues to make on a house that his family is afraid to live in and the tens of thousands of dollars he had invested in a job that he was unable to finish. He works seven days a week now, as does his wife, Coralia, who is a maid.
And Mr. Lopez, 48 years old, is in failing health and has no medical insurance. After being patched up in an emergency room the night of the riots, he has received virtually no medical care.
He complains of headaches, vomiting and dizziness, sometimes so severe that his co-workers must help him off a ladder. He says he has back and chest pain and is deaf in his left ear. Members of his family say that his halting speech has nothing to do with fluency in English. He used to be more coherent, they say, but now loses his train of thought.
"They destroyed me, physically and economically," Mr. Lopez said without bitterness the other evening, as his daughters did homework and laundry in the shabby one-bedroom apartment where the family now lives some 10 miles from South-Central Los Angeles.
"We had problems before, but nothing like this," said 17-year-old Melissa, the Lopez's middle daughter. "Everything was turned upside down."
Yet the Lopez family is philosophical about the lenient verdicts this week and showed no malice toward the assailants, whom Mr. Lopez was not able to identify in his testimony but who were visible in the videotapes.
For the attack on Mr. Lopez, Damian Williams was found guilty of misdemeanor assault but acquitted of felony assault with a deadly weapon. Mr. Williams faces a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a $1,000 fine.
 
'Better It's Over'
 "It's all right," Mr. Lopez said of the verdict. "If they sent those guys to jail, those people would be mad and do it all over again. It's better it's over. And for me, everything that is broken I can't anyway get back."
His daughter Melissa, too, is magnanimous. If the verdict was unfair to her father, she said, it is also a reminder that "this verdict is the kind of injustice black people always get."
Melissa came to court when her father testified, looked his assailants in the eye and "saw they were human beings, too."
What angers the Lopezes more is the police response to the rioting. "There was no protection for nobody," Mr. Lopez said. "Whose fault is that?"
The minister who saved Mr. Lopez stood guard with Bible in hand, transported his body home and then to a hospital when no ambulance crew would brave the neighborhood. The 60-year-old minister, the Rev. Bennie Newton, befriended the Lopezes. They were at his bedside last spring when he died of leukemia.
"For all the thoughts I had against black people, preacher Bennie was like a piece of cotton with love going 'round my heart," said Mr. Lopez's brother-in-law, Luis Barrios. "He was there to show us that in every situation, just like the Bible tells us, there is good and bad."
But it was their life before the beating, as one of two Hispanic families on an otherwise black street where neighbors helped neighbors, that predisposed the Lopez family to forgive.
"Everybody says, 'It's your dad, don't you hate black people?' " Melissa said. "Well, the thing about us, thank God, is that we grew up all our lives around black people. We know there are good people, bad people, O.K. people. There was really no hatred. I understood why they were so mad."
 
Recalling a Terrible Night
 On the night of the riots, 19-year-old Vanessa accompanied her father to the hospital, both of them covered with a towel in the back seat of Mr. Newton's car so they would not be seen and stoned for being the wrong color.
Vanessa then spent more than 24 hours with her father in a building riddled with gunfire and jammed with howling, bloody victims. She has little to say about that experience except that "I had to stay calm because I was the only one there for him."
Melissa, despite her words of solace, flinches when people come too close to the car she is riding in on the way to her father's work site in South-Central Los Angeles. Her father says she is quicker to anger than she used to be. She adds that concentrating in school has become a struggle.
After the riots Aileen, who is 9, was petrified in the family home in South-Central, and thus they moved to the small apartment next to Mr. Barrios. "This little girl, she be crying every day," Mr. Lopez said. "She believed they would come again and get me."
There was no margin of error in Mr. Lopez's young business. He lost his $8,000 truck, $2,000 worth of tools, $3,000 worth of insulation and dry wall, and many personal possessions, including his green card.
Meanwhile, a few blocks away, his job site was trashed by the rioters, who tore copper pipes from the walls and stole equipment. Because of his injuries, Mr. Lopez never completed that job, in which he had invested $35,000 of his own money in the expectation that he would make it back in the end.
Then there is the family home, which sat empty for months because no one wanted to buy or rent it in the riot-torn neighborhood. Recently, Mr. Lopez found a tenant, who he says has turned out to be a deadbeat.
 
Working Day and Night
 Desperate for money, Mr. Lopez works day and night. "I tell him he must go to the doctor," Mr. Barrios said. "He tells me, "Yeah, but I have to work.' He is a tough guy when it comes to work. Nobody will stop him. He has the American dream in his head all the time."
Melissa hugged her father with special urgency when he came home from work early one day because he was tired. "Hi, Daddy, you O.K.?" she asked, trying to sound nonchalant.
Outside Mr. Lopez's hearing, the teen-ager said she was afraid: "That's a proud man. He doesn't like to say exactly what's going on. But I know there is something wrong with him. Sometimes he keels over."
From the porch next door, Mr. Barrios watched father and daughter embrace in the fading light of evening. Mr. Barrios is a relative newcomer to this country, here just six years, and he talks of hardship in the context of what America promises.
"We all believe in the magic of this place," Mr. Barrios said. "This is heaven. So where did heaven go? Who took it away?"

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Surprise German Rate Cut Spurs Big Gains for Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar staged a broad rally yesterday after Germany stunned the currency markets with interest rate cuts that set off similar rate reductions throughout Europe.
 The cuts prompted money to flow into dollar-denominated assets as yields fell on investments based on European currencies. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.6667 German marks, from 1.6408 marks on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for December delivery fell $1, to $372.80 an ounce.
The Bundesbank confounded expectations in the currency markets yesterday by cutting half a point off its key discount rate, to 5 3/4 percent, and its Lombard rate, to 6 3/4 percent. The central bank also set a fixed short-term repurchase rate for next week at 64/10 percent, below the 62/3 percent of this week.
 Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Austria followed suit, partly to keep exchange rates level with the mark.
 
Bundesbank 'More Optimistic'
 "The fact that they have decided to cut really would suggest the Bundesbank is more optimistic on future price moves," said Brian Martin, an economist at Citibank in London, citing the prospect of falling German inflation.
 The fiercely independent German central bank has often eased credit when least expected. "This highlights just how foxy the Bundesbank can be at the old game plan of trying to outwit the market," said David Brown, chief economist at Tokai Bank in London.
 Some viewed the cut as a shift in Bundesbank policy under its new president, Hans Tietmeyer, even though he has said the bank will continue easing credit cautiously.
 
Dollar Rises to 108.35 Yen
 The dollar, which surged against the Japanese yen on heavy buying in Tokyo, widened its gains in late New York trading, rising to 108.35 Japanese yen, from 107.42 yen on Wednesday.
"The market is more comfortable holding long positions now," said Ichiei Kuki, customer dealer at Tokai Bank in Tokyo.
 Meanwhile, the British pound finished in New York at $1.4844, below $1.4939 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates compared with Wednesday's quotes included: 1.4695 Swiss francs, up from 1.4515; 5.8367 French francs, up from 5.7950; 1,606 Italian lire, up from 1,597; and Canadian $1.3095, down from $1.3176.

HEADLINE: Anxious Haitians Start Building Boats Again

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PETIT-GOAVE, Haiti, Oct. 21

 BODY:
Colbert St. Vil sat under a wooden boat with a chisel, carving the last touches on a vessel he said he was building to transport bags of rice and cement from ships docked at a nearby port to this coastal town.
This fishing hamlet, however, is one of the villages from which many Haitians have fled in rickety boats, trying to reach the United States and appeal for asylum from the military Government that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide two years ago. And Mr. St. Vil's new cargo boat could quickly become a passenger boat. 
 In towns like Petit-Goave, people are hastily building boats to make the 600-mile journey to the United States because of increasing economic hardship and political repression.
"If he does not return, we'll take matters into our own hands," Mr. St. Vil said, referring to President Aristide. "I don't mean on land; I mean the ocean. It's our only way out."
If Haitians do take to the sea, it will create yet another refugee problem for the Clinton Administration, which is struggling to restore Father Aristide to power. The flood of refugees from Haiti was a major factor in persuading the Administration to push hard for Father Aristide's return in the first place.
In two years of negotiations, diplomats have failed to persuade the military to accept the return of Father Aristide as President.
The restoration of democratic rule seemed to be in sight in July after the Army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, signed an accord agreeing to resign and accepting the return of Father Aristide by Oct. 30.
But last week the treaty fell apart when General Cedras refused to resign and plainclothes paramilitary forces assassinated President Aristide's Justice Minister, Guy Malary.
While diplomats try to salvage the accord, Haitians are making plans in case they fail.
In Petit-Goave, about an hour from Port-au-Prince, people speak about the fear and the hardships they have endured since the coup. They speak about nightly "disappearances" and about not being able to speak freely.
Tension in this quaint town, dotted with colonial gingerbread homes, increased last week when a soldier was killed while on duty. When word spread through the open-air market, vendors scurried to get home, creating a sense of panic.
"Every night I go to sleep, I dream of Guantanamo," said Yvon St. Lot, referring to the United States Naval Base on the southeastern coast of Cuba where he and other Haitians were held after they were picked up at sea. "At least I was able to eat twice a day."
 
When the Exodus Stopped
 After the coup, more than 40,000 Haitians left by boat, hoping to reach the United States. Thousands left from Petit-Goave. During the Bush Administration, about 10,000 were allowed into the United States as political refugees. But the exodus halted when the Coast Guard began stopping boats at sea and repatriating the Haitians.
Mr. St. Lot, 30, like many here, fled twice by boat. The first time, his boat was intercepted by the Coast Guard and he spent two months at Guantanamo before being returned to Haiti. Eight days after his return, he tried again and ended up in Cuba, which also sent him back to Haiti.
 
'Now They Just Shoot You'
 "Now things are worse than before," said Mr. St. Lot, who does not sleep at his home because of fear. "They used to beat you up," he said of the military thugs. "Now they just shoot you."
What is also driving ordinary Haitians to flee is a sense that the United Nations embargo against Haiti will hurt them the most.
In the past, Haitians used to say they were fleeing for fear of their lives; now many readily admit they will be leaving because of economic hardship.
Prices in Haiti have skyrocketed. In just a few days, gasoline prices went to $3.70, from $1.50, and the price of rice quadrupled. Unemployment is spreading rapidly; every day, young men here sit idly under the verandas and play cards to pass the time.
 
Blaming Aristide
 Marie-Judith Theodore, an unemployed teacher, said: "If it was up to me, the Americans can have this country. Under these conditions, it's better to be occupied. I know that a lot of people don't want the whites here, but at least I would work."
But Miss Theodore blames President Aristide for the economic deterioration.
"His return is impossible," she said with strong conviction. "The other side will boycott him. There will be problems. I know the United States is playing with him because if they wanted him to return, a little country like Haiti could not stop them."
Asked if she would take a boat to the United States, Miss Theodore just smiled. But as she walked away, a man who was standing nearby said her boyfriend was a soldier. "Don't listen to her," he said.
 
Two Hard Choices
 The political situation remains murky. Many of the men playing cards said wryly that it was not support for President Aristide that led them to sleep at a different locations every night. As they spoke, others kept watch. And whenever a stranger appeared, they kept quiet.
"Every night people disappear," said Jeuly Prophete, 25. "You never know what happens to them."
To many Haitians, their options are few: Stay and go hungry and face the wrath of soldiers, or risk their lives aboard a leaky boat in hope of finding a better life somewhere else.
Luc Selmot, who was playing poker, said a phone call from President Clinton would be enough to solve the crisis. But he also plans to leave no matter what the outcome.
"When I leave, nobody is going to send me back here," he said. "The United States knows what's going on here, so when I leave they can't send me back. They might as well kill me on the spot. That's what the military will do to us."
