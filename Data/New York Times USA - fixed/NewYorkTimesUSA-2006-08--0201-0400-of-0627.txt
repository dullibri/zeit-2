HEADLINE: Georgia to Revise Peacekeeping Agreement

BYLINE: By COMPILED BY MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers on Thursday. 
 GAZETA

GEORGIA: RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS MUST GO: Georgias minister of foreign affairs announced Wednesday that his country is preparing revisions to the Dagomys Agreement, signed with South Ossetia in 1992, stipulating the introduction of Russian peacekeepers into the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone. The Georgian minister for conflict resolution said shortly after the first round of talks with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that the government hoped to begin revising the document as early as Aug. 17. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Russia, North Ossetia and South Ossetia, along with Georgia, would all have to agree before any changes were made. 


IZVESTIA
WHY DOES THE WEST LOVE GEORGIA?: Georgia is working on a new law on political extremism that would make any support for antigovernment activities a criminal offence. Georgias opposition is crying foul and Izvestia wonders why the West still considers Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvilis regime one of the most democratic post-Soviet countries. There are 30 lawsuits before the European Court of Human Rights against Georgia, and 60 percent of Georgian journalists think the countrys press is only partially free. Yet, the newspaper says, Georgia is the only post--Soviet republic that gets positive coverage from the American press.

KOMMERSANT
IMMIGRANT AMNESTY REJECTED: Russias ombudsman for human rights, Vladimir V. Lukin, on Wednesday proposed granting amnesty to illegal immigrants working in Russia, giving them immediate legal status. The Federal Immigration Service rejected the idea, saying that it would be better to wait until a new, more liberal immigration law comes into effect in Jan. 2007. Even representatives from Russias major diasporas criticized the idea, agreeing with the immigration service that the best solution is to wait until 2007.

NOVYE IZVESTIA
HOMELESS CHILDREN STILL A PROBLEM: According to official statistics, there are not more than 5,000 to 6,000 homeless children in Russia, which is about two times less than five years ago. By unofficial statistics, however, the total is just under one million. In 2002, the Russian government started a $200 million program to address the problem of homeless children. While the program has had some success removing children from the street, they often return after a short period of being shuffled from police departments to hospitals and social care facilities. Experts complain that current measures only superficially address child homelessness without taking into account deeper societal problems.

REPORT BLASTS GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO HATE CRIME: The Moscow Bureau for Human Rights released a statement on Wednesday criticizing the inaction of authorities in Moscow and St. Petersburg for not addressing adequately the recent surge in hate crimes. According to the report, a hate crime has been committed in Russia practically everyday this summer. The report praised a St. Petersburg program that has lowered the number of hate crimes in the city, but said that too few political leaders are aware of the problem.

VREMYA NOVOSTEI
BOUCHER VISITS TASHKENT: Richard Boucher, United States assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs visited with Uzbekistans foreign minister and President Islam A. Karimov on Wednesday in Tashkent. In a press conference after his meeting with Mr. Karimov, Mr. Boucher said that the United States hoped to establish a new basis for cooperation with Uzbekistan, but is still concerned about the human rights situation in the country. The United States, he said, wishes to continue working with Uzbekistan on combating terrorism, narcotics and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, as well as on business development.

VEDOMOSTI
HEZBOLLAH USING RUSSIAN WEAPONS?: Israel has accused Russia of selling weapons to Syria, which in turn sells them to Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon. Moscow has questioned the accuracy of Israels information, saying that Syria has agreed not to resell weapons without Russias permission. A former officer with the Russian Defense Ministry says that pictures taken recently of Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon indicate that they are using Soviet weapons given to Arab countries in the 1960s.

ROSSIISKAYA GAZETA
Due to its strengthening economy, Russia may no longer qualify for economic support under the Generalized System of Preferences, the United States State Department announced on Wednesday. Depriving Russia of duty-free exports into the United States may cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars. Though the United States denies it, many see political motivations behind the move, especially considering that only a few days ago, the United States levied sanctions against two major Russian weapons manufacturers for selling arms and supplies to Iran.

HEADLINE: For Bachelor Pads, New Heights 

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
PAUL BELOFF's two-bedroom apartment has everything that a 44-year-old bachelor could want. A custom-designed music system with hidden speakers. A leather couch and a leather rug. A considerable wine selection. And automatic window shades that close with the push of a button. There are also a gym and a bar just an elevator ride away, along with attentive servants who wash his clothes, prepare some meals and clean his home. 
 ''It took me 20 minutes to decide to live here,'' said Mr. Beloff, an international hedge-fund manager who bought his $1.37 million apartment at the Four Seasons Residences in Miami about two years ago, mainly for the hotel services that come with it. 
Before heading out to a club or a party, he said: ''People usually come to my place. If I need ice, I just pick up the phone and say: 'Send me ice. Send me stirrers.' And boom, the ice arrives.'' 
 Single men like Mr. Beloff are falling in love with condo-hotels, apartments sold as condominiums but managed by hotels. Executives with Vail Resorts Lodging Company, a Colorado company that manages condominium resorts in six states, say they have seen a steady increase in the number of single buyers under 40. Although single women are buying into the same buildings, companies say, the majority of purchases are made by bachelors. 
 Executives with a range of condo-hotels confirm the trend. More than two-thirds of the first 500 condominium buyers at the W Las Vegas Hotel, Casino and Residences, scheduled to open in 2009, are single and predominantly male. At the Regent South Beach in Miami, a luxury condo-hotel opening in October with hot tubs on the balconies of almost half of its units, 80 percent of buyers are single men. And at the Four Seasons Residences in Miami, about 40 percent of condo owners are single and most of them are male.
 The upswing in single men, developers say, is partly caused by lower interest rates that have made home ownership an attractive option for a younger segment of the well-off. And, in some ways, singles at condominium hotels are a natural. Many have rooms the size of average hotel rooms or suites, which aren't particularly conducive to family living. 
 But it's also the draw of hotel services, like 24-hour room service and regular housekeeping, that appeal to bachelors. Not to mention a fresh set of transient guests in constant circulation by the pool or at the hotel bar, just an elevator ride away. 
 ''With the clientele and people that come through it, I think it's like a networking opportunity for meeting other professionals,'' said Mike Abramowitz, 37, a real estate investor who bought a one-bedroom unit by the pool at the Regent South Beach as a part-time crash pad and investment. Trying to bank on this trend, some condominium hotels are now marketing specifically to single guys. 
 The Four Seasons Residences in Miami recently overhauled its print ad campaign to feature single men. One ad shows a well-tanned guy holding a drink in front of the hotel tower. The text says: ''Sometimes after work I head out to the wading pool, watch the sunset and call my friends up North -- ask if it's snowing. Dave, who works the bar, brings over a vodka tonic like clockwork, and sees if I want the usual. Steak, medium rare. Fries, well done.''
 ''This is who we feel our core market is,'' said Matthew Hall, vice president of sales and marketing for the Four Seasons Residences in Miami. ''There's one gentleman who has lived here for a year and half, and he doesn't own a knife or a fork or plates.'' Instead, he orders room service for every meal, Mr. Hall said. ''These young people,'' he added, ''they've been brought up in an environment that it's not naughty to do it. It's something they're used to.'' Such service doesn't come cheap, of course. A 1,114-square-foot one-bedroom at the Four Seasons Residences starts at $845,000 with $660 a month in maintenance fees. Studio apartments at the W Las Vegas begin at $650,000 with maintenance fees starting at $388 a month. 
 ''When you're buying into a condo-hotel, you're really buying into a life style,'' said Elliot Karathanasis, the senior vice president for residential sales and marketing at the W Las Vegas, where the pool area is modeled on the cafes and nightclubs of the meatpacking district in Manhattan. ''The way we position our product in this marketplace is for folks that don't want the Bellagio or Four Seasons. They want something a bit hipper, a bit cooler.''
 IN an effort to bolster its cool factor and attract singles, the Royal Palm Resort in Miami Beach has entered a partnership with the men's magazine Maxim as it converts 165 hotel rooms into condominium units. As part of the deal, Rande Gerber, a nightlife impresario known for his Whiskey Bars at the W Hotels, is creating the first Maxim Lounge, which is scheduled to open at the resort by Jan. 1. The lounge will be the social hub of the resort with a ''Kid Rock-Meets-Gucci'' style, according to a news release. Condominium owners will receive V.I.P. entrance cards to the lounge and access to some Maxim parties held there.
 Not unlike many a bachelor's attempts to attract a mate, however, the marketing meant to lure single men doesn't always work as planned. The Four Seasons Residences in Miami, for example, recently hired an interior designer to create fully furnished bachelor pads decorated in dark woods and outfitted with guy-friendly features like flat-screen televisions and a wet bar. The first one sold to a woman from Spain.

HEADLINE: A Brief Recovery and Now This

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Jeremy W. Peters, Jane L. Levere and Joe Sharkey contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
This was to be the summer the airlines were going to put 9/11 and its aftershocks firmly behind them. 
 And it seemed to be working: fares were up, planes were full -- albeit to passengers' discomfort -- and the airlines were making money again. The industry just reported surprisingly strong second-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, its best showing in six years, after losing $40 billion since the 2001 terrorist attacks.
Now this.
 The foiled terrorist plot in London that aimed at American carriers throws into doubt whether the airline industry will be able to continue its nascent recovery. Aviation experts said yesterday that it was too early to tell the lasting effects of the new threat, but they say the industry is unlikely to escape completely unscathed. 
 If travelers take fewer trips -- out of fear, or an unwillingness to endure the frustrations of tighter security -- then the airlines could see an end to what has been a very short flight to prosperity. Oil prices dropped modestly yesterday, but their recent climb has also pressured airline finances. 
 The best the industry can hope for is that new security measures take effect with minimal fuss from passengers, and that travelers keep flying, meaning the crisis will pass with little damage beyond rattled nerves and a raft of canceled flights late in the summer travel season. 
 ''The challenge is to deal with this latest concern without tangling up the industry and still convincing people they're safe,'' said Jan K. Brueckner, a professor of economics at the University of California, Irvine.
 Shares of airline stocks either held steady or fell minimally yesterday. 
 Some airlines are permitting travelers booked on flights to or from Britain to make changes on what would otherwise be nonrefundable tickets. 
 Many are allowing passengers who have booked London flights over the next several weeks to rebook without penalty. 
 United and American are giving customers with reservations from today through Sept. 1, the option of rescheduling without penalty; British Airways was making a similar accommodation for passengers booked anytime before Dec. 1. 
 Airlines are also waiving restrictions like blackout dates and minimum-stay requirements to accommodate customers with disrupted travel plans. 
 Mike Boyd, president of the Boyd Group, an aviation consulting and research firm, said the cost of rebooking and reimbursing passengers would be a problem for airlines like American, Continental and United that have numerous London routes. 
 For some airlines, the costs threaten to tip the scales from profit to loss, he said. ''It's a burden on the airlines,'' Mr. Boyd added. ''This could put them below the line, and we don't need that right now."
 Travel agents and airlines reported few cancellations yesterday, however. American, the nation's largest carrier, said that a small number of passengers had canceled flights. 
 Altour, a travel agency based in New York, said only 3 of its 50 to 60 clients who were scheduled to fly to London yesterday had postponed their trips. ''People are waiting a little for the dust to settle,'' said Alexandre Chemla, the agency's chief executive. He said his business yesterday was ''as normal as any other day.''
 Air travel, however, was not. Even in a summer marred by frequent delays, yesterday's backups were notable, especially at airports with large amounts of international traffic.
 At Newark Liberty International, only 29 percent of flights had taken off on time by late afternoon, according to Flight Stats, an aviation statistics firm based in Portland, Ore. At Kennedy International, only 36 percent of flights left on time, compared with 73 percent on Wednesday. At O'Hare International in Chicago, only 42 percent of flights had departed on time by midafternoon.
 Industrywide, airlines reported that 41 percent to 62 percent of flights had departed on time as of 5 p.m. yesterday, according to Flight Stats. The normal rate is typically 80 percent or higher. 
 Hundreds of flights were canceled across Europe yesterday.
 The new security restrictions were likely to hurt airport retailers, which have built a business lately on selling water, snacks and meals for passengers to bring on board. While food will still be allowed, travelers will have to rely on the airlines for beverages, one of the last free offerings by some of the major carriers. 
 Business could turn worse for duty-free shops, which specialize in sales of liquor and other luxury goods.
 Michael Payne, executive director of the International Association of Airport Duty Free Stores, a trade association, said airports in the New York area, Miami and Chicago stopped selling liquor and perfume yesterday after the new security requirements were issued. 
 Mr. Payne said it was still unclear if liquid products purchased at duty-free stores behind the security checkpoints would be allowed as carry-on items on flights. Duty-free stores were awaiting word from the Transportation Security Administration on how the new guidelines would affect them. ''It's still very much an evolving story for us,'' he said.
 If travelers start avoiding the skies -- staying at home or taking to the road instead -- airlines may use two weapons to lure them back, namely fare cuts and offers of extra frequent-flier miles. They have used both before in times of financial difficulties and security concerns, like the period after the September 2001 attacks and after filing for bankruptcy, as six major airlines have done this decade.
 ''Anything that is discouraging to travel, all other things being equal, will put downward pressure on fares,'' said Bob Harrell, an industry consultant with Harrell Associates in New York.
 Fare cuts would clearly hurt the industry's thin profits. They represent a new concern to add to a list that includes fuel prices and a softening economy. ''Security was not the foremost concern they had at this point,'' said Philip A. Baggaley, an airline industry analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 The discovery of the threat would have been far worse for the airlines if it had occurred earlier in the summer. The peak season for travel at home and abroad is nearly over. Summer family vacations in many parts of the country end by mid-August because children must go back to school.
 But the fact that the threat involved American carriers serving London is particularly bad news for the big airlines, given the emphasis they have placed this year on international service. Over all, airlines carried 34.9 million passengers on international flights from the United States in the first five months of 2006, compared with 33 million in the period last year.
 Delta Air Lines, in fact, had made new international routes a linchpin of its efforts to restructure after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year. And flights between Heathrow Airport, outside London, and the United States are critical to United Airlines, which finally emerged from a lengthy stay in bankruptcy this year.
 American Airlines, one of the other carriers allowed to serve Heathrow under an international treaty, has been trumpeting its profitability and its having avoided slipping into court-ordered restructuring. Those airlines are in danger of being hurt the most if post-threat international travel slips.
 The impact on travelers' psyches is uncertain. Mr. Chemla at Altour said he believed that fliers had become inured to security threats. ''Unfortunately, people are getting used to this kind of situation, so they don't panic as in the past,'' he said.
 Professor Brueckner said the only situation similar to the London threat was the 2001 incident involving Richard Reid, known as the ''shoe bomber'' who stuffed explosives in his sneakers and tried to light them aboard a flight over the Atlantic.
 Mr. Reid did board a plane; in the London case, the authorities say the plot was foiled before any suspected participants set off on flights. Still, Mr. Reid's attempt, in the end, did not cause passengers much disruption, Professor Brueckner said.
 ''What did the shoe bomber lead to? People taking off their shoes and having shoes looked at in security lines.'' He continued: ''Maybe the carriers will be fine, maybe this will last for a week.''
 Anthony Sabino, a professor of law and business at St. John's University in Queens, said travelers have ''learned to live'' with the prospect of terrorism. 
 He predicted that demand for trans-Atlantic travel would rebound quickly from this week's disruptions. ''Expect some frayed tempers but no serious dropoff in bookings,'' he said. He added, ''People will not flock to cruise ships to cross the Atlantic.''

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrowed In June

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The trade deficit may have bottomed out.
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the deficit in the nation's trade of goods and services reached $64.8 billion in June, modestly below the $65 billion deficit recorded for May.
This suggested that the slowing economy in the United States and the weaker dollar, combined with faster economic growth overseas, were gradually reining in America's gaping imbalance in commerce with the rest of the world. 
 Although May's reported deficit was revised upward from a previous estimate of $63.8 billion, economists said the data suggested the imbalance had stabilized since it hit a peak of $66.6 billion last October. 
 ''It does look like the Queen Mary is turning,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at the forecasting company Global Insight.
 Yet even though the changing pattern of global economic growth would favor further declines in America's trade deficit, two obstacles stand in the way. Persistently high oil prices will keep adding to the nation's import bill in months to come. Moreover, policies in many developing countries -- most notably China -- have kept their exchange rates from rising against the dollar. 
 ''We are seeing an improvement in the deficit against the developed world primarily because we have currency moves there,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. ''But we have had virtually no currency change against the developing world.''
 The nation's trade deficit with the European Union retreated by $1.8 billion in June, to $9 billion. With Japan, the deficit declined by about $150 million, to $7 billion. 
 Meanwhile, the trade deficit with China increased by $2 billion, to $19.7 billion, as exports fell by $200 million while imports rose by $1.8 billion. America's trade deficit with Mexico, its fourth-largest trading partner, increased by about $600 million, to $6 billion. 
 With Congress in recess, the new trade data did not immediately set off calls for retaliation against China. Still, demands are likely to increase in the United States for China to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate significantly.
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has taken a less confrontational approach to China than his predecessor in pushing for a revaluation of the yuan. But Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, continue to threaten legislation to impose trade penalties on China if it does not allow its currency to rise more against the dollar. 
 The combination of lower economic growth in the United States and faster growth among major industrial nations in Europe and Asia should narrow the American deficit further as consumers and businesses abroad buy more American exports while American spending slows. 
 Expected changes in interest rates should contribute to this adjustment. The dollar is expected to weaken if the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates in the United States while other major central banks continue to tighten monetary policy. 
 This would make American exports cheaper and more competitive in foreign markets, and at the same time increase the prices of foreign-made products and services in the American market.
 An improving trade balance, in turn, would add to economic growth. In the second quarter of the year, trade accounted for 0.33 percentage points of the nation's 2.5 percent rate of expansion, the first time it made a positive contribution since the second quarter of 2005.
 ''As growth continues to moderate, it will take pressure off the trade deficit,'' said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York. ''As the dollar weakens, it will also take pressure off. If the process is gradual over the course of the next 12 to 18 months we could really have a nice soft landing for the United States and the global economy.'' 
 Japan, in particular, could provide an exceptional opportunity for American exports, as it emerges from a 15-year economic slump. Moreover, while the dollar has already depreciated substantially against the euro and thus has less room to decline further, there is ample scope for the dollar to fall against the yen. 
 The trade improvement in July was driven by a $2.4 billion increase in exports, to $120.7 billion, because of rising exports of computer parts, airplane parts and other types of capital equipment and industrial supplies. 
 But imports also rose by $2.2 billion, to $185.5 billion, as Americans gorged on imported consumer goods and foreign automakers building in America, like Toyota, stepped up imports of engines and other parts to satisfy the growing demand for their cars in the United States.
 Energy actually helped improve the trade balance in June. Imports of energy products declined by $1.3 billion in the month, as more of the refining capacity that was knocked out of commission in the hurricane season last year was brought back online, depressing demand for imported refined products. 
 But oil has been a substantial contributor to the deficit. In the first six months of the year, the overall trade deficit increased by about $47.5 billion compared with the same period of 2005. Of that amount, $37 billion represented rising imports of petroleum products, driven by the surging price of oil.
 As Mr. Paulsen points out, this provides some ground for optimism. If oil prices stabilize or even retreat, the trade deficit could start shrinking more substantially next year, adding a dollop to economic growth.

HEADLINE: Despite Terror Plot, Shares Rise on Oil and Earnings 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street withstood the news of a terror plot aimed at commercial airlines yesterday, with stocks gaining on strong corporate earnings reports and a sharp decline in oil prices.
 European markets tumbled as British authorities said 24 people had been arrested in a widespread plan to destroy many international flights, and the United States raised its terror alert to the highest level ever for air travelers. But while United States and international airline stocks fell as a result, strong earnings reports from a Dow component, the American International Group, and others provided support.
Wall Street also benefited from lower crude oil prices, which fell on the belief that reduced travel in the coming weeks and months would curtail demand for fuels. A barrel of light crude oil settled at $74, down $2.35, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 ''With the whole issue of what's happening in London, we could have seen a major sell-off, but we didn't,'' said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons. ''All these things that have happened lately, with inflation and interest rates and oil, you'd think the market would have had a really difficult time with that. But there's some upside here.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 48.19 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 11,124.37. Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.86, or 0.5 percent, to 1,271.81, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 11.46, or 0.6 percent, to 2,071.74.
 In Europe, the FTSE 100 in Britain slid 0.6 percent, the DAX index in Germany tumbled 1.3 percent, and the CAC-40 in France fell 1 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei stock average slipped 0.2 percent.
 Bonds were steady in listless trading, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note auctioned on Wednesday falling 3/32, to 99 17/32, and the yield unchanged at 4.93 percent. The dollar was mixed against most major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 In economic news, the nation's trade deficit slipped 0.3 percent in June as a result of strong sales abroad, while first-time jobless claims edged higher last week. The trade data showed economic strength, which could spur inflation and higher interest rates, while the unemployment report showed a slowing economy, which ought to help reduce inflation risk. Such conflicting data has been a hallmark of the economy in the last few months, giving Wall Street little direction.
 Airlines suffered as a result of flight cancellations and concerns about future terrorist attacks. British Airways fell $2.85, to $70.48, as it took the brunt of the cancellations out of Europe. Among domestic airlines, Continental Airlines fell 35 cents, to $23.86, and United Airlines' parent, UAL, slid 31 cents, to $23.52.
 Most of the terror-related selling was limited to the airlines, and even the hardest-hit stocks recouped some of their early losses by the close.
 ''Yes, you're seeing weakness in airline stocks, but ultimately, and I don't mean to sound cold-hearted, these terror arrests are not an important economic or financial event, and I think the market reflects that,'' said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. ''It's a piece of the puzzle, but it's a small piece. Oil prices, earnings, those are much bigger pieces.''
 American International, the insurance company, rose $1.83, to $60.32, after posting a profit that beat Wall Street forecasts.
 Viacom's acquisition of the DreamWorks live-action film studio helped it post strong results that beat analysts' expectations by 4 cents a share before one-time items. Viacom gained $3.28, to $37.03.
 The retailer Target rose $2.44, to $47.72, on a 13 percent increase in quarterly profit. Target said increased sales at existing stores and a strong credit card business fed its results.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 29 1/2-year Treasury bonds:



 (000 omitted in dollar figures)	 	High Price	91.181	High Yield	5.080	Low Yield	4.990	Median Yield	5.039	Total applied for	$19,278,003	Accepted	$11,556,625	Noncompetitive	$18,766	Interest set at	4 1/2

Britain Thwarts Plot To Blow Up Flights to U.S.
British authorities said they had thwarted an advanced terrorist plot to blow up airplanes flying from Britain to the United States using liquid explosives that would have escaped airport security. A1

Counterterrorism officials said the sophistication of the scheme could mean that Al Qaeda was behind it and was still able to direct attacks. But some specialists said that if homegrown British jihadists had conceived a plot of such ambition, it might hold even graver implications for the future. A1

Despite knowing for years that liquid explosives posed a threat to airline safety, security agencies have made little progress in deploying technology that could help defend against such attacks, experts say. 
 A1

The Department of Homeland Security banned all liquids and gels, from water to common toiletries like contact-lens solution and toothpaste, from carry-on luggage aboard airplanes. A9

Israel Presses U.S. for Rockets
Israel has asked the Bush administration to speed delivery of short-range anti-personnel rockets armed with cluster munitions, which it could use to strike Hezbollah missile sites in Lebanon, according to two American officials. A1

Israel warned residents of southern Beirut to evacuate their homes, even as Israel held off expanding its military operation while diplomats negotiated a United Nations resolution to halt the fighting. A10

Bomber Kills 35 at Shiite Shrine
A belt packed with explosives worn by a man who apparently intended to blow himself up inside one of the holiest shrines of Shiite Islam in Iraq, exploded at a police checkpoint near the shrine, Iraqi officials said. At least 35 people were killed and more than 120 others were wounded. A3

Typhoon Kills 83 in China
The most powerful typhoon to hit China in five decades raged across its southeastern coast, claiming at least 83 lives and forcing 1.5 million people from their homes, the official New China News Agency reported. A3

3 to Be Executed in Indonesia
Three men convicted in connection with riots that killed more than 200 people are to be executed tomorrow, Indonesian officials said, in a case that has been marred by questions and become embroiled in the country's sectarian politics. A3

Heat Toll in California Is Highest Since 1950's
Roughly 140 Californians died of a heat stroke in last month's heat wave, a death toll unlike the state had seen from high temperatures since 1955, state officials said. A1

Debate Over Barrier for Bridge
The Golden Gate bridge is one of the world's most popular suicide sites and after decades of debate the board of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, has taken a step toward creating a barrier. A11

A Look at Immigration and Jobs
A study by the Pew Hispanic Center found that there was no evidence to support claims that the millions of foreigners who have come to the United States in the last decade have taken jobs from American workers. A12

Lobbyists' Case Not Dismissed
The government's case charging two former pro-Israel lobbyists with improperly receiving and transmitting secret national security information cleared a hurdle when a judge ruled that the sections of the Espionage Act prohibiting such activity were not unconstitutionally vague. A11

Union Seeks to Build Muscle
The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees announced plans to spend $60 million more a year to campaign for universal health coverage, to unionize 70,000 workers annually and to register 280,000 union members to vote. A12

HEADLINE: The Morning After the Morning After

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
With every war there are two days to keep in mind when the guns fall silent: the morning after, and the morning after the morning after. America, Israel and all those who want to see Lebanon's democracy revived need to keep their eyes focused on the morning after the morning after.
 Here's why. 
 The only way that the fighting in south Lebanon will be brought to a close is if all the parties accept a cease-fire and the imposition of a robust international peacekeeping force, led by France, along the Israel-Lebanon border -- supplanting Hezbollah. 
 The morning after that cease-fire goes into effect, everyone knows what will happen: Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah -- no matter how battered his forces and how much damage his reckless war has visited on Lebanon -- will crawl out of his bunker and declare a ''great victory.'' Hezbollah, he will say, fought the Israeli Army to a standstill inside Lebanon and rained rockets on northern Israel. Meanwhile, military analysts everywhere will write that Israel has ''lost its deterrence'' vis-a-vis Arab forces, and blah, blah, blah.
 Sorry, been there, heard that, and I don't buy it. What matters in war, alas, is the balance of destruction on the ground and the political weight it exerts over time.
 On the morning after the morning after, Lebanese war refugees, who had real jobs and homes, will start streaming back by the hundreds of thousands, many of them Shiites. Tragically, they will find their homes or businesses badly damaged or obliterated. Yes, they will curse Israel. But they and other Arabs will also start asking Nasrallah publicly what many are already asking privately: 
 ''What was this war all about? What did we get from this and at what price? Israel has some roofs to repair and some dead to bury. But its economy and state are fully intact, and it will recover quickly. We Lebanese have been set back by a decade. Our economy and our democracy lie in ruins, like our homes. For what? For a one-week boost in 'Arab honor'? So that Iran could distract the world's attention from its nuclear program? You did all this to us for another country?'' 
 As Michael Young, opinion editor of The Beirut Daily Star, put it in an article in Slate: ''Hezbollah's test will be to rapidly alleviate the suffering in its own community and, therefore, avoid losing its base. The party still has substantial backing among its co-religionists, and it is not about to see this disappear. But soon the fate of the hundreds of thousands of Shiites now living in schools, tent cities, and even public parks will be an overriding concern for Nasrallah. Many have fled areas partly or wholly destroyed, to which they might not return for months or years. Hezbollah will have to provide funding for reconstruction and rehabilitation that is likely to run into the billions of dollars. The party will have a monumental task to revive not only Shiite morale but confidence that Hezbollah can take care of its own. Even the party's most optimistic interpretation of the current war -- that it is a heroic achievement -- will not spare it having to tiptoe very carefully through Shiite trauma.''
 Moreover, if and when a French-led international force is placed along the Israel-Lebanon border, it will be a big loss for Hezbollah. The Shiite militia will no longer be able to directly touch Israel and start a war for Iran or Syria whenever it chooses. And, if Hezbollah tried to lob missiles over the peacekeeping zone, or penetrate it, it would clash with forces from France, Italy and Turkey, the likely peacekeepers. That means Hezbollah, Iran and Syria would not be able to hurt Israel without also hurting their own relations with the European Union. 
 Israel needs to keep its eyes on the prize. It's already inflicted enormous damage on Hezbollah and its community, but Nasrallah will only have to pay the full price for inviting all that destruction once the guns fall silent on the morning after the morning after. So let's get there as soon as possible. That will deter him. What would deter him even more, though, would be if the U.N. would go ahead and impose sanctions on Iran for its illicit nuclear bomb program. After all, it was Iran, Nasrallah's master, that ordered up this war to distract the U.N. from doing just that. It would be nice to say to Iran: You ravaged Hezbollah for nothing.
 Beyond those two limited objectives, there's no storybook ending for Israel in Lebanon, and it shouldn't throw more good lives after some elusive knockout blow. It's just not that kind of neighborhood. As they say in the movies, ''Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.''

HEADLINE: Immigration And Jobs Link Is Disputed

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
In the furious debate over immigration, advocates of reducing the inflow have argued that the millions of foreigners who came to the United States in the last decade took jobs from American workers. But a study released yesterday by the Pew Hispanic Center found that there was no evidence to support that claim for the country as a whole. 
 The study, based on Census Bureau data, found that 14 states with high immigration rates after 1990, including Texas, Nevada and Georgia, also had higher-than-average employment rates for American-born workers. Those 14 states accounted for 24 percent of American workers.
 But in eight states that had big increases in immigrants in the same period, among them Arizona and Tennessee, employment rates for American workers were below average. Those states were home to 15 percent of American workers. 
 The study concluded that there was no consistent link between surging growth in immigration and declines in employment for Americans. 
 ''We find no pattern,'' Rakesh Kochhar, the author of the study, said. ''We cannot say with certainty that the growth of the foreign-born population has either hurt or helped native-born workers.''
 Even in the recession and slow recovery since 2001, there was no consistent pattern to show that increases in immigration hurt the job prospects of American workers across the country, the study found. 
 Instead, Mr. Kochhar said, the pace of economic growth in a state was more likely to determine whether American workers lost out in competition with immigrants. The study did not address the impact of immigration on wages. 
 The Pew Hispanic Center is a nonpartisan research organization in Washington that does not make policy recommendations. In the study, Mr. Kochhar looked at census data from 1990, 2000 and 2004 to chart the increase in immigrant populations in the states and the employment of American-born workers in 2000 and 2004. 
 The study confirmed that the boom of the 90's brought surges in immigration to states that had not seen such intense flows, including Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina where immigrant populations increased more than 200 percent. 
 From 2000 to 2004, the study found, increases in immigrants coincided with high employment rates for American workers in 27 states and the District of Columbia, which encompassed 67 percent of workers born in the United States. 
 ''The findings are entirely plausible, contradicting a notion that immigrants are broadly hurting native-born workers,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, a nonpartisan group that focuses on low-wage workers. But Mr. Bernstein cautioned against minimizing the impact on Americans who did face a struggle against foreign workers. 
 ''There certainly are places in this country where native-born workers are hurt by immigrant competition,'' he said. ''The fact that it doesn't hurt in a national sense should not lead us to dismiss local problems.''

HEADLINE: Federal Panel Hammers Out Report on Recommendations to Shake Up Higher Education

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
A federal commission approved a final report on Thursday that urges a broad shake-up of American higher education. It calls for public universities to measure learning with standardized tests, federal monitoring of college quality and sweeping changes in financial aid.
 The panel also called on policy makers and leaders in higher education to find new ways to control costs, saying college tuition should grow no faster than median family income, although it opposed price controls. 
The report recommended bolstering Pell grants, the basic building block of federal student aid, by making the program cover a larger percentage of public college tuition. That proposal could cost billions of dollars.
 Eighteen of the 19 members of the panel, the Commission on the Future of Higher Education, voted to sign the report, which attacked increasing tuition costs and pointed to signs of complacency on some campuses. David Ward, who as president of the largest association of colleges and universities was the most powerful representative of the higher education establishment on the commission, refused to sign. 
 Calling the report ''a shot across the bow,'' Dr. Ward said that academia would take it seriously, but that he wanted to remain ''free to contest'' it. Several proposals, including those on testing and financial aid, aroused fierce opposition from university leaders and at points divided the panel. 
 The chairman, Charles Miller, an investor and a former chairman of the University of Texas Regents, had hoped to turn out a punchy report that would rattle academia with warnings of crisis.
 But in the last six weeks, the commission issued six drafts, watering down passages that had drawn criticism and eliminating one this week, written by Mr. Miller, that had encouraged expanding private loans as a share of student financial aid. 
 A proposal on standardized tests was also weakened at the last moment. Previous drafts said that ''states should require'' public universities to use standardized test, but the final version said simply that universities ''should measure student learning'' with standardized tests. 
 All the panel members who participated in a meeting on Thursday at the Education Department headquarters here expressed unanimity on some points, including that the report correctly identified critical challenges like increasing access to higher education for poor students and holding institutions more accountable for students who drop out or graduate with few skills.
 The members seemed at odds on how to carry their recommendations forward. Some, like former Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, called on President Bush to incorporate them in the Congressional agenda. 
 Mr. Miller said the next step should be more ''national dialogue'' with governors and corporate leaders. He seemed upset by what he characterized as wrangling with representatives of the status quo. 
 ''You can't act on the recommendations today because you encounter one set of defenders and then behind them another set of defenders, and you get into all these battles,'' he told reporters after the panel voted.
 Education Secretary Margaret Spellings established the panel a year ago, drawing members from sectors of higher education like community colleges, for-profit trade schools, liberal arts colleges and large research universities, public and private, as well as from the ranks of executives at I.B.M., Boeing, Microsoft and other businesses.
 The commission was created at a time of increasing tuitions. From 1999 to 2004, median family income grew 13 percent and average tuition 38 percent, according to federal data cited in an interview by Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economist on the commission.
 Ms. Spellings urged the group to examine access, affordability and accountability, to determine whether colleges were turning out students qualified to compete in the global economy. The answer in too many cases, the panel said, is that they are not.
 ''Too many Americans just aren't getting the education that they need,'' the report said. ''There are disturbing signs that many students who do earn degrees have not actually mastered the reading, writing and thinking skills we expect of college graduates.''
 A spokeswoman for Ms. Spellings, Katherine McLane, said, ''The commission has made bold recommendations on improving the accessibility and affordability of higher education, to which the secretary intends to give very serious consideration.''
 One recommendation that won broad support was for changing immigration laws to help foreign scientists who graduate from American universities obtain green cards.
 Dr. Ward's organization, the American Council on Education, is the major coordinating body for all higher education institutions, public and private. Leaders of some of the associations that belong to the council, like the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and the American Association of Community Colleges, embraced the report as a helpful statement of priorities. 
 Other important groups in the council issued withering critiques.
 The Association of American Universities, which represents 60 top research universities, noted that the report ''deals almost exclusively with undergraduate education.'' 
 Robert M. Berdahl, a former chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is president of the universities association, said, ''What is needed is something much richer, with a more nuanced understanding of the educational engagement and how it is undertaken.'' said 
 Another council member, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents 900 private institutions including liberal arts colleges, major research universities and church- and other faith-related colleges, attacked the recommendation to develop a national database to follow individual students' progress as a way of holding colleges accountable for students' success. 
 The association called the proposal a dangerous intrusion on privacy, saying, ''Our members find this idea chilling.'' 
 Several groups said the report spent much ink discussing increases in students' work skills, while slighting the mission of colleges and universities to educate students as citizens.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Washington: Deficit Is Running Below Last Year's Pace 

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The federal deficit through June is running below last year's pace, helped by strong growth in revenues, the Treasury Department said. Through the first 10 months of this budget year, the deficit totaled $239.7 billion, an improvement of 20.8 percent from the same period a year ago, when the deficit totaled $302.8 billion. The deficit in July totaled $33.2 billion, down from $53.4 billion in July 2005. The Bush administration is now forecasting that the deficit for the 2006 budget year, which ends Sept. 30, will total $296 billion, an improvement from the $423 billion deficit it forecast in February.

HEADLINE: Catskill Resort Proposal Is Criticized by Comptroller, Who Says Developer Understated Risks 

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
A proposal for a 1,960-acre resort in the Catskills, which has worried environmentalists and elected officials, came under fire from the New York State comptroller yesterday in a report that said the developer understated both the project's environmental impact and its economic risks. 
 The project, known as Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park, consists of two luxury hotels, two golf courses and hundreds of units of housing in the midst of New York City's watershed about 125 miles north of Manhattan. The proposal is wending its way through the state's environmental review process. 
Last fall, an administrative law judge for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation decided that 12 issues required further study after two years of hearings and a 6,720-page environmental impact statement. The process is on hold as the developer, Crossroads Ventures, appeals the decision.
 The report from the comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said the developer's economic analysis was based on faulty assumptions about profitability and comparable developments.
 In a statement with the report, the comptroller's office said that the developer had overstated the income the project would need in order to be profitable. ''In this case,'' the report said, ''an analysis that overstates required income artificially supports a larger-scale project.'' 
 The report also highlighted the project's potential risk to the environment, specifically the New York City watershed. The water in the Catskill reservoirs is so pure that the city has an exemption from federal laws requiring drinking water to be filtered. But the Environmental Protection Agency is reviewing that status. If the city loses the exemption, it could be forced to build a $9 billion filtration plant.
 ''The Belleayre project ignores this filtration avoidance determination,'' the report said, ''and threatens to expose the city to huge additional capital expenses at a time when the costs of maintaining and repairing the existing water supply system are becoming more burdensome.''
 A spokesman for Crossroads Ventures criticized the report, saying that Mr. Hevesi had not sought comment from the company. ''We're disappointed that we weren't contacted directly by the comptroller's office where we could have addressed many of these issues,'' said Paul Rakov, vice president for public affairs at Crossroads Ventures, in Shandaken, N.Y. 
 Alan J. Steinberg, the E.P.A.'s regional administrator, recently sent a letter to members of New York City's Congressional delegation, reiterating his concerns about the Belleayre project. Mr. Steinberg wrote that the agency supported changes to the proposal to eliminate development from the more environmentally fragile eastern portion of the property, an idea advocated by Representative Maurice Hinchey, who represents the area.
 Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the E.P.A. letter and the comptroller's report ''a major one-two blow to this project in anything like its current state.''
 But in a phone interview on Thursday, Mr. Steinberg said that he had since been contacted by the developer, who indicated that it was putting together a new proposal that would reduce the impact of development on the eastern site. Mr. Rakov, of Crossroads Ventures, confirmed that the company was scaling back the development. The E.P.A.'s support of the project is considered critical because the agency holds the key to the city's filtration exemption.
 ''Before I would be willing to consider such a proposal, I would have to consider its impact on turbidity,'' Mr. Steinberg said.

HEADLINE: Quandary for Office Tenants: Downtown or Jersey City? 

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The developer Larry A. Silverstein has been betting that tenants for the new office towers at ground zero will finally come knocking on his doors when space gets tight in Midtown and rents soar to unprecedented levels.
 Indeed, after largely ignoring his newly built skyscraper at 7 World Trade Center for two years, tenants like Moody's Investors Service; Mansueto Ventures, a business magazine publisher; and Darby & Darby, a law firm, have suddenly started leasing space there that would bring hundreds of workers downtown.
But leasing is also getting hot again one mile to the west, in Jersey City, where a forest of office towers grew up on the waterfront in the 1990's as companies fled the higher costs of Manhattan. 
 Citigroup, which announced two years ago that it was moving 1,600 workers to western New Jersey from downtown, just signed a lease that would send another 1,200 high-paying executives from Lower Manhattan to the Newport complex in Jersey City. Deutsche Bank is nearing completion of a deal to move 1,200 workers to the Harborside complex in Jersey City from Manhattan.
 Until recently, the percentage of vacant offices in Jersey City languished in the double digits, refusing to budge. So most developers scurried to erect condominium towers. But after word of Citigroup's possible move to Jersey City first surfaced three months ago, the level of interest in the New Jersey waterfront by New York-based companies has jumped to the point where the developer Richard Lefrak is considering building his eighth office tower in Jersey City, at a site now earmarked for residential development.
 ''There's a lot of activity on the waterfront,'' said Mitchell E. Hersh, chief executive of Mack-Cali Realty, which owns the Harborside complex and is negotiating with Deutsche Bank. ''Rents here are roughly half of what they are in Midtown. We're seeing a lot of interest, corporate expansions as well as financial services.''
 The moves by Citigroup and Deutsche Bank are only the latest illustrations of the difficulty of retaining jobs in New York City and rebuilding the business district in Lower Manhattan. Increasingly since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, financial institutions and other companies have sought to decentralize. And with rents rising again in Manhattan, there is an economic incentive to relocate at least technical jobs to less-expensive places.
 In the past, the battle for jobs has often led to border wars, as New Jersey offered sizable subsidies to lure companies across the Hudson and New York countered with tax breaks of its own to keep the companies in place. Many economists condemned the strategy as self-defeating for both sides.
 Eric J. Deutsch, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business group, said that demand was still growing downtown, especially since rents in some prime Midtown buildings have climbed above $100 per square foot a year. In the last 18 months, he said, companies from outside Lower Manhattan have leased 1.5 million square feet of space downtown. In addition, Royal Bank of Canada, the AIG insurance company and Legg Mason, the brokerage firm, are all about to sign leases for some of the large blocks of downtown space.
 To retain jobs and handle growth, he said, there is a need for more new buildings. ''While the New Jersey waterfront will always be a lower-cost alternative,'' Mr. Deutsch added, ''Lower Manhattan is the ideal location and a better value for tenants who want to be in New York City.''
 There are four new towers planned for ground zero, with 8.8 million square feet of space, and they face a lot of competition from New Jersey, which offers even larger tax breaks and other subsidies than a tenant can get downtown. 
 The lure of lower costs and tax breaks can be enticing, even to a company like Citigroup, whose chief executive, Charles Prince, is co-chairman of the Partnership for New York City, a civic group working to entice companies downtown. 
 After Citigroup announced in 2004 that it was sending 1,600 workers from Lower Manhattan to Warren, N.J., a spokeswoman vowed: ''We're keeping all our space in Lower Manhattan. We're not giving up an inch of space.''
 But now the bank has sold its building at 250 West Street and is moving the executives who worked there to Jersey City.
 The average rent downtown may be $38.57 a square foot per year, 35 percent cheaper than the Midtown average, according to CB Richard Ellis, a real estate broker. But the average on the Jersey waterfront is only $28.87 a square foot. And under New Jersey's Business Employment Incentive Program, Citigroup will get a tax rebate worth an estimated $37.1 million over 10 years and Deutsche Bank will get one worth about $22 million over the same time period.
 Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said yesterday that the bank remained the largest private employer in New York City. ''We expect to continue to add jobs here and to keep our headquarters here,'' she said.
 Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said that another border war would be unwise.
 ''What's important to New York is that these jobs remain within our regional economy,'' she said. ''We're long past days where New Jersey is the enemy. It's more important that these jobs don't move to Maryland, Tampa or India.''

HEADLINE: Economy Often Defies Soft Landing

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
In the cool and quiet marble corridors of the Federal Reserve, the strategy for taming inflation sounds painless, even soothing: a ''soft landing'' for the economy after several years of flying high.
 As the central bank contended on Tuesday, when it decided to pause in its two-year effort to raise interest rates, inflation is ''elevated'' right now but will begin to decline because economic growth is poised for a modest slowdown.
Many economists, though, warn that the soft landing may seem anything but soft, and suggest that the Fed is either too rosy about the looming slowdown or naive about the difficulty of reaching its goal for inflation.
 In practice, the Fed has achieved only one true soft landing -- in 1994-95, when, under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, it was able to slow the economy enough to cool spending and ease inflation pressure but not so much as to cause a big jump in unemployment. But even Mr. Greenspan, whose ability to fine-tune policy made him famous, presided over two formal recessions, in 1991 and in 2001. 
 This time, many analysts say that the Fed and its new chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, face considerably tougher challenges. Crude oil, at more than $70 a barrel, is selling at prices that would have been unthinkable in 1995. Productivity growth, which was accelerating in 1995, is slowing these days. The dollar, which was climbing against other major currencies in 1995, is declining against most of them now.
 Analysts and other experts say that if Mr. Bernanke is serious about his goals for controlling inflation, at least two million more workers may have to lose their jobs over the next two years. 
 ''The economic slowdown has to be much more substantial than anybody in the Federal Reserve or on Wall Street is expecting,'' said Robert J. Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern University, who has analyzed the trade-off between inflation and unemployment for the last several decades.
 Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials say they want to keep core inflation, the main measure of retail prices excluding energy and food, below 2 percent a year. But core inflation is already 2.9 percent and almost certain to climb as the cost of oil pushes up prices for items as diverse as air fares and plastics.
 Mr. Gordon said the last few decades had shown a grim but consistent trade-off: to reduce inflation by one percentage point, the unemployment rate has to rise by about two percentage points for a full year.
 To reduce inflation to the upper limits of what Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials consider acceptable, more than three million jobs would be lost, a bigger drop than in the recession of 2001.
 And that is Mr. Gordon's relatively upbeat hypothesis, which assumes no other shocks to the economy -- no additional increases in energy prices, no collapse in the dollar's value, no collapse in housing.
 ''I think the Fed is facing an absolutely classic case of stagflation,'' Mr. Gordon said, ''a situation in which they cannot win.'' 
 He is not alone. Many other economists contend that inflation is more entrenched and will be more painful to reverse than the Fed thinks. Others predict that inflation will indeed subside, but only because the economy will weaken much more than the Fed is expecting.
 The chief forecaster at Decision Economics, Allen Sinai, said unemployment would have to rise to at least 5.5 percent, from 4.8 percent today, putting a million more people out of work, before inflation begins to decline.
 The chairman of Roubini Global Economics Monitor, Nouriel Roubini, predicted that the economy would fall into a recession early in 2007 as a result of high energy prices, higher interest rates and a housing collapse.
 ''Either the Fed does not believe its own inflation forecast, which I don't think is the case,'' Mr. Roubini said, ''or the slowdown is going to be greater than what they have been saying. They can't have it both ways.''
 To be sure, economists differ on how weak the economy already is or how severe inflation pressure is. And skepticism abounds on the chances of achieving a true soft landing.
 The very idea of such a thing is only about a decade old. It was conceived by Mr. Greenspan, then the Fed chairman, as a way to attack inflation before it started, by shrewdly using the levers of monetary policy to slow the economy just enough to keep it from overheating.
 Mr. Greenspan's greatest success was in the mid-1990's, when the economy had been expanding for nearly four years. Though inflation was declining and was lower than it is today, the Fed doubled short-term interest rates, to 6 percent from 3 percent, in just over a year.
 At the time, the result seemed neither soft nor smooth. Several financial institutions, caught by surprise, found themselves in big trouble. The economy slowed for a while, and unemployment edged up.
 But by 1996, the economy was rapidly growing again and the nation enjoyed several years of booming stock markets, falling unemployment and relatively low inflation. 
 The success, along with Mr. Greenspan's growing aura as a wizard of monetary nimbleness, prompted the Fed to step in and help soften the blows of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, the stock market collapse of 2000, the recession of 2001 and the surge of unemployment that followed.
 He failed in preventing the 2001 recession, but the Fed cut interest rates so deeply that this started a boom in housing prices and home refinancing that kept consumers spending even as incomes stagnated and unemployment moved higher. 
 Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now a chief forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers, said Mr. Bernanke needed to do more than simply duplicate Mr. Greenspan's one soft landing.
 Mr. Greenspan was not trying to reduce inflation, but merely to keep it from going up. Mr. Bernanke, by contrast, is trying to reduce it substantially.
 ''Soft landings are much more frequent in forecasts than in real life,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''With a computer, I can give you a soft landing if you give me 10 or 20 runs. But in real life, you only have one run.'' 
 Uncertainties and disagreement among experts about the economy's direction are now unusually high. A big uncertainty is whether the nation is near full employment.
 Many economists contend that the country is essentially at full employment, meaning that additional demand for workers will tend to push up wages. Because wages account for more than three-quarters of total production costs, Fed officials view them as inflationary if they rise significantly faster than productivity.
 Specialists like Mr. Gordon at Northwestern and Mr. Meyer maintain that the labor market is already very tight and predict that wages will soon start to push up inflation. 
 But others disagree, arguing that wages over the last five years have lagged behind increases in productivity and have barely kept up with inflation. The bigger risk, according to that school of thought, is to make the situation worse by driving up unemployment.
 ''We have no clue about labor market tightness right now,'' said J. Bradford De Long, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, who argues that workers still have little bargaining power.
 Depending on one's perspective, Mr. De Long said, the Fed's attempt at a soft landing is either a display of cool-headed technocracy or murky witchcraft. 
 Right now, he said, ''this is on the witchcraft side.''

HEADLINE: Blast Kills 35 and Wounds 120 at Shiite Shrine in Najaf

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; An Iraqi employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Najaf for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
A belt packed with explosives worn by a man who apparently intended to blow himself up inside one of the holiest shrines of Shiite Islam exploded on Thursday during a police pat down at a checkpoint near the shrine, Iraqi officials said. At least 35 people were killed and more than 120 others were wounded, including Iranian pilgrims, the officials said.
 The blast, in Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad, ripped into a crowd of Shiite pilgrims who had traveled to the golden-domed Shrine of Imam Ali on the anniversary of the death of Zaineb, the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad. 
The bombing of a Shiite shrine in the city of Samarra in February set off a wave of revenge attacks on Sunni Arabs and counterattacks on Shiites in which hundreds of people were killed within days. 
 The explosion on Thursday underscored the degradation of security in the spiritual heart of the Shiite-dominated south, an area once believed to be under the tight control of Iraqi and American forces. The most revered Shiite cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, lives just blocks away from the shrine.
 Other attacks around Iraq, mostly aimed at civilians, brought the death toll for the day to at least 48, even as additional Iraqi and American troops continued to deploy across Baghdad to try to bring a modicum of security to the capital. 
 The shrine attacked in Najaf sits at the center of downtown, surrounded by a labyrinth of narrow alleyways, and is a memorial to Ali, the prophet's son-in-law and the first martyr in the epochal seventh-century split between Sunni and Shiite Islam.
 The bomber walked up to a police checkpoint about 60 feet from the shrine at 10:15 a.m. and his explosives detonated as a policeman searched his body, said local officials and the Iraqi prime minister's office. A ball of flame engulfed the police officers at the checkpoint, killing at least five of them, said Dr. Munthir al-Athari, director of the health bureau in Najaf. At least eight women were among the dead. 
 The shrine was apparently not damaged. 
 Policemen and rescue workers wheeled victims sliced with shrapnel into the city's main hospital. Women in black robes wailed. People sprawled across beds and clutched limbs swathed in bandages soaked through with blood.
 ''I was in the market heading to visit the shrine when a huge explosion took place,'' said Shakir Ubaid Hassan, who was among those being treated for wounds. ''A lot of people were killed and injured, and I was hit in my head.''
 The country's top leaders, including the president and the prime minister, denounced the assault in separate statements. 
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a staunch Shiite, pinned the blame on loyalists of Saddam Hussein and ''takfiris,'' a term that refers to fundamentalist Sunni Arabs who consider Shiites to be infidels.
 ''Such barbaric carnage reveals the nature of the Saddamists and takfiri terrorists who seek to start sectarian unrest between Iraqi people,'' Mr. Maliki said in a written statement. ''We ask God Almighty to take the martyrs into his heaven and grant patience to their families and heal the wounded.''
 Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, a spokesman for the American command, issued a statement saying the attack was the work of ''a vicious death squad who targeted innocent Iraqis practicing their faith at one of the holiest sites in Iraq.''
 Najaf's economic growth is dependent on a steady stream of religious tourists, including many from neighboring Iran. Under Mr. Hussein's rule, few Shiites from outside Iraq were allowed to make pilgrimages to the Shrine of Ali. Now, thousands stream into the city each day, Iraqi officials said.
 Powerful Shiite parties with militias have control of the security forces in the province encompassing Najaf, and the area was once considered a haven shielded from the incessant bombings that plague central Iraq. But a recent series of deadly attacks has eroded the sense of security. On July 18, a suicide bomber in a van set off his explosives after luring day laborers into his vehicle outside a Shiite shrine in the neighboring city of Kufa, killing at least 53 people and wounding more than 100. 
 On July 6, a suicide car bomber rammed his sedan into two busloads of Iranian pilgrims near another Shiite shrine in Kufa, killing at least 12 people, including 5 Iranians, and wounding dozens.
 The bombings in Kufa seemed intended to provoke the militant Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose militia is accused by American officials and many Sunni Arabs of killing Sunnis in attacks across Baghdad and elsewhere. Mr. Sadr's chief mosque is in Kufa, and he occasionally preaches there on Fridays.
 Mr. Sadr's main office is next to the Shrine of Ali in Najaf, as are those of some of the country's leading ayatollahs. The city is home to the marjaiya, considered by many Shiites to be the top four clerics of their faith, and the base for the Hawza, a venerable seminary. Prominent Shiites have lived or studied in Najaf, including Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, and Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
 The governor of Najaf, Assad Abu Ghalal al-Taiee, belongs to one of the country's leading Shiite parties, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The party has a military wing, the Badr Organization, that helps provide security for Najaf. Other militias also operate openly in the city, including that of Mr. Sadr.
 The Shiite movement began in earnest when Ali and his son Hussein were killed in separate incidents in the seventh century. The term Shiites originally meant partisans of Ali. Shiites have clung to the notion that those directly descended from Ali, and thus from the Prophet Muhammad, are the proper rulers of the Islamic empire.
 Ali's body is said to lie in a tomb inside the shrine, which Mr. Sadr's militia used as a base during battles against American forces in 2004.
 The other reported violence on Thursday unfolded mostly in Baghdad. Four civilians were killed when the Sadr militia clashed with other armed men, Iraqi officials said. A bomb exploded in a restaurant, killing at least six people and wounding three. Three people were killed and three wounded when Iraqi commandos fought gunmen near a bazaar.

HEADLINE: Recounting Our Way to Democracy

BYLINE: By Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. 
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the mayor of Mexico City from 2001 to 2005, was a candidate for president in 2006, representing a coalition led by his Party of the Democratic Revolution. This article was translated from the Spanish by Rogelio Ramirez de la O.

DATELINE: Mexico City 

 BODY:
NOT since 1910, when another controversial election sparked a revolution, has Mexico been so fraught with political tension.
 The largest demonstrations in our history are daily proof that millions of Mexicans want a full accounting of last month's presidential election. My opponent, Felipe Calderon, currently holds a razor-thin lead of 243,000 votes out of 41 million cast, but Mexicans are still waiting for a president to be declared.
Unfortunately, the electoral tribunal responsible for ratifying the election results thwarted the wishes of many Mexicans and refused to approve a nationwide recount. Instead, their narrow ruling last Saturday allows for ballot boxes in only about 9 percent of polling places to be opened and reviewed. 
 This is simply insufficient for a national election where the margin was less than one percentage point -- and where the tribunal itself acknowledged evidence of arithmetic mistakes and fraud, noting that there were errors at nearly 12,000 polling stations in 26 states.
 It's worth reviewing the history of this election. For months, voters were subjected to a campaign of fear. President Vicente Fox, who backed Mr. Calderon, told Mexicans to change the rider, but not the horse -- a clear rebuke to the social policies to help the poor and disenfranchised that were at the heart of my campaign. Business groups spent millions of dollars in television and radio advertising that warned of an economic crisis were I to win.
 It's my contention that government programs were directed toward key states in the hope of garnering votes for Mr. Calderon. The United Nations Development Program went so far as to warn that such actions could improperly influence voters. Where support for my coalition was strong, applicants for government assistance were reportedly required to surrender their voter registration cards, thereby leaving them disenfranchised.
 And then came the election. Final pre-election polls showed my coalition in the lead or tied with Mr. Calderon's National Action Party. I believe that on election day there was direct manipulation of votes and tally sheets. Irregularities were apparent in tens of thousands of tally sheets. Without a crystal-clear recount, Mexico will have a president who lacks the moral authority to govern.
 Public opinion backs this diagnosis. Polls show that at least a third of Mexican voters believe the election was fraudulent and nearly half support a full recount. 
 And yet the electoral tribunal has ordered an inexplicably restrictive recount. This defies comprehension, for if tally sheet alterations were widespread, the outcome could change with a handful of votes per station. 
 Our tribunals -- unlike those in the United States -- have been traditionally subordinated to political power. Mexico has a history of corrupt elections where the will of the people has been subverted by the wealthy and powerful. Grievances have now accumulated in the national consciousness, and this time we are not walking away from the problem. The citizens gathered with me in peaceful protest in the Zocalo, the capital's grand central plaza, speak loudly and clearly: Enough is enough. 
 In the spirit of Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we seek to make our voices heard. We lack millions for advertising to make our case. We can only communicate our demand to count all the votes by peaceful protest. 
 After all, our aim is to strengthen, not damage, Mexico's institutions, to force them to adopt greater transparency. Mexico's credibility in the world will only increase if we clarify the results of this election. 
 We need the goodwill and support of those in the international community with a personal, philosophical or commercial interest in Mexico to encourage it to do the right thing and allow a full recount that will show, once and for all, that democracy is alive and well in this republic.

HEADLINE: Bush, on a Quick Trip From His Texas Ranch, Says Americans Are Safer Than Before Sept. 11

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting from Waco, Tex., for this article.

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Aug 10 

 BODY:
President Bush tried to assure Americans on Thursday that antiterrorism measures taken since the Sept. 11 attacks had made them safer while acknowledging that danger remained -- part of a balancing act in which his aides portrayed him as deeply involved in dealing with the foiled airline plot even as he continued his vacation here. 
 As Americans stood in long lines at airports, Mr. Bush went ahead with his planned trip to Wisconsin to raise money for a Republican Congressional candidate and to speak about the economy during a stop at a metal factory. He made brief remarks about the arrests in Britain on the tarmac of the airport in Green Bay, saying the plot was ''a stark reminder'' of the threat from ''Islamic fascists.'' 
''The country is safer than it was prior to 9/11,'' he said in Green Bay. ''We've taken a lot of measures to protect the American people. But obviously, we're still not completely safe, because there are people that still plot and people who want to harm us for what we believe in.''
 He later flew back to his ranch here, and aides said there were no plans for him to cut short his stay.
 Democrats seized on Mr. Bush's decision not to return to Washington as evidence that the president was disconnected.
 Several senior Republican strategists were also uneasy with the possibility that images of President Bush's activities in the past week, including bicycle rides in the 100-degree Texas heat, could be used to accuse him of being too casual about the potential terrorist threat. 
 White House officials said Mr. Bush was kept closely apprised of the investigation, through classified briefings conducted in a secure trailer on the ranch. Mr. Bush was at the ranch on Wednesday afternoon when his homeland security adviser, Frances Fragos Townsend, called to tell him the arrests were imminent; the two spoke several times throughout the evening, a senior administration official said, and by late Wednesday night, with the bulk of the arrests having been made, the president signed off on the plan to raise the threat level.
 But now that Americans have learned of the plot, some Republicans, when promised anonymity so they could speak freely about their criticisms, said Mr. Bush had to be careful not to appear out of touch, as his critics and even some of his allies said he did last summer when Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast. 
 At a time when Congressional Republicans are facing tough re-election battles at home, they lamented that the president was not doing more to seize the mantle of national security.
 ''A policy of casual nonchalance is not a winning strategy,'' said one Republican close to the White House, who suggested that the president should, at the least, deliver a primetime television address from the Crawford ranch. 
 Instead, Mr. Bush stuck to his schedule; after Thursday's metal plant tour, he attended a fund-raiser for John Gard, a candidate for an eastern Wisconsin Congressional seat; the event raised $500,000. On Friday, he will travel down the road from his ranch, Prairie Chapel, to the Broken Spoke, a neighboring ranch, for another fund-raiser.
 ''The government functions even when the president is residing in Texas,'' said Dan Bartlett, counselor to the president. ''The president is never off the job; he has been working around the clock, as the American people would expect.''
 One high-level administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said White House aides were concerned that the president would be open to accusations he was politicizing the crisis if he responded dramatically. This official said a decision had been made in part for the president to keep a low profile and allow the event to speak for itself.
 During his vacation in Crawford, which began last Thursday, the president's public comments have been focused largely on the Middle East, particularly over the weekend and Monday, when he was joined at the ranch by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser. 
 But over the past 7 to 10 days, according to a senior administration official who spoke anonymously about how Mr. Bush handled the plot inquiry behind the scenes, it became clear that the British investigation had ''a significant U.S. element to it.'' By Friday, the investigation had become ''a significant focus'' of the president's morning intelligence briefings, the official said.
 While Ms. Rice and Mr. Hadley were at the Crawford Middle School on Sunday, taping appearances on the morning talk shows about the crisis in Lebanon and Israel, Mr. Bush spent 47 minutes on the telephone with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. ''At that point here was no sense of timing as far as when the takedown would take place,'' the official said.
 That began to change late Tuesday and early Wednesday, and by Wednesday afternoon, with the arrests imminent, Ms. Townsend placed her call to Mr. Bush at the ranch. Though the arrests continued through the night, Mr. Bush was not awakened.
 ''By the time he went to bed more than half the operation had already taken place,'' the official said. ''The key people that we were particularly concerned about had already been arrested.''
 By Thursday morning, with Mr. Bush headed for Wisconsin to deliver a speech on the economy during the metal factory tour, the question at the White House was how the president should address the public. 
 Last month, Mr. Bush used a speech on the economy at the port of Miami to talk about the Middle East. This time, he spoke directly to the press corps at the airport, in the shadow of Air Force One at a microphone set up for his arrival. 
 ''The recent arrests that our fellow citizens are now learning about are a stark reminder that this nation is at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom, to hurt our nation,'' Mr. Bush said, adding: ''Travelers are going to be inconvenienced as a result of the steps we've taken. I urge their patience and ask them to be vigilant.''
 The remarks lasted two minutes, and the president took no questions.

HEADLINE: Energy Sales Lift Canada's Surplus 

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Canada's trade surplus widened more than expected in June, led by higher exports of energy and metals.
 The surplus grew to 4.75 billion Canadian dollars ($4.24 billion), from 4.11 billion dollars in May, Statistics Canada said Thursday in Ottawa. 
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected an increase to a surplus of 4.3 billion Canadian dollars, from the 4.07 billion dollars the statistics agency initially reported for May.
 The country's trade surplus with the United States narrowed to 8.25 billion Canadian dollars in the month, from 8.38 billion Canadian dollars in May.
 Energy exports have sustained Canada's trade surplus in the last five years, offsetting a slowdown in factory shipments caused by a strong dollar. Canada has the largest pool of oil reserves outside the Middle East, and companies are spending billions on pipelines to supply crude oil and natural gas to the United States and overseas.
 ''The trade surplus continues to benefit from rising commodity prices,'' Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at the Bank of Montreal in Toronto, said. Canada's trade surplus is not expected to widen much in coming months because of the strong dollar.
 Exports rose 1.1 percent, to 37.6 billion dollars, as energy shipments increased 3.4 percent, to 7.37 billion dollars, Statistics Canada said. Sales of industrial goods like copper and aluminum rose 2.9 percent, to a record 7.77 billion dollars.
 Canada's imports fell 0.7 percent, to 32.8 billion dollars, led by a 5.5 percent drop in chemicals and plastics, the agency said.

HEADLINE: With Business Leading a Push, Liquor Comes to Dry Bible Belt

BYLINE: By MELANIE WARNER

 BODY:
While much of America put Prohibition to rest 73 years ago, large parts of the South have remained strictly off-limits to alcohol sales.
 But local and national business interests that stand to profit from the sale of alcohol, including real estate developers, grocery chains, restaurant groups and Wal-Mart, are combining their political and financial muscle to try to persuade hundreds of dry towns and counties to go wet. In the process, they are changing the face of the once staunchly prohibitionist Bible Belt.
Since 2002, business groups have spent upwards of $15 million on campaigns, including professional lobbyists, to persuade voters in some 200 dry towns and 25 dry counties in six Southern states to legalize alcohol sales in stores and restaurants. 
 Wal-Mart has financed dozens of local elections, contributing from $5,000 to $20,000 a campaign, said Tim Reeves of Beverage Election Specialists, which supports local alcohol referendums. 
 Wal-Mart, based in a dry county in Arkansas, forbids drinking at events held at corporate headquarters. But the giant retailer has made a push in the last year to sell more liquor, along with beer and wine, in its stores.
 Attempts by Wal-Mart and others to allow alcohol sales in other places that remain dry -- 415 counties in the South and in Kansas still prohibit such sales -- are meeting fierce resistance from some church groups and religious leaders. They argue that returning to the days when liquor flowed will mean more family violence, under-age drinking, drunken driving and a general moral decay in the community. 
 But voters are increasingly likely to follow their pocketbooks rather than the words of their pastors. Alcohol proponents often make the case that liberalizing laws will increase tax revenue and reduce the need for property tax increases, an issue looming large in voters' minds. 
 More dry-to-wet measures have passed than have been defeated in the last four years in Texas, Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kansas, the states where the battles are concentrated. ''The communities who effectively make arguments about economic development and tax dollars typically win the votes,'' said John Hatch, a political strategist based in Austin, Tex.
 Some churches are taking a moderate stand on drinking. The Rev. Mike Hunter, senior minister at the First Christian Church in Lufkin, Tex., said he was invited by some of the more conservative clergy members in town to participate in meetings to oppose legalizing alcohol, but declined. ''It's a decision we leave up to individuals,'' he said. ''The legal, responsible consumption of alcohol is not a pulpit point in our congregation.''
 The issue is now playing out in Lufkin, an old railroad town in the heart of the Texas Bible Belt 115 miles northeast of Houston. On a recent Monday night, 175 citizens gathered at the town's civic center to voice their opposition to a referendum proposal, scheduled for a vote in November, that would allow sales of beer and wine in stores and drinks in restaurants all across Angelina County. Lufkin is the county's largest town, with 35,000 people. 
 ''This is an unprecedented attack against the family,'' the Rev. Ronnie L. Frankens, pastor of Homer Pentecostal Church in neighboring Diboll, said of the alcohol vote. ''We are going to fight this tooth and nail.'' His rousing words were greeted with cries of ''amen'' and ''praise Jesus.'' 
 Like many in attendance that night, Linda Jones, who works for the city of Lufkin and whose husband is a pastor at the First Baptist Church in nearby Moscow, said she thought the measure, if passed, would invite more pernicious forms of commerce, like bars, nightclubs and liquor stores. She says she considers drinking to be a sin and does not partake. ''My grandmother was an alcoholic and I never wanted to be like that,'' she said.
 On the other side of the debate are people like Sarah Strinden, who moved to Lufkin in the 1980's from Madison, Wis. She says that most people she knows are moderate drinkers and would just like the convenience of being able to buy beer and wine on their regular shopping trips. Currently, she says that getting some wine to go with dinner involves a 40-minute round-trip drive to a liquor store in Nacogdoches.
 In restaurants in dry areas of Texas, diners who want to order drinks can do so only if they become members of the restaurant's ''club.'' Such memberships are usually free to the customer, but restaurants must spend up to $20,000 a year for record-keeping and fees to the alcoholic beverage commission. ''Lufkin needs to come into the modern age,'' Ms. Strinden said.
 Across the South, some business groups seem to agree with her, backing efforts to nudge dry towns and counties to go wet. 
 ''It's going to be much harder to attract restaurants and grocery stores to your town if they can't sell alcohol,'' said Mr. Hatch, the political strategist who has been hired to help get the measure passed in Angelina County. 
 Mr. Hatch and other proponents say their campaigns have been financed by a diverse group that includes grocery chains like Albertson's, Kroger and Safeway; and restaurant groups like Brinker International, which owns Chili's Grill and Bar, and Darden Restaurants, owner of Red Lobster and Olive Garden. 
 And, of course, Wal-Mart. ''I think Sam Walton, being the family-oriented man he was, would be rolling over in his grave about this,'' Mr. Frankens, the pastor of Homer Pentecostal Church, said in a telephone interview, referring to the Wal-Mart founder. ''I'm really disappointed in Wal-Mart as a company.''
 Wal-Mart does not break out revenue from alcohol, but according to A. C. Nielsen, at the end of 2004 Wal-Mart had United States alcohol revenue of $1 billion out of total domestic revenue of $229 billion. 
 Retailers and restaurants say the ability to sell alcohol is not a precondition for choosing a new location, but it is a factor. For casual dining chains, the average restaurant check doubles when someone orders an alcoholic beverage, according to the research firm NPD Group.
 The Distilled Spirits Council, the Washington-based trade group for liquor manufacturers, says it has participated in half a dozen local elections, providing some combination of financial assistance and economic data.
 In Duncanville, a Dallas suburb of 36,000, voters bought the argument made by a group called Citizens for Shopping More and Less Taxes, which was financed by town residents, local convenience stores and real estate developers, as well as Safeway and Kroger. The group said the town would get some a much-needed tax boost by allowing beer and wine sales in grocery and convenience stores. 
 The town is now seeing that boost. Before the vote in September 2003, Duncanville had experienced four years of declining sales tax revenue. But revenue rose slightly in the first two years, and is up 15 percent for the first seven months of 2006 compared with the period in 2005, according to the Texas comptroller. The Duncanville city manager, Kent Cagle, estimates that beer and wine sales are bringing in $500,000 a year in sales taxes. 
 ''This extra revenue has kept us from cutting new services and we're starting to put back some of the things we had cut, like parks maintenance, some city positions and street maintenance and signs,'' Mr. Cagle said. 
 Those who fight against alcohol sales say the extra tax revenue comes at a cost. Lee Miller, a leader of Angelina Citizens for a Better Community, the group vowing to defeat the measure, points to data from the state of Texas showing that for every $1 in revenue the state received from alcohol, $9 is paid out for expenses like treatment for alcohol abuse, law enforcement services and motor vehicle crashes. 
 ''This will not benefit us as a community,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It costs us more money in expenses and in the lives of our children.'' 
 Mr. Miller, who does not drink, says he is concerned that if the vote passes, his 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son will have easier access to alcohol.
 Mr. Hatch, the political strategist, argues that Mr. Miller's cost revenue figures paint an inaccurate picture because they do not consider the additional sales taxes from alcohol purchases, only revenue from alcohol excise taxes, the bulk of which flow to the state.
 Oscar Dillahunty, a 69-year-old, one-time beer distributor who hired Mr. Hatch and started Angelina County Citizens for Responsible Business, has estimated that the county could rack up at least $15 million in annual beer sales alone, which would translate into $225,000 in sales tax revenue for Lufkin and $75,000 for the county. He says his estimate is based on sales in a similar county in Mississippi, where he previously owned a beer distributor.
 As for concerns about social consequences, studies that have linked increases in the number of alcohol outlets to violence or drunken driving draw the strongest correlation between such problems and bars. Most of the recent dry-to-wet proposals in the South do not allow for bars.
 Many officials in towns and counties that recently went wet say they have not seen an increase in reported crime or drunken driving. Mr. Cagle, the city manager in Duncanville, said the town had not devolved into ''Drunkenville,'' as church groups claimed it would. 
 Three police chiefs -- David Walker of Fort Payne, Tex.; Benny Womack of Albertville, Ala.; and Eddie Phillips of East Ridge, Tenn. -- all say they have not seen any increase in law enforcement problems since alcohol sales began in 2004. 
 But just as the feared public mayhem wrought by alcohol abuse often fails to materialize, the economic prosperity is often absent, too. In Albertville, Ala., the Rev. Willis Kelly, who preaches at Douglas First Baptist Church, says he is still waiting for the town's financial boom. 
 ''The folks that wanted it to go wet campaigned on the idea that it would bring in money to build a new school,'' Mr. Willis said. ''Last year they collected only a little over $100,000 in extra taxes. That wouldn't even buy toilet paper.''
 Mr. Willis says no new restaurants have opened in Albertville, a town of 18,000 people 65 miles from Birmingham, since the vote in June 2004, and only one of the two grocery stores in town opted to sell beer and wine. 
 Jon Howard, director of finance for Albertville, would not confirm Mr. Willis's tax numbers and Mayor Carl Pruett declined to comment on the town's economy. 
 In Lufkin, where in recent years the economy has been surging without the help of alcohol sales, some citizens just want their town to be a bit more like the rest of the country and a little less Bible Belt. ''This is the 21st century,'' said Ernest Rowe, a 70-year-old retired forest worker. ''I just want to be able to buy my case of Coors Light, come home and pop open a cold one.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Ambassador in Iraq Says Iran Is Inciting Attacks 

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Iran is pressing Shiite militias here to step up attacks against the American-led forces in retaliation for the Israeli assault on Lebanon, the American ambassador to Iraq said Friday. Iran may foment even more violence as it faces off with the United States and United Nations over its nuclear program in the coming weeks, he added.
 The Iranian incitement has led to a surge in mortar and rocket attacks on the fortified Green Zone, said the ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad.
The four-square-mile Green Zone, protected by layers of concrete blast walls and concertina wire on the west bank of the Tigris River here, encloses baroque palaces built by Saddam Hussein that now house the seat of the Iraqi government and the American Embassy. 
 The Shiite guerrillas behind the recent attacks are members of splinter groups of the Mahdi Army, the powerful militia created by the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, Mr. Khalilzad said. 
 The splinter groups have ties to Iran, which is governed by Shiite Persians, and to Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite Arab militia in Lebanon that has been battling Israel for a month, the ambassador added.
 There is evidence that Iran is pushing for more attacks, he said, without offering any specifics. But he acknowledged that there was no proof that Iran was directing any particular operations by militias here. 
 ''Iran is seeking to put more pressure, encourage more pressure on the coalition from the forces that they are allied with here, and the same is maybe true of Hezbollah,'' Mr. Khalilzad said in an interview Friday in his home inside the Green Zone. 
 His remarks are the first public statements by a senior Bush administration official directly linking violence in Iraq to American support of Israel's military campaign in Lebanon, and to growing pressure by the United States over Iran's nuclear program. Until now, American officials have not publicly drawn a direct connection between Shiite militant groups here and Hezbollah in Lebanon. 
 Mr. Khalilzad's comments also reinforce the observations of some analysts that the rise of the majority Shiites in Iraq, long oppressed by Sunni Arab rulers, is fueling the creation of a ''Shiite crescent'' across the Middle East, with groups in Iraq, Iran and Lebanon working together against common enemies, whether they be the United States, Israel or Sunni Arab nations. 
 Despite the recent attacks by the splinter groups, Mr. Khalilzad insisted that the most powerful Shiite leaders in Iraq had not yet pushed for more violence against the Americans, even though Iran would like them to. That includes Mr. Sadr, he said. 
 ''Generally the Shia leadership here have behaved more as Iraqi patriots and have not reacted in the way that perhaps the Iranians and Hezbollah might want them to,'' Mr. Khalilzad said.
 Iran and Hezbollah want the Iraqi Shiite leaders ''to behave by mobilizing against the coalition or taking actions against the coalition,'' he added.
 In their public addresses, the top Shiite leaders in Iraq have forcefully condemned the Israeli assault on Lebanon, much more so than senior officials in Sunni Arab countries. Denunciations have come from Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered Shiite cleric here, from Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and from Parliament, which called the Israeli airstrikes ''criminal aggression.'' 
 When Mr. Maliki visited Washington last month, Congressional leaders pressed him to denounce Hezbollah as a terrorist group, but he dodged the request.
 The mercurial Mr. Sadr has come closest of the Shiite leaders in hinting that Iraqis might take up arms in support of Hezbollah. He said in late July that Iraqis would not ''sit by with folded hands'' while Lebanon burned, and on Aug. 4 he summoned up to 100,000 followers to an anti-Israeli and anti-American rally in Baghdad. 
 Most of those who showed up were angry young men, many swathed in white cloths symbolizing funeral shrouds and some toting Kalashnikov rifles.
 On Friday a senior cleric in Mr. Sadr's movement, Sheik Asad al-Nasiri, told worshipers at Mr. Sadr's main mosque in Kufa that ''the Zionist entity's power has been broken and has been weakened in the battle.'' He asserted that ''the resistance has given the best examples of bravery and sacrifice.'' 
 Sympathy with Hezbollah is not limited to the radical fringe. As images of the destruction in Lebanon continue flickering across the Arab television networks, many ordinary Iraqis say they would join what they call a holy war against American-backed Israel.
 Mr. Khalilzad said Iran could stoke more violence among the Shiite militias as the end of the month draws nearer. That is expected to be a time of high tension between Iran and the United States, because a United Nations Security Council resolution gives Iran until Aug. 31 to suspend its uranium enrichment activities or face the threat of economic and diplomatic sanctions. Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has insisted that Iran will pursue its nuclear program.
 Mr. Khalilzad said, ''The concern that we have is that Iran and Hezbollah would use those contacts that they have with groups and the situation here, use those to cause more difficulties or cause difficulties for the coalition.'' 
 If the United Nations adopts another resolution against Iran after the Aug. 31 deadline, he said, that ''could increase the pressure on Iran,'' and ''Iran could respond to it by further pressing its supporters or people that it has ties with, or people that it controls, to increase the pressure on the coalition, not only in Iraq but elsewhere as well.''
 Some military analysts cast the Israel-Hezbollah war as a proxy struggle between the United States and Iran, and prominent conservatives in Washington have called for American military action against Iran. 
 William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, said on Fox News last month that the Bush administration had been ''coddling'' Iran and that the war in Lebanon and Israel represented ''a great opportunity to begin resuming the offensive against'' militant Islamists.
 Here in Iraq, the Iranian-backed Mahdi Army rose up twice against the Americans in 2004, and American and British forces have stepped up operations recently against elements of it, raiding hideouts and engaging in pitched battles in the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad and in the area around Basra, the southern port city. 
 On Monday, American forces called in an air attack during a raid in Sadr City. Prime Minister Maliki, who depends on Mr. Sadr for political support against rival Shiites, denounced the raid, saying he had never approved it and that the Americans had used ''excessive force.''
 American military officials have given few details about ties between Shiite militias here and Iran or Hezbollah, except to say they believe that Iran has given technology for lethal shaped-charge explosives to Iraqi militias. Iran may have passed on the technology via Hezbollah, some officials have said.
 Western security advisers confirmed Friday that there had been a recent spate of mortar and rocket attacks on the Green Zone, known to some as the International Zone. It is unclear whether anyone was wounded or killed by the strikes. A spokesman for the American military, Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, declined to give details. 
 ''We aren't interested in discussing attacks on the International Zone, their effectiveness or who may be responsible,'' he said in an e-mail message.
 Leaders in the Sadr Organization say parts of the Mahdi Army are not under their control. Those rogue elements, they say, carry out attacks without guidance from Mr. Sadr or his top commanders.

HEADLINE: Surge in Retail Sales in July Was the Largest Since January 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
Consumers spent heartily in July on goods like cars and electronics as sales at retail stores rose a greater-than-expected 1.4 percent, a government report on Friday showed. 
 It was the biggest increase since January, according to the report, which was released by the Commerce Department, and was well above the 0.8 percent gain economists were expecting.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, retail sales rose 1.0 percent, also the biggest rise since January, exceeding the 0.5 percent increase economists had forecast.
 Economists said the data indicated that the consumer, a major driver of the economy, was still spending, despite rising gasoline prices and signs of a slowdown in the housing market.
 ''This blockbuster surge in sales strongly suggests that the economy may not be slowing as much as the central bank had anticipated when it opted to pause its rate-hiking cycle,'' said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at J. P. Morgan Private Client Services in New York.
 Federal Reserve policy makers decided this week to keep interest rates steady in the belief that the economy might be starting to slow enough to crimp inflationary pressures after more than a two-year stretch of rate increases.
 ''This shows the consumer is alive and well,'' said Marc Chandler, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ''It suggests the talk this week about recession is quite alarmist.''
 Last month's gain in retail sales followed a 0.4 percent decline in June, which had been reported initially as a 0.1 percent decrease.
 Sales of motor vehicles and parts surged 3.1 percent in July after sinking 2.5 percent the prior month.
 The Labor Department reported Friday that import prices rose 0.9 percent in July, slightly more than expectations, as petroleum costs rose sharply.
 And business inventories in June rose a greater-than-expected 0.8 percent, according to the Commerce Department.
 The ratio of inventories to sales, a measure of how long it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales rate, rose to 1.26 months from 1.25 months in May.

HEADLINE: On Edge Over Terrorist Plots and Oil Supply 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
RENEWED concern about terrorist strikes and a spike in energy prices threatened to flatten airlines, just as they had pulled themselves off the canvas and staggered back to profitability. 
 The British authorities arrested 24 men and accused them of planning to use liquid bombs in a coordinated attack against as many as 10 flights over the Atlantic. The arrests set in motion a global security crackdown that led to the cancellation of thousands of flights and threatened to discourage travel by plane.
The news scared investors already on edge about the economy and a spreading scandal over the timing of stock options that some executives granted to themselves, though markets quickly shrugged off concern about terror attacks.

TAKING A PAUSE -- The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rates steady at its policy-setting meeting, ending a string of 17 consecutive rate increases over the last two years. But it said increases could resume if inflation did not abate. 
 For now, the Fed said ''inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time,'' so it left its federal funds target rate at 5.25 percent. That rate sets the cost of overnight loans among banks, and indirectly influences the prime rate and other loan rates. 
 Even a pause in the upward march of interest rates should help the economy, but stocks fell after the announcement because many investors had anticipated steady rates now and were looking for signs of lower borrowing costs in the future. The Fed, though, is balancing signs of a slowing economy with accelerating inflation.
 Producer inflation numbers for July will be released on Monday; consumer inflation numbers will come on Tuesday.

OIL SCARE -- After finding ''unexpectedly severe corrosion'' in a pipeline, BP said it would shut the huge Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska to allow for repairs. The move would have reduced domestic oil production by 400,000 barrels a day, or 8 percent, and the announcement sent crude oil prices up by more than $1 a barrel, to $76.
 A day later, however, BP said that initial inspections suggested that corrosion was not as widespread as it had feared, and that it might be able to keep part of the field operational as it fixed the problem.
 The uncertainty surrounding Prudhoe Bay -- BP said production had fallen to 120,000 barrels a day, from 400,000 -- led ConocoPhillips, one of the three big owners, to tell some customers it could not guarantee supplies. The other big owners, BP and Exxon Mobil, have not yet warned their customers.
 The problem may rekindle the debate about whether to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The House approved drilling in May, but the Senate did not.

POLICE BLOTTER -- Federal authorities arrested two more executives in their investigation of backdated stock options and said they were searching for a third, who might have fled the country after wiring more than $50 million overseas.
 David Kreinberg, the former finance chief of Comverse Technology, a software maker in New York, and William F. Sorin, the former general counsel, were arraigned in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on charges of mail, securities and wire fraud. Jacob Alexander, the former chief executive, is thought to have fled the country.
 By retroactively granting themselves the option to buy Comverse's stock right before it rallied, the men essentially stole from other shareholders and inflated the company's apparent profit, prosecutors said.
 Federal prosecutors filed similar charges against Gregory L. Reyes, former chief executive of Brocade Communications Systems, and Stephanie Jensen, former vice president for human resources, last month. A federal magistrate in San Francisco last week denied a motion to dismiss the case.
 A growing number of companies, including Pixar Animation, Juniper Networks and Sepracor, have said they plan to restate earnings because of questions about the timing of stock option grants, though none of their executives have been charged criminally over the practice.
 Cablevision, a cable television company in Bethpage, N.Y., may have to restate its financial results from 1997 through 2002 because of suspect stock option grants.

CLOSING THE BOOK -- Martha Stewart, who spent five months in federal prison after being convicted in 2004 of lying to investigators reviewing possible insider trading in a pharmaceutical stock, agreed to pay $195,000 to settle a civil lawsuit that securities regulators filed in the case.
 In addition to paying the fine, Ms. Stewart agreed not to serve as a chief executive or director of any public company -- including the one she founded, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia -- for five years. She neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
 Her former stockbroker, Peter E. Bacanovic, was included in the settlement. He will pay $75,645. Federal prosecutors say they used inside information from a mutual friend, Samuel D. Waksal, to help her avoid losing $45,000 on her investment in Mr. Waksal's company, ImClone.
 The settlement will also prohibit Ms. Stewart from commenting publicly about her company's financial prospects.

GOOD AND BAD -- Strong growth in revenues is narrowing the federal budget gap, the Treasury Department said. The federal deficit totaled $239.7 billion through the first 10 months of the budget year, 21 percent below the deficit at the same point last year.
 The trade deficit also narrowed, although only slightly, to $64.8 billion in June from $65.0 billion in May, the Commerce Department said. Still, it was the fifth-highest monthly trade gap on record, as the country imported a record $20.5 billion worth of crude oil. (May's was the third-highest on record.)
 Jobless claims grew faster than expected and builders gave further evidence that the housing market was slowing. Toll Brothers, the country's largest builder of luxury homes, said orders for homes fell 45 percent in its most recent quarter.
 On Wednesday, the government will release statistics on the number of building permits issued and the number of new houses built last month.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Upholds Random Police Searches of Passengers' Bags on Subways

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Calling the New York City subways a ''prime target'' for terrorists, a federal appeals court yesterday upheld a lower court's ruling that random police searches of passengers' bags were constitutional because they helped prevent attacks.
 The ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, affirmed an earlier decision by Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who said in December that the incursion on subway passengers' privacy is minimal enough to be justified by the deterrent effect bag searches have on potential terrorists. 
At a time when the New York subways have twice been reported targets of terror groups and when bombs have gone off on trains and buses in Russia, Spain and England, the appeals court wrote that ''the search program serves a special need and, on balance, is reasonable.''
 ''In light of the thwarted plots to bomb New York City's subway system, its continued desirability as a target, and the recent bombings of public transportation systems in Madrid, Moscow and London, the risk to public safety is substantial and real,'' the court wrote.
 The ruling was the second in which courts upheld the program of random searches that the New York police put in place in July 2005, soon after bombings in the London Underground that killed 56 and wounded hundreds. The police have searched bags at random stations and intervals, say every 5th or 10th passenger entering a station. Passengers can refuse to open their bags and walk away, but they cannot go through the turnstile to the trains with bags they did not allow the police to search.
 The program was challenged at a trial before Judge Berman by the New York Civil Liberties Union, which argued that the searches were too infrequent and haphazard to be effective and violated the Fourth Amendment's provision against unreasonable searches and seizures without a specific cause. Yesterday, Christopher Dunn, a lawyer for the group, said that its options included an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
 ''It is troubling that the court's opinion fails to closely scrutinize the effectiveness of the program, which has resulted in police searches of hundreds of thousands of innocent New Yorkers,'' Mr. Dunn said, ''and which even the city's own experts admitted leaves the subway system wide open to terrorist attack.''
 Those experts were David Cohen, the deputy police commissioner for intelligence; Michael A. Sheehan, the deputy police commissioner for counterterrorism; and Richard A. Clarke, former head of counterterrorism for the National Security Council. The ruling took a deferential stance toward them and other national security experts, saying: ''We will not -- and may not -- second-guess the minutiae of their considered decisions.''
 The ruling also included a poetic, albeit dark-toned, passage on the history and magnitude of the New York subway system, which the court called ''staggering'' with 26 interconnected train lines, 468 far-flung stations and 1.4 billion trips taken a year.
 ''The New York City subway system is a singular component of America's urban infrastructure,'' the court wrote. ''The subway is an icon of the city's culture and history, an engine of its colossal economy, a subterranean repository of its art and music, and, most often, the place where millions of diverse New Yorkers and visitors stand elbow to elbow as they traverse the metropolis.''
 For all those reasons, the court said, ''it is unsurprising, and undisputed, that terrorists view it as a prime target.''

HEADLINE: Science Caught in a Bubble: Two Different Ways to See

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
It is a hot day at the Palace of Fine Arts, but no one is bending down to take a promised drink. The spout, gleaming with polished chrome, looks like those on many new water fountains. The problem is that it is mounted on the rim of an open toilet.
 ''A Sip of Conflict'' reads the explanatory sign, for this is an exhibit at the Exploratorium, the astonishing science museum here. Judging from the grimaces and giggles of visitors, the point being made is clear. We may know something to be true -- that the water is clean and cold -- but sensory experience conflicts with reason. In this conflict, guess which wins?
Compare that exhibit with another, at the Tech Museum of Innovation in nearby San Jose. You sit at a computer monitor and select elements of a roller coaster ride -- track length, loop shapes, cart speeds -- constructing a rudimentary track. Then you walk over to a roller coaster cart, where your custom bit of track is simulated: a screen shows the cart's motion over the track, while the cart rocks and thrusts as if it were really moving through your self-constructed ride. 
 Could the approaches be more different? The Exploratorium exhibit has almost nothing to do with technology; the Tech exhibit celebrates it. The Exploratorium exhibit is almost deliberately old-fashioned; the Tech exhibit aspires to state-of-the-art effects. The Exploratorium display is modest, and succeeds; the Tech's is ambitious and seems less spectacular than its promise. 
 The exhibits even reflect two different archetypes for the modern science museum. While the Exploratorium focuses on experiment, the Tech focuses on sensation. The Exploratorium has the aura of a science fair, the Tech the aura of a sci-fi fair. 
 But both models are in transition and confronting challenges. The two museums also have new directors. The Tech, facing declining attendance and recovering from Silicon Valley's crash, hired a new president, Peter Friess, a German master clockmaker whose doctoral thesis connected the history of art and the history of technology. He also directed and helped to create the Deutsches Museum in Bonn, which focuses on German technology and research since 1945.
 The Exploratorium has brought in Dennis M. Bartels as executive director. Experienced in science education and policy (and a former director of the Exploratorium's learning center), he plans to expand the museum's programming and subject matter while overseeing its move to a new building during the next few years, doubling its size. The new site, according to current plans, is on two piers near the downtown area. 
 Admittedly this is not a comparison of equals. The Exploratorium, founded in 1969 by the physicist Frank Oppenheimer (J. Robert's brother), created the participatory model for the modern science museum. The best of its 400-some displays strip away irrelevant detail and decorous flimflam and focus on simple, pungent principles. Displays about mechanics, sound, electricity and human perception inspire a combination of wonder and unsettled thought: something is palpably felt that had earlier been just an abstract idea.
 The Exploratorium's displays are meant to appear homemade, and they are: the workshop where they are constructed and the display areas share the museum's floor space. It really is an educational institution, with substantial resources devoted to training teachers and scrutinizing the effects of its exhibits. 
 But the Exploratorium's style has also become so familiar that its displays can seem a bit shopworn, like well-used equipment in an aging high school science lab. The contemporary scientific universe is also different from what it was in the 1970's, the Exploratorium's first heady decade. 
 What about the personal computer, advances in medicine, nanotechnology, string theory, the Internet? None get satisfactory treatment here. Mr. Bartels, in an interview, pointed out that contemporary science had moved to extremes of scale: the very big and very small, the very fast and very slow. How, he asks, are they to be demonstrated with Exploratorium-style apparatus? And what about contemporary audiences' taste for spectacle? 
 One response to these issues has been made by the Tech Museum, which was meant to embody the energy and inventiveness of Silicon Valley. It contains its own IMAX theater and, with its glossier aesthetic, celebrates newer technologies. 
 The museum, which opened in 1998 courtesy of the local government and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and companies, is housed in a $113 million building. Its 132,000 square feet now contain exhibits about the Internet, undersea exploration, earthquakes, genetic research and chip design, along with interactive displays and simulations. 
 Yet even with this kind of backing and ambition, the Tech pales in comparison with the Exploratorium. The tech crash couldn't have helped. During the Tech's first full year, 1999, the museum had 800,000 visitors. Last year there were fewer than 400,000, of which a third came only to see an IMAX film. (Some 500,000 visited the Exploratorium last year.) 
 But the Tech's decline in attendance is not just a function of the local economy. During a recent weekend the largest crowds were waiting to see ''Superman Returns'' at the IMAX. Some exhibits were in disrepair. And displays that were meant to tap into Silicon Valley's technological strengths seemed less sophisticated than commercial products and computer programs in daily use. 
 One participatory exhibit had all of the stolidity of the Exploratorium toilet but none of the wit: the visitor is invited to ''experience an M.R.I.,'' which involves lying down on a tabletop with your head in a plastic module as a tape recording plays the medical equipment's grating, pulsing noise. 
 Mr. Friess, in an interview, said the museum would have to define itself more clearly by celebrating the spirit of innovation, and connecting itself more closely with the stories and ideas of Silicon Valley. But it is apparent that a reimagining will also be needed. 
 Is it possible that each of these museums could get hints of what it needs from what the other features? One thing missing from the Exploratorium, for example, is the very notion of innovation that Mr. Friess emphasizes. The Exploratorium presents ideas and principles but not scientists or methods. It is ahistorical. One wanders from one display or discipline to another, from earth sciences to mechanics, to optics, to psychology; each exhibit is effectively an experiment.
 But many of these experiments have historical analogs: they were designed to answer particular questions. Visitors get no sense of this. They race objects of different shapes down ramps or change the lengths of swinging pendulums, for example, without recognizing that they are conducting variations of classic experiments Newton used to discern the laws of motion.
 A historical context would also raise other questions: Which experiments failed and why? How were certain scientific questions answered or ignored? 
 Such an approach might expand the Exploratorium's breadth and suggest different kinds of exhibits. It might even make it easier to explore the newer branches of science or examine ethical issues that Mr. Bartels said he wished to address more intensively. 
 As for what the Tech might gain from looking more closely at the Exploratorium, the benefits would be legion. The Tech's displays put glitter ahead of substance. One offers protruding bronze molds of explorers' hands and asks visitors to ''touch hands that touched discovery,'' including the hand of Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of ''Star Trek,'' treating him as if he were as real as an adjacent oceanographer. It's a silly exhibit with an even sillier execution.
 Another simulates an earthquake, though its shaking floor and sharp jerks seem more like an amusement park ride that can't get off the ground. 
 In most exhibits little is learned about either science or innovation. But consider what happens at the Exploratorium, where simpler technologies are involved, and abstract ideas are made palpable. 
 Cold air is heavier than warm air? Sure, but wait until you've blown soap bubbles that hover without sinking, buoyed on the chilled air created by a slab of dry ice. Faster moving air creates the ''lift'' for airplanes? Sure, but make a flat disk float without falling as a jet of air blows down on it, and the principle begins to amaze.
 At the Exploratorium square wheels roll smoothly over a properly shaped surface; the blood vessels in your own eyes can be seen; ice crystals branch out over a glass surface; the corpses of an iguana and mouse are devoured by natural scavengers. 
 In each display that works (not all of them do) something simple is indelibly portrayed. We may think we know the world's scientific principles, but perhaps we haven't yet come to feel those truths or to fully believe them. The best exhibit, like an experiment, has enough power to prove its point and reshape experience.
 The Exploratorium even provides another water fountain for those who blanch at the toilet's testimony to the inadequacy of reason. Press the fountain's copper-plated switch, lean over, and the moment your lips touch the liquid, music is heard: water completes the electrical circuit. 
 The sip offers not conflict but wonder. We thought we knew the world, but here, drinking deeply, we find we are only beginning to understand it.

HEADLINE: Students Imagine Red Hook's Future 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, based in Red Hook, operates one of the rawest exhibition spaces in New York City: a corner of the Beard Street Warehouse, an 1869 complex of storehouses built of rough-cut schist on reclaimed marshland. The galleries have no air-conditioning or heating. Light enters through arched iron shutters and bounces off wooden ceiling beams and support columns. Electric fans provide feeble ventilation.
 The space is a remnant of Red Hook's long-faded status as one of the country's busiest shipping centers. Settled by the Dutch in 1636, the area exploded with maritime activity after the completion of the Erie Canal, which established a connection between the New York harbor and the Midwest, in 1825. In the warehouse dock workers once carted raw sugar, spices, flax, hemp, jute, rubber, leather, dried fruit, seeds, coffee and cocoa.
 But by the 1950's, with the decline in grain traffic and the completion of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which cut the neighborhood off from the rest of Brooklyn, Red Hook began a long demise, which has only recently been halted by gentrification. 
 A new show in the coalition's gritty exhibition site tries to reimagine the future of Red Hook, taking account of the area's waterfront location, on Upper New York Bay, and of trends in urban planning and architectural design. It is on view on weekends through Aug. 20 as part of the coalition's summer show, ''Food for a Feast for the Eyes.'' 
 The Red Hook exhibition arose from a spring-semester studio class at the Yale School of Architecture that was organized around the theme of urbanism, but unlike other academic exercises, it focused on more than the merely theoretical. 
 Like other gentrifying neighborhoods, Red Hook is in the throes of rapid social and economic change. In April a terminal for giant luxury cruise ships opened on Pier 12, which had been part of the last remaining container-shipping terminal in Brooklyn. In May a 52,000-square-foot Fairway grocery store, with a 300-space parking lot, opened at the foot of Van Brunt Street. Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, plans to build its largest store there, on a 22-acre site that was once a shipyard and dry dock.
 At the mouth of the Erie Basin, on a pier next to the warehouse's pier, a developer wants to replace a long-shuttered sugar factory with loft-style apartments, offices and stores.
 In 10 proposals the Yale students, who are entering the last year of a three-year master's program in architecture, responded to those developments in varying ways. The results are on view in the form of computer renderings and paper models.
 One team tried to disperse and integrate the big-box stores into the historic neighborhood, rather than reject them -- although that was an option. In its proposal a doughnut-shaped Wal-Mart has a public square at its center, connected to the street by a colorful archway. Nearby, a giant self-storage building has a running track and a park on its roof, within view of the expressway overhead.
 ''Most people see these stores as a negative when they come into their neighborhoods,'' said James Tate, 26, who developed that proposal with Harris Ford and Sini Kamppari. ''By taking those types of stores and combining them with other kinds of large-scale public space -- everything from parks to gardens -- you could create a new form of public space, which could actually benefit the city.''
 Another proposal envisions using new paving materials that allow vegetation to grow between the pavement's squares, to create an adaptable landscape that could be used for sports fields, farmers' markets and parking for 31,000 vehicles.
 ''There is a great potential for big-box stores to do good, to be a positive force in urban areas, to move from the fringe into a place in the urban fabric, as long as it's handled in a sensitive manner,'' said Neil Sondgeroth, 24, who designed the proposal with Weston Walker. 
 (Mr. Sondgeroth cited Le Corbusier as an inspiration, but he admitted that he was also influenced by his current part-time job in the hardware department of a sprawling Lowe's home-improvement store on the outskirts of New Haven.)
 Perhaps the most fantastic proposal conceives of Red Hook as a ''self-contained world that operates on its own logic,'' according to Jacob Reidel, 27, who collaborated with E. Sean Bailey and Shelley Zhang. The three were fascinated by model-railroad hobbyists, who create neatly ordered worlds. 
 ''It's not a far stretch to see those impulses guiding not just Robert Moses, but more contemporary planners as well,'' Mr. Reidel said. 
 Their proposal would preserve a core of historic buildings but erect a thin ''curtain'' of high-rise buildings directly to their east. On the other side of the curtain, the Red Hook Houses -- one of the city's oldest and largest public housing projects, built in 1938 -- would be reconfigured into suburban-style ''bungalows'' reminiscent of those in early streetcar suburbs. Farther east and south would be an ''agricultural zone'': community gardening on a grand scale. 
 Edward Mitchell, who organized the exhibition, praised the students' willingness to indulge in the implausible. ''They have the advantage of being able to be visionary, and not getting caught up in the real-world stuff too early,'' said Mr. Mitchell, an adjunct assistant professor of architecture at Yale. ''The interesting part of any urban vision is it rarely gets built, but that vision may feed the thinking of the public over a longer term.''
 The Bloomberg administration, which has been squabbling with the operator of the Red Hook container terminal over the city's plans for redevelopment of the waterfront piers, seems to have taken no notice of the exhibition, but it has drawn some buzz -- not all positive -- since it opened on July 22.
 The exhibition was featured on Curbed, a blog at www.curbed.com that focuses on real estate, prompting several residents to express alarm. ''As an architect who lives in Red Hook, all I can say is please stop!!!'' one person wrote on the Web site. Another asked: ''Do they teach context in architecture school anymore? Or do they just teach people to pursue an egotistical vision no matter what the impact is on people?'' 
 Steve McFarland, who runs a blog called B61 Productions, at www.b61productions.com, named for a bus line that serves Red Hook, said that the griping was understandable, because both longtime residents and urban pioneers feared being engulfed by big-box stores and the resulting traffic -- or displaced by rising rents. ''Nobody is taking into account the history of the place in their plans,'' he said.
 Others saw the show in a different light. Anna M. Hagen, a sculptor who lives in Ditmas Park and is a vice president of the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, said the students' proposals would have been preferable to what she sees as the haphazard development now taking place. 
 ''If Yale had presented these drawings three years ago, and Red Hook had a possibility of choosing among them, it would have been a beautiful thing,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Equity Firm Is Acquiring Owner of Resorts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The owner of the Mammoth, Stratton and Whistler ski resorts agreed yesterday to be acquired by a private equity firm, the Fortress Investment Group, for about $1.81 billion cash. 
 The acquisition of the resort owner, the Intrawest Corporation, whose properties include the luxury safari operator Abercrombie & Kent and the Tremblant ski resort in Quebec, is the biggest buyout of a publicly traded resort operator.
The cash offer of $35 a share is a 32 percent premium over Intrawest's closing price Thursday. The offer also calls for Fortress to assume roughly $992 million in debt, according to an Intrawest spokesman.
 Intrawest shares surged $7.69, or 29 percent, to $34.20. 
 An analyst with Intrawest's largest holder, Pirate Capital, called the $35 bid ''a great price'' and said the hedge fund would support the deal. Pirate began buying shares about 18 months ago and had pressed Intrawest to bolster returns.
 ''With the real estate headwinds and consumer sentiment wavering, it's hard for public shareholders to value the company as it should be valued,'' the analyst, Stephanie Tran, said.
 Among other properties, Intrawest owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, a heli-skiing operation; the Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort in Florida; and Club Intrawest, a private resort club network in North America. It also owns ski properties in Colorado, West Virginia and Vermont.
 Fortress sees the company's diverse leisure properties as growth opportunities and will pursue new growth initiatives, the chief executive of Intrawest, Joseph S. Houssian.
 The acquisition requires the approval of regulators and two-thirds of votes cast by Intrawest shareholders. The deal has the backing of Intrawest's directors and is expected to close in October.

HEADLINE: An Audit Sharply Criticizes Iraq's Bookkeeping

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Aug. 11 

 BODY:
An audit by the international accounting firm Ernst & Young portrays Iraq as a country that cannot keep its books straight, where elementary accounting errors of up to a billion dollars are routine and where no one can say how much of the country's oil revenues end up in government coffers.
 An auditing board sponsored by the United Nations, which had hired Ernst & Young to carry out the work, posted a summary of the findings on its Web site late Thursday. The audit focused on the nearly $22 billion that Iraq generated in 2005 from oil revenues, which form the basis for virtually the entire national economy. 
 But in a country in need of every dollar it can generate to restore a crumbling infrastructure, pay government salaries and train its security forces, the auditors found enormous sums simply deposited in the wrong government account or counted differently by various official agencies. The actual oil exports could not be determined accurately because Iraq still does not have modern equipment for measuring what its pipelines pour into tankers.
 The panel, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board of the Development Fund for Iraq, was created by the United Nations to supervise an account dominated by Iraqi oil revenues but also including interest payments and money seized from Saddam Hussein's government.
 Referring to the tracking of money from the development fund, sometimes called the D.F.I., the board said in statement that ''overall control systems are ineffective,'' and that the government's financial institution suffered from a ''lack of written policies and procedures'' and ''staff who are not properly trained to deal with the nature and complexity of D.F.I. transactions.''
 Those transactions are largely overseen by the Central Bank of Iraq and the Ministry of Finance. Late Friday, the Muslim Sabbath, a spokesman for the ministry, said that he had no specific knowledge of the findings. An e-mail message to Sinan Alshabibi, the governor of the Central Bank, was not returned.
 But Assim Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil, raised the possibility that some of the discrepancies could go beyond simple accounting errors and instead be related to the official corruption that many investigators have found to be endemic in Iraq.
 ''Any amount that has been spent illegally by any side will be followed up and reviewed by Iraqi institutions,'' he said, ''and it will be brought back.''
 When asked about the audit, Elizabeth Colton, a spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Iraq, said in a written statement: ''The embassy is working to support the government of Iraq's continuing efforts to strengthen its financial institutions and controls.''
 The audit found that in 2005, Iraq made nearly $22 billion by exporting 509,588,308 barrels of oil at an average price of $43 a barrel.
 But even those basic figures were in dispute, the audit found. Files at the State Oil Marketing Organization, which oversees oil exports, indicated 845,534 fewer barrels exported than recorded by production companies in Basra, where the oil goes out to tankers in the Persian Gulf. The organization's contracting and bidding procedures were also in disarray, the audit found.
 Once the exports generated revenues, the money was improperly accounted for again and again, the audit found. In one case, $211 million was deposited straight into the government marketing group's accounts rather than the approved United Nations account for all Iraqi oil revenues.
 In another instance, over $1 billion in oil money ended up in an accounting netherworld at the Central Bank because payments to various Iraqi ministries were not recorded when they were made. Other instances of accounting errors involving hundreds of millions of dollars appeared to be common.
 The findings echoed those of an earlier audit of the 2004 oil revenues, indicating that few reforms had been made in the interim. ''The audit reports continue to be critical of the financial and accounting control systems in place,'' the board said.

HEADLINE: The Spoils Of Victimhood

BYLINE: By THOMAS FRANK. 
Thomas Frank is the author, most recently, of ''What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America.'' He will be a guest columnist during August.; Maureen Dowd is on leave. John Tierney has the day off.

 BODY:
''President Bush operates in Washington like the head of a small occupying army of insurgents,'' the pundit Fred Barnes writes in his recent book, ''Rebel-in-Chief.'' ''He's an alien in the realm of the governing class, given a green card by voters.''
 Let's see: These insurgents today control all three branches of government; they are underwritten by the biggest of businesses; they are backed by a robust social movement with chapters across the radio dial. The insurgency spreads before its talented young recruits all the appurtenances of power -- a view from the upper stories of the Heritage Foundation, a few years at a conquered government agency where expertise is not an issue, then a quick transition to K Street, to a chateau in Rehoboth and a suite at the Ritz. For the truly rebellious, princely tribute waits to be extracted from a long queue of defense contractors, sweatshop owners and Indian casinos eager to remain in the good graces of the party of values. 
What a splendid little enterprise American conservatism has turned out to be. 
 How does this work? How does the right keep its adherents in a lather against government bureaucrats and Washington know-it-alls when conservatives are the only bureaucrats and know-it-alls who matter anymore? 
 Part of the answer is that, after their crushing defeat in the 1930's, conservatives rebuilt their movement by adopting a purely negative stance against liberalism. They were so completely excluded from power, they believed, that in 1955 William F. Buckley Jr. famously depicted them ''Standing athwart history, yelling Stop.'' Writing in the middle of the Reagan years, the journalist Sidney Blumenthal gaped at the persistence of this ''adversarial'' mind-set long after the liberals had been routed. ''Even when conservatives are in power they refuse to adopt the psychology of an establishment,'' he marveled. 
 Here we are, 20 years later, and to hear conservatives tell it, every election is still a referendum on the monster liberalism, which continues to loom like a colossus over the land. Even Tom DeLay -- the erstwhile ''hammer'' -- becomes a martyr when addressing the faithful. ''The national media has taken my own re-election as their own personal jihad,'' he moaned in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. ''So we're fighting the fight of ages.''
 That conservatives continue, as Rick Perlstein writes, to ''soak in [their] marginalization'' four decades after the election of the last liberal president puts this victimology beyond implausible. It is more on the order of a foundational myth, like the divine right of kings, a fiction that everyone involved must accept as fact. 
 A century ago, it was conservative stalwarts, not liberal reformers, who were the natural party of government. And they were forthright about what they stood for as well as what they were against: They were for rule by a better class of people, for a Hamiltonian state in which business was unified with government. And conservatism is still for those things, tacitly at least. Just look at the resumes of the folks the president has appointed to the Departments of Labor, Agriculture and the Interior. Or scan one of the graphs that economists use to chart the distribution of wealth over the last hundred years. The more egalitarian society we grew up in is gone, snuffed out by the party of tradition in favor of an even rosier past that lies on the far side of the 1930's.
 These ought to be easy things to deplore. They ought to arouse precisely the kind of simmering fury that millions of Americans feel toward lewd halftime shows and checkout clerks who don't say ''Merry Christmas.'' But we have difficulty holding conservatives accountable for them, so potent is their brand image as angry outsiders. What conservatives do, as everyone knows, is protest government, protest modernity; to hold them responsible for government or for modernity is to bring on cognitive dissonance.
 Or, rather, it might bring on cognitive dissonance. We don't know because puncturing conservatism's marginalization fantasy hasn't really been tried. If liberals are ever to recover, this will have to change. Against the tired myth of the ''liberal elite'' they must offer a competing and convincing theory of how Washington works, and for whom.

HEADLINE: Despite a Rise in Retail Sales, Indexes Drop on Broad Investor Worries

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Shares dropped yesterday in light trading after Apple said its mishandling of employee stock options would require it to make significant changes in its third-quarter results compared with last year's earnings. The major indexes ended the week with losses.
 Investors also had broader worries, especially fears of an economic slowdown. A steep increase in retail sales did little to allay those worries. 
 ''We're in a seasonally slow part of the year, and there are a lot of unknowns on the horizon right now,'' said Mike Malone, a trading analyst at Cowen & Company. ''Based on that, there really is no urgency to get overly aggressive.''
 Every sector fell despite the cheery retail sales numbers reported by the Commerce Department. Retail sales rebounded in July by 1.4 percent, the biggest gain in six months. June's revised sales numbers were down 0.4 percent, much weaker than the 0.1 percent dip originally reported.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.34 points, or 0.33 percent, to 11,088.03.
 Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.07 points, or 0.40, to 1,266.74, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 14.03 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,057.71.
 The S.& P. 500 has been trading in a narrow range from 1,225 to 1,280 since mid-May. The bottom of the range is supported by stock valuations, but the top is held by concerns about economic growth, Mr. Malone said.
 Any optimism investors feel is fragile. Investors had been waiting for the Federal Reserve to pause its streak of interest rate increases and when it did, on Tuesday, stocks fell anyway.
 ''There's a sense that the market's never happy,'' said Ryan Larson, a senior trader at Voyageur Asset Management in Chicago. ''They want one thing and when they get it, the next day we're on to something else.''
 For the week, the Dow lost 152.32 points, or 1.36 percent. The S.& P. lost 12.62 points, or 0.99 percent, and the Nasdaq dropped 27.34 points, or 1.31 percent.
 Bonds fell 9/32, to 99 8/32, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note at 4.97 percent, up from 4.93 percent on Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies; gold prices were also mixed.
 Crude oil futures rose. A barrel of light crude settled at $74.35, up 35 cents, in New York trading.
 Investors in technology stocks are closely watching the backdating scandal, which has already resulted in five indictments and a series of restatement announcements. More than 80 companies are undertaking voluntary reviews of their options or are being investigated by government regulators.
 Apple fell 42 cents, to $63.65. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Apple said it expected to have to restate past results to take noncash charges for compensation costs related to stock-option-granting practices. 
 Juniper Networks said after the close of regular trading Thursday that its board concluded that the company would need to restate past financial results to record additional noncash charges for option grant expenses.
 Juniper fell 68 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.22, after its announcement about its options.
 In other trading, shares in the Mills Corporation fell $6.52, or 29 percent, to $16.07 after Bank of America downgraded the real estate investment trust because the company said that it would delay filing its quarterly report and that it expected accounting errors to lower past earnings by as much as $210 million.
 The resort operator, Intrawest, rose $7.67, or 29 percent, to $34.18 after it agreed to be acquired by the private equity firm Fortress Investment Group for about $1.81 billion cash. The $35-per-share cash offer represents a 32 percent premium over Intrawest's Thursday closing price of $26.51 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Evercore Rises in Its Debut
By Reuters

 Shares in the boutique investment bank Evercore Partners surged more than 18 percent yesterday in their market debut, snapping a string of disappointing initial public offerings from similar companies.
 The bank raised $82.95 million in the initial public offering, giving it an initial market capitalization of almost $570 million.
 An active market in mergers and acquisitions and in underwriting has bolstered the recent earnings of many established investment banks, but share prices have suffered for smaller rivals that went public this year.
 Evercore's initial shares were priced at $21. They closed up $3.85, or 18.3 percent, to $24.85.
 Only 20 of the 137 initial offerings this year have priced above range, and Evercore is the only finance offering to price above range, according to the data tracker Dealogic.

HEADLINE: There's More Than the Currency Advantage Behind China's Export Surge 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE United States trade deficit narrowed ever so slightly in June, but the mild improvement did not deter renewed calls in Washington for a substantial currency revaluation by China to make American exports more competitive. Congress is again threatening to take protectionist measures unless China does more than allow the gradual appreciation of the currency that it began last year.
 The chart at right shows the amazing rise of Chinese exports to the rest of the world compared with the total amount of United States exports to its trading partners. As recently as 1993, the first year of Bill Clinton's presidency, they amounted to just a fifth of the United States total, but they had climbed to nearly a third of the total by 2000, the last year of Mr. Clinton's administration. 
Since then, the rise has been meteoric. By 2003, Chinese exports had expanded to 60 percent of the American total, and in 2005 the figure hit 84 percent. With June figures now reported by all major countries, Chinese exports amounted to 90 percent of the United States total in the first half of this year.
 In most export products, Chinese companies compete with other Asian concerns, not with American or European ones, in large part because of the widely different wage rates. That makes it unlikely that a substantial Chinese revaluation would, in and of itself, do much to stimulate American exports. Conceivably, however, by making Chinese citizens feel richer, and by cutting the prices of goods imported to China, it might stimulate demand for products from the United States and other countries.
 But the immediate effect of such a revaluation might be to propel the dollar value of Chinese exports up, enabling it to pass the United States in terms of export value, and perhaps setting off demands in Washington for even more action.
 Not that long ago, the complaints in Washington were about unfair trade practices of Japan, not China. The second chart shows Japanese exports, again as a percentage of the United States total. They peaked in 1986 at 93 percent of the American total, but then fell back as the decline of the dollar, which had begun in 1985 after the Plaza accord of major industrialized nations began to have an impact.
 The bursting of Japan's bubble in 1990, and the lackluster Japanese economy during the decade that followed, caused export growth in Japan to lag that of the United States. By 2001, the Japanese were down to just 55 percent of the United States pace. They then grew faster than the United States for a few years, but are lagging this year.
 Some economists have voiced fears that a slowdown in the United States would cause the rest of the world, particularly Asia, to suffer. But Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, notes that American imports, adjusted for inflation, are already growing much less rapidly than they did in the late 1990's, without any apparent impact on China's soaring trade surpluses. He notes that Europe's share of China's exports has been growing.
 And while the United States is still the world's No. 1 exporter, that is nothing compared with its dominance of the other end of the trade equation. In the first half of this year, it imported more than China and Germany put together, and three times as much as Japan.
 That reflects the huge United States imbalance of trade in goods. Germany imported 83 cents worth of goods for each dollar of exports, a penny less than China and 7 cents less than Japan. The United States imported $1.82 worth of goods for each dollar's worth it exported.

HEADLINE: Ben Wood, Our Man In Shanghai

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE

 BODY:
BEN WOOD has neither the theory-ridden vocabulary nor the matte-black wardrobe typical of maverick architects these days. With his gentle paunch, worn leather sandals and grizzly white beard, he comes across as more of a couch potato than a man of action, though the vintage Chinese army motorcycle and sidecar hint at an adventurous spirit.
 Still, over the last five years Mr. Wood has transformed himself from a successful Boston architect into a Shanghai powerbroker whose designs translate into billions of dollars in development.
The profession's big players are flocking to China to compete for commissions. Even the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas has raved about the opportunities to be had. But Mr. Wood is one of the very few allowed to build whole neighborhoods without a local associate or a government institute to sign the construction documents. At his occasional public appearances in the United States, architects line up to seek his advice on how to get in on the action. 
 ''I'm trying to change China, and China has definitely changed me,'' Mr. Wood said during a recent interview on Martha's Vineyard, where he and his wife were camping in a safari-style tent. ''People have no idea of the scope of the work that's up for grabs right now. It's like the Wild West was in America.'' 
 The turning point for Mr. Wood, now 58, was his 2003 Xintiandi project in downtown Shanghai, a $200 million two-block ''entertainment environment'' stuffed with modern restaurants, clubs, cafes and boutiques, accessorized with old bricks, stone gates and ornately carved wooden balconies from the dense warren of old courtyard houses that previously filled those blocks. Xintiandi proved so successful a model for urban redevelopment that it spawned at least dozens of duplicates across the country. Developers now use the term ''to Xintiandi'' when asking their architects for more aspirational China-lite designs. 
 Critics, however, argue that he has undermined the need to preserve China's fast-vanishing architectural heritage with a pastiche that is only one photo-op away from Disneyland. In The New Yorker magazine Paul Goldberger described Xintiandi as ''a stage set of an idyllic past, created so that people in China can experience the same finely wrought balance of theme park and shopping mall that increasingly passes for upscale urban life in the United States.''
 Qingyun Ma, an internationally respected architect in China, said that Xintiandi's influence ''is such that every city wants to have one.'' 
 ''Even I myself have done projects that are Xintiandi-ish,'' he said. ''However, this unchallenged embrace of one way is a threat because it abandons other modes of historical practice.''
 Mr. Wood has applied his formula to projects all over mainland China, from Chongqing to Wuhan to Hangzhou. In Hangzhou he adapted 10 blocks of a sleepy lakeside area into a resort with pagoda-style roof-scapes, trellis-covered walkways and a high-tech conference center. For his $80 million Cambridge Watertown project in Zhujiajiao, he has proposed narrow canals inspired by China's 13th-century water-town plans stitched together with picturesque foot bridges and semi-detached contemporary-style condos. 
 When he ambles through the streets of Shanghai these days, Mr. Wood said, ''some still walk up to me because they recognize me, and they are happy and proud of the new life'' in their old neighborhood. It sometimes turns out that the well-wishers have been forced out of their homes and into new high-rise apartment buildings elsewhere by Mr. Wood's projects.
 ''Wood is a star in China,'' said Cliff Pierson, an editor at Architectural Record magazine who manages a biannual awards program for new Chinese architecture. ''China needed someone like Wood to show them you can make more money by saving rather than tearing down old buildings. No one had done that before because it was so much easier to work with a blank slate.
 ''Now there are dozens of copycats. But it's not so much the number that's so influential but that Wood has changed the way people with money think about public places.''
 In Shanghai, Mr. Wood is now undertaking the next chapter for Xintiandi: a complete theater district with four Broadway-style performance spaces, two of which he promises will be ''Andrew Lloyd Weberesque,'' with 2,800 seats. For the project, now under way, Kohn Pedersen Fox architects have also designed a futuristic oval-shaped skyscraper, which will be accompanied by at least three other towers, along with a Times-Square-like intersection featuring huge electronic billboards and -- a favorite Wood feature -- an artificial lake. 
 A popular open-air antiques row, now home to some 180 dealers, will be dismantled, upgraded and rebuilt in replicate form. About 40 ''top dealers'' will be readmitted. Underground the whole thing connects to five levels of parking.
 Mr. Wood casts himself as a kind of swashbuckling suit. After stints as a fighter pilot, restaurateur, ski bum and contractor, he earned his architecture degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984, when he was 37. He then spent 10 years working for Ben Thompson, the architect and mastermind of something known in the industry as the festival marketplace. Most visible in places like Faneuil Hall in Boston and South Street Seaport in New York, it is an economic juggernaut of arguable distinction wherein the dilapidated gives way to the upscale and the trendy, all with a dash of old-time historical flavor.
 ''Ben Thompson taught me that architecture should be about more than just making buildings that don't fall down,'' Mr. Wood said. He gestured toward a stack of carved timbers from a 150-year-old Chinese temple that he'd seen on the back of a truck in China. He talked the driver into selling them and now intends to build with them on property he owns in Martha's Vineyard.
 The call to go to China came in 1998, when Mr. Wood was running an architecture practice with Carlos Zapata in Boston. (His best-known project with Mr. Zapata was a controversial stadium renovation at Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears.) The two were invited along with several Western architectural firms, including Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, to enter a Hong Kong developer's competition for a two-block neighborhood in old Shanghai. There was a catch: the site had to be cleared of undesirable elements, and the job had to be well under way by May 1999 in time for an official visit already scheduled by President Jiang Zemin.
 While other architects suggested tearing out the old rabbit warren of courtyard houses, built by the French in the 1860's on interlaced narrow lanes, Mr. Wood said he could design around and with them. He got the job.
 Working in Shanghai was a revelation. He did not speak Mandarin, and he hiked around the city for miles so he would be able to find his way back to his hotel without relying on a cab. ''If you say 'the Ritz,' some cabdrivers won't understand you,'' Mr. Wood said. ''They call it 'Por-ta-ma-na' after John Portman, the architect who designed it.''
 To get a feel for the local vernacular, he asked guides to take him to any place that hadn't changed much for a hundred years or since before there was electricity. He was especially struck, he said, by the street life along the narrow alleys in the older parts of the French Concession. Private life was conducted in public to a degree he had not witnessed elsewhere. ''They even walk around outside in their pajamas and underwear if it's hot,'' Mr. Wood recalled.
 At Xintiandi, Mr. Wood fostered communal feeling in somenotably un-Chinese ways. Despite having been warned that there is no Chinese tradition for alfresco dining, he designed the neighborhood to be chockablock with outdoor cafes. He also created a wide esplanade sweeping along the edge of an artificial lake. 
 Photographs show a waterfront view with a swath of well-kept lawn, a string of lampposts along a stone path and various high-rises twinkling at night in the background: hardly a traditional vista for Shanghai. But local residents have made it their own, Mr. Wood said, coming down in droves on summer nights to gather for ballroom dancing or to play Canto Pop on their boomboxes. Xintiandi is also a magnet for foreign tourists, who flock to its clubs by night. 
 To make way for all this, many of the 4,500 people who used to live there had to be relocated to modern apartment buildings; those who did not want to go, Mr. Wood acknowledged, were likely to find their roofs removed. Such forced relocations are frequently criticized by foreigners. Locals, perhaps used to even more radical changes, seem to take them more in stride. Mr. Wood himself simply says that everyone was fairly compensated. As for the old schoolhouse where Mao attended the first meeting of the Communist Party, it has been preserved. 
 Local land values are now soaring. But Mr. Wood said he was most proud of the way that Xintiandi has attracted small entrepreneurs who are buying and renting shop fronts for their own boutique businesses. 
 ''I was working in unknown territory, and sometimes it was scary,'' he said of that first project. ''At the same time here was someplace where I could do more in 15 years than most architects do in their entire careers.'' So in 2004 he decided to move to China full time. 
 Two years later he still comes across as a hyped-up romantic who relishes the prospect of living big and does not concern himself overmuch with compromises that a more fastidious architect might refuse. 
 To succeed he has had to learn fast about a place where the word for ''fake'' is a compliment, meaning something that did not cost full price. Certain back-alley copy shops, he learned by grim experience, sell duplicates of the computer discs that architects drop off for reproduction. It may be only a matter of hours before a PowerPoint presentation of a new design is available for sale in a pirated edition. 
 As a result so-called fake firms abound, he said. Mr. Wood said he sometimes interviewed young Chinese designers who proudly show him work he knows was actually done by well-known firms like SOM, Cesar Pelli, Kohn Pedersen Fox or even his own.
 Mr. Wood has also learned the finer points of etiquette: how to plan for the procession of V.I.P.'s visiting the construction site in their black cars, or whether to wear a tie to meetings with representatives of the government (which typically has a 10 percent stake in most large-scale construction). The more elite the official is, the less likely he'll be to wear a tie. To get the job, it pays to show confidence and follow suit.
 In spite of such complexities, Mr. Wood said that building in China had an appealing immediacy. ''In the United States you are not allowed as an architect to speak to a worker on a construction site, make a suggestion or help figure out a design flaw when it crops up,'' he said, lamenting the protocols regarding liabilities and the union regulations that govern most American construction sites. On an American project, ''you can't say anything at all without a lawyer in tow,'' he added. ''In China they often don't even bother with contracts.''
 Mr. Wood has opened a martini bar, called DR (for Design Research, in tribute to a store founded by Ben Thompson that was a forerunner to Crate & Barrel), in Xintiandi that has become a pit stop for architects and developers visiting from abroad. ''It has a definite vibe, part SoHo, part Rick's Place,'' said Mr. Pierson of the Architectural Record. ''A lot of expats go there, and Wood loves holding court. He wears that beard, and in China they tend to automatically respect people with white beards.''
 Mr. Pierson acknowledged that Mr. Wood's approach to architecture would not go over well with Western preservationists. ''He keeps facades, moves pieces around, adds windows where there were none,'' he said. ''If he were doing that with historic properties in the U.S., I would be more critical. But for China saving even bits and pieces is an important leap. Ten years from now when preservation there has become more sophisticated, they'll be able to look back and say this was the first important step.'' 
 For Henry Ng of the World Monuments Fund, freewheeling economic development is '' a threat more lethal than razing buildings.'' And Mr. Wood's design approach is appealing to Chinese developers because it shows that ''preservation can be profitable,'' said Mr. Ng, who was reached by e-mail while touring the hutong, or ancient city lanes, in Beijing. 
 Mr. Wood is dismissive of the complaints that his projects have a theme-park air. ''That's only because they are so clean,'' he said. ''As for authenticity, consider this: Every sidewalk paver is made of hand-hammered granite. It takes a day to install four of them.''
 Preservation, he said, is not his goal anyway: ''The real point is not the architecture of the place, but the new life a place attracts. The hutong probably should be torn down. They can't even accommodate sewage pipes, let alone cables for everything else people need today. That doesn't mean destroy the kind of place they were.''
 Still, the heady days when this corner of the world was a Western architect's oyster may be winding down. Chinese architects want the commissions for themselves. ''I don't like being confronted at every meeting with a room full of architects staring at me resentfully,'' Mr. Wood said, adding, ''The window is closing quite fast.''
 For the next stage in his career he wants to design eco-resorts in Yunnan Province, a rolling mountainous and pasture region near the Tibetan border that was renamed Shangri-La to attract tourism development. He envisions visitors staying in tents much like his own on Martha's Vineyard.
 He has also bought an old Tibetan farmhouse that he hopes to renovate and where he might be able to keep and fly a 1947 Seabee plane he has had restored.
 ''I'm going to stay in China a while longer,'' he said. ''There are limits to what I can do in the United States. I don't fit in with the C.E.O. culture there. But in China being flamboyant is a good thing.''

HEADLINE: Saving the Earth, And Saving Money 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

 BODY:
HIGH energy costs are helping to persuade American companies that they need to embrace environmentally friendly practices, says Gwen Ruta, who is in charge of creating and managing corporate partnerships for Environmental Defense, a nonprofit group based in New York. Here are excerpts from a conversation: 


Q. Why should companies care about their environmental impact?

A. They need to care because if they don't, their stakeholders do and they're going to hear about it. On the other side of the coin, there are all kinds of opportunities. Pollution is by definition waste, and waste by definition is costly. Finding a way to lessen your environmental impact is finding a way of running your business more efficiently.

Q. What has Wal-Mart done to improve its practices?

A. It's very standard in the industry to have these big trucks, these big 18-wheelers, idling when they are loading and off-loading, sometimes even overnight, to keep their air-conditioning running. Wal-Mart said no to that and said they were going to turn off the engine. They have installed some auxiliary power systems so the trucks can still be refrigerated. By doing that, they're reducing greenhouse gases by 100,000 tons a year, which is like taking 20,000 cars off the road. They're also saving themselves $25 million in the fuel it takes to keep those trucks idling. That's a good example of a win-win.
Secondly, they've announced to their suppliers that within the next five years, all the wild-caught fish that Wal-Mart sells will come from sustainability-certified fisheries. That's a very aggressive goal, and it sends a huge signal to the fishing supply community around the world. 

Q. Are these just public relations moves?

A. It may have started for P.R. reasons, but the more they've done, the more they've convinced themselves of the business benefits. They've seen the synergy between environmental innovation and business. A lot of it is about efficiency, and that's a hallmark of Wal-Mart.

Q. How do you put pressure on managements or boards to cooperate with you?

A. We certainly work with individuals all the way up to the top of a company. For example, we have a partnership with FedEx to help develop and deploy the first hybrid delivery trucks. We met with Fred Smith [the company's founder and chief executive] and Dave Bronczek, who is president of FedEx Express, and brought them along as allies.

Q. Don't you try to embarrass companies?

A. No. Maybe that's why companies will work with us.

Q. So how did you cooperate with FedEx?

A. We approached FedEx with the idea of creating the next generation of delivery trucks. The goal was simple but revolutionary: we wanted to change truck technology in America. We knew we needed a demand signal to do that, meaning we needed a big truck buyer to say to the manufacturers, ''We want you to do better.'' FedEx has amazing clout in the truck market so they were a great partner. Together we developed a set of performance goals for a new truck: it had to improve fuel efficiency by 50 percent, it had to reduce emissions of soot, or particulates, by 90 percent, and it had to deliver as many packages and carry as much weight as a regular FedEx truck. Then we challenged their suppliers to meet our specs. Now we have trucks on the road that are reducing soot by 90 percent and are going 50 percent farther on a gallon of fuel.

Q. What was the key technology?

A. It's not dissimilar from a Toyota Prius or the system that's in a hybrid car. It's a hybrid diesel-electric system.

Q. What will be the annual impact?

A. For every 10,000 hybrid trucks that replace conventional trucks on the road, we're looking at reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 80,000 tons, which is equivalent to planting two million trees. It would reduce diesel fuel usage by over seven million gallons and reduce nitrogen oxide, which causes smog, by about 1,700 tons. That would have the same effect as if you stopped traffic in New York City for a month.

Q. What will it take to change American automakers' thinking on fuel efficiency?

A. Two things have to happen. One is that we need to have a better national policy. We had the opportunity recently to increase fuel economy standards for American fleets, and we didn't do much with that. The other thing is that these corporate fleets are a good example of where we can use corporate purchasing power to make change up the supply chain.

Q. Are you optimistic that companies suddenly are more environmentally conscious?

A. I wouldn't say ''suddenly.'' It's like when a Hollywood star makes a breakout movie and people say he is an overnight success, but it's really taken 15 years to get to that point. The first partnership we had started in 1989 with McDonald's. We went to them and said, ''Hey, you've got way too much packaging here.'' Remember those Styrofoam clamshells? They were paying to buy them and paying to throw them away. We worked with them on a project that had 35 or 40 different recommendations. Eliminating the Styrofoam clamshells was the most visible outcome. That was 17 years ago and we've been working toward these goals ever since. I see the momentum building in the past few years. But it takes leadership on the part of these companies to make it happen.

HEADLINE: In Vino Veritas?

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

 BODY:
THIS is what a blessing looks like in the wine business: Wine Spectator, a handsome glossy monthly that markets itself as a field guide for wine aficionados, recently bestowed a rating of 90 on a 2004 cabernet sauvignon from the Valentin Bianchi Famiglia winery in Argentina. 
 This is what a blessing does: After the wine received the 90, Brian Zucker, who oversees online sales for K&L Wine Merchants, a large retailer in San Francisco, decided to promote the Valentin Bianchi cabernet in an e-mail message to tens of thousands of customers.
If it had scored an 89, Mr. Zucker said, ''we would have sold a tiny fraction of what we'll end up moving.'' But because of the 90, and considering the wine's price, $12.99, he declared himself ''absolutely confident'' that K&L would sell out its inventory of the Argentinean cabernet. 
 Mr. Zucker said he was promoting the Valentin Bianchi because he thought it an attractive buy even before Wine Spectator treated it to a 90. But that is hardly always the case with a high-scoring wine. ''A wine that is highly rated takes on a life of its own,'' he said. ''It doesn't necessarily represent the best value, but that doesn't seem to matter.'' 
 A rating system that draws a distinction between a cabernet scoring 90 and one receiving an 89 implies a precision of the senses that even many wine critics agree that human beings do not possess. Ratings are quick judgments that a single individual renders early in the life of a bottle of wine that, once expressed numerically, magically transform the nebulous and subjective into the authoritative and objective. 
 When pressed, critics allow that numerical ratings mean little if they are unaccompanied by corresponding tasting notes (''hints of blackberry,'' ''a good nose''). Yet in the hands of the marketers who have transformed wine into a multibillion-dollar industry, The Number is often all that counts. It is one of the wheels that keep the glamorous, lucrative machinery of the wine business turning, but it has become so overused and ubiquitous that it may well be meaningless -- other than as an index of how a once mystical, high-end product for the elite has become embroidered with the same marketing high jinks as other products peddled to the masses. 
 ''On many levels it's nonsensical,'' Joshua Greene, the editor and publisher of Wine & Spirits, said. He has been using the 100-point system to judge wines in his magazine for about a dozen years. 
 Mr. Greene's ratings, especially when he awards a 90 or higher, often figure prominently in newspaper advertisements and promotional materials. Still, he said of the 100-point scoring system, ''I don't think it's a very valuable piece of information.'' To Mr. Greene, The Number is an unfortunate remnant of a time long past, when America was only starting to appreciate wines sold in something other than a green glass jug -- akin to a set of training wheels that should have been removed years ago. 
 Yet Mr. Greene continues to use the 100-point system because he believes that he has no choice; to do otherwise is to court potential financial disaster. Because he is ''determined to find a way to talk about wine without using scores,'' he publishes a scoreless issue of Wine & Spirits once a year -- and then braces for a corresponding decline in circulation and advertising revenue.
 Once upon a time, a rating of 90 might have made a wine stand out. Today, so many critics are using the 100-point scale that the odds of a bottle earning a place on, say, Wine.com's listing of ''90+ Rated Wines Under $20'' have increased immeasurably -- in part because Wine.com, among other retailers, has joined the ranks of those scoring wines. 
 MANY wine buyers may think that The Number has the same integrity as the ratings that Consumer Reports bestows on products like cars or household appliances. But virtually every critic using the 100-point system deviates from the stringent standards that Consumer Reports, a nonprofit magazine, has adopted to ensure objectivity. 
 ''The deeper you get into this, the more you realize how misleading and misguided this all is,'' said William R. Tisherman, a former editor of Wine Enthusiast, who is more broadly known within the wine business by his nom de plume, Tish. Mr. Tisherman said he ''only reluctantly'' started using numbers to rate wines in Wine Enthusiast in the mid-1990's.
 Still, there is no denying the power of the 100-point system, no matter how flawed or hollow. It provides a simple point of reference in the often bewildering world of wine, a life preserver for anyone drowning in a sea of choice. As a consequence, its effects are felt throughout the industry. Even critics acknowledge that The Number has helped to elevate the overall quality of wine, and experts say it has also influenced the popularity of certain grapes that producers select. Its most direct impact, however, may be in the way that wine is sold. 
 Wine shop managers might dismiss ratings as overly simplistic -- numbers devoid of context, such as a merchant's sense of individual customer tastes. But the ratings are helping to feed two significant trends ripping through the business: the might of discount retailers like Costco and the growth of online retail outlets. For better or for worse, The Number is proving an effective stand-in for the knowledgeable wine shop salesclerk. 
 ''It's a guide,'' said Marvin R. Shanken, the editor and publisher of Wine Spectator, which helped to popularize the 100-point system. ''It's not an absolute.'' But a numerical score suggests anything but an approximation -- and try telling a winery suffering the economic consequences of a disappointing 89 for its signature vintage that The Number is nothing more than a guide. 
 ''Every day I have people come in the store,'' said Larry Leventhal, a manager of First Avenue Vintner in Manhattan, ''and they tell me they're not interested in hearing about any wine unless Parker gave it at least a 90.''
 IN the beginning there was Robert M. Parker Jr. This lawyer turned self-employed wine critic introduced the 100-point system to the wine world in 1978, when he started a wine buying guide called The Wine Advocate, published every two months. 
 Until that time, critics in both the United States and abroad tended to use a simple 5-point system -- if they used any scoring system at all. But Mr. Parker fashioned himself after Ralph Nader, a crusading consumer advocate on a quest, in this case to enlighten the discriminating wine buyer. Scoring wines on a scale of 50 to 100 seemed the perfect vehicle to advance his cause.
 ''Consumers understood the 100-point rating system almost viscerally,'' said Elin McCoy, author of ''The Emperor of Wine: The Rise of Robert M. Parker Jr. and the Reign of American Taste,'' published last month in paperback. ''Whatever a person knew or didn't know about wine, they understood that a grade of 98 is a good thing, and a 72 not so good.'' To avoid being influenced by the name or reputation of a winery, Mr. Parker tasted batches of wine together, slipping the bottles into individual paper bags and then mixing them up and rating each one. Under his system, a 96 to 100 is an extraordinary wine, 90 to 95 is excellent, and 80 to 89 is above average to very good.
 As Mr. Parker's influence grew, retailers started quoting ''Parker Points'' in advertisements and other promotional materials. That raised his profile and that of The Wine Advocate -- and inspired other publications, eager to market their own titles, to adopt a 100-point scale, Ms. McCoy said. Wine Spectator was the first, in the mid-1980's. 
 Wine Spectator actually began scoring wines in 1980, Mr. Shanken said, shortly after he paid $40,000 to buy it. A buying guide, he understood, would be crucial to the Spectator's success. The magazine experimented with 9- and 20-point scales before adopting the 100-point system. Mr. Shanken bristled when asked if he adopted the 100-point scale in a bid to emulate Mr. Parker's success, but he also gave his better-known rival his due. 
 ''He certainly deserves the credit for using it first in wine,'' Mr. Shanken said. 
 Another 10 years or so passed before the next set of magazines, Wine Enthusiast and Wine & Spirits, adopted 100-point systems, both in the mid-1990's. But by that time the American wine industry had changed notably. 
 Wine consumption in the United States began to grow appreciably beginning in the late 1960's, analysts say, but that translated primarily into a huge increase in the sale of jug wines, like Gallo's Hearty Burgundy and sweet fizzy concoctions like Riunite Lambrusco. 
 America's lusty embrace of pricier wines sold in 750-milliliter bottles did not start until about 1980, those same experts say. Mr. Parker and Mr. Shanken both rode and drove that trend. Today, those in the wine industry -- wine makers, wine merchants, wine writers and other self-described ''cork dorks'' -- say the United States is in the midst of a golden age of wine, in no small part because of the Parker scoring system.
 ''There's no doubt that the 100-point score has played a role in the growing popularity of wine,'' said Jon A. Fredrikson, a wine consultant in Woodside, Calif. 
 Per capita wine consumption in the United States fell in the 1980's, when the industry weathered a national antidrug campaign that lumped in alcoholic beverages with narcotics. The greatest factor in reversing that trend, Mr. Fredrikson said, was studies demonstrating the health benefits of moderate consumption of red wine. Assigning numerical scores to wines also proved pivotal, he said, as the uninitiated began looking for a way to distinguish one bottle of wine from another by a means other than price. 
 ''The retail trade didn't pay attention until we moved to the 100-point score,'' said Mr. Greene at Wine & Spirits, who had been using a four-star system to rate wines until he switched in 1994 or so. 
 Mr. Tisherman, then editor of Wine Enthusiast, also realized that he risked irrelevancy if he did not follow suit. He watched the Spectator use what Mr. Shanken called ''the advance''-- the scores his magazine sends out weeks ahead of the actual publication date so that retailers can stock up on highly rated wines -- to entrench itself as a central player in the wine industry.
 ''Basically the Spectator was saying, 'Use our numbers, which we'll send you ahead of time, so you can order a lot of that wine and then watch it fly out of the store,' '' Mr. Tisherman said. ''We didn't feel we had any choice.'' 
 Apparently, others felt the same way: today, at least a dozen sources publish a 100-point score, including assorted Web sites and Beverages and More, a 55-store chain in California. 
 The Number has also found a partner in shelf talkers -- the capsule wine reviews that sometimes adorn shelves beneath select bottles in retail outlets. ''The way the industry works now,'' said David Graves, a founder of Saintsbury Winery in Napa Valley, ''if you send out enough wine samples, you might get a real high number that you can put on your shelf talker.''
 Cork dorks say that even today, the only scores that count are those of the first two publications to embrace the 100-point score: Mr. Parker's Wine Advocate and Mr. Shanken's Wine Spectator. That has not stopped retailers from cherry-picking high scores no matter who comes up with them. Wine.com uses no less than seven sources when fishing for members of the 90+ club, including The Wine News, the Connoisseurs Guide and the International Wine Cellar. And in a pinch, Wine.com is not above turning to an eighth source.
 When promoting Capcanes 2001 Costers del Gravet, a Spanish wine, for instance, Wine.com quoted a well-regarded publication, International Wine Cellar, written by Stephen Tanzer, in its review. But the source of the 91 that earned the 2001 Costers a place on its 90+ list was Wine.com itself. (The company did not return a call seeking comment.)
 Consumer Reports, which began rating wines in 1997 (without a numerical system) never sells products it reviews and thus has no financial incentive to promote a product. In contrast, Wine Enthusiast operates an online wine store. Tim Moriarty, the magazine's managing editor, said that he and other editorial employees ''hardly ever have dealings with the sales part of the organization.'' 
 The sales arm employs its own wine critic, Josh Farrell, a professional sommelier. On the Wine Enthusiast Web site last week, no wine that he reviewed scored less than a 90. That, Mr. Farrell says in a note on the site, is because ''of our commitment to finding only the best.''
 Consumer Reports accepts no advertising -- again, to ensure that it steers clear of conflicts of interest. For that same reason, Mr. Parker runs no ads in The Wine Advocate. 
 The glossy magazines, of course, can make no similar claim; the economic health of publications like the Spectator and the Enthusiast are wholly dependent on the ad space they sell to many of the same wineries whose bottles they review. And Mr. Parker himself does not meet one of the gold standards established by Consumer Reports, whose testers refuse freebies. Like other tasters, Mr. Parker primarily tests sample bottles sent to him at no cost. 
 ''It'd be economically impossible to buy all those wines, especially the ones that are $100 to $300 to $500 a bottle,'' said Mr. Shanken, who noted that the Spectator rates a minimum of 12,000 wines a year. All the Spectator's tastings are blind, Mr. Shanken said, in contrast to those of some rivals. 
 Tim Moriarty at Wine Enthusiast said his magazine ''encourages,'' but does not require, his reviewers to perform blind tastings.
 Yet no critic working for a print publication seems to wrestle with the conflicts that regularly confront Wilfred Wong of Beverages and More, the retail chain. Mr. Wong allows that working as a wine critic inside a large retail operation can be tricky. At times, he said, his bosses nudge him to lavish a high score on a wine, especially one that has failed to earn a 90+ from Mr. Parker or Mr. Shanken's crew of critics. His bosses may have secured a good price on a big shipment of wine but that does not necessarily mean, Mr. Wong said, that he treats it to a good score.
 ''We have fights all the time,'' Mr. Wong said. His reputation among the chain's customers, he said, keeps him honest -- a view the founders of Beverages and More say they support. 
 Still, Michael De Loach, the vice president of the Hook and Ladder winery in Sonoma County, wonders if scoring mania is healthy for the industry. ''Wilfred is a bona fide wine guy, but really, think about it, who needs Parker when you can make up your own numbers?'' Mr. De Loach said. ''If Parker or Spectator don't give you a high enough score, you can make up your own.''
 THE 100-point rating system is imperfect, said James Laube, the Spectator's chief critic of California wines. But he also sees it as the best safeguard against paying too much for a painfully mediocre product, especially if someone takes the time to read his tasting notes. 
 ''I don't see how it can be harmful for consumers when you have 4 or 6 or 10 people offer an opinion on a bottle of wine,'' Mr. Laube said. ''I think it's a very valuable service to let people know if there are imperfections in a wine.'' 
 Almost any oenophile will tell you that wines have improved in recent years. They cite factors including global warming and advances in the science of viticulture, but also the widespread adoption of the Parker scoring system. 
 ''Over all, it's been one of the most important things elevating the quality of wines around the world,'' said Mr. Fredrikson, the wine consultant. ''Producers care about their scores.'' 
 Yet there are grumblings that some wine makers may care too much about them. It is easy to start an argument in the wine industry by positing that many wine makers fashion wines to please the palettes of Mr. Parker, Mr. Laube and other high-profile critics. Mr. Parker and the critics from Wine Spectator tend to save their highest ratings for robust-tasting, more intense wines, and consultants like Enologix, based in Sonoma, Calif., understand that. In its promotional materials, Enologix promises to use chemistry to ''assist wine makers'' in ''boosting average national critics' scores.'' 
 Some fear that the worldwide influence of Mr. Parker, who has been described as the planet's most powerful critic, will eventually mean a homogenization of wines. ''It is perhaps a shame that the two dominant sources of wine advice in the U.S., the estimable Robert Parker of The Wine Advocate and the diligent team at Wine Spectator, seem to favor approximately the same styles of wine,'' Jancis Robinson, author of ''The Oxford Companion to Wine,'' wrote in an e-mail exchange.
 Ms. Robinson, who is based in Britain, uses a 20-point rating system, though she wrote that she is ''not enamored'' of numerical scoring.
 Analysts say that the rating system, at least as deployed in the United States, favors certain varietals. Wines made from so-called noble grapes -- cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and chardonnay -- tend to dominate the 90+ lists because they tend to be more complex wines with blockbuster potential. Wines using chenin blanc grapes, on the other hand, taste less powerful by comparison. So simpler wines like chenin blancs tend not to generate show-off scores.
 ''That's another way numbers are misguiding people,'' said Mr. Tisherman, the former Wine Enthusiast editor who now calls himself a ''recovering critic'' and helps clients sponsor wine-tasting parties. ''A 96 is better than an 86, but not if you want a light-bodied wine, and Americans tend to prefer light-bodied wines. Yet those are also the wines least likely to get a good score.''
 Mr. Tisherman argues that it is time to drop the 100-point system because it limits the spectrum of wines that sell well. Still, the 100-point scale may have once been a useful bridge, he and others said, helping many Americans attain a more refined, perhaps even European, preference for premium bottles. If current trends continue, the United States will pass Italy in two years as the world's second-largest consumer of wine, behind France. (But that is only in total volume: America still does not rate in the top 25 countries in per capita consumption.) 
 In recognition of this growing sophistication, Mr. De Loach says it is time to switch to a three- or four-star rating system because ''applying a 100-point scale to wine is dishonest. It makes the consumer think it's scientific.'' He expressed his appreciation for the publications that have established their reputations by using it, but also declared it a ''noble experiment whose time is over.''

HEADLINE: This Pause May Depend On Prices

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve has chosen a wait-and-see approach on inflation and economic growth, and the central bankers will not have to wait long for a sign that their work is done -- or not. The Fed and Wall Street are likely to pay close attention to reports this week on July inflation. 
 Data on producer prices are scheduled for Tuesday and consumer prices on Wednesday.
''Those are critical numbers,'' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors. A Bloomberg News poll of economists predicts increases of 0.2 percent in core producer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy items, and 0.3 percent in core consumer prices.
 The stock market has experienced wide swings since the Fed decided last week to hold the target on its key interest rate at 5.25 percent. Buyers evidently zeroed in on the absence of an 18th consecutive rate increase, while sellers appeared to focus on the Fed's statement suggesting that further increases were ahead if the data warranted them.
 Mr. Koesterich cautioned that the inflation figures this week might relieve the bulls of some of their hope that the tightening cycle is over.
 ''The risk is that both core numbers will be higher than expected,'' he said. ''In the last couple of employment reports, hourly earnings have been above expectations, and we're also seeing capacity constraints in manufacturing. It's not clear to me that inflationary pressures are behind us.''
 What is clearer to him is that the Fed has an extra incentive to raise rates again if further signs of rising prices appear.
 ''The Fed has spent 25 years building credibility with the market,'' he said. ''Given the new composition of the Fed, it's something they don't want to lose.''
 Wall Street may find the Fed and its new chairman credible, but it will not like the prospect of more tightening. 
 If the inflation data this week exceed forecasts, ''it will be a definite negative for the equity market,'' Mr. Koesterich warned. ''The market is not pricing in further hikes.''

DATA WATCH -- Other items on a full economic calendar this week include a report on Wednesday on July housing starts and building permits. The Bloomberg poll forecasts a decline in both.
 The same day, two indicators of July manufacturing health will appear. Industrial production is estimated to have risen 0.6 percent, versus a gain of 0.8 percent in June; a slight increase is predicted for capacity utilization.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall on Worry That Rates Will Rise Again

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Stocks actually rose Thursday, after the authorities in London announced that they had uncovered a plot to set off bombs in airplanes bound for the United States. But the market fell for the week anyway. 
 The prospect of resumed interest rate tightening by the Federal Reserve weighed on the market, even though the central bank decided Tuesday not to raise its benchmark rate after 17 consecutive increases. But the bank said it would study data on economic growth and inflation and decide whether to raise rates at future meetings. The market fell after the Fed statement, and it fell again on Wednesday.
It rebounded Thursday, after the announcement of the thwarted terrorist plot. But on Friday, stocks fell again, on a report that retail sales had risen briskly -- raising the chances of future interest rate increases.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 152.32 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 11,088.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.62 points, or 1 percent, to close at 1,266.74. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 27.34 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,057.71. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.97 percent from 4.89 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: THEATER

BYLINE: By Jesse Green

 BODY:

When ''THE FANTASTICKS'' opened in 1960 at the Sullivan Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village, no one dreamed it would run for 42 years, handily becoming the world's longest-running musical. Imagine ''Wicked'' playing until 2045 -- although the entire cast (8), orchestra (2) and audience (150) for the original ''Fantasticks'' could fit into Glinda's bubble. Impressive statistics, but there's something even more telling: DOROTHY MARTIN, who first saw ''The Fantasticks'' when she was 8, still had time to grow up and play the piano for some 4,800 of the show's 17,162 performances, more than a quarter of its run. 


Ms. Martin, 44, returns as the pianist (and musical director) for a new Off Broadway production, now in previews. It is not much different from what played on Sullivan Street. No key changes have been made in HARVEY SCHMIDT's music; TOM JONES, who wrote the book and lyrics, and directs the revival, has not revamped scenes or interpolated pyrotechnics. This is as it should be for ''The Fantasticks,'' which is a poetic fairy tale about young lovers and scheming fathers, with a score that stands nearly alone in American musical theater for its radical economies and sumptuousness. It's sweet, but not delicate, and surprisingly hard to play; Ms. Martin and the harpist regularly break strings.

But there will be a few changes. Mr. Jones has rewritten the lighthearted song about varieties of rape (''It Depends on What You Pay'') to remove references that caused some picketing toward the end of the downtown run. There are about 50 more seats in the house. Anything else? ''Well, there was talk of doing it with a baby grand as opposed to an upright,'' Ms. Martin said, ''but we couldn't find the room.'' Opens Wednesday, Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100; $75.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 13, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The Theater entry today on Page 2 of Arts & Leisure includes an outdated reference to the opening of ''The Fantasticks'' at the Snapple Theater Center. After the section went to press, it was postponed to Aug. 23, from Aug. 16.

HEADLINE: Zoo Humor and a Soundtrack for the Help-Wanted Ads

BYLINE: By Neko Case

 BODY:
NEKO CASE is hard to pin down. Figuratively she's somewhere between country and folk; she says country-noir is apt. She's itinerant, touring or recording with her bands (the New Pornographers is one of several) or friends (Rachel Flotard is one of many). Neko Case is her real name. Sure, she was teased, but she said the real loss was no rainbow pens or mini license plates at rest stops. Now 35, she's beyond missing such trinkets. Taking a break from touring (she resumes Aug. 24 at McCarren Pool in Brooklyn), Ms. Case was in Tucson, cuddling indoors with her new dogs, Travis and Liza With a Z, and her new cat, Ira. She taught herself a little guitar and learned some more on tour. Ms. Case also writes short stories (no one is allowed to read them), and her deft storytelling is evident on her fourth album, ''Fox Confessor Brings the Flood'' (Anti-Records). She spoke with Winter Miller about what she's listening to, and watching, now.

'The Mighty Boosh'
 
 This comedy show from England is incredibly weird. It's these two guys who work in a zoo, and there are all these bizarre musical numbers and animals that talk, and lots of flights of fantasy. It's so hilarious. It's kind of low-budget, which makes it even funnier. The first season takes place in the zoo, but it goes out of business, so the second season takes place in an apartment. The episodes have full musical and dance numbers that suddenly appear out of nowhere. Our tour manager in England got us addicted last May. Hopefully it will be released in the United States soon. Initially ''The Mighty Boosh'' (two DVD's, themightyboosh.com) was a TV show adapted from a radio show, and you can buy all the radio shows online.

'Eccentric Soul: The Big Mack Label'
 I heard about this compilation album (Numero Group) from a friend who's a music writer. The cover features a foggy photo of a lady with a silver wig and a silver microphone singing in a basement. My favorite song, ''Your Replacement Is Here,'' is so harsh. It's soul music, some is instrumental, which you don't hear much on compilations, and it's got ballads. It feels like a mixtape from some friend who does nothing but collect records, and you're like, ''Damn, can you make me a copy of that?''

Dave Chappelle
 I saw ''Dave Chappelle's Block Party'' (DVD, Rogue Pictures/Focus) on a tour break, and I had the best time. It was really funny, really moving, and I wasn't expecting it to be like that. It had the greatest live recording sound quality of any live show in a movie. I'm a big fan of Erykah Badu, so I was excited to see the footage of her, and I'm pretty into ?uestlove. Dave Chappelle just seemed so natural all the time. I love how inclusive he is with his audience, he's very conscious they're there. There's so much about performing live that's a whole big myth about rock 'n' roll that doesn't include the audience. Like the audience is supposed to be quiet and stand there. I love it when it's your Friday night too, and you have a good time watching the show, and you're included. People need to see that music isn't hard, or comedy; they're not a smoke-and-mirrors production. It can be very natural. He's irreverent, but you can feel his conscience. He makes people ask questions. That's a powerful thing. 

Esopus 6
 Esopus is a magazine that comes out twice a year. For Esopus 6: Process (esopusmag.com), the theme was creative process, and they asked a writer, a mathematician, a production designer and all these different people about their process. For the CD ''Help Wanted,'' they asked a bunch of musicians to write a song inspired from the want-ads section, with the idea that inspiration can be found anywhere. I love the song ''Pine Cone Cafe'' by Grizzly Bear. One day I'll get to hang out in my garage and write stuff like that. 

The Minutemen
 ''We Jam Econo: The Story of the Minutemen'' (two DVD's, Rocket Fuel Films) is an oral history as told by the band members Mike Watt and George Hurley. It's old footage and interviews with friends. They played an important role in my early music development. When I was a teenager, I was really into punk rock, but it was getting old and becoming overly macho and saying the same things. The Minutemen were not a man's band and not a woman's band, they were a smart band. I remember when D. Boon, their guitar player, died in '85. I don't remember the death of any figure being talked about more. I like how they didn't press Mike Watt to talk about his friend's death, they just let him talk about how much he loved the guy. One disc is all footage, which is totally incredible. The other has 62 songs or something ridiculous. These discs stuck to the music and the friendship and didn't take tabloid angles, which is so common in music biography. I wanted the music, and that's what you get: great music.

HEADLINE: Just What Reggae Needs, a Clean-Cut Ambassador

BYLINE: By KELEFA SANNEH

 BODY:
Earlier this year all of Jamaica seemed to be listening to the same song. That song was ''Ghetto Story,'' by a rising star known as Cham, who told a vivid tale of poverty and crime. Over an electronic beat composed of a few sharp buzzes, Cham started at the beginning:
 I remember those days when Hell was my home 
 When me and Mama bed was a big piece a foam 
 And me never like bathe and my hair never comb 
 When Mama gone a work, me go street, go roam
 ''Ghetto Story'' was an unlikely candidate for cross-over success. Too many words, too many local references, too much slang. It's a crime narrative, not a dance song.
And yet ''Ghetto Story'' just won't go away. The New York hip-hop radio station Hot 97 started playing it, betting that listeners would get sucked in by Cham's fervid voice, even if they didn't catch all the words. A low-budget music video found its way onto MTV. Cham recorded a remix with Akon, and then another one with Alicia Keys, who sang about the old New York: ''Hookers and ho's/On 11th Avenue, selling bodies for dope.'' Cham's record company, Atlantic, commissioned a new music video, one that doesn't look like a straight-to-DVD crime flick. All this is buildup for Tuesday, when Cham's second album, also called ''Ghetto Story,'' will arrive in stores.
 Reached in a hotel in Rochester, where he was working his way through a not particularly glamorous American promotional tour, Cham said he was surprised by the success of his single. ''It was the biggest song in Jamaica after, like, two days,'' he said. ''Then it went from Jamaica to New York, and it started to rip New York to pieces. Then to London. And I said: 'Oh. I see what's going on.' ''
 But will people buy the album? As Cham knows better than anyone, he's merely the latest in a long line of reggae stars trying to figure out how to convert momentum and a major-label budget into a viable career. Sean Paul has done it, partly because he never really seemed like part of Jamaica's rough-and-tumble reggae scene. But others, from Damian Marley (last year's great reggae hope) to Elephant Man (who was, briefly, an unlikely hip-hop star) to the respected veteran Beenie Man (whose new album is due later this month), have had a harder time negotiating the American pop charts.
 It's not entirely the audience's fault either. If there's one thing more fickle than the American record-buying public, it's the Jamaican reggae scene. And the story of reggae in the last few years has largely been a story of false starts, minor triumphs and -- most frustrating of all -- self-sabotage.
 By the time Bob Marley died, in 1981, he was far and away the most beloved musician in the history of reggae, but he was hardly a representative figure. Reggae fans were already embracing a new form, dancehall reggae. It had fewer notes: the music consisted of stripped-down tracks, known as riddims. And it had more words: singers were gradually adopting more conversational styles.
 In 1985 a pioneering electronic riddim called ''Sleng Teng,'' composed by King Jammy, helped push dancehall into the computer age. Since then, as electronic beats and forcefully declaimed lyrics have become the norm, dancehall has grown closer in sound and spirit to hip-hop, just as hip-hop had borrowed many of its sounds and strategies from early dancehall. As it happens, Cham's ''Ghetto Story'' is in part a tribute to that first wave of computer-generated dancehall. It's based on an old-fashioned electronic riddim called ''85,'' in homage to that watershed year. The ''85'' riddim is the work of Dave Kelly, a brilliant producer who could (but wouldn't) claim to be the Dr. Dre of dancehall. 
 Mr. Kelly has been making reggae hits since the early 1990's, when he worked with the ferocious dancehall roarer Buju Banton. And he has been paying close attention over the last decade, as the genre has endured a handful of triumphs and a fistful of setbacks, while steadily pumping out wild, weird singles.
 Speaking from Florida, where he lives when he's not in Jamaica, Mr. Kelly said that the growing American success of the ''Ghetto Story'' might be a good sign for a genre that could use one. ''I'm optimistic,'' he said, ''because I think it's getting to the point where people are realizing that dancehall reggae is more then a catchy hook or a dance move.''
 He was referring indirectly to the reggae boom of 2002-3. That was when Sean Paul was taking off, when Elephant Man's frenetic club hit ''Pon de River Pon de Bank'' could be seen on BET, when the dancehall crooner Wayne Wonder was enjoying a surprise pop hit with ''No Letting Go.'' Reggae was on the verge of a major breakthrough. But since then reggae has gone back underground, and Jamaican tastes have changed.
 After the boom the Jamaican charts filled up with old-fashioned roots-reggae songs, which weren't quite as compatible with American hip-hop. And this year two of the biggest (and best) Jamaican hits -- ''Badman Forward, Badman Pull Up,'' by Ding Dong, a dancer, and ''Dutty Wine,'' by Tony Matterhorn, a D.J. -- aren't really songs at all: they are dancing guides, with yelled instructions in place of lyrics. Try explaining all that to a casual pop fan, looking for the next Sean Paul.
 In recent years reggae stars have also had to reckon with a controversy of their own making. Many of the top performers have recorded songs with antigay lyrics. In 2004 gay-rights activists started an awareness campaign, and concerts by Beenie Man and other dancehall stars were canceled in Europe and America.
 The furor seemed to die down after the top reggae stars privately agreed to avoid recording violent antigay rhetoric in the future. But the effect lingered: nonfans all over the world now think of dancehall as the genre with the antigay lyrics. And last month Beenie Man learned that the anger hasn't subsided: his AIDS benefit concert, scheduled for New York, had to be canceled after an outcry.
 This is what Beenie Man is facing as he promotes his new album -- and umpteenth crossover attempt -- ''Undisputed'' (Virgin), which is due on Aug. 29. The album focuses on playful sex songs, and it includes the Jamaican hit ''Hmm Hmm'' (produced by Tony, Mr. Kelly's half-brother), which cleverly uses those hums in place of a common Jamaican vulgarity. 
 But elsewhere Beenie Man sounds a bit flat, as if his frustrating recent years had sapped his usual wit and verve. Outside Jamaica his long career seems more like a trail of damning evidence; an abject apology might help, but it would be a gamble: Jamaican fans would likely view it as an unacceptable capitulation.
 Maybe all that makes Cham (formerly Baby Cham) the ideal reggae star for this complicated moment. He's a clean-cut but versatile vocalist, equally capable of unleashing a barrage of threats or delivering a bouquet of lover-man promises. He sounds equally at home on an American radio station or in a Jamaican club. He has avoided the antigay lyrics that helped derail Beenie Man's career. And with Mr. Kelly in his corner, Cham has a steady supply of simple but elegant electronic beats.
 ''Ghetto Story'' begins with half a dozen hard, brash, unimpeachable tracks. In ''Tic Toc'' he turns a nursery rhyme into a warning: ''Tic, toc, tic goes the clock/Informers dance to the sound of my Glock.'' While he doesn't pretend to have an American accent (as some hit-hungry reggae stars have done), he delivers many of his lyrics slowly (by dancehall standards), so Americans can follow along.
 ''You have to find some way without watering down the lyrics, to break the language barrier,'' he said. And to that end, he often lets his voice crack, like an adolescent's, when he gets worked up. It's a nonverbal cue that is never lost in translation.
 There are a few missteps around the album's halfway point. The thug-love choruses and hip-hop beats seem like an unnecessary concession to hip-hop listeners; besides, Cham never sounds better than when he's got an old-fashioned digital dancehall beat to work with. Which raises a question. Is the focus on crossing over a mistake? Shouldn't reggae stars be satisfied to make music that reggae fans like?
 Part of the problem is the obvious economic one: You can't make much money from CD's in Jamaica. Mr. Kelly says he gave away about a thousand copies of the ''85'' compilation (which includes the ''Ghetto Story'' single) on the island. 
 ''We're not even trying to sell records in Jamaica,'' he said. Instead he wants to keep Jamaican listeners satisfied (Cham recently did a free tour of the island) while reaping the rewards in America and overseas.
 Now all Cham needs is for ''Ghetto Story'' to keep climbing in popularity, and for the next single to do just as well; it's a tall order but not an impossible one. He knows that, in a globalized music economy, real success depends on attracting listeners who don't know -- or care to know -- about the genre's rich history. 
 Staying home isn't an option. ''You just sit in Jamaica, making records that mash up Jamaica? It doesn't come like that,'' he said. ''So I'm willing to do the work.''

HEADLINE: For Labor Day Getaways, a Few Deals 

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
STILL looking for a cheap Labor Day getaway? You may have your work cut out for you. Packed planes and high prices are expected through the first weekend in September, with few bargains for procrastinators.
Late-summer air fares, for instance, are more expensive than last year. For the first week in September, fares to Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas and Europe were up between 9 and 17 percent through the end of June, compared with a year ago, according to Sabre Airline Solutions. And many hotels that have been seeing record occupancies and double-digit rate increases see no reason to start discounting. Demand for Labor Day ''is stronger than last year,'' said Amy Ziff, editor at large of Travelocity. ''I wouldn't be surprised if this year is a record breaker.'' Still, some deals remain. Here is a roundup of some of the better offerings. 


ACCOMMODATIONS -- While there is still availability at some traditional Labor Day beach resorts like the Jersey Shore or Cape Cod, finding a bargain is more of a challenge. One place to look is the Web site for the New England Inns and Resorts Association, NewEnglandInnsandResorts.com, which says some members have been fully booked since 2005, but others are offering Labor Day promotions. The deals listed on the site are mostly gas credits or value-added packages that throw in breakfast or a bottle of wine. Only a few are offering cut rates; the Catania Hospitality Group, for example, is discounting its three hotels in Massachusetts by 20 percent. In New Jersey, forget bargains at the beach. ''I think you'll see more discounting inland, along the Delaware,'' which has seen soft bookings after flooding earlier this summer, said Terry Anderson, president of the Preferred Inns of New Jersey.
 For deeper discounts, head to a city, where hotels typically aren't as full and may be offering better bargains. In many cases, you won't even have to give up your tan. Many properties in cities like New York and Washington are offering rooftop pools and sun decks. In New York, Hotel Gansevoort is offering a two-night ''Who Needs the Hamptons?'' package through Sept. 4, starting at $570 a night. It includes breakfast, spa treatments for two, reserved chairs at the rooftop pool during the week, and a bag full of sunscreen, water misters and magazines -- for a saving of more than $200. The newly redesigned Park Hyatt Washington, which boasts bathrooms with deep soaking tubs and an indoor pool, has a $405 two-night package with breakfast, free parking and two tickets for the Old Town Trolley -- a saving of 27 percent. Hotel Palomar, also in Washington, has a lap pool and sun deck with cabanas, and is offering a $119 a night Labor Day rate for Aug. 31 to Sept. 4 including breakfast -- about a 30 percent savings.

AMUSEMENT PARKS -- For families, some of the best deals are at theme parks. Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, Calif., both rolled back prices on everything from admission (now $39.95 for adults from about $45 last year) to cotton candy (now just 25 cents a stick from $3). This year, Universal Orlando Resort in Florida began allowing children 9 years old and under in free when their parent buys a $99.95 two-day multipark pass online. Not to be outdone, SeaWorld recently announced a children-free promotion for families staying at participating Orlando Marriott hotels.
 Families that book four or more nights at one of the Loews Hotels at Universal Orlando Resort get free tickets for two adults and two children good for seven days to Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. Hotel rates start at $199 at Loews' Royal Pacific Resort, $299 at the Hard Rock Hotel and $259 at Portofino Bay Hotel. Downtown Disney Resort Area Hotels, a group of seven hotels on Disney property in the Orlando area, are also offering deals. The newly renovated Royal Plaza, for example, is renting rooms for as low as $89 a night through Sept. 30. Guests booking directly with the hotel at (800) 248-7890 can get a $10 gas card if they ask for it when making their reservation.

CANADA -- Canadian provinces are trying to lure more American visitors across the border. From January to May, visits by Americans were down 5 percent from the same period in 2005, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission. One of the reasons for the downturn is a stronger Canadian dollar. The United States dollar bought 1.33 Canadian dollars in July two years ago compared to about 1.13 this year, according to Avery Shenfeld, a senior economist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto.
 But in many cases, the exchange rate is being offset by lower rates. In Quebec City, the Loews Le Concorde is offering rates as low as 149 Canadian dollars ($134 at the current rate of 1.11 Canadian dollars to $1) -- a saving of 45 percent. And Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, which has 21 properties in Canada, is offering ''Only One Way'' summer rates of up to 40 percent off at most of its Canadian hotels. 
 Through October, travelers can book discounted two-night hotel packages in Montreal at www.sweetdealmontreal.com that include late check-out, buffet breakfast or an upgrade. Rates at the InterContinental Montreal begin at 219 Canadian dollars. For bargains in Calgary, Alberta, check www.greatcalgaryescapes.com. One listing: The Calgary Marriott is offering a Cars Eat Free package with promotion code TRS that includes free parking and a gas card worth 25 Canadian dollars, from 159 Canadian dollars a night. 

HURRICANE HOLIDAYS -- The best savings are to be found in off-peak destinations like Mexico, the Caribbean and parts of Florida, where typical off-season incentives have been stepped up a bit to try to lure wary travelers back after last year's hurricanes.
 In the Florida Keys, hard hit by Hurricane Wilma last year, prices are an average 25 percent lower during the off-season, according to the Cheaptickets.com Off-season Deals Report. Prices in New Orleans are 22 percent less in the off-season, while those in the Bahamas are 14 percent lower.
 Through July, air fare to Cancun over the Labor Day weekend was down 16 percent from last year according to Travelocity. And most resorts that were damaged by Hurricane Wilma last October have reopened with improved facilities. Some are offering perks. For instance, starting Aug. 16, the recently reopened JW Marriott Cancun Resort and Spa will offer guests staying at least four nights discounts and gifts ranging from a free bottle of champagne to 15 percent discounts on back massages. 
 Aruba, which hasn't had a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than 100 years, is also offering deals. The Radisson Aruba Resort and Casino, for example, is offering savings of 10 percent, with rates starting at $209 a room a night including a $100 food and beverage credit for stays of five nights or longer.

Is it true that round-the-world tickets are considerably cheaper if one starts in Europe rather than the United States? -- Carol Groneman, New York
 It depends on where you start in Europe. Prices for long-haul tickets (especially in business class) in London, Paris, Rome, Frankfurt or Zurich can vary by as much as 40 percent, but tickets are generally cheaper than in the United States. (London is the most expensive starting point in Europe for business-class tickets.) 
For example, the cost of a round-the-world ticket in business class for a three-continent journey with the Oneworld airline alliance from New York is $7,500 ($3,900 economy); from London, $7,200 (about $2,200 economy); and from Paris, $6,400 ($2,500 economy). You may be able to save even more money if you buy your round-the-world ticket in Bangkok ($5,540 business class, $2,640 economy), Colombo, Istanbul or Mumbai. But remember, you must start your trip in the same country you bought your ticket. You normally have 12 months to complete the trip.
 It's a good idea to compare fares and route and airline options offered by the three airline alliances: Oneworld (www.oneworld.com), with eight carriers, including American, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Qantas, which sets fares according to the number of continents you visit or pass through; Star Alliance (www.star-alliance.com), with 18 carriers, including United, Singapore, Air Canada, Lufthansa, Air New Zealand and Thai Airways, which sets fares according to mileage limits of 26,000 (economy class only; maximum five stopovers), 29,000, 34,000 and 39,000 miles; and Skyteam.com, with 10 carriers, including Continental, Delta, Air France/KLM and Alitalia, which prices tickets according to itinerary (a Northern Hemisphere route traveling via Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok or Tokyo will cost about 30 percent less than a southern route via Australia or the South Pacific) and number of stopovers.
 Most alliance round-the-world trips are made with two airlines; for example, if you are in the United States, and you choose to fly with the Oneworld alliance, you'll take British Airways across the Atlantic to a variety of gateways and on to Sydney, then Qantas back home across the Pacific. 
 Round-the-world tickets are too complicated to book online. Check out the options on an airline alliance site, then call a member airline or a travel agent to make your reservations. ROGER COLLIS

HEADLINE: For a Tourist Town, Too Much of a Good Thing

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
SEEN from afar, the turreted skyline of San Gimignano has often been cast as a medieval Manhattan. And on some days, it seems, pedestrian traffic can also recall Grand Central Terminal at rush hour.
 In recent months, the situation has gotten particularly snarly. On weekends, the town's two main streets have become so congested that ''if you'd thrown a bean up into the air, it wouldn't have fallen to the ground,'' recalled one wizened resident. In the face of an annual onslaught of some three million visitors, local officials began sputtering about emergency measures.
''Of course, we can't restrict the number of tourists,'' said Marco Lisi, San Gimignano's personable mayor, noting that the town is on Unesco's World Heritage list. ''But at the same time we can't pretend that nothing is wrong, or endanger the patrimony we're supposed to protect. This is a medieval city, not Disneyland.''
 Like many Italian tourist-magnets, San Gimignano has been increasingly challenged to balance the cultural cravings of foreign sightseers with the impact such popularity has on the town, bearing in mind that the local economy depends substantially on tourists. 
 ''Some people, jokingly, say that we have to get out of the 'Bermuda Triangle,' a reference to the hordes of tourists in sandals and shorts who migrate between St. Peter's in Rome, the Uffizi in Florence and Piazza San Marco in Venice,'' said Francesco Rutelli, deputy prime minister and culture minister. ''We want the world to discover Italy's hamlets, with their historic artistic, cultural and religious itineraries, and the local handicrafts. This Italy has extraordinary productive and economic potential.''
 But in San Gimignano, some feel the town's popularity is too much of a good thing. 
 It takes less than 15 minutes to cross the roughly 900-by-500-yard historic center at a leisurely stroll. Mass tourism came here at the end of the 1970's, said one local official, growing at a 5 to 10 percent rate each year. In no time the 1,400 residents living in the historic center were overrun by outsiders.
 The city is also a popular site for school class tours, which has only compounded the problem, especially in the spring months. ''I don't have to tell you that 500 elderly Germans don't occupy the same space as 500 teenagers who act as they're supposed to act at their age,'' said Mr. Lisi, the mayor. ''Long weekends are a tragedy.''
 ''We just can't handle the numbers,'' added Daniele Cappellini, the official responsible for transportation here. In a city equipped to handle 60 tour buses comfortably, last year there were as many as 160 on busy days, he said. ''When it's so crowded, tourists don't even get a sense of what San Gimignano is really like,'' Mr. Cappellini added. 
 At the heart of the matter, everyone here agrees, is the quantity-against-quality issue. Most visitors to San Gimignano whiz through the town in less than an hour, barely enough time to bask in the shadow of its famed towers. ''To stay for an hour is offensive,'' said Mr. Cappellini. 
 ''The problem is hit-and-run tourism, which doesn't create wealth or guarantee the preservation of a beautiful but delicate city,'' said Sabrina Benenati, the town counselor responsible for commerce and local productivity. ''If all you want to do is get photographed in front of a tower, I'm sure there are computer programs that can do the same thing with no damage to the town and without spending much money.''
 Some in tourism-related businesses, like Maddine Insalaco, who runs a landscape-painting workshop in Tuscany, have left. Originally based in San Gimignano, four years ago she opted for the less frenetic pace of another part of Tuscany. ''We wanted to live in an area that corresponded to our classic ideal of Tuscany,'' she said. 
 For several years now, local officials have been trying to come up with solutions. They have tried to spread tourism throughout the year, concentrating cultural events -- many of them free -- from October through December, the traditional off-season. They are also pushing tours of the surrounding area, and the dozens of charming towns like Colle Val d'Elsa or Volterra -- within an easy day's drive of San Gimignano -- as incentives to stay longer.
 And six years ago, Mr. Cappellini's office began charging tour buses a drop-off fee that is significantly reduced if tourists visit one of the civic museums (which have exceptional Renaissance masterpieces) or eat or sleep inside the city walls. ''We've actually increased tourism thanks to this,'' said Mr. Cappellini. The system -- which also minutely monitors the city's six parking lots to avoid backups -- has been successful enough that other cities like Florence have adopted it, but it has also roused the anger of tour operators, some of whom have been threatening to boycott Tuscany. ''They complain the cost of the ticket is too high,'' said Ms. Benenati.
 OTHER Italian cities have taken equally creative approaches to limiting the summer crush. Three years ago, Mariano Bruno, the mayor of Lipari, the largest of the seven volcanic atolls that make up the Aeolian Islands, levied a fee on disembarking tourists that is channeled into a fund to improve services and security. It's a nominal fee -- one euro ($1.30) a head (three euros to climb the most famous volcano, Stromboli), but it was imposed to make the point that fragile environments need taking care of.
 ''We're not ready to limit tourism,'' said Mr. Bruno. ''It's our font of survival.'' Mr. Bruno is also aware that overcrowding does not make for good publicity, so coast guard officials ensure that only a limited number of vessels can anchor off certain harbors. 
 The less-is-more attitude has worked well in Sardinia, where local officials have successfully given restrictiveness a mark of exclusivity. The Oasis of Biderosa, a three-mile stretch along the island's eastern coast, has managed to escape the overdevelopment that is rapidly drawing tourists to the island -- largely because it is in a regional forest preserve and has only one access road. A maximum of 400 people, or 120 cars at 10 euros per car, are admitted to the area a day. Services are few; for instance, there are no beachfront cafes.
 ''The more we protect it, the more people want to come,'' said Felice Corda,provincial director for the Sardinian Forestry Agency. 
 Many have tried to cash in on Biderosa's success, and money-making offers flow in regularly, but the forestry agency isn't biting: ''We're avoiding the lure of the cash register in favor of nature,'' Mr. Corda said. 
 Tourism can be big business, of course. In San Gimignano, shopkeepers have few complaints about the overcrowding. ''There's never too many tourists,'' said Maria Grazia Tinacci, the owner of a shop crammed with ceramics and knickknacks along the souvenir-shop-lined Via San Giovanni.
 ''What we really need are parking lots,'' she said.
 But the tourist onslaught has also meant higher prices for residents. Rents have become so high that shops catering to mundane needs like shoe repairs have been forced out of town.
 ''We're penalized because we spend as much as tourists do to live here,'' said Gabriele Bacciotini, a San Gimignano native and the national president of Italiana Sommelier, a wine tasting school. Like many locals, he has resigned himself to an uneasy coexistence with passing strangers. ''At least we live well in January, when no one is around,'' he said.

THE PARLIAMENT OF MAN
 The Past, Present, and Future
 of the United Nations.
 By Paul Kennedy.
 361 pp. Random House. $26.95.
If the United Nations didn't exist, Fox News would have to invent it. There is no more satisfying all-purpose explanation for America's failure to have its way in the world than ''the U.N.'' Indeed, our very own ambassador to the institution, John Bolton, has described it as ''a target-rich environment'' -- like Iran, perhaps, but without the capacity to fight back.
 It takes a brave man, or a blithe one, to write about the United Nations as if it had some purpose other than either to obstruct or to accommodate American policy goals. I'm not sure which category the Yale historian Paul Kennedy belongs to, but it's safe to say ''The Parliament of Man'' will earn him no credit from the America-first crowd. 
 One of the chief virtues of this even-handed, mild-mannered appraisal is Kennedy's ability to embed the United Nations in the long history of schemes to end war once and for all. The dream of substituting reason for force, he writes, was ''a central part of the intellectual architecture of the Enlightenment'' -- most famously captured in Immanuel Kant's ''Perpetual Peace'' of 1795. Statesmen themselves had little patience for such castles in the sky -- until the 19th-century tangle of treaty obligations was buried, along with the youth of Europe, beneath the fields of Flanders. War had now become so abhorrent that the Kantian project seemed not naive but indispensable, and the world's chief states sought collective security in a League of Nations. 
 Kennedy observes that the League represented a real advance. But the shameful failure of its feeble fail-safe mechanisms in the face of German and Japanese aggression proved all too clearly that no parliament of man (a term first coined by the young Tennyson) could afford to be blind to the real nature of states and of men. American and British diplomats toiling in the havoc of World War II thus designed an astonishingly ambitious replacement for the League. Difficult though it is to recall today, the United Nations was expected to operate as an institutionalized form of the wartime alliance, with the victorious powers at its core and a military committee to serve as their Joint Chiefs of Staff. The planners were also acutely aware of the political effects of the Depression, which had legitimized authoritarianism of both the left and the right, so they established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ensure economic stability. The system that emerged genuinely constituted, as Kennedy observes, ''a new world order.''
 But this order, too, abjectly failed when the cold war paralyzed the collective-security apparatus. Kennedy provides a dutiful, and largely familiar, summation of the 45-year deep freeze that ended with the first gulf war, and then a quick account of the phases that followed: post-cold-war euphoria; humiliating reversals in the Balkans and Africa; chastened but increasingly forceful activism under Secretary General Kofi Annan, and finally the train wreck of the debate over war in Iraq. Kennedy's regard for the system's design leads him to insist that this confrontation actually vindicated the United Nations Charter. ''One of the breaker points (fuses) built into the 1945 system had been triggered,'' he writes, since one permanent member of the Council had tried, and failed, to gain the acquiescence of the other four. This is a little bit on the order of: the house may have burned down, but at least the alarm worked. 
 ''The Parliament of Man'' is organized thematically rather than chronologically -- good for conceptual clarity, bad for narrative drive -- and Kennedy devotes as much attention to the ''soft'' United Nations of social and economic development as to the ''hard'' United Nations of political mediation and peacekeeping. The former is the organization that most people outside the West care about, and that absorbs most of its energies, in the form of the many agencies and programs dealing with poverty, the environment, women's rights and public health. 
 Western analysts and journalists tend to give the soft United Nations short shrift. What, after all, is the connection between all these programs and the actual condition of men, women and children? Kennedy, to his credit, concedes that United Nations development bodies haven't done much to eradicate poverty, and that the low status of women ''remains a signal failure in our human condition.'' But he also claims -- convincingly, I think -- that concepts like ''sustainable development'' that have emerged from the endless palaver have changed the global debate in lasting and important ways. Hardheaded Western critics should bear this distinction in mind before dismissing the whole kit and caboodle. 
 At the United Nations, Kennedy will probably be seen as belonging to the group known as ''critical friends.'' At times his wish to vindicate his faith in the beleaguered institution makes him too friendly a critic. Like many United Nations officials, he blames peacekeeping failures on the shortsightedness or hypocrisy of member states rather than on the professionals in the Secretariat; his lengthy indictment with regard to Bosnia, for example, includes not a word about the peacekeepers' own self-defeating culture of neutrality. He is too easy on the many third-world states that have resisted -- and continue to resist -- efforts to modernize the institution. (He characterizes the notorious 1975 ''Zionism equals racism'' resolution merely as ''extremely silly.'') Washington has been a bad player, but it's had lots of company. 
 Kennedy closes with his own ambitious agenda of reform, including proposals to establish a stand-by force of 100,000 soldiers, revive the military committee, develop a sophisticated intelligence capacity and add eight or nine nonpermanent members to the Security Council. But these suggestions have been made before, and the member states have rejected them all. The United Nations appears to be impervious to serious reform. It's not hard to see why: the 191 members, with their wildly clashing interests, cannot even agree on what the institution is for. Its universality indeed makes it the realization of Tennyson's parliament of man. This is, at the same time, the United Nations' curse.

HEADLINE: Hezbollah's Other War

BYLINE: By Michael Young. 
Michael Young is the opinion editor of The Daily Star, an English-language newspaper published in Beirut, and a contributing editor at Reason magazine.

 BODY:
One evening earlier this summer, Lebanon's most popular satire show, ''Bas Mat Watan,'' broadcast a sketch showing an ''interview'' with Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader and secretary general. ''Nasrallah'' was asked whether his party would surrender its weapons. He answered that it would, but first several conditions had to be met: there was that woman in Australia, whose land was being encroached upon by Jewish neighbors; then there was the baker in the United States, whose bakery the Jews wanted to take over. The joke was obvious: there were an infinite number of reasons why Hezbollah would never agree to lay down its weapons and become one political party among others.
But it was the rapid reaction to the satiric sketch that sent the more disquieting message. That very night, angry supporters of Hezbollah closed the airport road with burning tires -- a warning that they could block at will the main access point in and out of the country -- and marched on mainly Sunni, Druse and Christian quarters in Beirut. In a Christian neighborhood, they clashed with the son of a former president and his comrades, and several youths were taken to hospital. 
 The leaders of Hezbollah defended these actions, explaining that they were the spontaneous emotional response to the mocking of a cleric. It is just as likely that they were a coordinated effort to intimidate critics. In any case, to me the event seemed an essential one, since it symbolized the duality that has defined Lebanon ever since its civil war came to an end in 1990. The duality was once neatly encapsulated by Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druse sect, when he asked, Would Lebanon choose to be Hanoi, circa 1970, or Hong Kong? That is, would it seek to become an international symbol, as represented by Hezbollah, of militancy and armed struggle, particularly against Israel, or would it opt for the path laid out by Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's late prime minister and billionaire developer, who sought to transform his country into a business entrepot for the region, a bastion of liberal capitalism and ecumenical permissiveness?
 In seeking to silence critics of their leader, in momentarily shutting down the airport, Hezbollah struck a blow against Lebanon's tolerant, if always paradoxical, openness. Once again, it seemed, the Lebanese were suffering the consequences of failing to agree on a common destiny. At the time, the consequences seemed bearable. With the outbreak of the current conflict with Israel, they don't seem bearable at all.
 Lebanon today lies ravaged, its inhabitants suffering the consequences of Hezbollah's hubris and Israel's terrible, wanton retribution. Since July 12, when party militants abducted two Israeli soldiers and killed three on the Israeli side of the border, Lebanon has been under a virtually complete Israeli blockade. At the time of writing, nearly 1,000 people have been killed, mostly civilians. Predominantly Shiite areas in the south, Beirut's southern suburbs and the northern Bekaa Valley have been turned into wastelands; Beirut seems empty. Businesses, when they do open, close early; store owners have cleared out their showrooms. The mood is one of ambient disintegration. Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of refugees have moved into the capital, even as many of its residents have headed for the mountains. The economy, already precarious before the conflict started, lies in shambles, as does public confidence in the country's future.
 As attention focuses on Israel's air war and troop movements, there has been less emphasis on the social impact of hundreds of thousands of traumatized Shiites moving into mainly non-Shiite areas. A month into the war, there have been laudable acts of cross-sectarian assistance, with Christian, Sunni and Druse organizations and parties helping refugees in schools and other facilities around the country. Yet there are signs of strain. In an effort to avoid conflicts between Shiite refugees and his own Druse supporters, Walid Jumblatt has allowed the refugees to put up Hezbollah flags and photographs of Nasrallah. The longer the fighting continues, however, the more likely it is that altercations will take place. Israel may have hoped to unite the Lebanese people against Hezbollah and force its government to extend its authority throughout the country. But such unity and such authority are hard to see on the horizon. As recriminations over the war spread, the delivery of aid across group lines will become more difficult, frustration will mount and the sectarian and political divide, already exacerbated by anxiety over Hezbollah's actions and intentions, will only grow.
 How long it seems (and yet it is only a year) since the Lebanese were celebrating the Cedar Revolution -- or what they always more revealingly called the Independence Intifada. Following the killing of Rafik Hariri in February 2005, it seemed that the Lebanese people were coming together to demand the end of Syrian dominance and the resurrection of their nation's democracy. In that not so distant past, I had high hopes for the development of a liberal, even libertarian, Lebanon; after all, I reasoned, coexistence, freedom and entrepreneurial drive had been the natural state of the country between independence in 1943 and the start of the civil war in 1975 and even beyond. Maybe I was biased in this regard. My late father was an American, my mother is a Maronite Christian and I spent the first decade of the war living in predominantly Muslim West Beirut, where I came to embrace multiple identities and distrust the exclusivist certitudes of many Lebanese. When I returned to Lebanon in 1992, after several years in the United States, my enduring memories from that earlier time were of a remarkably diverse society that could rebound from its worst calamities, seemingly effortlessly. Many of the cliches were true: a neighborhood firefight might break out between militias in the morning, but by the end of the day people would be repairing their damaged properties. The Lebanese could be infuriatingly anarchic, stupidly selfish, but they were also determined to take initiatives and embrace new departures. This I saw as the essence of the liberal ideal. When the Syrian Army left, I believed, that ideal could at last be fulfilled. 
 My understanding was a valid one, but in retrospect an incomplete one. The ideals of the Independence Intifada were largely the ideals of an urban middle class -- politicians, professionals, journalists and students; mostly Christians and Sunnis but also some Druse -- fed up with a vulgar, vampirical Syrian hegemony. But what about that sizable part of Lebanon that had no inclination to see Syria gone?
 From the moment of Hariri's assassination on Feb. 14, 2005, it was clear that the Shiite political parties, particularly Hezbollah, did not share in the national distress surrounding the former prime minister's death. Certainly, party officials paid their respects to the Hariri family and condemned the crime, but when tens of thousands of Lebanese descended on Martyrs Square in Beirut to bury Hariri, the most obvious question was, Where are the Shiites? Given that Shiites represent perhaps 35 to 40 percent of the Lebanese population, this was no idle question.
 Of course, there were Shiites -- as individuals. But over the years, Hezbollah had gradually won over a large majority of the community, particularly poorer Shiites, and the party had no wish to assist in Hariri's elevation from politician to national martyr. It probably sensed as well what many others did at the time -- namely that the assassination, blamed by the late prime minister's allies on the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, could be used to end Syria's presence in Lebanon and curb the influence of Syria's close ally, Hezbollah itself. While other Lebanese saw the prospect of true independence, Hezbollah saw a threat -- and this split vision would have grave consequences. Ultimately, a combination of traditional sectarian tensions, audacious political opportunism and the sheer unmovable force of Hezbollah's state within a state would contribute to defeating the hopes of the Independence Intifada.
 Hezbollah's dependence on Syria and dominance of local Shiite politics were long in the making. In the early 1980's, the ''Party of God'' was a loose collection of shady militant groups organized and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and dedicated to fighting Israel. After vanquishing its Shiite rival, the Amal movement, in fierce street fights, Hezbollah established its headquarters in the southern suburbs of Beirut. When the civil war ended in 1990, with Syria in effective control of the country, it was virtually the only armed group allowed to retain its weapons. The official rationale was that it needed those weapons to continue fighting Israel's occupation of the south. But Syria had its own reasons to keep Hezbollah armed: as it negotiated with Israel for the return of the Golan Heights, the Assad regime wanted all the military leverage it could get.
 Under Syrian tutelage, Hezbollah began to play a role in Lebanon's political affairs as well. In 1992, Lebanon held its first postwar election, and when Nasrallah chose to participate, the decision created friction within the party, ostensibly because it implied abandoning the goal of creating an Islamic state in Lebanon but also, and more prosaically, because of personal leadership rivalries. Yet the party won an impressive 12 seats, and while it did not enter the government at the time, it firmly anchored itself in Parliament. Making use of the expanded patronage powers at its disposal, it began filling the civil service with supporters, which was a great boon to its often impoverished constituents. The integration of an Islamic militia into the state attracted considerable attention at the time; optimists saw it as a model of how an Islamist party might be ''moderated.'' In reality, Hezbollah manipulated this process to safeguard its autonomy, even as it expanded its military capabilities under Syria's approving eye.
 Throughout much of the 1990's, Rafik Hariri, the Sunni billionaire, built up a glittering new Beirut and attracted investors and plaudits from abroad. The Syrians grew wary of Hariri, however, worrying that he moved far too comfortably in the world's capitals and would one day try to remove Lebanon from their orbit. Hezbollah, the Syrians understood, could serve as a valuable counterweight to Hariri's ambitions. More cynically, the Syrians realized that Hezbollah's pariah status in the world community could work to their advantage, for who but Syria could ever hope to bring the violent party under control? To remain relevant in Lebanon and throughout the Middle East, the Syrians helped create a problem that only they could resolve.
 But there was more to the Syrian-Shiite alliance than that. Many Shiites were genuinely grateful to Syria for helping them overcome decades of marginalization. The community's economic and political ascent, and its resistance against Israel, were all encouraged by Syria. You could argue, with some irony, that the Syrians had graciously allowed the Shiites to be their cannon fodder, but for Shiites these events were vital steps in their journey from the periphery of Lebanese political and social life to its very center.
 Hezbollah's crowning moment came in May 2000, when Israeli forces withdrew from Lebanon after a 22-year presence. Refusing to accept the U.N.'s judgment that the withdrawal was complete, Hezbollah vowed to continue its ''resistance.'' While Hezbollah never quite made clear whether its resistance was ''Lebanese'' or ''Islamic'' in spirit (both terms were used interchangeably), this ambiguity went to the heart of the matter. Hezbollah simultaneously represented radical religious militancy and a peculiar sort of Lebanese patriotism, based on an existential struggle against Israel and the convenient ignoring of Syrian domination.
 With Hariri's killing, two Lebanons entered into confrontation. They were distinguished, in large part, by their different visions of the past. One recalled the glories of a cosmopolitan, multiconfessional prewar Lebanon and admired Hariri for seeking to revive those glories. The other one, mainly Shiite, had little such nostalgia: it recalled a prewar, sophisticated, free-market Lebanon that had left them with little worth remembering.
 In fact, both of these perceptions were flawed: the pre-1975 country was only partly a Mediterranean pleasure palace; its liveliness and prosperity were centered on a Beirut surrounded by rings of poverty, where the excluded were many. And Shiite misery, while very real, had been recognized in the late 1950's and early 1960's, when the state extended its services to the south. It was further alleviated in the 1980's, and later after Hariri took office in 1992, as Shiite leaders were granted an ample share of the national pie. Any drive around Shiite areas in the last decade would have shown the mark of returning emigrant money in the proliferation of villas, businesses and interests linking Lebanon to communities in Africa, the United States and South America.
 Lebanon is a country of simultaneous complex identities, and Hezbollah's world deftly incorporated paradoxes no less than Hariri's. The image of a Shiite Lebanon awash in turbans, chadors and prayer beads is a caricature. Secularism and religiousness, wealth and poverty, tradition and modernity, militancy and laid-backedness, Hanoi and Hong Kong -- all are present among Shiites, as among other Lebanese communities. Hezbollah's genius has been to draw from this diversity even as it also seeks to stifle it. It has done so by virtually monopolizing the provision of basic services and patronage jobs to Shiites throughout the country and by convincing its co-religionists that if the party loses political ground, all Shiites lose.
 In March 2005, Hezbollah and the rest of Lebanese society faced off in the climactic events of the Independence Intifada. On March 8, as Syrian troops began preparing to leave the country, Hezbollah organized a demonstration in downtown Beirut to ''thank'' Syria for all its help to Lebanon. Hassan Nasrallah spoke to the assembled masses, followed by an array of lesser pro-Syrian clients. 
 The Hezbollah-led demonstration was of particular symbolic importance. It was held in Beirut's rebuilt downtown area, Hariri's jewel and hitherto the setting for weekly anti-Syrian rallies. In his choice of locale, Nasrallah declared that the downtown area belonged to Shiites as much as to Sunni Muslims, Christians or Druse -- the communities leading the opposition to Syria. His supporters pointedly marched under the national flag, reminding their countrymen that Shiites were as Lebanese as anybody else. It was an impressive gathering, with between 200,000 and 400,000 people in attendance. 
 But Nasrallah had miscalculated. Though there was a smattering of non-Shiites in the crowd, the rally was widely regarded as a sectarian Shiite challenge to the Lebanese independence movement -- and this created widespread alarm. One week later, on March 14, the independence movement responded by holding a counterrally. There appeared to be at least three times as many people present on March 14 as on March 8 -- Sunnis, Christians and Druse, but also some Shiites, all from the farthest reaches of Lebanon -- probably some one million people, with tens of thousands more languishing on blocked access roads to Beirut. In a country of only four million, it was an extraordinarily large gathering. The ''March 14 coalition,'' as it would come to be known, embodied the idea of coexistence and promised a new beginning.
 Or did it? While the March 14 rally was interpreted by many as the defining moment of a new, multisectarian Lebanon, while it was an unforgettable experience for those who attended -- and I was there -- it also emerged from the viscera of Lebanese sectarianism. Anger against Syria, sorrow over Hariri's murder and the hope for a free Lebanon all contributed to March 14, but so, too, did revulsion at the image of hundreds of thousands of poor Shiites descending on Beirut's pot of gold, its downtown area, that receptacle of mainly urban Sunni and Christian achievement. The hinterland had laid claim to the wealth of the capital, and it had done so in the name of a Syrian regime that was also a product of the hinterland. The reflex of Lebanon's elites and middle class -- those who prided themselves on their openness -- was to close the door.
 Hezbollah, for its part, had much the same reflex. The Lebanese majority, you might think, had spoken. But that night, Hezbollah's television station, Al Manar, presented the demonstration in the narrowest of sectarian terms: as a resurrection of the right-wing Christian politics of the civil-war era. Viewers were shown images from the march suggesting that a onetime Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, was staging a comeback. The implication was that collaborators with Israel were at the forefront of the movement. It was pure demagoguery, since the Lebanese Forces had much earlier broken with Israel. But the station's intent was to sound a persistent Hezbollah trope: those who opposed Syria were really acting on behalf of the United States and Israel -- and this was no time for subtlety.
 There was something inherently unstable in this situation. On the one hand, the Christians, Sunnis and Druse who (rightly or wrongly) regarded themselves as defenders of Lebanese tolerance and liberalism were animated in part by their own prejudices. On the other hand, the Shiite community was expressing its form of Lebanese patriotism through an implicit reaffirmation of autocratic Syrian rule. Who could untwine such contradictions? The great Lebanese journalist George Naccache once observed that ''two negations do not make a nation''; he was describing how Lebanon's Christians and Sunnis had built the newly independent Lebanese state in 1943 on a strange compromise: the Christians would not look to join the West, and the Muslims would not seek to become part of a wider Arab nation. His words remained relevant: if March 8 and March 14 were both founded on negations, the prospects for a united Lebanon were dim.
 It was widely hoped that the elections scheduled for May and June 2005 would put Lebanon's new freedom on a more stable footing. But political maneuverings leading up to the vote soon dashed this hope. Lebanon's famously complex political system is founded on sectarianism: in an effort to guarantee a voice to every religious group, political offices and parliamentary seats have been apportioned to different sects, depending on their size, ever since independence. The result is a system that requires consensus -- even as it also hardens social divisions and encourages bizarre alliances and deals among bitter foes. It should be little surprise, then, that the very elections that were supposed to confirm the end of Syrian rule by handing political power over to the March 14 majority coalition also ended up tearing that majority apart.
 The March 14 coalition was made up of a disparate array of parties, led by the largely Sunni Future Movement of Saad Hariri, the son and political heir of the late prime minister. It also included Walid Jumblatt's Druse-Christian bloc and a collection of Christian and secular parties. Aligned against the coalition were Hezbollah and the other pro-Syrian Shiite party, Amal, and a flotilla of smaller pro-Syrian groups. For a time, at least, it appeared that the pro- and anti-Syrian factions would face off against each other in a clear contest.
 But in Lebanon things are rarely that simple. When Gen. Michel Aoun, a Christian populist and former prime minister, returned from exile in France in May 2005, the March 14 coalition was wary of his intentions: Did he wish to join the movement or take it over -- or perhaps wreck it? Aoun was popular in Lebanon's Christian strongholds and had impeccable anti-Syrian credentials: he had battled the Syrian Army in the final days of the civil war. But his sweeping denunciations of the country's elites and his apparent willingness to hasten his return by making deals with pro-Syrian politicians, and probably the Syrian regime itself, gave the March 14 leaders pause. 
 At this point, the volatility of Lebanon's politicians and the complexity of its political system gave Hezbollah a crucial opportunity. Walid Jumblatt, the Druse leader, was concerned that Aoun's candidates would take seats away from him in one of two districts the Druse leader considers his reserved constituencies. A cunning, contrapuntal politician, Jumblatt has always advanced his interests through triangulation -- working both sides of an issue until one emerges stronger and he can capitalize on it. That is why it was jarring, but not surprising, to see him reach out to Hezbollah and Amal in late March 2005. Jumblatt needed Hezbollah's votes to overcome the Aounist challenge, and to make sure he got them, he engineered a deal. A new electoral law would protect Hezbollah's representation in Parliament. In return, Hezbollah would instruct its constituents to vote for Jumblatt's candidates. The Druse leader forced the inexperienced Hariri to go along with an effort designed to marginalize Aoun and create three large blocs in Parliament: a Jumblatt bloc, a Hariri bloc and a joint Hezbollah and Amal bloc.
 I later asked Jumblatt why he had conducted this maneuver. He answered that he hoped to bring Hezbollah into the national consensus in a post-Syria Lebanon and to bargain with it from a position of strength. That was disingenuous. The fractured Lebanese system invites expediency, but also destructiveness. Through his efforts, the Druse leader infuriated the Maronite Christians, notably their patriarch, Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, Syria's most stalwart and courageous opponent. The community felt betrayed. It had endured the most political isolation during the Syrian years, and it had taken to the streets after Hariri's death more actively than the initially timorous Sunnis. What it got was a Parliament that made most Christian candidates effectively dependent for their seats on the whims of Hariri, Jumblatt and the Shiite parties. Many Maronites saw this as a denial of their place in Lebanon's new equation. 
 In the end, Jumblatt's maneuver worked: he, Hariri and their Christian allies were able to assemble a parliamentary majority true to the spirit of the March 14 movement and, by consequence, a cabinet majority. But Hezbollah and Amal also had a large bloc, and following Lebanon's customs of consensus-based governance, they were invited to join the cabinet. The opposition was led by Aoun; in a masterful electoral swerve of his own, the onetime anti-Syrian firebrand had allied himself with various pro-Syrian politicians and acquired their votes. Thus, in only a matter of weeks, the dizzying duplicity of Lebanese politics had swept all concord away, and the idealists of the Independence Intifada either found themselves standing against their former comrades or too disgusted to trust the political class.
 It was to the credit of the new prime minister, Fouad Siniora, one of Rafik Hariri's closest collaborators, that he tried to chart a way through this wilderness of mirrors. Siniora's job was not an easy one. His first priority was to help the United Nations begin its investigation of Hariri's assassination. Given the high probability of Syrian involvement, he knew Lebanon would face a reaction from the worried men in Damascus and also from their Hezbollah allies in Lebanon. As anti-Syrian politicians and journalists were marked for assassination throughout the year and a series of bomb explosions tore through Christian areas, these fears seemed justified.
 Meanwhile, Siniora also had to handle relations with Hezbollah. Five of the ministers in his cabinet were Shiites, either members of Hezbollah and Amal or named by them. Members of the parliamentary majority affirmed their desire to see Hezbollah integrated into the armed forces and to see the state regain control over all the national territory -- meaning Hezbollah must no longer rule over the border with Israel. But desiring Hezbollah's disarmament was one thing; achieving it, another. When it came to such matters, the parliamentary majority was reluctant to act like a majority. Hariri was especially diffident, probably because his Saudi sponsors advised him to avoid precipitating any Sunni-Shiite showdown that might boomerang in the kingdom. But the chief obstacle, of course, was Hezbollah itself. The militia realized that without its weapons, it would lose its reason to exist as a militant movement, lose its elan and lose its value to Syria -- as well as its ties to its main financier and advocate, Iran.
 It did not take very long before the rift between Hezbollah's supporters and detractors was reflected in the cabinet. The most divisive episode came late last year, when the government majority sought to approve a mixed Lebanese-international court to try the suspects in the Hariri assassination. The Shiite ministers refused to go along, arguing that the move was premature. The majority saw this as a ploy to protect Syria at a time when Nasrallah was publicly reaffirming his alliance with the Assad regime. On Dec. 12, in the tense hours following the assassination of the prominent anti-Syrian journalist Gebran Tueni, the government broke the deadlock by voting to approve a mixed tribunal. This was constitutionally defensible, but the Shiite ministers claimed it broke the rule that all important decisions must be made by consensus. They walked out of the government but did not resign. Hezbollah was not about to lose the convenient cover of legitimacy provided by participation in the cabinet, but it had every intention of gumming up the system so that the cabinet majority would not act as a majority again.
 For all its efforts, Siniora's government became less and less able to govern. Early this year, Nabih Berri, the speaker of Parliament, proposed a ''national dialogue'' of leading politicians to address the most divisive issues -- like the fate of Hezbollah's weapons. But little came of this. In the dialogue, Nasrallah would make concessions and then invariably step back from implementing them. The final straw was the July 12 abduction of the Israelis. For most of the ministers in the government, the operation was nothing less than a coup, a brazen effort to show that the majority had no control over so basic a matter as a declaration of war.
 Several months ago, I began participating in a series of informal discussions with orphans of this wretched state of affairs. Our group is heavy on southern Lebanese, both Shiites and Christians, and its very modest ambition is to create a forum for exchanges between individuals unable to identify with any of the major blocs in Parliament. For the Shiites in the group, there is a pressing desire to loosen Hezbollah's grip on their community. Several come from the 1970's left, but that is by no means the rule. The organizer of the group is a journalist who was close to Hezbollah a decade ago, having been the host of a program on Al Manar, the Hezbollah television channel, while another, also a journalist, hails from a prominent southern religious family.
 Endeavors like these are worthy because their starting point is the assumption that Lebanon really must be governed through mutual concessions and dialogue. Amid the general sectarianism, this may sound absurd. The ideal of Lebanon as a mosaic of separate but collaborating communities has been shattered so many times that it is difficult even to know what collaboration might mean. But it is also true that grounds for hope exist. Over the past half-century, the once-marginalized Shiites have steadily integrated themselves into Lebanese politics and society. While Shiites today largely accept Hezbollah's claim to be their representative and protector, in the future new forms of Shiite politics and expression may emerge -- must emerge.
 And yet the current war is pushing the country in precisely the opposite direction. The great fear expressed by many Lebanese is that the country can absorb neither a Hezbollah victory against Israel nor a Hezbollah defeat. If Hezbollah merely survives as both a political and military organization, it can claim victory. The result may be the expansion of the party's authority over the political system, thanks to its weaponry and its considerable sway over the Lebanese Army, which has a substantial Shiite base. This, in turn, might lead to a solidification of Iranian influence and the restoration of Syrian influence. A Hezbollah defeat, in turn, would be felt by Shiites as a defeat for their community in general, significantly destabilizing the system.
 As the violence continues, retribution is in the air. Israel has focused its attacks on Shiites, leaving Sunni, Christian and Druse areas (though not their long-term welfare) relatively intact. Amid all the destruction, many a representative of the March 14 movement has denounced Hezbollah's ''adventurism,'' provoking Shiite resentment. As one Hezbollah combatant recently told The Guardian: ''The real battle is after the end of this war. We will have to settle score with the Lebanese politicians. We also have the best security and intelligence apparatus in this country, and we can reach any of those people who are speaking against us now. Let's finish with the Israelis, and then we will settle scores later.''
 This essentially repeated what Hassan Nasrallah told Al Jazeera in an interview broadcast a week after the conflict began: ''If we succeed in achieving the victory. . .we will never forget all those who supported us at this stage. . . .As for those who sinned against us. . .those who made mistakes, those who let us down and those who conspired against us . . .this will be left for a day to settle accounts. We might be tolerant with them, and we might not.''
 Meanwhile, the country has sunk into deep depression, and countless Lebanese with the means to emigrate are thinking of doing so. The offspring of March 8 and March 14 are in the same boat, and yet still remain very much apart. The fault lines from the days of the Independence Intifada have hardened under Israel's bombs. Given the present balance of forces, it is difficult to conceive of a resolution to the present fighting that would both satisfy the majority's desire to disarm Hezbollah and satisfy Hezbollah's resolve to defend Shiite gains and remain in the vanguard of the struggle against Israel. Something must give, and until the parliamentary majority and Hezbollah can reach a common vision of what Lebanon must become, the rot will set in further.
 In his Al Jazeera comments, Nasrallah made it clear that the imperatives of ''resistance'' still trumped those of conciliation. But he sounded a little more conciliatory in a subsequent speech on Al Manar, when he emphasized that Hezbollah was struggling on behalf of all Lebanese. With hundreds of thousands of his brethren displaced from their homes, with Lebanon already facing an estimated $2.5 billion in direct losses, with Hezbollah having alienated many of its countrymen, even as it has fired off its prize weapons in a war of little benefit, maybe Nasrallah saw something he hadn't earlier: that his party may not always be the only party to hold the weapons. Faced with his intransigence, unable to peacefully settle their differences with Hezbollah, Lebanon's other communities will likely rearm. The result may be a return to civil war. And if that happens, nothing will put Lebanon -- let alone liberal Lebanon -- back together again.

HEADLINE: Why the Rich Are Different

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''The Rich Spend Just Like You and Me'' (Economic View, Aug. 6), the income of the top 1 percent of Americans was estimated to have grown by an inflation-adjusted 44 percent from 1994 to 2004, versus 10 percent for everyone else. And the savings rate of the top 5 percent of households was gauged to have fallen from 13.6 percent in 1990 to 6.2 percent in the first quarter this year. 
 Such numbers substantially understate both the growth of income and the savings of the very rich, because a large part of their growing wealth comes from the surge in the value of their equities and real estate that has never been realized. 
 Consider Bill Gates. Much of his wealth reflects unrealized capital gains in Microsoft stock and options. Yet these gains do not enter into the national income statistics, nor do they augment the official personal savings rate. 
 If we counted unrealized capital gains as income, we would see that inequality in income and wealth in this country has risen even more rapidly than the earlier figures suggest, and that the very rich save a much higher fraction of their income than 6.2 percent.

HEADLINE: For Long-Term Dependability, Check the Initial Quality

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
FOR many consumers, the most important factor in choosing a new vehicle is not the hipness of its design, the comfort of its seats or even the number of cup holders on board. These practical-minded buyers want to know how well a car or truck will hold up in the years ahead; the less trouble-prone it promises to be, the more desirable it is. 
 While it is impossible to know exactly how dependable any new vehicle will be, a model's repair record offers a reasonable basis for predicting how often it might need to visit the repair shop in the future. The latest survey of owners' experience, the 2006 Vehicle Dependability Study by J. D. Power & Associates, released last week, offers some useful indicators. Among other things, it shows that cars with few defects when new tend to remain reliable as they age.
The study by J. D. Power, the influential market research firm that rates everything from airlines to bass boats and mortgage lenders, measures problems experienced by owners of three-year-old vehicles. The 2006 V.D.S. is based on responses from 47,620 original owners of 2003 models. 
 This study is important to consumers: 61 percent of new-car buyers say that long-term durability is among their most important factors in choosing a vehicle, the firm's research has shown. Automakers are eager to earn high ratings in this study because owners of three-year-old cars may soon be purchasing again, and good marks may encourage loyalty to the brand.
 The numbers from this year's dependability study reveal broader trends, too. For instance, the gap in long-term quality between luxury and nonluxury brands has been cut in half over the last four years. While Lexus is again the top brand in dependability -- for the 12th consecutive year -- and Cadillac ranks fourth, three of the top five are nonluxury brands: Mercury, in second place, Buick in third and Toyota in fifth. 
 J. D. Power calculates its rankings by the number of reported problems per 100 vehicles. The lower the score, the better the performance.
 The study presents its findings in two ways, rating both brands and individual models. A total of 37 brands sold in the United States were ranked from the one with the fewest problems per 100 vehicles (Lexus at 136) to the one with the most faults (Land Rover at 438). The industry average for 2006 was 227 problems, down from 237 in the 2005 study.
 The ratings for individual models lists the top three in market segments defined by Power. Japanese nameplates dominated: Lexus, Honda and Toyota had the most models at the top of their segments. Lexus had four: the GS 300-GS 430, GX 470, LS 430 and SC 430. Toyota also had four: the Echo, RAV4, Highlander and Tundra. Honda had three: Civic, S2000 and Odyssey. 
 Detroit's automakers have been narrowing the gap with the Japanese. Of the 13 brands above the industry average this year, six were from Ford and General Motors and five were Japanese nameplates; only two, BMW and Jaguar, were European. 
 One pitfall of looking at three-year-old vehicles is that some models may already be out of production by the time the study is released; a number of segment winners are no longer available in new-car showrooms, making the information useful mostly to buyers of used cars. Another survey from J. D. Power, the Initial Quality Study, tallies problems of makes and individual models in the first 90 days of ownership. The 2006 I.Q.S. was released in June.
 While it sometimes seems as though auto surveys are being released daily, the long-term look provided by the Power dependability study has little competition; it is the most widely cited of those conducted by market research companies. Another source of information for consumers is the annual car reliability survey by Consumer Reports; results from its latest survey were published in the magazine's April auto issue. The 2006 survey was based on reliability information for about one million vehicles, provided by subscribers to the magazine and its Web site.
 Consumers looking for solid finger-pointing advice will find a good deal of agreement between the surveys by Power and Consumer Reports. In addition, there is a strong correlation between the Initial Quality Study and what happens three years later in the Vehicle Dependability Study, said Neal Oddes, director of product research and analysis for J. D. Power. 
 ''If you are going to improve in I.Q.S. over four years, there is a good likelihood that you will improve in V.D.S.,'' he said.
 Of course, buyers need to keep in mind that there is a time lag. For instance, Hyundai ranked third in this year's I.Q.S., but two months later was below the industry average in dependability. That, Mr. Oddes explained, is because Hyundai, while improving steadily, did not show a big leap in initial quality until 2005; the three-year dependability study does not yet reflect that improvement.
 And BMW, which has been doing well in dependability, made a poor showing this year in initial quality. One reason: I.Q.S. was changed in 2006 to place more emphasis on design issues. BMW fared poorly in part because new owners struggled with the interface of its electronic information system. Porsche, the top brand in initial quality this year, had also done well in the same study in 2003, finishing seventh. But in the latest dependability rankings, the company placed 22nd. The drop was caused by problems with the audio systems as well as the ride, handling and braking of the 911 and Boxster that showed up after the 90-day study was completed, Mr. Oddes said.
 Even a strong correlation between the studies does not mean that every model gets a top mark three years later. Of the 50 models that fared best in the 2003 Intial Quality Study, 26 got top billing in the dependability study released last week. 
 A brand ranking compiled by Consumer Reports of 2003 models listed 15 brands that were above average. In Power's V.D.S., 13 brands were rated above the industry average for 2003 models. Nine brands made both lists: Lexus, Toyota, Honda, Acura, Buick, Infiniti, Mercury, Ford and BMW. 
 Differences in the studies that do arise may be a result of the number and types of questions asked in the two surveys, said David Champion, director of automotive testing for Consumer Reports.
 ''I think Consumer Reports is purely looking at things gone wrong, whereas J. D. Power is things gone wrong and satisfaction with the product,'' Mr. Champion said, using the industry term for vehicle problems.
 Individual models that got top ratings in the V.D.S. also tended to do well in the Consumer Reports ratings. In fact, most vehicles that did well on the V.D.S. were rated by Consumer Reports as either ''much better than average'' or ''better than average.'' 
 Mr. Oddes and Mr. Champion agreed that it was good for consumers to have two independent sources of information. While the matchups between the studies are not perfect, there are many similarities, potentially a significant bit of guidance for consumers whose priority is no-fuss motoring.

HEADLINE: Behind the People Behind the Wheel

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
DIOMEDES LORA, who owns a window-tinting business on Dyckman Street in Inwood, speaks of taxis with the reverence that the Plains Indians once showed for the buffalo. ''The taxi is a big thing, and it has many parts,'' Mr. Lora said two weeks ago, standing in front of his rented garage. ''A taxi driver needs tires, he needs gasoline, he needs electrical maintenance, he needs insurance and parking.'' 
 A short, muscular man who kept one hand hooked into his belt, Mr. Lora gestured up and down the street at businesses catering to taxi drivers, among them a radio shop and a car wash plastered with cab-company decals. ''It's amazing how they spark the economy,'' he said. 
Certain New York neighborhoods have signature industries -- Wall Street has its investment houses, Chelsea its art galleries -- and in such areas, spinoff shops pop up, catering to the dominant local business. So it is in Upper Manhattan, where the pre-eminent business is livery cabs, and the satellite ones include ventures like Mr. Lora's. 
 Livery cabs are so numerous in Washington Heights and Inwood that they often snarl traffic. On the 65 short and skinny streets in Manhattan north of 155th Street, no fewer than 2,078 such cabs are registered; a neighborhood that has 2.6 percent of the city's population has 8.5 percent of its livery cabs. Their two-way radios are so common that they can interfere with television reception, according to Miguel Martinez, a local City Council member, who is himself a former driver. (Mr. Martinez had an Oldsmobile 98 ''with a good sound system,'' he recalled, perfect for playing merengue and hip-hop.)
 And the livery industry, already robust, is getting more so. Last fall, for example, the Taxi and Limousine Commission approved the opening of another livery company in the neighborhood. The debate over the new company, the area's 12th, was rancorous; residents complained about the scarcity of parking, and taxi drivers grumbled about intensifying a competition that is already fierce. 
 But owners of the satellite businesses are smiling. 
 ''I always give taxi drivers better prices, because they come more often,'' Mr. Lora said. ''The driver only keeps his car three years, and after that he has to redo everything: he has to get a radio, he has to get tinted windows. It's a client that recycles itself.''
 Businesses that serve cabdrivers also tend to adopt their habits -- addressing them by car number, for example, a practice the drivers follow with each other. ''If you know 100 cabdrivers, you probably know one or two by their name,'' said Edward Guzman, who was fixing a Town Car's air-conditioner at Celin Auto Electric, on 10th Avenue and Isham Street. ''They'll tell me, 'This guy 05 is sending you a car.' '' Julio Alvarez, the owner of 195 Brokerage on 181st Street, an insurer for cab drivers, named his firm after his former car number. Where there are cars there are also car washes, and Upper Manhattan has a good half-dozen. When each cab arrives, the workers swarm over it like pit crews at the Daytona 500, swabbing the interiors and brushing the chrome on the wheels. At Broadway Hand Car Wash one late afternoon, as a cab pulled slowly back into traffic after a wash, a worker followed it nearly off the curb, still wiping at the bumper. 
 Speedy service, along with low prices, is particularly important to the success of these satellite shops. Unlike drivers of yellow cabs, livery drivers tend to own their cars, and when they go to the garage or the car wash, they are both missing work and anticipating a bill. 
 ''I'm going to have to work until 12 o'clock today,'' said Anthony Sanchez, a driver who went to the Celin garage because the window of his Town Car would not roll up. 
 According to Mr. Guzman, the Celin mechanic, his clients' favorite topic is how bad business is. ''They always complain, especially in the shop, because they're always looking to get a little off,'' Mr. Guzman said. ''They want to let you know it's not going well.''
 AROUND the corner from Celin is a barbershop that caters to livery drivers. One day a few weeks ago, the normally reserved owner of Los Taxistas Barber Shop, Bolivar Morales, could be found dancing around his shop, clicking a pair of scissors like a set of maracas. Two speakers mounted on the lime green walls blared merengue so loudly that a receptionist could hardly hear the occasional caller. 
 Mr. Morales, a former driver, said that about 40 percent of his customers were drivers or former drivers, who get a 30 percent discount on Mondays and Tuesdays. But discounts are not the only draw. ''Taxi drivers are very social,'' said Alberto Jimenez, a driver getting his $10 trim safely out of reach of Mr. Morales's musical scissors. ''They do many things together.'' 
 What do taxi drivers discuss as the hair gets snipped? ''They talk about bad government, and about the rising price of gasoline,'' said one of the barbers, Lenny Rodriguez. ''They say their base is the best.'' They also pass on tips about traffic, which the barbers redistribute. 
 Unsurprisingly, Los Taxistas Barber Shop is not the only Upper Manhattan business with ''taxista'' in its name. Other such establishments include Restaurante El Taxista Ecuatoriano, a dim Ecuadorean place on Audubon Avenue in Washington Heights, and El Taxista News, a free monthly paper whose office consists of a tiny basement room on 181st Street. 
 On a recent afternoon, Jose Rodriguez, the newspaper's rumpled owner, editor and star reporter, sat in his office, below a display of old El Taxista News covers. (One headline: ''Judge Makes Fun of Taxi Drivers.'') 
 Mr. Rodriguez was chatting about Los Taxistas Barber Shop -- he drops off 50 copies there each month, he said, and ''they're all taken away in a few days'' -- when the phone rang and he excused himself. ''This is a musical taxi driver, an accordionist,'' he said. ''He wants a story.''

HEADLINE: Same Problem, Different Stations

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
AT 8:30 on a recent morning in West Windsor, N.J., Ken Anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car, waiting patiently for a train to pull into the Princeton Junction station from New York. 
 He was not picking anyone up. In what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into Manhattan, Mr. Anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot.
 ''There's usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars, and when one of their spots opens up, I make my move,'' said Mr. Anderson, 34, of Hightstown, N.J., who works as an accounts payable supervisor at Atari. ''To have any chance for a parking spot, you have to get here before 6:30 in the morning or after 8. For me, parking every day is an adventure.''
 Earlier that morning, Kristan Flynn, a 34-year-old research associate who lives in Princeton, five miles from the station, sped into the parking lot on her bicycle. 
 ''No place to park,'' she said. ''Even the bike racks are nearly all full.''
 More than 7,000 people board commuter trains each day at the Princeton Junction station, but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them, according to New Jersey Transit.
 For Mr. Anderson and the 3,767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the West Windsor Parking Authority, the wait can be as long as seven years, officials said. Another 2,833 from West Windsor are on a two-year waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents. 
 Commuters don't have many alternatives at nearby stations. 
 Thirteen miles to the south, the daily lot at the Hamilton train station is filled by 6:30 a.m., and there are no available permits. A few miles south, in Trenton, the parking garage operator says the $90-a-month specials are all taken, leaving commuters the option of paying $8 a day or $135 a month. 
 At a time when Gov. Jon S. Corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River, at a cost of $7.2 billion, transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem: even now there are not enough parking spaces. 
 And the problem is not unique to New Jersey. Parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by Metro-North in Westchester County and Connecticut and by the Long Island Rail Road in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In Westchester, there are about 26,000 parking spaces for 75,000 commuters. On Long Island, almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full.
 ''If we're growing the commuter rail system, we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains,'' said Jon Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign in New York, a mass transit advocacy group. ''It's a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area.'' 
 Yet, commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies, like New Jersey Transit and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, that have failed to keep up with the growing demand. 
 The names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles. In the meantime, people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and, at Princeton Junction, even offering nearby homeowners $100 a month to use their driveways. 
 Gone are what transportation officials call the ''kiss and ride'' days, when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night. For many families, the parking crunch has created a hardship, particularly for those working parents who can't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 a.m. or who would like to put their child on the school bus come September, but can't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn. 
 Those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies, including getting there by bicycle, in-line skating, even skateboards. 
 IN New Jersey and across the region, municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations. This means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents. It also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages, often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community, leading to more traffic.
 ''Adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the big-city boogeyman is coming,'' said Darius Sollohub, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college's School of Architecture.
 ''It makes them feel that they have become too urban, that they are a city now and no longer a town,'' Mr. Sollohub said. ''It goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place.''
 Even in towns with resident-only parking lots, the waiting list can be long and the process for getting a permit arduous. In Rowayton, Conn., a shortage of parking spots forces commuters -- millionaires and chief executives among them -- to line up every year on the Saturday before Father's Day to have their permits renewed. The line begins to form around midnight, when men and women (or teenagers they pay to do the job), some on folding chairs, others resting in sleeping bags, wait through the night for a new windshield sticker that will assure them of a parking space every day for the next year.
 In the end, 375 lucky residents walk away with the town's coveted prize.
 In some towns, residents have given up parking by the rules, even if it means getting tickets. At the Cold Spring Harbor station in Huntington, on Long Island, commuters have become so desperate that they have been leaving their cars in emergency vehicle lanes the last few months.
 ''Some people are also parking on the lawn, and they have been ticketed and are now a little sore about it,'' said Joan Cergol, the assistant to the town supervisor of Huntington. ''The Cold Spring station is first come first served, and it fills up rather quickly.''
 In January 2003, James E. McGreevey, then the governor of New Jersey, approved a $200 million, five-year plan for the construction of parking garages and lots that would meet a goal of creating 20,000 parking spaces throughout the state. So far, 11,500 spaces have been added, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, including 5,500 spots at rail stations, 4,300 at light rail stations and an additional 1,700 at bus terminals, at a total cost of about $105 million.
 Still, despite those additions and others that Mr. Stessel said were in the works -- including the opening of a 2,000-space garage in Hamilton, N.J., in November that would replace street-level parking and result in an increase of 600 parking spaces -- the creation of new spaces is not keeping up with the demand for affordable parking and the expectation that ridership will continue to grow.
 ''In terms of adding enough spaces to meet the needs of our commuters, I'm never happy with the pace,'' said George D. Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit. ''But we are moving as fast as we can, and I think we have demonstrated that the past few years, during which time we have spent between $175 million and $200 million to add parking around the state.'' 
 Mr. Warrington said that 4,500 spaces would be added in New Jersey during the next 12 to 18 months. The agency's goal, he said, is to add 2,000 to 4,000 spaces across the state every year for the next 10 years. 
 Although Mr. Warrington said that the plan was to meet the projected increase in ridership that the proposed Hudson River tunnel would most likely bring, a look at New Jersey Transit's own numbers indicates that adding 25,000 to 45,000 spaces does not begin to meet commuters' immediate needs.
 Based on the figures, there are an estimated 124,150 riders who travel on New Jersey Transit's trains on any given weekday, and only 55,000 parking spaces in private and municipal lots statewide. 
 Some towns have come up with creative solutions to help ease the parking crunch, including offering valet service at the Millburn and Summit stations in New Jersey, according to Gary Roth, a parking consultant with BJF Planning in Manhattan, a private consulting company that helps municipalities address parking woes. 
 ''Millburn originally had enough parking for 300 vehicles and was able to squeeze in an additional 140 cars'' with the valet service, Mr. Roth said. ''Summit had 120 cars prior to valet parking, and has since added parking for 75 to 100 cars.'' 
 Millburn and Summit each pay about $3,000 a week to the vendors that provide the attendants for valet service. 
 After officials in Maplewood, N.J., dismissed proposals for a parking garage in the township, they offered free jitneys to get commuters to and from trains and buses. 
 Mr. Roth said that for some towns, finding the solution to parking problems can sometimes have a negative effect on a local economy.
 TEN years ago in Brewster, N.Y., a second Metro-North train station, called Brewster North, was built to accommodate the overflow of commuter vehicles at the station in the center of town, where many businesses are located. ''Now people began driving to the new station and not shopping in the village anymore,'' Mr. Roth said. ''By moving parking away from the village, people's shopping patterns actually changed.''
 In West Windsor, Mayor Shing-Fu Hsueh acknowledged that a lack of parking at Princeton Junction had been ''one of the biggest complaints'' among residents, and nonresidents. To help address the problem, the town is reviewing proposals from 17 companies vying to redevelop 350 acres around the Princeton Junction station. It hopes to create a so-called transit village, including new commercial and residential buildings, as well as sidewalks and expanded parking -- all within walking distance of the station, Mayor Hsueh said. This is the same approach that New Jersey Transit is trying to take with other communities, including Hamilton. 
 While the transit village approach has been lauded by policy makers as an example of ''smart growth'' development because it is created within walking distance of public transportation, none of the current proposals for Princeton Junction or Hamilton would provide enough parking to meet existing demand. This is parking that is needed, in large part, because of the increase in development in central New Jersey over the last 20 years. 
 Mr. Warrington of New Jersey Transit said that among the possible solutions to the parking problem in Princeton Junction was the addition of another train stop, to the north, in South Brunswick. 
 ''I have also challenged our guys to explore a valet system at Princeton Junction,'' he said. ''Valet parking has proven to be very successful and profitable in other towns.''
 And if there isn't enough parking now, what can commuters expect if plans for a second rail tunnel linking New Jersey and Manhattan under the Hudson come to fruition? Transportation officials expect that an increase in ridership in New Jersey would be likely to create major parking shortages in Bergen, Essex, Passaic and Hudson Counties.
 In that event, a parking garage on Route 17, in Ramsey, that was recently built by New Jersey Transit but has been so underused that transit officials rented some of the spaces to a local car dealer, might fill up. Mr. Warrington acknowledged that the agency had made a mistake by not adding parking to the Secaucus Junction transfer station, which has its own exit off the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 ''Frankly, Secaucus is an ideal location for cars to park before they enter the vortex of chaos that is the Lincoln Tunnel,'' he said.
 Since many of the decisions about parking still remain with municipalities, not only in New Jersey, but in Westchester, Connecticut and Long Island as well, is it time for state government to insist that cities and towns cannot restrict access to public parking? 
 ''Home rule is a very sacred thing,'' Mr. Orcutt of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign said. ''Politicians would be crucified if they intruded onto the turf of a town's right to control land and passed it off to a regional agency like New Jersey Transit.''
 In the meantime, commuters wait and hope. For eight years, Wayne Larsen and his wife, Debbie, arranged their lives around her picking him up and dropping him off at New Jersey Transit's Aberdeen-Matawan station. Finally, in December, he received a letter from the township, granting him an annual parking permit for $360. He had submitted the application in 1998.
 ''It was like receiving a winning lottery ticket,'' said Mr. Larsen, 49, a printer who works in Manhattan. ''Now maybe I can go back to living a normal life.''

HEADLINE: Tunnel Visionaries

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, New Jersey Transit and the federal government are moving ahead with plans to build a new $7 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson. That is good for the co-dependent economies of the Garden State and New York City, neither of which can prosper without the other. 
 It is also good news for automobile addicts. Instead of sitting in traffic while trying to cross the Hudson River during rush hour, they will have a new reason to kick their increasingly expensive habit.
The new tunnel, which will complement the existing tunnel that links Penn Station to the American mainland, has been on the wish list of regional planners for years. The wish recently came much closer to reality when the Port Authority pledged $2 billion for the effort. New Jersey Transit and federal transportation agencies will pick up the rest of the tab. 
 Preliminary engineering work is about to begin, with 2016 the target date for completion.
 The new tunnel will double rail capacity under the river, allowing New Jersey Transit to transport 86,000 daily rush-hour commuters by 2025, up from today's 43,000. It will also improve service along Amtrak's heavily used Northeast Corridor.
 Commuters from the west, including some upstate New York counties, account for about 15 percent of the gross city product of New York City, according to the Regional Plan Association. And New Jersey owes a sizable portion of its prosperity to the availability of high-paying jobs in Manhattan.
 It's alarming to consider, then, how much the region's 21st-century economy depends on early-20th-century planning and engineering. The current rail tunnel, which takes New Jersey commuters and Amtrak passengers into dreary Penn Station, is nearly a century old and holds just two tracks. It was built for a time when New Jersey really was a garden state, and when New York City's economy was far less reliant on guest workers from west of the Hudson.
 Over the past decade, New Jersey Transit has vastly improved access to Penn Station. Its Midtown Direct service offers a direct link to Manhattan from Morris, Union, Somerset and Essex Counties. Its Frank R. Lautenberg Rail Station in Secaucus allows passengers from northern New Jersey and upstate New York to transfer to Penn Station-bound trains.
 Partly as a result of this expansion, the existing rail tunnel cannot accommodate any more trains during rush hour. And, as regular commuters know well, a single mishap in the tunnel can lead to hours of delays and inconvenience.
 The new tunnel would add two more tracks, one in each direction. Equally important, the plan calls for expansion of a century-old, two-track rail bridge over the Hackensack River near the tunnel. Without additional bridge capacity, the new tunnel may not be able to reach its potential.
 The region's economy requires 21st-century improvements in its infrastructure. The new rail tunnel is an important step in that direction.

HEADLINE: A Borrower's Right to Back Out 

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS who have committed to refinancing a mortgage sometimes wish they could back out of their obligation after closing. 
 It turns out they can, at least in some cases.
After closing a typical mortgage refinancing contract, consumers have three days during which they may rescind the agreement and obtain a full refund of appraisal fees and other payments they made in the course of obtaining the loan. The right has been in existence for decades, but industry executives and analysts said consumers often overlook it in the stack of disclosure documents they sign during a closing.
 ''Most consumers are involved in transactions with reputable borrowers, where they get the deal they thought they were going to get, so they don't need to exercise this right,'' said David Wiese, the chairman of the financial services department of Tyler Cooper & Alcorn, a Hartford law firm. ''But when there are 20 or 30 disclosures to sign during a transaction, I think some consumers walk away not realizing they have this right.'' 
 The right of rescission, as it is known, is a federally mandated contractual provision, and it is limited to refinancing agreements and must be exercised by midnight of the third business day after closing. It does not extend to refinancing agreements in which the original lender simply offers a new interest rate, with no new money being lent aside from cash for closing costs.
 Borrowers can rescind for any reason, and as soon they notify the lender of the rescission, the lender has 20 days to refund all the fees associated with the transaction to everyone involved. 
 Any owner of the mortgaged property can rescind, Mr. Wiese said, so if the husband is the borrower but his wife's name is on the title, she can reverse the contract.
 The right of rescission has its roots in the so-called ''tin men'' scams of the 1950's, in which aluminum-siding salesmen would agree to finance the siding by taking out a mortgage on the house without the owners understanding the contractual terms. State laws granting rescission rights were consolidated in federal ''truth in lending'' laws in 1968. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association does not track the number of rescissions exercised by consumers each year, but industry executives said such actions are quite rare.
 Thomas J. Pinkowish, an author of ''Residential Mortgage Lending'' (South-Western Educational Publishing, 2003) and the president of Remoc Associates in Essex, Conn., consultants to the mortgage industry, said that he rescinded a refinancing agreement in 2004 after the lender raised the interest rate beyond the terms originally agreed upon.
 Consumers should use their right to rescind, Mr. Pinkowish said, only when the lender's terms vary significantly from what was originally promised, or if the borrower's financial situation changes drastically. ''It should be exercised with responsibility,'' he said, ''because if it's abused, it can severely impact the industry and hurt consumers.'' 
 For example, borrowers will sometimes apply with several lenders simultaneously and use the right of rescission to coerce them into offering better terms. Lenders, who invest significant time and money in refinancing transactions, ultimately recoup those costs by charging higher fees to other customers.
 One way to avoid a rescission is to ask lenders for a copy of the so-called HUD-1 settlement statement, which by law lenders must make available 24 hours before closing. ''That gives you the time to review everything,'' Mr. Pinkowish said, ''so you can ask questions before you're at the table.''

HEADLINE: Raising Preferential Rents In Rent-Stabilized Buildings

 BODY:

Q -- When I moved into my rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan, the landlord offered me a lower ''preferred'' rent. In my most recent renewal lease, the landlord eliminated the discount. Is this legal?

A -- That depends, said David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. Under a 2003 amendment to the rent laws, he said, a landlord is allowed to offer a tenant in a rent-stabilized apartment a rent that is lower than the legally allowable rent. In order for the landlord to be allowed to revert to the maximum legal regulated rent at the end of the lease, he said, it must be indicated in the lease that the lower rent is a preferential rent. 
In fact, Mr. Ng said, since the amendment was adopted, there have been at least two appellate court rulings interpreting it. In one, he said, the Appellate Term, First Department ruled that if the lease indicates the rent being charged is a preferential rent but also implies that the preferential rent will continue, then in renewal leases, allowable rent increases will be applied to the lower figure. 
 And in a decision in June, he said, the same court ruled that a landlord who did not indicate both the preferential rent and the maximum allowable rent in the lease, and who filed a false registration statement with the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, would have to base future lease renewals on the preferential rent, subject to legal rent increases.
 ''The court in the second case seems to be saying that if a landlord does not establish what the maximum legal regulated rent was by filing a proper registration statement with D.H.C.R.,'' Mr. Ng said, ''then the only legal rent would be the preferential rent, and that is the rent that future increases are to be based upon.''

Can a Condo Association Uproot an Owner's Garden?

Q -- In 2004 my parents purchased a town house in Somerset, N.J. When deciding whether to buy, my mother asked the sales manager if she could have a vegetable garden in the area behind the house. The manager assured her twice that she could. Recently, the association's board sent my mother a letter demanding that she remove the garden or pay a fine. Must she comply?

A -- ''It appears that the letter writer's mother will have to remove the vegetable garden,'' said Donald M. Onorato, a co-op and condominium lawyer in Hackensack, N.J.
 Mr. Onorato said the backyard area is most likely a limited common element. That, he said, is an area owned by the condominium association but used exclusively by a unit owner. And most master deeds and bylaws give the association's board the right to control the use of limited common elements. 
 Mr. Onorato added that the statements made by a sales manager or real estate agent generally would not be binding on the association.

HEADLINE: The Culture Of Nations

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Diplomats in New York rack up a lot of unpaid 0parking tickets, but not all rack them up at the same rates. According to the economists Raymond Fisman and Edward Miguel, diplomats from countries that rank high on the Transparency International corruption index pile up huge numbers of unpaid tickets, whereas diplomats from countries that rank low on the index barely get any at all.
 Between 1997 and 2002, the U.N. Mission of Kuwait picked up 246 parking violations per diplomat. Diplomats from Egypt, Chad, Sudan, Mozambique, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Syria also committed huge numbers of violations. Meanwhile, not a single parking violation by a Swedish diplomat was recorded. Nor were there any by diplomats from Denmark, Japan, Israel, Norway or Canada. 
 The reason there are such wide variations in ticket rates is that human beings are not merely products of economics. The diplomats paid no cost for parking illegally, thanks to diplomatic immunity. But human beings are also shaped by cultural and moral norms. If you're Swedish and you have a chance to pull up in front of a fire hydrant, you still don't do it. You're Swedish. That's who you are.
 Walter Lippmann got to the crux of the matter in a speech 65 years ago. People don't become happy by satisfying their desires, he said. They become happy by living within a belief system that restrains and gives coherence to their desires: 
 ''Above all the other necessities of human nature, above the satisfaction of any other need, above hunger, love, pleasure, fame -- even life itself -- what a man most needs is the conviction that he is contained within the discipline of an ordered existence.''
 People need the coherence their culture provides and value it even more than easy parking. 
 For several decades a veteran foreign aid worker, Lawrence E. Harrison, has contemplated the power of culture in shaping behavior. He's concluded that cultural differences mostly explain why some nations develop quickly while others do not. 
 All cultures have value because they provide coherence, but some cultures foster development while others retard it. Some cultures check corruption, while others permit it. Some cultures focus on the future, while others focus on the past. Some cultures encourage the belief that individuals can control their own destinies, while others encourage fatalism. 
 In a new book, ''The Central Liberal Truth,'' Harrison takes up the question that is at the center of politics today: Can we self-consciously change cultures so they encourage development and modernization? Harrison is writing about poverty, but this is incidentally a book about the war on terror, and whether it is possible to change culture in the Middle East and the ghettos of Muslim Europe.
 On the one hand, Harrison is an optimist. He has taken his title from one of Daniel Patrick Moynihan's greatest observations: ''The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.''
 But when Harrison turns to how politics can change culture, you find he is a man who has been made aware of the limitations on what we can know and achieve. Harrison and a team of global academics studied cultural transformations in Ireland, China, Latin America and elsewhere. They concluded that cultural change can't be imposed from the outside, except in rare circumstances. It has to be led by people who recognize and accept responsibility for their own culture's problems and selectively reinterpret their own traditions to encourage modernization.
 Harrison observes that gigantic investments in education, and especially in improving female literacy, usually precede transformations. Chile was highly literate in the 19th century, and in 1905, 90 percent of Japanese children were in school. These investments laid the groundwork for takeoffs that were decades away. 
 Harrison points to many other factors -- leaders who encourage economic liberalization, movements that restrict the power of the clerics -- but the main impressions he leaves are that cultural change is measured in centuries, not decades, and that cultures are separated from one another by veils of complexity and difference.
 If Harrison is right, it is no wonder that young Muslim men in Britain might decide to renounce freedom and prosperity for midair martyrdom. They are driven by a deep cultural need for meaning. But it is also foolish to think we can address the root causes of their toxic desires. We'll just have to fight the symptoms of a disease we can neither cure nor understand.

HEADLINE: Same Problem, Different Stations

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
AT 8:30 on a recent morning in West Windsor, N.J., Ken Anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car, waiting patiently for a train to pull into the Princeton Junction station from New York. 
 He was not picking anyone up. In what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into Manhattan, Mr. Anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot.
 ''There's usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars, and when one of their spots opens up, I make my move,'' said Mr. Anderson, 34, of Hightstown, N.J., who works as an accounts payable supervisor at Atari. ''To have any chance for a parking spot, you have to get here before 6:30 in the morning or after 8. For me, parking every day is an adventure.''
 Earlier that morning, Kristan Flynn, a 34-year-old research associate who lives in Princeton, five miles from the station, sped into the parking lot on her bicycle. 
 ''No place to park,'' she said. ''Even the bike racks are nearly all full.''
 More than 7,000 people board commuter trains each day at the Princeton Junction station, but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them, according to New Jersey Transit.
 For Mr. Anderson and the 3,767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the West Windsor Parking Authority, the wait can be as long as seven years, officials said. Another 2,833 from West Windsor are on a two-year waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents. 
 Commuters don't have many alternatives at nearby stations. 
 Thirteen miles to the south, the daily lot at the Hamilton train station is filled by 6:30 a.m., and there are no available permits. A few miles south, in Trenton, the parking garage operator says the $90-a-month specials are all taken, leaving commuters the option of paying $8 a day or $135 a month. 
 At a time when Gov. Jon S. Corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River, at a cost of $7.2 billion, transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem: even now there are not enough parking spaces. 
 And the problem is not unique to New Jersey. Parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by Metro-North in Westchester County and Connecticut and by the Long Island Rail Road in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In Westchester, there are about 26,000 parking spaces for 75,000 commuters. On Long Island, almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full.
 ''If we're growing the commuter rail system, we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains,'' said Jon Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign in New York, a mass transit advocacy group. ''It's a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area.'' 
 Yet, commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies, like New Jersey Transit and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, that have failed to keep up with the growing demand. 
 The names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles. In the meantime, people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and, at Princeton Junction, even offering nearby homeowners $100 a month to use their driveways. 
 Gone are what transportation officials call the ''kiss and ride'' days, when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night. For many families, the parking crunch has created a hardship, particularly for those working parents who can't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 a.m. or who would like to put their child on the school bus come September, but can't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn. 
 Those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies, including getting there by bicycle, in-line skating, even skateboards. 
 IN New Jersey and across the region, municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations. This means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents. It also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages, often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community, leading to more traffic.
 ''Adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the big-city boogeyman is coming,'' said Darius Sollohub, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college's School of Architecture.
 ''It makes them feel that they have become too urban, that they are a city now and no longer a town,'' Mr. Sollohub said. ''It goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place.''
 Even in towns with resident-only parking lots, the waiting list can be long and the process for getting a permit arduous. In Rowayton, Conn., a shortage of parking spots forces commuters -- millionaires and chief executives among them -- to line up every year on the Saturday before Father's Day to have their permits renewed. The line begins to form around midnight, when men and women (or teenagers they pay to do the job), some on folding chairs, others resting in sleeping bags, wait through the night for a new windshield sticker that will assure them of a parking space every day for the next year.
 In the end, 375 lucky residents walk away with the town's coveted prize.
 In some towns, residents have given up parking by the rules, even if it means getting tickets. At the Cold Spring Harbor station in Huntington, on Long Island, commuters have become so desperate that they have been leaving their cars in emergency vehicle lanes the last few months.
 ''Some people are also parking on the lawn, and they have been ticketed and are now a little sore about it,'' said Joan Cergol, the assistant to the town supervisor of Huntington. ''The Cold Spring station is first come first served, and it fills up rather quickly.''
 In January 2003, James E. McGreevey, then the governor of New Jersey, approved a $200 million, five-year plan for the construction of parking garages and lots that would meet a goal of creating 20,000 parking spaces throughout the state. So far, 11,500 spaces have been added, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, including 5,500 spots at rail stations, 4,300 at light rail stations and an additional 1,700 at bus terminals, at a total cost of about $105 million.
 Still, despite those additions and others that Mr. Stessel said were in the works -- including the opening of a 2,000-space garage in Hamilton, N.J., in November that would replace street-level parking and result in an increase of 600 parking spaces -- the creation of new spaces is not keeping up with the demand for affordable parking and the expectation that ridership will continue to grow.
 ''In terms of adding enough spaces to meet the needs of our commuters, I'm never happy with the pace,'' said George D. Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit. ''But we are moving as fast as we can, and I think we have demonstrated that the past few years, during which time we have spent between $175 million and $200 million to add parking around the state.'' 
 Mr. Warrington said that 4,500 spaces would be added in New Jersey during the next 12 to 18 months. The agency's goal, he said, is to add 2,000 to 4,000 spaces across the state every year for the next 10 years. 
 Although Mr. Warrington said that the plan was to meet the projected increase in ridership that the proposed Hudson River tunnel would most likely bring, a look at New Jersey Transit's own numbers indicates that adding 25,000 to 45,000 spaces does not begin to meet commuters' immediate needs.
 Based on the figures, there are an estimated 124,150 riders who travel on New Jersey Transit's trains on any given weekday, and only 55,000 parking spaces in private and municipal lots statewide. 
 Some towns have come up with creative solutions to help ease the parking crunch, including offering valet service at the Millburn and Summit stations in New Jersey, according to Gary Roth, a parking consultant with BJF Planning in Manhattan, a private consulting company that helps municipalities address parking woes. 
 ''Millburn originally had enough parking for 300 vehicles and was able to squeeze in an additional 140 cars'' with the valet service, Mr. Roth said. ''Summit had 120 cars prior to valet parking, and has since added parking for 75 to 100 cars.'' 
 Millburn and Summit each pay about $3,000 a week to the vendors that provide the attendants for valet service. 
 After officials in Maplewood, N.J., dismissed proposals for a parking garage in the township, they offered free jitneys to get commuters to and from trains and buses. 
 Mr. Roth said that for some towns, finding the solution to parking problems can sometimes have a negative effect on a local economy.
 Ten years ago in Brewster, N.Y., a second Metro-North train station, called Brewster North, was built to accommodate the overflow of commuter vehicles at the station in the center of town, where many businesses are located. ''Now people began driving to the new station and not shopping in the village anymore,'' Mr. Roth said. ''By moving parking away from the village, people's shopping patterns actually changed.'' 
 IN West Windsor, Mayor Shing-Fu Hsueh acknowledged that a lack of parking at Princeton Junction had been ''one of the biggest complaints'' among residents, and nonresidents. To help address the problem, the town is reviewing proposals from 17 companies vying to redevelop 350 acres around the Princeton Junction station. It hopes to create a so-called transit village, including new commercial and residential buildings, as well as sidewalks and expanded parking -- all within walking distance of the station, Mayor Hsueh said. This is the same approach that New Jersey Transit is trying to take with other communities, including Hamilton. 
 While the transit village approach has been lauded by policy makers as an example of ''smart growth'' development because it is created within walking distance of public transportation, none of the current proposals for Princeton Junction or Hamilton would provide enough parking to meet existing demand. This is parking that is needed, in large part, because of the increase in development in central New Jersey over the last 20 years. 
 Mr. Warrington of New Jersey Transit said that among the possible solutions to the parking problem in Princeton Junction was the addition of another train stop, to the north, in South Brunswick. 
 ''I have also challenged our guys to explore a valet system at Princeton Junction,'' he said. ''Valet parking has proven to be very successful and profitable in other towns.''
 And if there isn't enough parking now, what can commuters expect if plans for a second rail tunnel linking New Jersey and Manhattan under the Hudson come to fruition? Transportation officials expect that an increase in ridership in New Jersey would be likely to create major parking shortages in Bergen, Essex, Passaic and Hudson Counties.
 In that event, a parking garage on Route 17, in Ramsey, that was recently built by New Jersey Transit but has been so underused that transit officials rented some of the spaces to a local car dealer, might fill up. Mr. Warrington acknowledged that the agency had made a mistake by not adding parking to the Secaucus Junction transfer station, which has its own exit off the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 ''Frankly, Secaucus is an ideal location for cars to park before they enter the vortex of chaos that is the Lincoln Tunnel,'' he said.
 Since many of the decisions about parking still remain with municipalities, not only in New Jersey, but in Westchester, Connecticut and Long Island as well, is it time for state government to insist that cities and towns cannot restrict access to public parking? 
 ''Home rule is a very sacred thing,'' Mr. Orcutt of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign said. ''Politicians would be crucified if they intruded onto the turf of a town's right to control land and passed it off to a regional agency like New Jersey Transit.''
 In the meantime, commuters wait and hope. For eight years, Wayne Larsen and his wife, Debbie, arranged their lives around her picking him up and dropping him off at New Jersey Transit's Aberdeen-Matawan station. Finally, in December, he received a letter from the township, granting him an annual parking permit for $360. He had submitted the application in 1998.
 ''It was like receiving a winning lottery ticket,'' said Mr. Larsen, 49, a printer who works in Manhattan. ''Now maybe I can go back to living a normal life.''

HEADLINE: A Housing Trade-Off in White Plains 

BYLINE: By DEBRA WEST

 BODY:
On Monday, the White Plains Common Council approved the developer Martin Ginsburg's request to add another five stories onto his proposed 23-story luxury condominium complex on Main Street. Mr. Ginsburg said the cost of the project, known as the Pinnacle, had increased so much in the nearly three years that it has been in the planning stages that without the additional five stories the Pinnacle no longer made business sense. 
 ''The council didn't have any objection to adding the five stories,'' said Paul Wood, the city's executive officer. ''They understood that in the 2 1/2 years that this project has been in the making, construction costs have increased by 30 percent.'' 
The fate of a 52-unit apartment building of affordable rental housing is directly tied to the development of the Pinnacle. ''Affordable'' these days means that a family of four making 60 percent of the median income in Westchester would pay about $1,300 a month in rent for a three-bedroom apartment, Mr. Wood said.
 In granting zoning variances for the Pinnacle, where condominiums are expected to sell from $500,000 to $2.9 million, White Plains had required that Mr. Ginsburg build 11 apartments for low- and middle-income families.
 In addition, Mr. Ginsburg had struck a deal with the developer Louis R. Cappelli to build 41 units of affordable housing. Originally, those units were to be built by Mr. Cappelli in exchange for permission to build the Renaissance, a 46-story hotel and condominium project a block away. In the deal, Mr. Cappelli provided the land for the affordable units, which would be adjacent to the Pinnacle (where the Corner Nook sandwich shop and other businesses now sit); in return, Mr. Ginsburg assumed responsibility for Mr. Cappelli's share of the affordable housing requirements.
 If the Pinnacle is not built, Mr. Cappelli could reclaim the land and build the affordable apartments himself, Mr. Wood said.
 The Pinnacle is being designed by Michael Graves (who is also designing the affordable housing units) and, until this week, was to have contained 139 condominium apartments in two stylish towers. The five extra stories will include 32 additional apartments, said David Johnston, a spokesman for Mr. Ginsburg. 
 Part of the reason for Mr. Ginsburg's delay in building the affordable housing project was that he had not secured the necessary tax incentives and low-interest financing from the county's Industrial Development Agency, Mr. Wood said. Instead, on Monday the Common Council agreed to provide low-interest financing for the project through the White Plains Urban Renewal Agency. 

Manatee Makes Quiet Exit
 Without quite as much fanfare as greeted his arrival, the manatee that swam up the Hudson River last week and surprised boaters, anglers and sunbathers from Manhattan to Croton Point appears to have headed back to sea.
 Last Sunday the manatee, a 1,000-pound relative of the elephant, was spotted in waters as far upriver as Croton-on-Hudson. Manatees, which are endangered and usually live in the warm waters off Florida, occasionally make it as far north as New York, but this may be the first time one has been seen in the Hudson River.
 But he left as quickly as he came. By Monday, the animal was seen swimming south past Chelsea Piers. Then, on Wednesday morning, he was reported to be following a New York Waterways ferry just across from the World Financial Center. 
 ''He's just a big blob out there in the water,'' said John H. Vargo, publisher of the magazine Boating on the Hudson & Beyond. ''It moves very slowly, and if it gets in the way it could get hit by a boat. But who knows. It's been traveling so long and it has made it this far. So maybe it will get lucky.'' 
 Mr. Vargo, whose Web site, www.boatingonthehudson.com, contains a message board, has been receiving and posting missives on the manatee's whereabouts all week. 
 ''Let's just hope he makes it out of New York Harbor,'' Mr. Vargo said.
 And back to Florida, where it belongs.

HEADLINE: Arts Center's New Director Envisions a New Direction

BYLINE: By MICHELLE FALKENSTEIN

 BODY:
IN the spring of 2005, when the Martha Graham Dance Company was to appear at the University of California campus in Davis, Brian McCurdy, the executive director of the college's Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts, made sure that the scheduled performance was just one of many activities that would involve the company. 
 ''It was total immersion for the campus in Martha Graham,'' said Mr. McCurdy, who organized a half-week residency for the company and a two-week residency for its music director. 
 The university's student orchestra took master classes with members of the company's orchestra and played alongside them during performances. The group's artistic director gave a series of talks, and a faculty member lectured on the American music of the 1930's and 40's that Graham favored. 
 Mr. McCurdy plans to similarly integrate the activities of the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College into campus life when he assumes the role of director there this week. 
 ''I'm looking at a new vision for what a performing arts center should be in an academic setting,'' Mr. McCurdy said. ''I want to create a different relationship to the campus, with programming that's more integrated into the academic programming.'' 
 This could mean that students of the arts get to witness the creative process more closely by observing rehearsals, he explained, or that liberal arts and science students explore additional aspects of a performance, like its literary, historical or scientific contexts.
 Mr. McCurdy, 55, has worked for more than 25 years in performing arts management. He will join Purchase from the Gallo Center for the Arts in Modesto, Calif., where he has served as executive director for almost a year. Before that, he spent six years as assistant vice chancellor of university cultural programs and director of the Mondavi Center, increasing subscriptions to more than 11,000 from 2,000 and the budget to $7.5 million from less than $2 million.
 At Purchase, Mr. McCurdy will be responsible for the financial performance, operation and programming of the Performing Arts Center, which is made up of five different spaces ranging in size from the 60-seat Organ Room to the 1,300-plus-seat Concert Hall. He will report to Elizabeth Langland, provost at Purchase, who also headed the search committee.
 ''Brian quickly rose to the top as a stellar candidate,'' Ms. Langland said. ''We were interested in the kind of innovative programming and collaborations with the arts department at Davis that he was doing. At Purchase, one of our goals is to encourage the Neuberger Museum and the Performing Arts Center to become much more engaged in the educational activities of the school.''
 Christopher Beach, Mr. McCurdy's predecessor, who left the Purchase center last November after 16 years as its director to run the La Jolla Music Society in California, planned the 2006-7 season for the Performing Arts Center at the college. It features about 60 dance, film, music and theatrical performances by artists as diverse as the country singer Emmy Lou Harris (Oct. 19); the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter (Nov. 18); the Paul Taylor Dance Company (Dec. 9); the Classical Theater of Harlem (''Macbeth,'' Feb. 24); and the jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove (March 2).
 Mr. McCurdy is currently planning the center's 2007-8 season, its 30th. 
 ''While maintaining the same level of quality, I would like to see the balance shift to more innovative, new work,'' Mr. McCurdy said. This means creating a focus for the entire season, ''Africa and the African Diaspora,'' and planning related activities, like symposiums on Africa and the impact of AIDS and malaria, the global economy and education. ''It's a way of putting the Arts Center at the center of what goes on on campus, instead of at the periphery,'' he said.
 Mr. McCurdy also hopes to move away from the model of the artist who comes to Purchase, gives a performance and leaves. ''I want to create longer residencies,'' he said, ''with more performances, master classes and student involvement.''

The Performing Arts Center, Purchase College, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase; (914) 251-6200. Information can also be found at www.artscenter.org.

HEADLINE: Same Problem, Different Stations

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

AT 8:30 on a recent morning in West Windsor, N.J., Ken Anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car, waiting patiently for a train to pull into the Princeton Junction station from New York. 
 He was not picking anyone up. In what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into Manhattan, Mr. Anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot.
 ''There's usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars, and when one of their spots opens up, I make my move,'' said Mr. Anderson, 34, of Hightstown, N.J., who works as an accounts payable supervisor at Atari. ''To have any chance for a parking spot, you have to get here before 6:30 in the morning or after 8. For me, parking every day is an adventure.''
 Earlier that morning, Kristan Flynn, a 34-year-old research associate who lives in Princeton, five miles from the station, sped into the parking lot on her bicycle. 
 ''No place to park,'' she said. ''Even the bike racks are nearly all full.''
 More than 7,000 people board commuter trains each day at the Princeton Junction station, but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them, according to New Jersey Transit.
 For Mr. Anderson and the 3,767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the West Windsor Parking Authority, the wait can be as long as seven years, officials said. Another 2,833 from West Windsor are on a two-year waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents. 
 Commuters don't have many alternatives at nearby stations. 
 Thirteen miles to the south, the daily lot at the Hamilton train station is filled by 6:30 a.m., and there are no available permits. A few miles south, in Trenton, the parking garage operator says the $90-a-month specials are all taken, leaving commuters the option of paying $8 a day or $135 a month. 
 At a time when Gov. Jon S. Corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River, at a cost of $7.2 billion, transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem: even now there are not enough parking spaces. 
 And the problem is not unique to New Jersey. Parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by Metro-North in Westchester County and Connecticut and by the Long Island Rail Road in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In Westchester, there are about 26,000 parking spaces for 75,000 commuters. On Long Island, almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full.
 ''If we're growing the commuter rail system, we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains,'' said Jon Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign in New York, a mass transit advocacy group. ''It's a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area.'' 
 Yet, commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies, like New Jersey Transit and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, that have failed to keep up with the growing demand. 
 The names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles. In the meantime, people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and, at Princeton Junction, even offering nearby homeowners $100 a month to use their driveways. 
 Gone are what transportation officials call the ''kiss and ride'' days, when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night. For many families, the parking crunch has created a hardship, particularly for those working parents who can't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 a.m. or who would like to put their child on the school bus come September, but can't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn. 
 Those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies, including getting there by bicycle, in-line skating, even skateboards. 
 IN New Jersey and across the region, municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations. This means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents. It also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages, often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community, leading to more traffic.
 ''Adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the big-city boogeyman is coming,'' said Darius Sollohub, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college's School of Architecture.
 ''It makes them feel that they have become too urban, that they are a city now and no longer a town,'' Mr. Sollohub said. ''It goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place.''
 Even in towns with resident-only parking lots, the waiting list can be long and the process for getting a permit arduous. In Rowayton, Conn., a shortage of parking spots forces commuters -- millionaires and chief executives among them -- to line up every year on the Saturday before Father's Day to have their permits renewed. The line begins to form around midnight, when men and women (or teenagers they pay to do the job), some on folding chairs, others resting in sleeping bags, wait through the night for a new windshield sticker that will assure them of a parking space every day for the next year.
 In the end, 375 lucky residents walk away with the town's coveted prize.
 In some towns, residents have given up parking by the rules, even if it means getting tickets. At the Cold Spring Harbor station in Huntington, on Long Island, commuters have become so desperate that they have been leaving their cars in emergency vehicle lanes the last few months.
 ''Some people are also parking on the lawn, and they have been ticketed and are now a little sore about it,'' said Joan Cergol, the assistant to the town supervisor of Huntington. ''The Cold Spring station is first come first served, and it fills up rather quickly.''
 In January 2003, James E. McGreevey, then the governor of New Jersey, approved a $200 million, five-year plan for the construction of parking garages and lots that would meet a goal of creating 20,000 parking spaces throughout the state. So far, 11,500 spaces have been added, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, including 5,500 spots at rail stations, 4,300 at light rail stations and an additional 1,700 at bus terminals, at a total cost of about $105 million.
 Still, despite those additions and others that Mr. Stessel said were in the works -- including the opening of a 2,000-space garage in Hamilton, N.J., in November that would replace street-level parking and result in an increase of 600 parking spaces -- the creation of new spaces is not keeping up with the demand for affordable parking and the expectation that ridership will continue to grow.
 ''In terms of adding enough spaces to meet the needs of our commuters, I'm never happy with the pace,'' said George D. Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit. ''But we are moving as fast as we can, and I think we have demonstrated that the past few years, during which time we have spent between $175 million and $200 million to add parking around the state.'' 
 Mr. Warrington said that 4,500 spaces would be added in New Jersey during the next 12 to 18 months. The agency's goal, he said, is to add 2,000 to 4,000 spaces across the state every year for the next 10 years. 
 Although Mr. Warrington said that the plan was to meet the projected increase in ridership that the proposed Hudson River tunnel would most likely bring, a look at New Jersey Transit's own numbers indicates that adding 25,000 to 45,000 spaces does not begin to meet commuters' immediate needs.
 Based on the figures, there are an estimated 124,150 riders who travel on New Jersey Transit's trains on any given weekday, and only 55,000 parking spaces in private and municipal lots statewide. 
 Some towns have come up with creative solutions to help ease the parking crunch, including offering valet service at the Millburn and Summit stations in New Jersey, according to Gary Roth, a parking consultant with BJF Planning in Manhattan, a private consulting company that helps municipalities address parking woes. 
 ''Millburn originally had enough parking for 300 vehicles and was able to squeeze in an additional 140 cars'' with the valet service, Mr. Roth said. ''Summit had 120 cars prior to valet parking, and has since added parking for 75 to 100 cars.'' 
 Millburn and Summit each pay about $3,000 a week to the vendors that provide the attendants for valet service. 
 After officials in Maplewood, N.J., dismissed proposals for a parking garage in the township, they offered free jitneys to get commuters to and from trains and buses. 
 Mr. Roth said that for some towns, finding the solution to parking problems can sometimes have a negative effect on a local economy.
 TEN years ago in Brewster, N.Y., a second Metro-North train station, called Brewster North, was built to accommodate the overflow of commuter vehicles at the station in the center of town, where many businesses are located. ''Now people began driving to the new station and not shopping in the village anymore,'' Mr. Roth said. ''By moving parking away from the village, people's shopping patterns actually changed.''
 In West Windsor, Mayor Shing-Fu Hsueh acknowledged that a lack of parking at Princeton Junction had been ''one of the biggest complaints'' among residents, and nonresidents. To help address the problem, the town is reviewing proposals from 17 companies vying to redevelop 350 acres around the Princeton Junction station. It hopes to create a so-called transit village, including new commercial and residential buildings, as well as sidewalks and expanded parking -- all within walking distance of the station, Mayor Hsueh said. This is the same approach that New Jersey Transit is trying to take with other communities, including Hamilton. 
 While the transit village approach has been lauded by policy makers as an example of ''smart growth'' development because it is created within walking distance of public transportation, none of the current proposals for Princeton Junction or Hamilton would provide enough parking to meet existing demand. This is parking that is needed, in large part, because of the increase in development in central New Jersey over the last 20 years. 
 Mr. Warrington of New Jersey Transit said that among the possible solutions to the parking problem in Princeton Junction was the addition of another train stop, to the north, in South Brunswick. 
 ''I have also challenged our guys to explore a valet system at Princeton Junction,'' he said. ''Valet parking has proven to be very successful and profitable in other towns.''
 And if there isn't enough parking now, what can commuters expect if plans for a second rail tunnel linking New Jersey and Manhattan under the Hudson come to fruition? Transportation officials expect that an increase in ridership in New Jersey would be likely to create major parking shortages in Bergen, Essex, Passaic and Hudson Counties.
 In that event, a parking garage on Route 17, in Ramsey, that was recently built by New Jersey Transit but has been so underused that transit officials rented some of the spaces to a local car dealer, might fill up. Mr. Warrington acknowledged that the agency had made a mistake by not adding parking to the Secaucus Junction transfer station, which has its own exit off the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 ''Frankly, Secaucus is an ideal location for cars to park before they enter the vortex of chaos that is the Lincoln Tunnel,'' he said.
 Since many of the decisions about parking still remain with municipalities, not only in New Jersey, but in Westchester, Connecticut and Long Island as well, is it time for state government to insist that cities and towns cannot restrict access to public parking? 
 ''Home rule is a very sacred thing,'' Mr. Orcutt of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign said. ''Politicians would be crucified if they intruded onto the turf of a town's right to control land and passed it off to a regional agency like New Jersey Transit.''
 In the meantime, commuters wait and hope. For eight years, Wayne Larsen and his wife, Debbie, arranged their lives around her picking him up and dropping him off at New Jersey Transit's Aberdeen-Matawan station. Finally, in December, he received a letter from the township, granting him an annual parking permit for $360. He had submitted the application in 1998.
 ''It was like receiving a winning lottery ticket,'' said Mr. Larsen, 49, a printer who works in Manhattan. ''Now maybe I can go back to living a normal life.''

HEADLINE: Nassau Bolsters Sex Offender Watch

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

 BODY:
Soon after the Nassau County Legislature voted on July 24 to give $100,000 to the advocacy group Parents for Megan's Law, Judith A. Jacobs, the Legislature's presiding officer, announced that the group would use the money to notify residents whenever a registered sex offender moved into their neighborhood, assist victims in finding counseling and educate parents and teachers about how to use the state's registry of sex offenders.
 ''We have a responsibility to ensure that our vulnerable children are not victimized by repeat sex offenders,'' Ms. Jacobs said in a statement. ''This funding is about protecting our children.'' 
Megan's Law, which has been on the books in New York for 10 years, requires that convicted sex offenders register with the police.
 The partnership mirrors one that the parents' group, which is based in Stony Brook, already has with Suffolk County. It could also have unexpectedly awkward consequences for some Nassau officials.
 The group's executive director, Laura Ahearn, has stood at the forefront of efforts in Suffolk to punish child molesters, and she is known for sharply criticizing anyone she believes is not trying hard enough to do the same. Ms. Ahearn once chased the Suffolk district attorney, Thomas J. Spota, down a courthouse hallway, and she has been known to get after his assistants and top police officials on the telephone and is not shy about accusing judges of sleeping on the bench or being too lenient.
 Her influence extends beyond Long Island. She helped draft legislation that tightened New York's registry law, and on July 27 she stood nearby when President Bush signed federal registry standards into law. 
 Ms. Ahearn said that Parents for Megan's Law also had federal and state grants that would allow it to research and compare how all 50 states administer their sex offender registries. She said that her research had identified inconsistencies in registry requirements among the states, bolstering support for the federal standards.
 ''And we'll continue monitoring the states to ensure there's uniform implementation across the country,'' she said.

Suffolk Seeking Ways To Help Its Fishing Industry
 Commercial and recreational fishing on Long Island may be an $800 million industry that employs 20,000 people in Suffolk County alone, but it is still on the decline and needs economic help, Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, says. So he is forming a task force to investigate ways the county can help.
 Mr. Levy already has a few ideas of his own, including low-cost government-backed loans to build a fish-processing plant. 
 ''We'll bring the county's economic development and environmental teams together with commercial and sport fishermen to create a symbiotic relationship,'' he said. ''I want everybody on board.''
 There is a hitch, though: Long Island history is replete with stories of fishermen in the commercial and recreational industries fighting over catch limits or exchanging accusations of overfishing.
 ''If we're all trying to reach the same goals, sometimes we don't throw rocks at each other,'' said Bradley Loewen, a commercial fisherman who is also an East Hampton town councilman. Mr. Loewen was offered the job of chairman on the task force, but, citing his responsibilities at Town Hall, he has so far agreed only to serve as a member.
 ''Steve Levy is doing a great, great thing for the industry, and I don't want to squander an opportunity,'' Mr. Loewen said. ''It's important that the chairman have the ability to do this flat out.''
 With a decline in the clam, scallop and lobster harvests in recent decades, largely because of water pollution, and stricter state and federal regulations, Mr. Levy said that he, too, felt the time was right for the two sides to become allies.
 ''We'll need everybody together at the same table to provide resources and help clean up the waterways,'' he said. ''And if we are unified, we might also become advocates when dealing with state or federal bureaucracy.''
 The task force will have 11 members, to be appointed this month, and will meet monthly starting after Labor Day, Mr. Levy said.

In Brookhaven Town, The Empire Zone Grows
 The recent addition of 500 acres to Brookhaven Town's state-designated industrial development zone has expanded the maximum size of the town's Empire Zone to 1,280 acres -- larger than any other on Long Island or in New York City.
 The Empire Zone program offers state tax credits to companies that create jobs. Those moving to Brookhaven may also qualify for town tax abatements through its industrial development agency.
 Since New York State chartered Brookhaven's zone in 1994, Uncle Wally's Muffins -- a subsidiary of Famous Amos Cookies -- has built a 40,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Shirley that created 112 jobs. It is now planning to add on 17,000 square feet, creating at least 20 more jobs, Raymond C. Donnelly, the town's newly appointed director of economic development, said. In 2003, a division of Rockwell International, the factory-automation and process-control giant, moved into the zone, creating about 200 jobs, he said.
 ''Brookhaven is now the only municipality on Long Island with room for that kind of expansion,'' Mr. Donnelly said.
 He and Anthony M. Figliola, the town's Empire Zone coordinator, said Brookhaven was also the only municipality in New York to supplement its Empire Zone with an employment program that links incoming employers with workers living in the area.
 They said the town benefits not only from increased tax revenue but also from overall economic growth. ''Some benefits are tangible and some are intangible, but quality growth is something you know when you see it,'' Mr. Donnelly said.


CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A report in The Week column on Aug. 13 about the expansion of the Empire Zone in the Town of Brookhaven misstated its size in relation to others on Long Island. Brookhaven's Empire Zone has the same maximum size as Suffolk County's 1,280 acres; it is not larger than any other Empire Zone on Long Island. Brookhaven's zone also has 500 available acres, fewer than Suffolk County's 778.

HEADLINE: Casino Bid Shadows Shinnecock Festival

BYLINE: By JULIA C. MEAD

DATELINE: SHINNECOCK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THE Shinnecock Nation Cultural Center and Museum rolled out the red carpet last month for its third annual summer festival. Members demonstrated beadwork and how to build a wikiup, a traditional thatched hut, and offered face painting and doll-making for children. Admission to permanent exhibitions of painting, sculpture and historical photographs was free.
 Members also lined a cooking pit with rocks and fresh seaweed, handing out plates that buckled under a steaming heap of lobster, clams, potatoes and corn for $20. And there were fried johnnycakes sprinkled with sugar for dessert. 
''We have always been welcoming as a people,'' said Winona Warren, the president of the museum board. ''But we want people not only to learn and to share our culture but to be respectful.''
 For most of that Sunday afternoon, however, the Shinnecocks outnumbered their guests by two to one. As David Bunn Martine, one of several Shinnecock artists, lashed bundles of reeds to the frame of a wikiup, visitors trickled in.
 Maybe that morning's drizzle kept some away. Or maybe the modest turnout was just another sign of how brittle the Shinnecocks' relations with the surrounding community have been.
 The Shinnecocks have long protected the sovereignty of their 800-acre reservation next to Southampton Village. From 1946 until two years ago, they invited the public in just once a year, for a Labor Day powwow. For a half-century, the powwow was the Shinnecocks' sole source of income, even as unemployment and substance abuse flourished.
 Then, in 2003, the Shinnecocks shocked and angered their neighbors by breaking ground for a casino proposed for tribal land in Hampton Bays. Last November, a federal judge ruled that the Shinnecocks, recognized by New York State for centuries, were entitled to federal recognition, too, but the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs responded by saying that it would not complete the formal recognition process for another quarter century. The Town of Southampton contends that the Shinnecocks need formal federal recognition to open a casino. 
 So, with its casino on hold, the Shinnecocks are reviving their long-dormant shellfish hatchery as a more modest means to economic development and are seeking financing for their five-year-old museum, the only Native American museum on Long Island. And they are once again trying to foster warmer relations with their neighbors.
 ''As long as Shinnecock was being 'good little Indians,' the outside community was very happy,'' Ms. Warren said. ''But once we asserted ourselves, it was perceived as a threat.''
 She took a deep breath, then smiled. ''The museum is a good assertion,'' she added. ''It's a useful tool to open up more intimate communication.''
 But it is not easy to open up. Next to the museum, a symbol of the Shinnecocks' attempts at openness, stands a billboard that says: ''Entering Shinnecock Territory. No trespassing. Violators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.''
 The tribe has tried to coexist with nonmembers, but on its own terms, since the 1640's, when Europeans first arrived on the South Fork, said Elizabeth Thunderbird Haile, a tribal elder and museum vice president. ''The first thing we said was, 'Understand us.' We're still saying it. The only reason we go to court is to defend ourselves from trespassers.''
 But even non-Shinnecocks who attended the festival had conflicting feelings about the casino and the traffic it could bring.
 ''The opposition is discriminatory,'' said Henry Davoli Jr., whose house is across a pond from the reservation. ''They see wealth everywhere around them, but the tribe's not allowed to have any? One more sideshow in the menagerie we have out here already is not going to make a difference.''
 After Mr. Davoli, his wife, Cecelia, and their two children chatted for several minutes with Lyle G. Smith, a tribal member, police officer for the Town of Southampton and waterfowler, about Mr. Smith's hand-carved and hand-painted decoys, Mr. Davoli switched gears.
 He said the Shinnecocks should swap their land in nearby Hampton Bays for an industrial parcel farther away in Calverton. ''Then they could have a casino on Long Island,'' he said. ''But I don't know if that's a good idea or not.''

HEADLINE: Same Problem, Different Stations

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
AT 8:30 on a recent morning in West Windsor, N.J., Ken Anderson was sitting behind the wheel of his car, waiting patiently for a train to pull into the Princeton Junction station from New York. 
 He was not picking anyone up. In what has become part of his daily hourlong commute into Manhattan, Mr. Anderson was staking out reverse commuters so he could grab a parking spot.
 ''There's usually one or two people who get off the train and into their cars, and when one of their spots opens up, I make my move,'' said Mr. Anderson, 34, of Hightstown, N.J., who works as an accounts payable supervisor at Atari. ''To have any chance for a parking spot, you have to get here before 6:30 in the morning or after 8. For me, parking every day is an adventure.''
 Earlier that morning, Kristan Flynn, a 34-year-old research associate who lives in Princeton, five miles from the station, sped into the parking lot on her bicycle. 
 ''No place to park,'' she said. ''Even the bike racks are nearly all full.''
 More than 7,000 people board commuter trains each day at the Princeton Junction station, but there are only enough parking spaces for about half of them, according to New Jersey Transit.
 For Mr. Anderson and the 3,767 other commuters who have applied for a permit through the West Windsor Parking Authority, the wait can be as long as seven years, officials said. Another 2,833 from West Windsor are on a two-year waiting list for parking lots reserved for township residents. 
 Commuters don't have many alternatives at nearby stations. 
 Thirteen miles to the south, the daily lot at the Hamilton train station is filled by 6:30 a.m., and there are no available permits. A few miles south, in Trenton, the parking garage operator says the $90-a-month specials are all taken, leaving commuters the option of paying $8 a day or $135 a month. 
 At a time when Gov. Jon S. Corzine is pushing for the construction of another commuter rail tunnel under the Hudson River, at a cost of $7.2 billion, transit and local officials have yet to address a longstanding problem: even now there are not enough parking spaces. 
 And the problem is not unique to New Jersey. Parking is a scarce commodity at many rail stations along the tracks operated by Metro-North in Westchester County and Connecticut and by the Long Island Rail Road in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In Westchester, there are about 26,000 parking spaces for 75,000 commuters. On Long Island, almost half of the parking lots are more than 95 percent full.
 ''If we're growing the commuter rail system, we have to grapple with how we are going to get people to the trains,'' said Jon Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign in New York, a mass transit advocacy group. ''It's a major planning issue with towns across the metropolitan area.'' 
 Yet, commuters without parking permits find themselves caught between municipalities reluctant to build parking garages and state transit agencies, like New Jersey Transit and New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road, that have failed to keep up with the growing demand. 
 The names of many commuters still dreaming of a permit to call their own are on waiting lists longer than their vehicles. In the meantime, people find themselves paying hefty fees at private lots and, at Princeton Junction, even offering nearby homeowners $100 a month to use their driveways. 
 Gone are what transportation officials call the ''kiss and ride'' days, when wives dropped husbands off at the station and picked them up at night. For many families, the parking crunch has created a hardship, particularly for those working parents who can't drop their children off at day care centers before 7 a.m. or who would like to put their child on the school bus come September, but can't afford to wave goodbye because parking spots vanish just after dawn. 
 Those who live too far to walk to train and bus stations have come up with assorted strategies, including getting there by bicycle, in-line skating, even skateboards. 
 IN New Jersey and across the region, municipalities own and operate most of the parking lots at train stations. This means that residents usually get parking permits before nonresidents. It also means that municipalities can restrict the expansion of parking lots and throw up obstacles to proposed parking garages, often out of concern that additional spaces would attract more commuters from outside the community, leading to more traffic.
 ''Adding a big monolithic structure like a parking garage makes people from small towns feel like the big-city boogeyman is coming,'' said Darius Sollohub, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who heads the infrastructure planning program at the college's School of Architecture.
 ''It makes them feel that they have become too urban, that they are a city now and no longer a town,'' Mr. Sollohub said. ''It goes against the reasons for why they moved to a small town in the first place.''
 Even in towns with resident-only parking lots, the waiting list can be long and the process for getting a permit arduous. In Rowayton, Conn., a shortage of parking spots forces commuters -- millionaires and chief executives among them -- to line up every year on the Saturday before Father's Day to have their permits renewed. The line begins to form around midnight, when men and women (or teenagers they pay to do the job), some on folding chairs, others resting in sleeping bags, wait through the night for a new windshield sticker that will assure them of a parking space every day for the next year.
 In the end, 375 lucky residents walk away with the town's coveted prize.
 In some towns, residents have given up parking by the rules, even if it means getting tickets. At the Cold Spring Harbor station in Huntington, on Long Island, commuters have become so desperate that they have been leaving their cars in emergency vehicle lanes the last few months.
 ''Some people are also parking on the lawn, and they have been ticketed and are now a little sore about it,'' said Joan Cergol, the assistant to the town supervisor of Huntington. ''The Cold Spring station is first come first served, and it fills up rather quickly.''
 In January 2003, James E. McGreevey, then the governor of New Jersey, approved a $200 million, five-year plan for the construction of parking garages and lots that would meet a goal of creating 20,000 parking spaces throughout the state. So far, 11,500 spaces have been added, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, including 5,500 spots at rail stations, 4,300 at light rail stations and an additional 1,700 at bus terminals, at a total cost of about $105 million.
 Still, despite those additions and others that Mr. Stessel said were in the works -- including the opening of a 2,000-space garage in Hamilton, N.J., in November that would replace street-level parking and result in an increase of 600 parking spaces -- the creation of new spaces is not keeping up with the demand for affordable parking and the expectation that ridership will continue to grow.
 ''In terms of adding enough spaces to meet the needs of our commuters, I'm never happy with the pace,'' said George D. Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit. ''But we are moving as fast as we can, and I think we have demonstrated that the past few years, during which time we have spent between $175 million and $200 million to add parking around the state.'' 
 Mr. Warrington said that 4,500 spaces would be added in New Jersey during the next 12 to 18 months. The agency's goal, he said, is to add 2,000 to 4,000 spaces across the state every year for the next 10 years. 
 Although Mr. Warrington said that the plan was to meet the projected increase in ridership that the proposed Hudson River tunnel would most likely bring, a look at New Jersey Transit's own numbers indicates that adding 25,000 to 45,000 spaces does not begin to meet commuters' immediate needs.
 Based on the figures, there are an estimated 124,150 riders who travel on New Jersey Transit's trains on any given weekday, and only 55,000 parking spaces in private and municipal lots statewide. 
 Some towns have come up with creative solutions to help ease the parking crunch, including offering valet service at the Millburn and Summit stations in New Jersey, according to Gary Roth, a parking consultant with BJF Planning in Manhattan, a private consulting company that helps municipalities address parking woes. 
 ''Millburn originally had enough parking for 300 vehicles and was able to squeeze in an additional 140 cars'' with the valet service, Mr. Roth said. ''Summit had 120 cars prior to valet parking, and has since added parking for 75 to 100 cars.'' 
 Millburn and Summit each pay about $3,000 a week to the vendors that provide the attendants for valet service. 
 After officials in Maplewood, N.J., dismissed proposals for a parking garage in the township, they offered free jitneys to get commuters to and from trains and buses. 
 Mr. Roth said that for some towns, finding the solution to parking problems can sometimes have a negative effect on a local economy.
 Ten years ago in Brewster, N.Y., a second Metro-North train station, called Brewster North, was built to accommodate the overflow of commuter vehicles at the station in the center of town, where many businesses are located. ''Now people began driving to the new station and not shopping in the village anymore,'' Mr. Roth said. ''By moving parking away from the village, people's shopping patterns actually changed.'' 
 IN West Windsor, Mayor Shing-Fu Hsueh acknowledged that a lack of parking at Princeton Junction had been ''one of the biggest complaints'' among residents, and nonresidents. To help address the problem, the town is reviewing proposals from 17 companies vying to redevelop 350 acres around the Princeton Junction station. It hopes to create a so-called transit village, including new commercial and residential buildings, as well as sidewalks and expanded parking -- all within walking distance of the station, Mayor Hsueh said. This is the same approach that New Jersey Transit is trying to take with other communities, including Hamilton. 
 While the transit village approach has been lauded by policy makers as an example of ''smart growth'' development because it is created within walking distance of public transportation, none of the current proposals for Princeton Junction or Hamilton would provide enough parking to meet existing demand. This is parking that is needed, in large part, because of the increase in development in central New Jersey over the last 20 years. 
 Mr. Warrington of New Jersey Transit said that among the possible solutions to the parking problem in Princeton Junction was the addition of another train stop, to the north, in South Brunswick. 
 ''I have also challenged our guys to explore a valet system at Princeton Junction,'' he said. ''Valet parking has proven to be very successful and profitable in other towns.''
 And if there isn't enough parking now, what can commuters expect if plans for a second rail tunnel linking New Jersey and Manhattan under the Hudson come to fruition? Transportation officials expect that an increase in ridership in New Jersey would be likely to create major parking shortages in Bergen, Essex, Passaic and Hudson Counties.
 In that event, a parking garage on Route 17, in Ramsey, that was recently built by New Jersey Transit but has been so underused that transit officials rented some of the spaces to a local car dealer, might fill up. Mr. Warrington acknowledged that the agency had made a mistake by not adding parking to the Secaucus Junction transfer station, which has its own exit off the New Jersey Turnpike. 
 ''Frankly, Secaucus is an ideal location for cars to park before they enter the vortex of chaos that is the Lincoln Tunnel,'' he said.
 Since many of the decisions about parking still remain with municipalities, not only in New Jersey, but in Westchester, Connecticut and Long Island as well, is it time for state government to insist that cities and towns cannot restrict access to public parking? 
 ''Home rule is a very sacred thing,'' Mr. Orcutt of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign said. ''Politicians would be crucified if they intruded onto the turf of a town's right to control land and passed it off to a regional agency like New Jersey Transit.''
 In the meantime, commuters wait and hope. For eight years, Wayne Larsen and his wife, Debbie, arranged their lives around her picking him up and dropping him off at New Jersey Transit's Aberdeen-Matawan station. Finally, in December, he received a letter from the township, granting him an annual parking permit for $360. He had submitted the application in 1998.
 ''It was like receiving a winning lottery ticket,'' said Mr. Larsen, 49, a printer who works in Manhattan. ''Now maybe I can go back to living a normal life.''

HEADLINE: New Attacks by a Heavily Armed Gang Rattle Brazil and Set Off Political Wrangling 

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
The powerful criminal group whose street battles with the police paralyzed this metropolis three months ago has begun a new series of attacks, mocking government efforts to reduce its influence, alarming citizens and igniting a partisan political dispute.
 The new offensive, which began this week, has killed far fewer people than the more than 180 left dead in May. But the number and variety of targets chosen is larger: more than 200 sites in a score of cities and towns, including government offices, banks and police and bus stations.
The criminal group that has claimed responsibility for many of the attacks, First Capital Command (P.C.C. are its initials in Portuguese), is a prison-based network that in the past has used such shows of strength as a bargaining chip to demand better conditions for its estimated 10,000 members behind bars. 
 ''A new fact in these attacks are the cities in the interior'' that have been chosen as targets, said Col. Elizeu Teixeira Borges, commander of the Sao Paulo military police. ''They've even attacked a church, which makes no sense.''
 The city of Sao Paulo is the largest in South America, with more than 10 million people in the city itself and another 10 million in the metropolitan area. With more than 40 million inhabitants, the state of the same name is more populous than California and accounts for nearly one-quarter of Brazil's total population and about 40 percent of its economy.
 The new attacks, which were preceded by a shorter wave of raids last month, have caused consternation. The gang has consistently shown itself to have more firepower than the police, including grenades, mortars and other weapons legally available only to the armed forces, which has contributed to a sense of helplessness among residents.
 ''We're always hearing about Hezbollah in Lebanon and Al Qaeda in Iraq, and it all seems so very far away,'' said Nelson Kimura, a university student here. ''But we have also an alien organism in our body politic, one that the state here, as there, seems unable to control.''
 With Brazil's presidential election less than two months away, the gang's guerrilla-style attacks have quickly become a campaign issue. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party, who promised vastly improved public security as a candidate four years ago, is seeking a second term. His main opponent is Geraldo Alckmin of the center-left Brazilian Social Democratic Party, who was governor of the state of Sao Paulo until election laws forced him to step down.
 On Friday, Mr. da Silva took part in a ceremony at a military base in the suburbs here and renewed an offer of federal help -- in the form of as many as 10,000 army troops -- made this week by his minister of justice. 
 ''Society must defeat these bandits,'' he said. ''We cannot be threatened or defeated by banditry.''
 But Mr. Alckmin's supporters and many political analysts have interpreted the offer of troops as aimed at weakening his candidacy.
 If the state government were to accept the army presence, the message to voters around the country would be that ''the crisis in Sao Paulo's security can't be resolved without Brasilia's help,'' O Estado de Sao Paulo, the state's most important newspaper, concluded on Wednesday. ''Lula would gain by showing that the state government has not been able to control the P.C.C. and would benefit by linking a sense of security among the populace to the army.''
 At an impromptu news conference here late Thursday, Claudio Lembo, who became governor of Sao Paulo when Mr. Alckmin resigned, said the presence of the army would constitute ''inappropriate interference'' in his state's affairs. ''This interference has not occurred because they know it would not be requested or accepted,'' he said, adding, in reference to the troops, ''We don't need them here at this moment.''
 According to Brazilian press reports, the armed forces themselves are wary of such duty. Mr. da Silva has already dispatched troops to Rio de Janeiro on a limited, temporary basis to fight drug gangs there, with mixed results at best: a 35-year-old schoolteacher was shot dead at a military roadblock and some military weapons ended up in the hands of drug lords who are said to have followers infiltrated among soldiers.
 On Friday, Mr. da Silva was accompanied by his ministers of justice and defense, and, in what seemed to be an effort to show that the military stands behind his plan, the commander of the Brazilian Army, Gen. Francisco de Albuquerque, and the officer in charge of the regional garrison here. In his remarks at the military base, the president referred to the rift between the state and federal governments in his address at the police academy, saying, ''People are recognizing that the gravity of the situation demands that we be comrades so that a solution can be found.''
 Violence appeared to be tapering off at week's end, but the authorities remain worried about new outbreaks. Sunday is Father's Day in Brazil, and an estimated 13,000 prisoners, including many affiliated with the First Capital Command, are entitled to a weekend furlough. 
 Security officials had sought to deny the furloughs, but a judge here ruled this week that such an action would be illegal. The police said they now planned to cancel all days off for officers and to ''monitor'' furloughed gang members, but Mr. Lembo also issued an appeal to the gang and its leaders to act with ''good sense.''
 ''We are preserving their dignity and integrity,'' he said, noting that the police had not killed any jailed or paroled gang members during the latest outburst of violence. ''Now I hope there will be reciprocity on their part.''

HEADLINE: Many Muslims in Britain Tell of Feeling Torn Between Competing Identities

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL and IAN FISHER; Heather Timmons contributed reporting from Birmingham, England, for this article, and Souad Mekhennet and Karla Adam from London.

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 12 

 BODY:
As a Muslim, Qadeer Ahmed says, he believes that violence against civilians is never justified. But as a British Muslim, he is not surprised to find the country once again at the center of a reported terrorist plot by homegrown extremists. 
 ''When people say it's Bush and Blair against the world, it's difficult to argue with them,'' said Mr. Ahmed, 37, a leader of the largest mosque in High Wycombe, where half a dozen young British Muslims were among the 24 arrested Thursday in what the authorities said was an elaborate plan to blow up planes on trans-Atlantic routes.
Despite government efforts over the last several years to reach out to community leaders -- a tricky proposition, given that Muslims hardly speak with one voice -- many Muslims have hardened their resentment of their country. 
 British policies in Afghanistan and Iraq, and now in Lebanon, are just the most recent in a long list of grievances -- cultural, economic and political -- among Muslims here. For a few, that has manifested itself in extremism and violence. For many others, it has meant a sharpening of a continuing struggle between two competing identities. 
 In a recent poll of Muslims in 13 countries conducted by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 81 percent of those surveyed in Britain said they considered themselves Muslims first and Britons second. That contrasts with Spain, where 69 percent of those surveyed considered themselves Muslims first and Spaniards second; Germany, where the comparable number is 66 percent, and even Jordan, with 67 percent. 
 Britain has never aspired to be a melting pot, and even second- and third-generation immigrants in England are likely to identify themselves -- and, more significantly, be identified by the English -- as belonging to their family's country of origin. 
 ''In the U.S., people routinely talk of Irish-Americans, Portuguese-Americans, You Name It-Americans, but have you ever heard the English talk that way?'' asked Roger Ballard, director of the center for applied South Asian studies at the University of Manchester. ''The English have always had, since the days of the Reformation, this strong commitment to homogeneity.''
 For Muslims, with their adherence to religion in a country that is aggressively secular and their feelings of brotherhood with Muslims in the Middle East, the feelings of alienation are particularly acute. 
 ''The war on terrorism is the war on us,'' said Mohammed Mowaz, 29, a computer engineer interviewed outside the Queen's Road Mosque in Walthamstow. 
 Nazim Akram, 23, an accounting trainee, said in an interview outside the mosque that he was skeptical about anything the authorities said, particularly after the botched raid by 250 officers in the Forest Gate section of London in June. After shooting a Muslim suspect, destroying his house, and arresting him and another Muslim man on suspicion of making chemical weapons, the police released them and said they had made a mistake.
 Similarly, Mr. Akram said he believed that the suspects in the recent bombing case were ''just normal guys.'' 
 Those who study Muslims in England say the current generation of young people -- those whose fathers moved here in the 1960's to work in the textile mills in the Midlands and the north -- is more inclined to be at odds with British society. 
 Many of the first wave of immigrants were from rural Pakistan, spoke poor English and never integrated much. But the generation that is coming of age now is caught between the traditionalism of their parents and the Western ideas they have been born in to, and the result can be toxic. 
 ''They are deeply confused, because they have been brought up in Britain and are actually very Westernized,'' Mr. Ballard said. ''They're seeking to discover an Islam through Western ideas.'' And, he said, they are rereading in literal terms. 
 Muslim ties to tradition are reinforced by frequent visits to where their families came from, and by arranged marriages to cousins who are likely to come from small Pakistani villages. 
 Feeling apart from mainstream society, finding it hard to get work in the depressed former mill towns near Manchester and Birmingham, some young men turn to local mosques -- often run by imams who have moved from rural Pakistan themselves -- as social, religious and educational centers. 
 Khalid Mahmood, a member of Parliament from Birmingham, said Muslims found it all too easy to shrug off the radicalization of some parts of their culture, particularly among young men. 
 ''They are reluctant to discuss what reality is and come to terms with it,'' he said. 
 Mr. Mahmood is a friend of the family of Tayib Rauf, one of the suspects whose arrest was announced Thursday, and he said that the Rauf family was comfortably off and not in any way fundamentalist. He suspected, he said, that Mr. Rauf had become radicalized in college, perhaps by listening to a speech from a visiting speaker. 
 In a country where, for instance, Muslims were free to raise placards denouncing freedom of speech during a demonstration protesting the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed, Mr. Mahmood said British tolerance had allowed extremism to flourish. ''We've been reluctant to curb freedom of expression or religious rights,'' he said. ''We've played host to people who weren't allowed in their own country of origin.'' 
 Some British Muslims are repelled by what they see as the decadence and libertinism of Western society, particularly obvious in Britain. 
 ''Among younger Brits in urban areas, which is where most British Muslims live, we drink more alcohol faster, sleep around more, live less in long-lasting, two-parent families, and worship less than almost anywhere else in the world,'' the writer Timothy Garton Ash argued in The Guardian recently. ''It's clear from what young British Muslims themselves say that part of their reaction is against this kind of secular, hedonistic, anomic lifestyle.''
 But Taji Mustafa, a spokesman for the British branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a nonviolent group advocating a unified Muslim government in Muslim countries, said rejecting Western permissiveness in the name of Islam does not breed extremism. 
 ''People say, 'Oh, he became more religious,' '' Mr. Mustafa said in an interview. ''What does that mean? Well, instead of spending time at the pub, he may spend more time with his family. When someone says, 'I'm Muslim first,' does that mean, 'I want to go bomb the Underground?' Nonsense!'' 
 If some Muslims see themselves as apart from British society, said Massoud Shadajares, chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, the feelings are cruelly reinforced by the British. 
 As an illustration, Mr. Shadajares described how at the time of the World Cup tournament in June, a secular Muslim friend from Nottingham ducked in to a pub to find the England team's latest score. 
 ''He walked in and said, 'Hey, guys, how are we doing?' '' Mr. Shadajares said. ''And one of the English guys said, 'I didn't know that Pakistan was playing today.' ''
 By the same token, when Sajid Mahmood, a cricket star of Pakistani descent, took the field with the English team this week against Pakistan, fans of Pakistani descent booed him and called him a traitor.

HEADLINE: Walking on the City's Wild Side

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
There is a place in this city where teenagers go crabbing from the old railroad bridge, where people consider themselves residents of a town of half a dozen rather than of a metropolis of eight million, where the waterfront still harbors ancient secrets along with the inevitable clash of development interests.
 It's called Staten Island. It is the fastest growing county in New York State, yet it remains, in pockets, and in its peculiar way, the Alaska of New York City.
That is, a place where nature, however debased, still plays a role in daily life and where there is room to pursue a dream, whether that means amassing a mansion-full of musty antiques or a yard full of cars up on blocks patrolled by roosters, or building an artwork along a quarter mile of beachfront, or simply drinking a beer outside the corner store without having to hide it in a paper bag. 
 This Staten Island, somehow urban, rural and suburban at once, is hard to spot from the typical perspective of the nonislander taking a sight-seeing round-trip ferry from Manhattan or driving through to New Jersey and points west. But on a leisurely journey by foot, the island blossoms. 
 A recent six-day trek along the roads and trails and beaches that trace and skirt Staten Island's 57-mile coastline turned up endless surprises, along with sufficient blackberries and sassafras leaves to sustain a hiker from one pizza place to the next. 
 Such a journey around Staten Island, the sixth-largest island in the continental United States, was not unprecedented. In 1679, two Dutch missionaries, Jasper Dankers and Peter Sluyter, rowed over from Brooklyn. They found the island aswarm with tasty wildlife -- ''well provided with wild turkeys, geese, snipe and woodhens'' -- but otherwise fairly inhospitable. After getting lost, they came upon an Englishwoman's farmstead. They asked ''for something to drink, and also for someone to show us the road, but she refused the last, although we were willing to pay for it,'' they wrote. ''She was a cross woman.''
 Three hundred and twenty-seven years later, the same flinty pioneer spirit can still be found on the island. And while snipe and woodhens are not so common, there are still plenty of geese, and wild turkeys, too.

DAY 1
 Richard Karlsson's house is a 15-minute walk from the ferry terminal at the island's northeast tip and thus 45 minutes from Wall Street. But his rambling Victorian mansion, screened off from the main drag, Richmond Terrace, by bowing apple trees and a gooseberry thicket and guarded by a dirty, arthritic Samoyed, might as well be in a haunted fairy tale.
 Its 15 rooms contain, among other things, a life-size gold-plated conquistador with fake diamonds for eyes, an organ upon which Mr. Karlsson plays hymns when the spirit moves him, and, stacked high on the stairway wall, the mounted heads of an elk, a gazelle and possibly a gnu. Mr. Karlsson, a Warholesque man in his late 60's, also collects stories and characters; in 35 years running a party-palace-cum-rooming-house, he has accumulated a few.
 ''There was a suicide here after I first moved here,'' he said, peering over the carved walnut banister down several flights of red-floral-carpeted stairs. ''A man went over the railing.''
 Mr. Karlsson's tenants include a reclusive man who draws maps of long-vanished streetscapes, a temperamental artist who banged out random note-clusters on the baby grand in the parlor, and a well-traveled jack of many trades named Paul Ratel, the Mansion's semi-official caretaker.
 Mr. Karlsson asked Mr. Ratel to explain the concept of the Mansion to a visitor.
 ''You'll never understand the concept of the Mansion,'' Mr. Ratel said.

DAY 2
 Heading west, Richmond Terrace becomes the main street of several working-class neighborhoods before petering out as a winding, rural-industrial lane. At its very end stands a lone country house with a barn and a chicken coop and a yard that merges into the marshy shore of the Kill Van Kull.
 The door was answered by Tara Alleyne, a city employee and inhabitant of what was once a soap-factory town called Port Ivory. ''I'm the only resident of Port Ivory,'' she said proudly. ''I'm on Mapquest.''
 The isolation suits her and her husband fine. ''Every once in a while you get a weirdo,'' she said. Prostitutes sometimes seek refuge from pimps on her porch. But it is mostly peaceful. 
 Yet Ms. Alleyne is not long for Port Ivory. ''I have to leave,'' she said. ''There's too many mosquitoes out here. Look at how much property I have, and I can't even go outside. I have to run to my car.''
 It was past 6 o'clock. The sun began to settle over the marsh. An abandoned elevated train track beckoned, traversing a wide expanse of grass and water. A dirt road led to another dirt road, where a pair of green signs at right angles, like those found in downtowns everywhere, announced the intersection of Fifth Street and Sixth Avenue.
 In the evening rush, the corner of Fifth and Sixth was a busy place. A rabbit hopped down Fifth, and a pair of doves pecked at a dusty depression in the road. On Sixth, a muskrat crossed in front of a family of mallards parked in the right lane. 
 A mile down the train tracks, civilization reared its head. A bright sign loomed above a parking lot: ''Burlington Coat Factory.'' Then: ''Modell's Sporting Goods.'' Also: ''Chuck E. Cheese's.''
 Behind that shopping center rose the waterfront kingdom of Chelsea: three houses along the Arthur Kill, which divides Staten Island from New Jersey. 
 ''My husband is the mayor of Chelsea,'' said the 50-ish blonde woman at one of the houses. ''This is the town hall. At one time we owned the whole town. This is the mayor's office, the police department -- if you don't belong here, you better leave town.''
 She said this with a smile, emboldening a traveler to wonder if a tent might be erected in her yard. ''Oh, it's not safe,'' she said. ''We have all kinds of wild animals back there. Raccoons, deer, attack cats, possums.'' In passing, she revealed her name: Barbara Decker.
 A Decker! Member of one of the oldest Dutch families on the island. Former operators of the ferry at Port Richmond. Founders of Deckertown, as nearby Travis was once known. Countrymen of Dankers and Sluyter, the wandering missionaries. 
 Surely her husband, a Decker by blood, would agree to offer refuge. She called him at work. No dice. ''We have wild dogs that swim across from the Isle of Meadows and come through here at night,'' she reported.
 So it was back to the darkening road, to contemplate the revenge of the Dutch on another generation of explorers. 
 Travis is a settlement of several thousand famed for its Fourth of July parade, a place so wholesome it was once called Linoleumville. At nightfall, the village youth, back from a crabbing expedition on Neck Creek, clustered around a car in the middle of the street discussing evening plans.
 Crab traps were dropped off, beer was obtained and an assembly convened on the roof of a commercial establishment overlooking the West Shore Expressway.
 As traffic roared by under a full orange moon, the young men of Travis held forth on current issues: Iraq was bad but not as bad as Vietnam; inflation was more of a drag on the economy than North Korea was; Richie should definitely refrain from urinating off the roof into the busy parking lot. 
 At evening's end, the merry band led the way through an untended industrial site to a stretch of beach with enough room to pitch a tent and withdrew into the night, trailing the sounds of clinking bottles and cresting laughter.

DAY 3
 Daylight revealed the campsite to be the bank of a busy commercial waterway with a view of refinery tanks on the Jersey side. The Arthur Kill, clear and cool, proved perfect for a morning bath.
 In the middle of the kill lay Prall's Island, a sanctuary for nesting herons, ibises and egrets. It is normally closed to humans, but for this quest the city's Parks Department provided a canoe and a native guide.
 Here is what nature fans are missing at Prall's Island: salt hay and foxtail grass; colonies of fiddler crabs engaged in their eternal wargame of musical holes; shin-high, ash-gray muck that swallows sneakers without apology; some seagulls and a few skeptical-looking egrets.
 It turns out the magnificent harbor birds have mostly abandoned the island as a nesting site. No one knows why. 
 Back on the big island, the hiking got tough. The only way across Fresh Kills, a tributary of the Arthur Kill, without a long inland detour (or a boat) was the West Shore Expressway, off-limits to pedestrians. A patrol car slowed and briefly whooped its siren, then drove on.
 Two miles south in Charleston, a rooster crowed in front of a house sided with Owens-Corning Foamular and adorned with the inscription ''Go Away.'' The rooster, handsome and blue-black, darted behind a disabled-looking car and disappeared.
 A side street ended at a rustic general store with a cast of regulars out front, something out of a Walker Evans photograph except that the Harley parked by the door was of recent vintage and Budweiser did not come in 16-ounce cans in the 1930's. 
 ''This is the only place on Staten Island where you can sit out, drink a beer, the cops drive by, and they don't say anything,'' said the motorcycle's owner, who gave his name as Billy Hillbilly.
 Mr. Hillbilly offered his version of the Story of Staten Island, a tale that anyone who has lived there longer than half an hour can tell. ''I used to live in Rosebank, right by the Verrazano Bridge, before they put the bridge in,'' he said. ''The minute they built that bridge, boom, it went straight to hell. Then I moved out here. Now 30 years later, the last frontier, that's going to hell, too.'' 
 Nearby, a cluster of half-built town houses, the Tides at Charleston, rose from a strip-mine-like cut in a field.
 That night, an office-park owner, Michael Abboud, provided a room to sleep inside a warehouse near Tottenville. Bass and drums from the Staten Island School of Rock, the studio down the hall, thumped out a lullaby.

DAY 4
 Once around the horn at Tottenville, the waterfront changes from boggy estuary to sandy seaside. This is the South Shore. In 1892, a naturalist, William T. Davis, wrote of it: ''Of drift wood there is no end, neither is there of old shoes, mousetraps, brooms and all other household utensils.''
 The image still fits, but beneath the cliff in the state park at Mount Loretto, the beachfront has been turned into a miniature sacred city, 150 shoulder-high pyramids of boulders, each capped by a handsome stone turned on end. Douglas Schwartz, a zookeeper at the Staten Island Zoo, has been building the cairns for 10 years, an act of devotion that he likened to ''giving flowers to the wife.''
 ''It's a concrete, real gesture,'' said Mr. Schwartz, 53. ''People see this and they think, 'He must really believe in something.' They're not sure what it is, but they know it must be something.''
 His work has become well known on the island, if not universally understood. Mr. Schwartz had the mixed pleasure of seeing his art splashed across the front page of The Staten Island Advance beneath the headline ''Sophomoric Prank or Cult Activity?'' 
 ''What I made as a bench for the happy children to sit on, they saw as a sacrificial altar,'' he said. 
 A mile up the coast, a piano concerto blared from the window of the Seguine Mansion. From the water irises by the fishpond came the piercing wail of a peacock. From above came a hearty human voice: ''You found it!'' 
 A youthful 75-year-old in a blue tank top stood on the balcony: George Burke, lord of the mansion, a colonnaded 1837 Greek Revival farmhouse on 27 rolling acres dappled with horses.
 Since buying the mansion in 1977, Mr. Burke, a decorator from an old island family, has filled it with paintings and furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries and gobs of showroom finery. (The deed also gave him rights to take his cattle across his neighbors' yards to water them in Wolfe's Pond, but he has not kept cows since the 80's, when several got loose and tied up traffic on Hylan Boulevard.) 
 The house looks like a museum, and it is. Mr. Burke has sold it to the city and opens it to the public on occasion, but he can live in it until he dies. ''When I do the open-house tours, people say to me, 'And where do you live?' '' he said as he reclined on a Chinese Chippendale sofa with a glass of Burgundy. ''I say, 'This is my home. I live in it.' '' 
 At the Parks Department's suggestion, he allowed a trail-weary hiker to camp on an American Empire cherry sleigh bed. Mr. Burke entertains almost daily; his annual White Party, Plantation Barbecue and Christmas Formal are lavishly covered on The Advance's society page. 
 Mr. Burke's favorite possession lies in the first-floor hall: a statue of a black dog with Farrah-like tresses, reclining on a golden pillow. ''Marie Antoinette had a bronze sculpture made of her poodle and a bronze statue made of her cat,'' he said. 
 ''That's the bronze statue of Marie Antoinette's poodle. That's it.''

DAY 5
 A long, hot trudge past beach-blocking developments led to Hylan Boulevard, with its formidable landscape of nail salons and lube joints, then back along dune trails to the beach at Great Kills Park. There, far beyond pilings crowned with cormorants, the Brooklyn skyline shimmered, a jarring reminder that there was a rest of the city.
 The Midland Motor Inn in Midland Beach, down the block from Aunt Phyllis Dog Grooming Plus Bait & Tackle, may lack the grandeur of the Seguine Mansion, but it does not require reservations. It does not even accept them. It does, however, accept $55, cash only, for a room with a broken television, a constellation of cigarette burns in the bedspread, and most of a mattress.
 Something about the inn makes a traveler yearn for an evening stroll. On a boardwalk bench, Jen and Juliana, two 19-year-olds who work at a pharmacy, took in the sea air. 
 Midland Beach was an odd place, they said. ''At the pharmacy,'' Jen said, ''people come in and ask us for Vicodins, Oxycontin, Ambiens, basically anything you can get high off, and we call the cops.'' 
 Still, her friend said, ''There are some good people here. Even the junkies, some of them are nice.''

DAY 6
 So many secrets to unlock, so little time. Just off the crowded boardwalk at South Beach, discreet gentlemen idled among the Rosa rugosa, and condoms littered the sand. At Fort Wadsworth, a Revolution-era rampart, dank, pitch-dark tunnels burrowed into a hillside, and an elderly man and woman nuzzled on the grass just beyond an ''Area Closed'' sign. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towered overhead, bearing its cargo of crawling cars back to Brooklyn. 
 Too much of the coast remained unexplored: weed-choked Colonial cemeteries; ship graveyards; the surreal topography of the old Fresh Kills landfill; the Staten Island Museum, with its collections of mounted algae specimens and 19th-century freshwater mussels; the Isle of Meadows, where wild dogs are said to roam.
 The ferry terminal lay a short hike up the road.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 13 about a reporter's trip around Staten Island misstated its size ranking compared with other islands in the continental United States. Although there is apparently no definitive list, Staten Island is at most the 13th largest, not the sixth largest. The error was pointed out by a reader just after the article appeared; this correction was delayed for research.

HEADLINE: Plan for New Rail Tunnel Takes Turn Toward Reality

BYLINE: By JONATHAN MILLER

DATELINE: SECAUCUS, N.J., Aug. 11 

 BODY:
It was just a few years ago that New Jersey Transit's executive director would try to explain -- to anyone who would listen -- the wonders of building another commuter train tunnel under the Hudson River. And every time, he would see eyes glaze over.
 ''People would say, 'Great idea,' '' George D. Warrington, the executive director, said in a recent interview. '' 'Maybe my grandchildren will see it.' ''
But a series of events in the last few weeks have made it more likely that it will not just be grandchildren, but their grandparents, too, who will see the completion of what is being called the Trans-Hudson Express tunnel, which would link New Jersey with Midtown. 
 The 9.3-mile project would cost an estimated $7.2 billion, create as many as 44,000 jobs and more than double the number of trains that cross the Hudson River during rush hour. Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey says the second rail tunnel, with its target completion date of 2016, is ''vital to the state's economic future.'' 
 The first action to brighten the project's prospects came last month when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey committed up to $2 billion toward the tunnel's completion -- a move that would have been considered highly unlikely several years ago. 
 Weeks earlier, the Federal Transit Administration authorized $82.5 million to conduct preliminary engineering. And two weeks ago, the New Jersey Transit board approved preliminary work on the reconstruction of an aging bridge in the Meadowlands that is vital to the tunnel project.
 In a potential side benefit to New York residents, said one high-ranking Port Authority of New York and New Jersey official who declined to be identified, the authority has begun talking about help to finance a project in New York that would link Grand Central Terminal to the Long Island Rail Road.
 All of which, leaders in both states say, means the project has reached a turning point.
 ''The big hurdles will be technical -- like tunneling -- rather than political,'' said Jon Orcutt, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. When asked, on a scale of one to 10 (10 being the highest) whether he thought the tunnel would become a reality, he said, ''I think we're around 7 or 8.'' 
 Just how the tunnel project was rescued from the scrapheap of grand ideas is a decade-long tale of cross-state rivals laying down their swords and embracing the realities of regional economics, and of a Democrat-controlled state convincing a Republican-dominated Congress of the economic necessity of the costly project.
 For the last 96 years, one two-track tunnel has run under the Hudson River into Pennsylvania Station in New York, and now carries 40,000 commuters a day. During peak travel hours there are about 23 trains, including Amtrak, coming and going through the tunnel, and a second tunnel -- that would end 100 feet below 34th Street below the basement of Macy's flagship store -- would bring that number to 48. The project would create a loop south of Secaucus Junction, giving riders on the Bergen, Main and Pascack Valley Lines a direct ride into Manhattan without having to switch trains in Secaucus or Hoboken.
 The plan's most forceful advocate has been Mr. Warrington, a former president and chief executive of Amtrak, who was appointed to run New Jersey Transit in 2002. Almost immediately after taking the job, he began trying to resurrect the notion of a second tunnel, taking over the stalled initiative that had been started by the Port Authority. 
 Along the way, he persuaded the Port Authority's chairman, Anthony Coscia, to get behind the project.
 Together they began proselytizing among politicians, real estate developers and business leaders in New York, contending that the entire region and not just New Jersey would profit from building a second tunnel.
 It was hard finding believers.
 Kathryn Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, an advocacy group for New York businesses, says this is the first project since the 1962 agreement to build the World Trade Center in which New York and New Jersey seem to have come together. There had been tension between the two states over New Jersey trying to lure businesses across the river.
 ''It reverses a generation in which we were accusing New Jersey of piracy,'' Ms. Wylde said in a recent interview, ''but it represents the reality of post-9/11 New York, that we are trying to keep businesses in the region.'' 
 In addition, both New York senators, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer, have endorsed the project, as has Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 The solidarity was crucial in persuading federal authorities to take the project seriously.
 For Mr. Coscia, the project returns the agency to its roots and a mission that he said ''we have sometimes not lived up to.'' 
 ''If our mission is to move people between two states,'' he said, ''adding another lane to the Lincoln Tunnel won't do it.'' 
 He and others point to studies that suggest the greatest growth in the area will come west of the Hudson. ''An increasing proportion of our workforce can only afford to own a home in New Jersey, and have basically relocated there,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''Twenty-five, thirty years ago the safety valve was Long Island, twenty years ago it was Rockland and Orange. Last decade, it's been New Jersey and even Pennsylvania.''
 Governor Corzine is perhaps one of the project's highest-profile advocates. As a United States senator in 2005, he took what most observers say was a crucial step when he helped insert language into a transportation bill stipulating that the secretary of transportation ''shall give strong consideration to the project for a full funding grant agreement.'' 
 And as governor, Mr. Corzine has promised that New Jersey will commit at least $500 million to the project. Some New York officials, once hostile to the tunnel project, now laud it, and, transportation officials say behind the scenes, are using it to exert pressure to deliver projects that are perceived as more beneficial to the city and state. 
 In a speech before the Regional Plan Association in May, Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general who is running as a Democrat for governor of New York, strongly hinted that several projects in New York should be worthy of Port Authority money, including the Second Avenue Subway line and a link from the Long Island Railroad to Grand Central Terminal.
 For now, it seems like the Port Authority is willing to go along. When asked about the worthiness of such projects, Mr. Coscia agreed that the $6.3 billion Long Island Rail Road project, called East Side Access, was worthy of financing.
 ''I think East Side Access is a very strong project, and I can see the Port Authority consider participating in it,'' he said. ''If you look at East Side Access and the tunnel, it's two sides of the coin. They're literally different pieces of the same project.'' 
 Another Port Authority official agreed with Mr. Coscia, but scoffed at another favored project of New York politicians, a link to Kennedy Airport from Lower Manhattan, calling it ''ridiculous.''
 As for the tunnel project, finding the $5 billion or so needed to complete the project remains the primary obstacle. 
 While the federal government could finance about 60 percent of the project, New Jersey's financial difficulties have been well-documented, and the state's Transportation Trust Fund, the pot of money that goes toward highway repairs and that narrowly averted bankruptcythis year, will need a more permanent fix down the line.
 In addition, it is unlikely that the Port Authority will spend its $2 billion without getting any return on such an investment. Mr. Warrington said that he has suggested a financial arrangement in which the Port Authority could share revenue with New Jersey Transit from commercial and retail development at the proposed Moynihan Station at 34th Street, which New Jersey Transit would control. 
 ''This is a conceptual offer that we've made,'' he said, ''and it's more than reasonable to allow the Port Authority to participate in any of those commercial opportunities.''
 Transit advocates warn that with so many big-ticket items planned, a fare or toll increase may be necessary for Port Authority-owned properties, although agency officials say the $2 billion committed thus far to the tunnel project is within the agency's resources. 
 For now, optimism remains high, but Mr. Corzine warned against assuming the deal is sealed. ''The die is not cast yet,'' he said. ''We've made real progress. New Jersey is putting its dough down and you see what the Port Authority's doing. We still have hurdles to overcome and we will continue to make the case very strongly that this is a project of crucial regional and national significance.''

HEADLINE: The City Hopes to Double the Size of Manhattan's No. 2 Convention Center, in the West 50's

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
As the state acts to expand New York City's largest convention center, the Bloomberg administration is moving to double the size of the city's second-largest exhibition and trade show space, saying the step is needed to capture additional midsize shows.
 The administration is seeking proposals from private developers to enlarge that space, the trade show facility on Pier 94 on the Hudson River, by extending it to the adjacent Pier 92, which is now part of the Manhattan Cruise Terminal. 
In three years or so, the administration says, Pier 92 will no longer be needed for berthing ocean liners, because the city plans to reduce the terminal to two piers from three, now that another cruise ship terminal has been built in Brooklyn.
 The space on Pier 94, off West 54th Street, has operated since 1998 under the name UnConvention Center, a play on the name of the largest exhibition site in the city, the state-run Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, near the river in the West 30's. 
 The smaller site is run by a private company, UnConvention Center Inc., which has been renting Pier 94 from the city under a series of short-term arrangements that will end when a developer for the larger, two-pier site is chosen and signs a long-term lease, the city's Economic Development Corporation says. The city also owns Pier 92. 
 Greatly expanding that trade show site, even as the Javits Center is significantly enlarged, will not create an oversupply of exhibition space in the city, said Paul Januszewski, a vice president of the Economic Development Corporation. 
 ''We really see it as two separate markets, large trade shows and midsize trade shows,'' he said. The Bloomberg administration says each market needs more space in the city. 
 NYC & Company, the city's convention and visitors bureau, estimates that during the last three years it has had to turn away more than 50 midsize shows, and says all of them could have been accommodated if a facility as big as what is being planned on the two piers had been available. 
 According to NYC & Company, Pier 94 offers more space for exhibitions and trade shows than any hotel or other site in the city. 
 The 50 shows, the group said, could have produced $210 million in spending in the city -- on hotels, restaurants, entertainment and other purchases -- by those attending the shows.
 The idea of using Piers 92 and 94 together for some purpose is not new. In the 1990's, the Giuliani administration sought to combine them for conversion to a large television and film production complex, but the proposal died. 
 And using Pier 92 for trade shows would not be without precedent. On occasions when cruise ships have not been at that pier, it has been used as additional space for shows needing more room than Pier 94 has. Indeed, both piers are currently being used, along with the Javits Center, as sites for the six-day New York International Gift Fair, which opened yesterday.. 
 But with Pier 92's primary use as part of the cruise ship terminal, it most often cannot be employed for a trade show. 
 Midsize trade shows are generally considered ''shows that are too small to view the Javits Center as an attractive venue but too big to be accommodated at existing facilities in area hotels,'' says the request for developers' proposals that the Economic Development Corporation issued in May, with a submission deadline of Sept. 13. 
 Convention industry experts said midsize shows were events requiring up to 400,000 square feet of space.
 Pier 94 has a total of 175,000 square feet in its 750-foot-long pier shed and in an attached shoreline structure, both one story high. In combining Piers 94 and 92, officials say, the city envisions a total of about 400,000 square feet, which is possible because the two-story structure on Pier 92 has about 200,000. 
 The first phase of the Javits Center expansion, which state officials approved last month, includes increasing that location's exhibition space to 1.1 million square feet by 2010, from the current 760,000 square feet. Like Mr. Januszewski of the Economic Development Corporation, Joseph E. Spinnato, the board chairman of the Javits Center Operating Corporation, said he did not believe that an expanded space occupying Piers 92 and 94 would be competing for business with an expanded Javits Center.
 The menswear, children's apparel and home design industries are among other industries that have held shows at Pier 94, which averages about 25 shows a year, said Elyse N. Kroll, the president of UnConvention Center Inc. In June, Pier 94 was the scene of a trade show for the erotica industry, called the Exotic Erotic Ball and Exposition.
 The cost of developing a permanent two-pier facility will not be known until the city receives proposals, but the developer chosen is expected to finance the project, said Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation. 
 The selected plan is subject to approval by the City Planning Commission. If it involves work in the water, like adding piles or filling in any space between the piers, approval will also be needed from the Army Corps of Engineers and from state environmental officials, Mr. Januszewski said.
 The city says a goal of the project, though ''not a strict requirement,'' is that public access to the waterfront be expanded through amenities like viewing areas on the piers' perimeters. Such amenities were suggested by civic groups, including Manhattan Community Board 4 and Friends of Hudson River Park, a park being developed along the shoreline from Lower Manhattan to 59th Street.
 John Doswell, a co-chairman of the board's waterfront and parks committee, said, ''We would like to have gotten more, but we think we got as much as we could.'' He and Albert K. Butzel, the president of the park group, said their groups would be ''unhappy'' if the element of public access were dropped.
 Marcy Benstock, the executive director of the Clean Air Campaign, said her group unconditionally opposed the project, for reasons including ''the heavier traffic and increased gridlock and air pollution'' that a larger trade show facility would bring.
 Although UnConvention Center Inc. would lose its tenancy at Pier 94 under the plan, Ms. Kroll said she was determined to continue operating at the site and was working with a major development organization, the Related Companies, on a proposal to develop the double-pier project.
 In 2000, the Giuliani administration said it was prepared to give a development group that Ms. Kroll then headed a 49-year lease for Pier 94, but the 2001 terrorist attack halted many such plans in the city, and the Bloomberg administration later decided to take its current approach.

HEADLINE: Is a Futures Stampede Keeping Oil Prices High? 

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
BY now, even a casual student of current affairs can reel off plenty of reasons for high oil prices: soaring demand, dwindling supplies, conflict in the Middle East and, most recently, the partial closing of an Alaskan oil field.
 Ben P. Dell, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, would place another factor at the top of the list: the money that has been surging into the commodities futures markets. Mr. Dell published a report last month suggesting that a stampede of institutional investors, mainly pension funds, into commodities is actually the chief cause of the rise in oil prices, which he called ''a bubble.''
The report has generated more reaction than any other oil research published by the firm in the last three years, Mr. Dell said. And not all of it has been positive. Some oil experts say that while the flood of money has had some effect on spot prices, it is by no means as important as Mr. Dell maintains. 
 ''I think the idea of speculation being the main driver of higher oil prices ignores the fact that in the real world there are a whole host of things to worry about,'' said Robert J. Weiner, professor of international business at George Washington University. 
 Similarly, Jan Stuart, global oil economist at UBS, said factors like geopolitics were more significant. Further, he said, ''I'm not calling it a bubble.'' For his part, Mr. Dell acknowledged that geopolitical concerns -- particularly fear of a possible disruption in supplies by Iran -- were having an impact on prices. But he said that such issues did not entirely explain oil prices, which, in his view, should be trending downward based on supply-and-demand fundamentals. 
 Despite some short-term fluctuations, inventory levels in the United States, for example, are ''well above the upper end of the average range,'' according to a recent Energy Department report. Growth in global demand has cooled, and new oil supplies have padded what had been a threadbare cushion of supply over demand. 
 ''You're growing supply,'' Mr. Dell said. ''You're growing inventories. And demand growth is slowing. But the price keeps going up.'' 
 The reason for this anomaly, he said, may be found in financial markets, specifically in the billions of dollars that investors, mainly pension funds and other typically conservative institutions, have poured into commodities in recent years. 
 Commodities futures that track indexes like the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index or Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index have become fashionable for many investors. Their reasoning is that this asset class, though volatile, affords portfolio protection because it has often performed well when stocks and bonds have been weak. 
 Close to $100 billion will be invested by pension funds and other institutions in futures contracts tied to the commodities indexes this year, up from less than $20 billion three years ago, according to Goldman Sachs.
 Pension funds, whose charters often prohibit short-selling, have been exerting upward pressure on futures prices, several analysts said. ''They want to be long. They want to stay long and 'don't bother me with it.' '' said William H. Brown III, president of WHB Energy Research in Chappaqua, N.Y. ''It definitely adds a positive bias to the market.'' 
 This persistent upward pull on futures prices creates an arbitrage opportunity that drags the price of spot oil higher as well, according to Mr. Dell. With futures prices higher than the spot price, why not buy oil, store it and then sell it forward in the futures market at a profit? Mr. Dell and others argue that this is precisely what's happening.
 ''It's a typical commodities play currently being employed in oil markets,'' said Sal Gilbertie, a trader at Fimat USA in New York. 
 Similarly, Phillip Verlander, an independent energy economist, said that on Aug. 4, for example, it was possible to ''buy heating oil in New York Harbor at $2 a gallon and store it and sell a future to deliver it in December for $2.24,'' and that many traders were doing so.
 Mr. Dell said that current oil prices were a bubble comparable to the tech investment bubble of several years ago -- and that the oil bubble was likely to burst before very long. 
 Others on Wall Street agreed that the flood of institutional dollars had had some effect, but they disagreed about just how much. Edward L. Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers, said, ''There is no doubt in my mind that there's an impact from a new class of investors into commodity markets, especially pension funds and also speculative investors including hedge funds.'' That impact can at times be as much as $10 a barrel, but ''fundamentals play a much bigger role,'' he added.
 In a similar vein, Mr. Stuart of UBS said: ''Explosive growth in commodity-related financial investments has translated into sharply higher prices and higher trading volumes on long-term oil futures. In effect, financial buyers have become consumers of oil, contributing to the persistence of high prices.'' 
 But he said that tight supplies, China's growing appetite for oil and other considerations were more important. ''The arbitrage that's available is only one of the factors supporting the price of oil,'' he said. Mr. Stuart expects the average price of oil to hold around $69 a barrel next year; oil has been trading around $75 recently.
 ON the other hand, Mr. Brown of WHB Energy Research supports Mr. Dell's view of current price levels. He has studied the historical correlation of oil prices with inventory levels and, at current levels, oil should sell for just $27 a barrel, he said. The impact of passive, long-term investors ''is in my view $33 a barrel,'' he said, with other factors, like flagging production in the North Sea and in Nigeria accounting for much of the rest of the gap. Still, he says he does not expect prices to tumble unless there was ''a major slowdown or even reversal of demand growth.'' 
 Mr. Dell said that prices could weaken once global storage capacity filled up, limiting the possibility of arbitrage profits. He said that this could happen within four to six months but emphasized that it would be hard to predict precisely when oil prices might move down. 
 In Cushing, Okla, a giant oil storage hub, the tanks are indeed filling up. ''In today's environment, all the major tankage owners are being very well utilized,'' said Rick Sandahl, senior vice president for market development at Enbridge Inc. He said that 80 to 90 percent of his company's storage capacity of 12.5 million barrels was in use. Asked if his customers seemed to be hoarding oil to take advantage of a price arbitrage, Mr. Sandahl replied: ''I would think it's a factor in their decisions.''
 Investors who believe that oil prices are ready for a fall would want to avoid mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that are linked to commodities indexes. Mr. Dell said that stock investors should ''underweight'' oil, recommending only such ''defensive'' plays as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Total and Apache, all of which, he said, have ''considerable excess cash flow beyond their capital spending needs.'' As such, he added, they could withstand a drop in oil prices ''and still deliver their growth plans.''

HEADLINE: Panel Suggests Using Inmates In Drug Trials

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA; Barclay Walsh contributed research for this article.

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
An influential federal panel of medical advisers has recommended that the government loosen regulations that severely limit the testing of pharmaceuticals on prison inmates, a practice that was all but stopped three decades ago after revelations of abuse.
 The proposed change includes provisions intended to prevent problems that plagued earlier programs. Nevertheless, it has dredged up a painful history of medical mistreatment and incited debate among prison rights advocates and researchers about whether prisoners can truly make uncoerced decisions, given the environment they live in.
 Supporters of such programs cite the possibility of benefit to prison populations, and the potential for contributing to the greater good.
 Until the early 1970's, about 90 percent of all pharmaceutical products were tested on prison inmates, federal officials say. But such research diminished sharply in 1974 after revelations of abuse at prisons like Holmesburg here, where inmates were paid hundreds of dollars a month to test items as varied as dandruff treatments and dioxin, and where they were exposed to radioactive, hallucinogenic and carcinogenic chemicals. 
 In addition to addressing the abuses at Holmesburg, the regulations were a reaction to revelations in 1972 surrounding what the government called the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, which was begun in the 1930's and lasted 40 years. In it, several hundred mostly illiterate men with syphilis in rural Alabama were left untreated, even after a cure was discovered, so that researchers could study the disease.
 ''What happened at Holmesburg was just as gruesome as Tuskegee, but at Holmesburg it happened smack dab in the middle of a major city, not in some backwoods in Alabama,'' said Allen M. Hornblum, an urban studies professor at Temple University and the author of ''Acres of Skin,'' a 1998 book about the Holmesburg research. ''It just goes to show how prisons are truly distinct institutions where the walls don't just serve to keep inmates in, they also serve to keep public eyes out.''
 Critics also doubt the merits of pharmaceutical testing on prisoners who often lack basic health care. 
 Alvin Bronstein, a Washington lawyer who helped found the National Prison Project, an American Civil Liberties Union program, said he did not believe that altering the regulations risked a return to the days of Holmesburg. 
 ''With the help of external review boards that would include a prisoner advocate,'' Mr. Bronstein said, ''I do believe that the potential benefits of biomedical research outweigh the potential risks.''
 Holmesburg closed in 1995 but was partly reopened in July to help ease overcrowding at other prisons.
 Under current regulations, passed in 1978, prisoners can participate in federally financed biomedical research if the experiment poses no more than ''minimal'' risks to the subjects. But a report formally presented to federal officials on Aug. 1 by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences advised that experiments with greater risks be permitted if they had the potential to benefit prisoners. As an added precaution, the report suggested that all studies be subject to an independent review. 
 ''The current regulations are entirely outdated and restrictive, and prisoners are being arbitrarily excluded from research that can help them,'' said Ernest D. Prentice, a University of Nebraska genetics professor and the chairman of a Health and Human Services Department committee that requested the study. Mr. Prentice said the regulation revision process would begin at the committee's next meeting, on Nov. 2. 
 The discussion comes as the biomedical industry is facing a shortage of testing subjects. In the last two years, several pain medications, including Vioxx and Bextra, have been pulled off the market because early testing did not include large enough numbers of patients to catch dangerous problems. 
 And the committee's report comes against the backdrop of a prison population that has more than quadrupled, to about 2.3 million, over the last 30 years and that disproportionately suffers from H.I.V. and hepatitis C, diseases that some researchers say could be better controlled if new research were permitted in prisons.
 For Leodus Jones, a former prisoner, the report has opened old wounds. ''This moves us back in a very bad direction,'' said Mr. Jones, who participated in the experiments at Holmesburg in 1966 and after his release played a pivotal role in lobbying to get the regulations passed. 
 In one experiment, Mr. Jones's skin changed color, and he developed rashes on his back and legs where he said lotions had been tested. 
 ''The doctors told me at the time that something was seriously wrong,'' said Mr. Jones, who added that he had never signed a consent form. He reached a $40,000 settlement in 1986 with the City of Philadelphia after he sued. 
 ''I never had these rashes before,'' he said, ''but I've had them ever since.'' 
 The Institute of Medicine report was initiated in 2004 when the Health and Human Services Department asked the institute to look into the issue. The report said prisoners should be allowed to take part in federally financed clinical trials so long as the trials were in the later and less dangerous phase of Food and Drug Administration approval. It also recommended that at least half the subjects in such trials be nonprisoners, making it more difficult to test products that might scare off volunteers. 
 Dr. A. Bernard Ackerman, a New York dermatologist who worked at Holmesburg during the 1960's trials as a second-year resident from the University of Pennsylvania, said he remained skeptical. ''I saw it firsthand,'' Dr. Ackerman said. ''What started as scientific research became pure business, and no amount of regulations can prevent that from happening again.''
 Others cite similar concerns over the financial stake in such research. 
 ''It strikes me as pretty ridiculous to start talking about prisoners getting access to cutting-edge research and medications when they can't even get penicillin and high-blood-pressure pills,'' said Paul Wright, editor of Prison Legal News, an independent monthly review. ''I have to imagine there are larger financial motivations here.''
 The demand for human test subjects has grown so much that the so-called contract research industry has emerged in the past decade to recruit volunteers for pharmaceutical trials. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, a Boston policy and economic research group at Tufts University, estimated that contract research revenue grew to $7 billion in 2005, up from $1 billion in 1995.
 But researchers at the Institute of Medicine said their sole focus was to see if prisoners could benefit by changing the regulations.
 The pharmaceutical industry says it was not involved. Jeff Trewitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a drug industry trade group, said that his organization had no role in prompting the study and that it had not had a chance to review the findings. 
 Dr. Albert M. Kligman, who directed the experiments at Holmesburg and is now an emeritus professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, said the regulations should never have been written in the first place.
 ''My view is that shutting the prison experiments down was a big mistake,'' Dr. Kligman said. 
 While confirming that he used radioactive materials, hallucinogenic drugs and carcinogenic materials on prisoners, Dr. Kligman said that they were always administered in extremely low doses and that the benefits to the public were overwhelming.
 He cited breakthroughs like Retin A, a popular anti-acne drug, and ingredients for most of the creams used to treat poison ivy. ''I'm on the medical ethics committee at Penn,'' he said, ''and I still don't see there having been anything wrong with what we were doing.'' 
 From 1951 to 1974, several federal agencies and more than 30 companies used Holmesburg for experiments, mostly under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania, which had built laboratories at the prison. After the revelations about Holmesburg, it soon became clear that other universities and prisons in other states were involved in similar abuses.
 In October 2000, nearly 300 former inmates sued the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Kligman, Dow Chemical and Johnson & Johnson for injuries they said occurred during the experiments at Holmesburg, but the suit was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.
 ''When they put the chemicals on me, my hands swelled up like eight-ounce boxing gloves, and they've never gone back to normal,'' said Edward Anthony, 62, a former inmate who took part in Holmesburg experiments in 1964. ''We're still pushing the lawsuit because the medical bills are still coming in for a lot of us.''
 Daniel S. Murphy, a professor of criminal justice at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., who was imprisoned for five years in the 1990's for growing marijuana, said that loosening the regulations would be a mistake. 
 ''Free and informed consent becomes pretty questionable when prisoners don't hold the keys to their own cells,'' Professor Murphy said, ''and in many cases they can't read, yet they are signing a document that it practically takes a law degree to understand.''
 During the Holmesburg experiments, inmates could earn up to $1,500 a month by participating. The only other jobs were at the commissary or in the shoe and shirt factory, where wages were usually about 15 cents to 25 cents a day, Professor Hornblum of Temple said.
 On the issue of compensation for inmates, the report raised concern about ''undue inducements to participate in research in order to gain access to medical care or other benefits they would not normally have.'' It called for ''adequate protections'' to avoid ''attempts to coerce or manipulate participation.''
 The report also expressed worry about the absence of regulation over experiments that do not receive federal money. Lawrence O. Gostin, the chairman of the panel that conducted the study and a professor of law and public health at Georgetown University, said he hoped to change that. 
 Even with current regulations, oversight of such research has been difficult. In 2000, several universities were reprimanded for using federal money and conducting several hundred projects on prisoners without fully reporting the projects to the appropriate authorities.
 Professor Gostin said the report called for tightening some existing regulations by advising that all research involving prisoners be subject to uniform federal oversight, even if no federal funds are involved. The report also said protections should extend not just to prisoners behind bars but also to those on parole or on probation. 
 Professor Murphy, who testified to the panel as the report was being written, praised those proposed precautions before adding, ''They're also the parts of the report that faced the strongest resistance from federal officials, and I fear they're most likely the parts that will end up getting cut as these recommendations become new regulations.''

HEADLINE: How Do You Say 'Desperate' In Spanish?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
FROM the moment ''Desperate Housewives'' began playing on Latin American cable channels last year, it was a success. Here, where telenovelas, the region's melodramatic, often campy answer to the soap opera, dominate prime-time programming, the antics on Wisteria Lane resonated with viewers who like their plots full of elaborate machinations.
 Now the makers of this hit ABC series have taken the process a step further. In a novel gambit they are franchising Spanish- and Portuguese-language versions of the show's first season for broadcast by networks around the region, using star-studded local casts to re-enact the original scripts.
 ''Barriers are breaking down,'' Fernando Barbosa said in a phone interview from Miami. He is senior vice president for Latin America at Buena Vista International Television, a branch of the Walt Disney Company, which produces the program. '' 'Desperate Housewives' shares certain characteristics with the telenovela, but it is based more on real life and is not as dramatized. Latin American audiences want alternatives in their programming, and we are responding to that by offering them a menu of choices.'' 
 Three versions of the series are under way, each tailored to a different area of Latin America. And three additional productions are a possibility, said Mr. Barbosa and executives here, depending on the outcome of discussions with networks in Mexico, Venezuela and Chile. First off the ground is the Argentine version, which will also be shown in neighboring countries including Uruguay and Paraguay and is scheduled to go on the air in six months or so. After that comes a production in Portuguese for Brazil and a second Spanish-language version made for Colombia and Ecuador.
 For ''Desperate Housewives'' to succeed in Latin America, though, it must win over viewers like Maria Jose Garcias, a 29-year-old receptionist at a downtown hotel here. She faithfully watches the English-language show, broadcast each week on cable on the Sony Channel with Spanish subtitles, and afterward often discusses it with her friends.
 ''I'll watch this Argentine version, but I don't know if I'm going to like it,'' she said in Spanish. ''They are all great actresses in the cast, and that's definitely an attraction. But the United States and Argentina are two totally different societies, each with their own customs and idiosyncracies, and I wonder if they are going to be able to translate that.''
 Those cultural differences are very much on the minds of the people writing and filming ''Amas de Casa Desesperadas,'' as the series is called in Spanish. They have had to walk a tightrope in order to retain the flavor of the original while also accommodating Latin America's own values and customs.
 One of the conditions that Buena Vista imposed on the Argentine producers of the series was that they adhere to the original American version. Bilingual Disney executives in the United States approve the scripts, a Disney representative periodically visits the set and film sequences are sent north for review. 
 ''Mickey Mouse is watching us,'' joked Marcos Carnevale, who adapted the script and directs the Argentine version of the series. But certain details in the original script simply don't make sense when transferred to a Latin American setting and have had to be altered.
 A plumber in Latin America, for example, would never make enough money to live in a plush upper-middle-class neighborhood like Wisteria Lane. So for the sake of credibility the show's hunky plumber has been transformed into the more prosperous owner of a plumbing supply company.
 In addition Latin American funeral rites differ from those in the United States, so some scenes involving burials or wakes had to be modified. The death penalty? It has been outlawed here. Thanksgiving? Make that Easter dinner.
 Comparable challenges emerged in translating the backgrounds of the main characters. For example a hyper-WASP type like Bree Van de Kamp (played by Marcia Cross), doesn't exist here, which meant that Mr. Carnevale had to find some kind of Argentine equivalent whose personality could plausibly seem just as pinched. 
 What he came up with was Vera, daughter of a military officer and a fervent Catholic with leanings toward the Opus Dei movement.
 Similarly, in the Colombian version of the series, the nouveau riche couple Carlos and Gabrielle Solis will be Ecuadoreans. ''They are the ethnic couple on the block, the equivalent of Hispanics in that society,'' Mr. Barbosa said. 
 By shooting different versions of ''Desperate Housewives,'' producers can also take into account cultural and linguistic differences within Latin America. Argentine Spanish, for instance, is heavily influenced by Italian and has many usages and phrases that would sound odd in Mexico or Venezuela.
 ''There's not going to be any che, vos or mate'' in the non-Argentine versions, said Fernando Blanco, president of Pol-Ka, Buena Vista's Argentine partner in the series, referring to a pair of typically Argentine locutions and the bitter, tealike beverage that is the national drink here. ''We are trying to adapt the original script to the customs of each country.''
 Casting proved to be another thorny issue for the producers. Should they seek actresses who look like their counterparts in the American show, or ignore that factor entirely?
 While Eva Longoria has become a star and a sex symbol playing Gabrielle Solis as a bantam Latin spitfire type, that cultural cliche would make no sense in a Latin American society. Instead, producers here cast Araceli Gonzalez, leggy and coltish, with chestnut hair and sparkling, pixieish eyes, for the Gabriela character.
 ''When the Buena Vista executives were here, they were surprised to see how tall I am,'' Ms. Gonzalez, a former model, said. ''And I tend to be warmer too, so the director had to squeeze me a bit to play up Gabriela's cynical, bitchy side more.''
 As Ms. Gonzalez's remarks indicated, though she and Ms. Longoria may be very different physical types, she made an effort to display the same manipulative, coquetteish personality in her version of the character.
 Carola Reyna, who plays Vera, is a blonde, not a redhead. But as she shot scenes in a pharmacy here with Jorge, the would-be paramour known as George in the original version, she wore the same tight hairstyle and facial expression as her American counterpart. 
 Ms. Reyna has acted in reworked American series before, having played the prissy C. C. Babcock in an Argentine version of ''The Nanny.'' From that experience, she learned not to let the original performance get in the way of her own interpretation.
 ''I'm not Marcia Cross, and I shouldn't try to be,'' she said. ''I'm different, so what I have to do is separate myself from her. I was a fan of the show long before I knew I was going to do it, but now I'm avoiding watching the first season. Otherwise her image will be too strong, and it will get in the way of my own imagination and how I see my character responding to the same situations that befall hers.''
 As director, Mr. Carnevale didn't want that either. So he instructed his cast not merely to imitate the original characters and not to flee from typically Latin American body language.
 ''The narrative line of the story remains the same,'' he said. ''But we are Latins, and we have to communicate as Latins. We touch more, kiss more and cry more, and our version has to reflect that.''
 The cachet of the series is such that top-drawer talents from across Latin America have agreed to participate. In the Argentine version, for example, Cecilia Roth, best known for her work in the films of Pedro Almodovar, has been cast as the dead narrator; the role of the career-minded Lynette, here renamed Lia, went to Mercedes Moran, who has won praise for performances in Lucretia Martel's films ''The Holy Girl'' and ''La Cienaga.''
 ''I like to do television every now and then, when it's challenging, and this definitely falls in that category,'' Ms. Moran said in an interview here, just after shooting a scene in which she explodes in rage and frustration after a confrontation with her boisterous twin sons. ''This kind of material lends itself to different readings. You can do it in basic form, like a 'Peyton Place,' or you can make it more complex and interesting, as the writers have done here.''
 Unlike the casting or the acting, the look of the show is very close to that of the American version. Indoor scenes for ''Amas de Casa Desesperadas'' are being shot at a conventional studio here. But out on a 12-acre site in the suburbs just north of here, producers have been building a Latin American version of Wisteria Lane, which they named Manzanares. The set is to be used for external scenes for all three editions of the series, with each cast coming in to film after their predecessors are finished.
 ''What we are trying to do is reconstruct the setting to be the same as in Los Angeles, respecting as much as possible the way in which things were done in the United States,'' Mr. Blanco of Pol-Ka said ''We've got 10 houses, with a main street, lawns, gardens and driveways.''
 ''Desperate Housewives'' marks a new twist in Latin America's 50-year relationship with American television. Back in what now seems like the stone age, when television was a luxury enjoyed only by the affluent, American series such as ''Bonanza'' were often broadcast in English with subtitles by networks in the region, most of which did not then have the budget to shoot local equivalents of such shows on their own.
 But as even the poor acquired television sets, Latin American networks eventually found that homemade telenovelas, which typically run 150 to 180 episodes and are broadcast over a period of about six months, brought them bigger audiences and thus bigger profits. Those shows came to monopolize prime time all over the region, and with the arrival of cable television American series tended to migrate to channels operated by the main Hollywood studios, including Sony, Warner, Fox and Universal.
 With ''Desperate Housewives,'' however, Disney is trying an end run around that trend. The company and its partners have been encouraged by the devoted following that ''Sex and the City'' gained on cable television in Latin America and the soaring popularity of the Argentine cartoonist Maitena, whose series of comic books about middle-class women and the conflicts they face, called ''Altered Women,'' has been a huge commercial success throughout the region.
 ''Everybody is waiting for this and watching, not just in our company but also all the telenovela producers and television stations'' in Latin America, said Mr. Barbosa, the Buena Vista executive in Miami. ''And if this project has great performances and great success in Latin America, I would expect that some other countries in Europe and Asia will jump in too.''
 Pol-Ka, one of Argentina's leading producers of films, television shows and commercials, came to ''Desperate Housewives'' already familiar with such collaborations. The company supplied not only a studio and crew, but also a know-how it acquired while working with HBO in 2004 on ''Epitafios,'' that network's first series made specifically for Latin America.
 Though Argentina has a long history as a film production center for Latin America, with skilled craftsmen and numerous studios, it gradually lost that role to Mexico. But when the economy here collapsed late in 2001, the peso lost more than half its value against the dollar, transforming it into one of the cheapest places in Latin America to do business.
 So far only the first 23 episodes have been ordered in each new version of ''Desperate Housewives.'' But producers and performers are already talking about a second season if the program does well in the ratings.
 ''Wisteria Lane is merely a metaphor, one that doesn't really exist here, or in the United States either,'' Ms. Moran said. ''As with a book or a film, the success of a series, no matter how localized you make it or how much you adapt it to another setting, is that its story be universal. And that is what they have achieved here.''

HEADLINE: Why 'Outsourcing' May Lose Its Power as a Scare Word

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
IN the 2004 political season, offshore outsourcing -- the practice of hiring lower-paid service workers in places like India to carry out tasks previously done by higher-paid American workers -- became an important issue. 
 The debate flared after the annual Economic Report of the President was issued in February 2004, just as the Democratic presidential primaries were heating up and payroll job growth was sluggish. Answering reporters' questions about a section of the report on trade, N. Gregory Mankiw, then the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, made a statement that would be utterly unobjectionable if uttered in a classroom at Harvard, where he taught before joining the Bush administration and to which he has returned.
The crux of it was this: ''outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade.''
 The phrase was translated into headlines, as well as politically motivated press releases, that accused Mr. Mankiw, and hence President Bush, of supporting the wholesale export of jobs from Bangor to Bangalore. Democrats and Republicans hastened to condemn the remark, which Mr. Mankiw hastened to clarify. 
 For Mr. Mankiw, the episode, which he recounts in a recent working paper that he wrote with Philip L. Swagel, former chief of staff at the council, stands as a case study of what happens when an academic economist is tossed into the meat grinder of the news cycle -- and of the public's general lack of economic education. ''This is the sort of stuff I talk about in the first week of my introductory economics class,'' he said. 
 Outsourcing has yet to make a significant appearance in this year's political campaign. The furor surrounding the practice seems to have subsided quickly once the ballots were tallied in November 2004. 
 Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Swagel found that the number of references to ''outsourcing'' in four major newspapers spiked from about 300 in 2003 to 1,000 in 2004, but has since fallen. As the number of jobs has risen steadily -- albeit not impressively -- politicians now seem preoccupied with other issues, like Iraq and energy. 
 But it's also possible that, considered in its macroeconomic context, outsourcing just isn't that big a deal right now. In the years since Mr. Mankiw's encounter with the buzz machine, economists have been crunching data on short-term trends in outsourcing in the vast service sector, which accounts for about 80 percent of domestic jobs. While there are some exceptions, they generally find more reason for concern than alarm.
 In December 2005, the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that 1.4 million jobs would be outsourced overseas from 2004 to 2008, or about 280,000 a year. That's a drop in the bucket. In July, there were 135.35 million payroll jobs in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thanks to the forces of creative destruction, more jobs are created and lost in a few months than will be outsourced in a year. Diana Farrell, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, notes that in May 2005 alone, 4.7 million Americans started new jobs with new employers.
 What's more, the threat of outsourcing varies widely by industry. Lots of services require face-to-face interaction for people to do their jobs. That is particularly true for the biggest sectors, retail and health care. As a result, according to a McKinsey study, only 3 percent of retail jobs and 8 percent of health care jobs can possibly be outsourced. By contrast, McKinsey found that nearly half the jobs in packaged software and information technology services could be done offshore. But those sectors account for only about 2 percent of total employment. The upshot: ''Only 11 percent of all U.S. services job could theoretically be performed offshore,'' Ms. Farrell says.
 Economists have also found that jobs or sectors susceptible to outsourcing aren't disappearing. Quite the opposite. Last fall, J. Bradford Jensen, deputy director at the International Institute of Economics, based in Washington, and Lori G. Kletzer, professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, documented the degree to which various service sectors and jobs were ''tradable,'' ranging from computer and mathematical occupations (100 percent) to food preparation (4 percent).
 Not surprisingly, Mr. Jensen and Professor Kletzer found that in recent years there has been greater job insecurity in the tradable job categories. But they also concluded that jobs in those industries paid higher wages, and that tradable industries had grown faster than nontradable industries. ''That could mean that this is our competitive advantage,'' Mr. Jensen says. ''In other words, what the U.S. does well is the highly skilled, higher-paid jobs within those tradable services.''
 There is evidence that within sectors, lower-paying jobs are being outsourced while the more skilled ones are being kept here. In a 2005 study, Catherine L. Mann, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, found that from 1999 to 2003, when outsourcing was picking up pace, the United States lost 125,000 programming jobs but added 425,000 jobs for higher-skilled software engineers and analysts.
 Economists also point out that jobs and services that are tradable won't necessarily move to lower-cost places. Ms. Farrell of McKinsey said that despite their huge populations, China and India lack enough university graduates with the specific skills and experience to meet the staffing needs of Fortune 500 companies. 
 In addition, labor costs are only one of many factors that companies consider. Executives have to worry about reliable power supplies and the proximity of vendors and customers. Here, again, the United States has significant advantages over countries like India and China. As a result, only a small portion of the jobs that could be outsourced will be outsourced; Ms. Farrell believes that by 2008, outsourcing will affect less than 2 percent of all service jobs.
 STILL, these projections aren't universally accepted. Alan S. Blinder, former vice chairman of the board of governors at the Federal Reserve and an economics professor at Princeton, says they are too optimistic because they don't take into account likely developments in the global economy. 
 ''As the technology improves, and as the quality and experience of offshore work forces improves, the capacity to deliver services electronically will rise,'' he says. Professor Blinder says that over the long term, far more than 2 percent of all service workers may be in danger of having their jobs outsourced overseas.
 So while the debate about outsourcing has declined, ''we shouldn't be deluded that this has subsided as an issue,'' Professor Blinder concludes. Should Mr. Mankiw decide to return to Washington to work for this administration, or a future one, he would be well advised to think twice before speaking about outsourcing.

HEADLINE: On the Rebound

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, Sanjiv S. Sidhu, a founder of the business software company i2 Technologies, was a tech-bubble wunderkind. 
 In 2000, he was listed at No. 41 on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people, with an estimated net worth of $6.5 billion. In March of that year, his company's stock was trading at a peak of $110 a share on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Then, the bubble burst. 
By 2003, Mr. Sidhu's name had dropped off the Forbes list, and his company's stock had fallen to 79 cents a share. That same year, it was removed from Nasdaq altogether, amid an investigation into the company's accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 In 2004, the S.E.C. accused i2, which is based in Dallas, of misstating about $1 billion in revenues over a nearly five-year period, and the company agreed to pay a $10 million penalty. Three i2 executives -- Mr. Sidhu was not one of them -- were later sued by the S.E.C. for securities fraud. 
 Today, Mr. Sidhu remains the company's chairman. Last year, i2's stock was relisted on Nasdaq; on Thursday afternoon, it traded at $14.34 a share. 
 While Mr. Sidhu no longer rates a place on Forbes's richest list, he still seems to have enough cash to dabble in real estate. 
 In late June, a company associated with Mr. Sidhu and his wife, Lekha Singh, paid $2.85 million for a two-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot apartment at the Grand Millennium, a condo building at 1965 Broadway. The company, Slam Enterprises I, had previously been used to buy a $4 million house in La Jolla, Calif., in 2000. A related company, Slam Enterprises II, bought a house in Dallas last year and one in Irving, Tex., the previous year, according to property records. Both companies are controlled by Slam Management, which lists Ms. Singh as president and Mr. Sidhu as vice president. 
 Michelle Kim, a broker with Weichert Realtors-Peters Associates, which listed the apartment, said it sold for $100,000 over the asking price after only one day on the market, with three or four buyers putting in offers. 
 Michele Peters, who runs the real estate company, said the apartment, which is on a high floor, had good views and was configured with one less bedroom than others in the same line, so that it felt more spacious. 
 Ms. Kim gave the apartment a thorough freshening for the seller. She had it painted, had the floors refinished, rented new furniture and artwork and even had the bathroom regrouted and a new kitchen sink installed. The total cost of the work was $6,500. 
 ''A $100,000 return on $6,500, that's money well worth spending,'' Ms. Peters said. 
 A representative for Mr. Sidhu said he would have no comment.

HEADLINE: Does Calling It Jihad Make It So?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
SOON after the British police announced last week that they had broken up a plot to blow up aircraft across the Atlantic, President Bush declared the affair ''a stark reminder that this nation is at war with Islamic fascists.''
 British officials, on the other hand, referred to the men in custody as ''main players,'' and declined to discuss either their motives or ideology so that they would not jeopardize ''criminal proceedings.''
The difference in these initial public characterizations was revealing: The American president summoned up language reaffirming that the United States is locked in a global war in which its enemies are bound together by a common ideology, and a common hatred of democracy. For the moment, the British carefully stuck to the toned-down language of law enforcement. 
 A critical debate in America today -- among political candidates and among national security experts -- is whether five years of war declarations and war-making have helped to make the United States more secure. Or, even in the absence of a major attack on American soil since 9/11, has this strategy created greater danger by providing terror groups with exactly what they crave: the sense that they are a unified army of jihadists? And has the strategy radicalized large swaths of the Muslim world in ways that were not imaginable as recently as 2003?
 For the White House, the bomb plot last week was Exhibit A in defense of the war strategy: the plotters would go after Americans, war or no war in Iraq. But critics argue that merging the global war on terror and Iraq was creating new jihadists, from Indonesia to Walthamstow, the East London area where much of the plot was hatched. 
 Few questioned whether the war-on-terror strategy made sense right after 9/11. The war in Afghanistan greatly degraded Al Qaeda's organizational ability, although there were indications last week that the terror network had links to the homegrown suspects in the London plot.
 President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney derided what they saw as the law enforcement approach of the Clinton years. As Mr. Cheney told visiting diplomats recently, ''There was a war on in the 1990's, but we didn't know it.''
 He routinely recites a history of terror plots against Americans over the past two decades, from the destruction of a Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 to the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in 2000 -- all of which, he said, were treated like police investigations, emboldening the plotters of 9/11. 
 ''You'll see case after case of terrorists hitting America or American targets -- and America failing to hit back hard enough,'' Mr. Cheney said in a recent speech. 
 The test of American willpower, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush have insisted, is in Baghdad, which explains why they stick to the language that it is the ''central front'' in the war on terrorism and domino that America cannot let fall. Defeat there, they warn, would give the jihadists a victory and empower them to move on to the next country -- maybe Pakistan, maybe Saudi Arabia, maybe Lebanon. 
 The question is whether that approach -- and the language that goes with it -- creates a trap for the administration.
 ''I think that what is happening is that everything is getting magnified,'' said Stephen Cohen, a Mideast scholar at the Israel Policy Forum. ''Just like every small crisis around the world was part of the cold war, every one is now part of the struggle between militant Islam and the United States. And that makes individual conflicts harder to solve,'' and an inspiration for jihad.
 Mr. Cohen cited the American approach to the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict. If that conflict were once again regarded as just another chapter in a long-running regional dispute, the stakes would be lower in Washington, making it easier for the United States to play a more traditional peace-making role. 
 The administration response is that it describes the world the way it is -- rather than ducking the realities of the Mideast.
 Although she worries that the language of ''Islamic fascism'' risks alienating Muslim communities, Farhana Ali, a political analyst at the RAND Corporation, said: ''I don't blame the administration for treating this as a war, because it is one in many ways. It's a political war.'' 
 She points to the video released last month, exactly a year after the London subway bombings. In it, one plotter who died in the attacks, seeming to speak from the grave, warned that the explosions were just the beginning of bigger attacks.
 Daniel Benjamin, author of ''The Next Attack,'' a book about the future of terrorism, said: ''The tube bombers in Britain were clearly motivated in large measure by Iraq. They were obsessed about it. ''
 Washington has tried, at times, to soften its message. Mr. Bush has launched diplomatic efforts to convince the Muslim world that the battle is with terrorists, not with ''a great religion.'' The administration provided aid to the tsunami victims in Indonesia, partly also to remind the world's largest Muslim nation that American goals go beyond counterinsurgency operations.
 But those military operations are what most of the world watches each night. A mystery of the London plot is whether Al Qaeda incited it -- as its surviving leadership seeks to prove it can still pack a punch -- and whether the suspects were prompted by televised military imagery. 
 Jon B. Wolfsthal, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on Friday: ''If I could ask one question as an interrogator to the guys they just arrested, I'd want to find out who they were and what they were thinking about this kind of attack before Iraq, or after. I'd want to know whether they have longstanding anger at the U.S., or are we adding fuel to the fire, and making new extremists. I don't mean that Iraq was right or wrong, but every action has consequences.''
 In the current issue of The Atlantic, James Fallows argues that the imagery of the ''long war'' -- one that has already lasted longer than the Korean conflict -- is self-defeating. ''An open-ended war is an open-ended invitation to defeat,'' he wrote. ''Sometime there will be more bombings, shootings, poisonings and other disruptions in the United States.'' Some will be the work of Islamic extremists, some not. He added: ''If they occur while the war is still on, they are enemy 'victories,' not misfortunes of the sort that great nations suffer.'' 
 For Mr. Bush, however, dropping the talk of a ''long war'' would be to send a message that America can go back to sleep. Thus, each terrorist attack or threat is woven into the bigger picture of a global struggle. 
 It helps explain the recent redeployment of American troops to the streets of Baghdad: to pull out early would be a return to the failed approach of the 1990's. It would be another Somalia, another Beirut. The problem is whether staying may give the jihadists something else: A narrative of never-ending conflict, in a war to be fought in Baghdad, in Lebanon and in economy class over the wing of a 747.

HEADLINE: Portrait of the Maximum Leader as a Young Man

BYLINE: By Ann Louise Bardach. 
Ann Louise Bardach, a writer for The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of ''Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana.''

DATELINE: Santa Barbara, Calif. 

 BODY:
FIDEL CASTRO appears to have cheated death (yet again) and will celebrate his 80th birthday today. Although he has decreed that his birthday celebration will take place on Dec. 2 (the 50th anniversary of his return to Cuba from exile), he in fact came into the world, weighing 12 pounds, on Aug. 13, 1926, at 2 a.m. at his family's estate at Biran.
 In 1952, when Fulgencio Batista seized power through a military coup, Fidel Castro declined an invitation to join the regime from Rafael Diaz-Balart, a brother of his wife, Mirta, and a minister in the new government. He had far grander ambitions.
On July 26, 1953, Mr. Castro and his younger brother Raul declared war against Batista with an audacious assault on the Moncada military garrison in Santiago de Cuba. The attack was a disaster, with more than 60 men killed, but it made Fidel Castro a household name. He reveled in his ensuing trial -- declaring famously that ''history will absolve me'' -- and was sentenced to 15 years at the Isle of Pines prison. (He served less than two.) 
 Castro was productive and prolific in prison, reading ceaselessly and writing hundreds of letters. Twenty-one of those letters were published in Cuba in 1959 in a volume edited by his friend and frequent correspondent, Luis Conte Aguero. (Mr. Conte Aguero broke with Castro soon after and fled to Miami in 1960.) 
 The book will be published in the United States in English next year for the first time as ''The Prison Letters of Fidel Castro.'' The excerpts below, translated by Mr. Conte Aguero's son Efraim Conte, are striking in that they reveal both the idealistic young revolutionary of 1953 and the pitiless dictator he would become over the following half-century. 

The Prisoner
Dec. 12, 1953
To Luis Conte Aguero:
 I am going to ask you a favor. Write a Manifesto to the people in accordance with the content of this letter. Sign it in my name and take it to Mirta. She will try to have it published. 
 It is decided we shall not have Christmas -- not to even drink water on that day as a sign of mourning. Make it known, because I believe that in this way the objective will be more noble and human. There is no point for prisoners like us to aspire to the joys of Christmas. 
 Luis, we still have strength to die and fists to fight. Receive, from all of us, a strong embrace. 

The Propagandist
 Even behind bars, Fidel Castro never lost faith in his cause or in his ability to exact revenge on his enemies. In this letter to Melba Hernandez, one of two women who took part in the Moncada raid, he depicts himself as the heir to the great Cuban nationalist Jose Marti.

PUB-DATE: April 17, 1954
To Melba Hernandez:
 First, we cannot for a minute abandon propaganda, for it is the soul of our struggle. Ours must have its own style and match our circumstances. 
 Second, we must coordinate the work between our people here and those abroad. To this end, arrange a trip to Mexico as soon as possible. We have to consider with extreme care any project of cooperation with others, lest they simply try to use our name. ''To know how to wait,'' Marti said, ''is the great secret of success.''
 Third, maintain a deceptively soft touch and smile with everyone. Follow the same strategy that we followed during the trial; defend our points of view without raising resentments. There will be enough time later to squash all the cockroaches together. Do not lose heart over anything or anyone; after all, we did not do so during the most difficult moments. 
 One last counsel: beware of envy. When someone has glory and prestige as you do, the mediocre easily find motives or pretexts to be suspicious. Accept help from anyone, but remember, trust no one. 

The Strategist
PUB-DATE: June 19, 1954
To Luis Conte Aguero:
 Here I spend my life reading and exercising self-control. I truly feel better when I do not read the newspapers; the politicking and submissiveness I see everywhere produces in me fits of rage. 
 If anyone's patience has been put to the test it is mine; there are times when I spend whole hours fighting the desire to explode, declaring myself on hunger strike, and not tasting a bite until I am taken out of this cell or killed, which would not be the least improbable. I am convinced that what they want at all costs is to provoke me, and I ignore their intentions. 
 Luis, I think we must organize as soon as possible a firm, systematic and growing campaign against this outrageous situation of mine. This is psychologically the most favorable moment due to a series of events. The Minister of Governance has behaved just as he is, a perfect pansy; he has acquiesced to all the whims of the military and given himself over to shameless enrichment. 
 Remember Cato, who always ended his speeches asking for the destruction of Carthage. 

The Aggrieved Husband
 With her spouse incarcerated, Mirta secretly accepted a modest stipend from her brother Rafael, the deputy interior minister, through his office. When the arrangement became public, Fidel Castro refused to believe it, insisting that Ramon Hermida, the interior minister, was trying to blacken his name. 

PUB-DATE: July 17, 1954
To Luis Conte Aguero:
 This is a machination against me: the basest, most cowardly, most indecent, the vilest and intolerable. Mirta is too level-headed to have ever allowed herself to be seduced by her family, agreeing to appear in the Government employee roster, no matter how hard her economic situation. I am sure she has been miserably slandered. 
 Only an effeminate like Hermida at the lowest degree of sexual degeneration would resort to these methods, of such inconceivable indecency and unmanliness. Now I have no doubt that the statement attributed to me about being well-treated was his doing.
 I do not want to become a murderer when I leave prison. Has a political prisoner no honor? Ought a political prisoner be offended in this way? May not a prisoner challenge someone to a duel when he leaves prison? Must he graze on the bile of infamy in the impotence and despair of confinement? 
 I am ready to challenge my own brother-in-law to a duel at any time. It is the prestige of my wife and my honor as a revolutionary that is at stake.

The Warrior
 Furious at discovering that Mirta had actually received help from her family and thus besmirched his honor, Mr. Castro sues for divorce and micromanages a scorched earth campaign for sole custody of his son, Fidelito, in this letter to his half-sister, Lidia.

PUB-DATE: November 29, 1954
To Lidia Castro Argota:
 It makes me very happy what you tell me about the divorce; above all that it will be done strictly following my instructions. About the boy, I remain unchanged in my point of view, and at the first opportunity, immediately after the filing, will press the court to require his return to Cuba to attend school, consistent with my thinking. 
 I resist even the thought of my son sleeping for one night under the same roof that shelters my most despicable enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those miserable Judases. I have endured their aggressions with the same strength I will use to demand reparations from them; I have suffered the unjustifiable and unforgivable absence of my son with the same resolve with which I shall rescue him at any cost. They know it, or at least they should know it! I presume they know that to rob me of that boy they will have to kill me -- and even then.
 I lose my head when I think of these things. 

The Politician
 In 1954, with public opinion overwhelmingly against the Batista regime, a groundswell arose for an amnesty for political prisoners. The United States even pressured Batista to adopt an amnesty, but Fidel Castro was only interested in one on his terms.

March 1955
To Luis Conte Aguero:
 I am not in the least interested in swaying the regime to enact that amnesty; this is not at all my concern; what I am interested in is demonstrating the falsehood of its positions, the insincerity of its words, the base and cowardly maneuver that they are carrying out against men who are in prison for opposing it. 
 They have said that they are generous because they feel strong, in fact they are vengeful because they feel weak. 
 There will be Amnesty when there is peace. With what morale can men who have spent the last three years proclaiming that they carried out the coup to bring peace to the Republic make such proposals? So there is no peace, so the coup did not bring peace. 
 ''The best proof that there is no dictatorship is that there are no political prisoners,'' they said for many months; today prison and exile are overflowing, therefore they cannot say that we live under a democratic constitutional regime. Their own words condemn them.

HEADLINE: A Critical Race for Governor

 BODY:
The bitterly contested Democratic primary for governor has produced both a Democratic candidate, John DeStefano, and the framework of a debate. Although the next governor will inherit a budget with nearly a billion-dollar surplus, pressing issues abound. Connecticut is burdened with high taxes, energy costs and home prices. For most towns, mass transit is virtually nonexistent. Job growth has stagnated. One result is that the young are voting with their feet: Connecticut is losing a greater percentage of its 20- to 34-year-olds than nearly any other state. This campaign will help determine whether these worrisome trends continue. 
 The two candidates come to the race with very different perspectives. Mr. DeStefano has governed New Haven for more than 10 years as mayor, grappling with all the gritty problems involved in running one of the state's major cities. The popular Republican incumbent, Gov. M. Jodi Rell, has been governor for two years and lieutenant governor for nine. and represented Brookfield for a decade in the state House of Representatives. Voters have a good choice, and they will be best served by a robust debate on the following issues: 
 Energy. Connecticut is headed toward a real energy crisis, symbolized by the blackout in Stamford about 10 days ago caused by strains on the underground electrical distribution system. The financial services sector that makes up much of downtown Stamford emptied; UBS was forced to use generators for a day and a half. The state already knows its electricity prices are among the highest in the country, and is spending more than $1 billion to improve its inadequate electrical transmission system. 
 Accountability. Connecticut's annual budget exceeds $15 billion, but the legislature focuses more on who gets what than on how the money is spent. As a result, the constituencies that make the most noise get a bigger share of the budget than those who really need the money. That is one reason that Governing magazine gives the state below-average marks in fiscal management. More to the point, it's a disservice to taxpayers. The next governor should give this issue top priority. 
 Reading. Connecticut suffers from a disparity in test scores between whites and members of minorities. An even larger problem is that only 39 percent of all Connecticut fourth graders read to national standards. Addressing Connecticut's reading crisis will require raising the bar for teacher training. It will also require tangling with the educational establishment and teachers' unions, which is something governors prefer not to do. Any governor willing to take on this fight could make a huge difference to thousands of the state's children.
 Property Tax Reform. Property tax reform has long seemed an esoteric issue, and politicians who have sounded the alarm have not made much headway. But citizens are now beginning to sit up and take notice. The increasing reliance of communities on property taxes has encouraged undisciplined sprawl and big box stores, placed new burdens on the elderly and people on fixed incomes and, in some cases, put homeownership out of reach. The time has come for real reform. 
 Liabilities. Generous wages for state employees and an equally generous pension plan have created huge unfunded liabilities that taxpayers will have to pay in years to come. Currently, the state's pension plan is short $6.9 billion for pensions it will be obligated to pay in the years ahead. But an even worse problem is the promise of lifetime health insurance to those who have been state employees for at least 10 years. The unfunded cost of that benefit is estimated at an incredible $8.8 billion. These are huge threats to the state's fiscal health. 
 Health Care. An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 Connecticut residents -- 10 percent of the state's population -- do not have health insurance. Taxpayers end up paying the bills of a large majority of the uninsured in the most expensive way possible when minor health problems are neglected and require emergency room visits and surgery. In a state that for years was the center of the insurance industry, this is morally wrong and fiscally shortsighted. 
 Urban Decay. Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven have for years been three of the poorest cities in the country. The state has spent hundreds of millions on convention centers and similar projects to try to turn them around. Yet their needs are basic and will not be solved by high-profile projects. Few will flock to urban areas unless they are safe and have good schools and reasonable taxes. This will be a major challenge for the next governor. 
 Housing. Between 2000 and 2005, housing costs rose more than 63 percent, while wages rose less than 20 percent. The median cost of a home in Connecticut is now an astonishing $304,000 -- so high that in only 12 towns in the state is the median income high enough for people to be able to pay such a price for a house. Too many people find the state unaffordable, and housing is a big reason why. This is also hurting the economy.
 Connecticut is overdue for a vigorous debate on these and other issues. The people of the state deserve no less.

HEADLINE: Into Africa

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS; Paula Schwartz contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
AS the house lights dim for the second act of each performance of Madonna's ''Confessions'' tour, the singer, wearing a crown of thorns, begins her 1986 anthem, ''Live to Tell,'' while her body hangs in mock crucifixion on a cross glittering with the mirrored tiles of a disco ball. 
 Madonna has been riffing on crucifix imagery for two decades. What hauls the entire tableau vivant into the present are the images flickering behind her on screens: close-ups of African children, staring with mournful eyes, superimposed over crackling flames and a running ticker, which tallies at 12 million the number of children orphaned by AIDS in Africa.
That Madonna should suddenly be casting an ice-blue eye toward Africa should hardly be surprising. After all, she has always known how to spot a trend. 
 And much as it may strain the limits of good taste to say it, Africa -- rife with disease, famine, poverty and civil war -- is suddenly ''hot.'' 
 Beginning early in the decade with a trickle of celebrity fact-finding missions to strife-torn sub-Saharan nations (Bono in Ghana, Bono everywhere) that became a torrent within the last couple of years (Clay Aiken in Uganda, Jessica Simpson in Kenya), Africa has now been embraced by the masses. 
 Those who work with or study Africa-related causes report that tourism in many African countries is way up, that students are increasingly choosing to study and volunteer there, and that money is pouring into Africa-centric charities -- from grassroots efforts organized at churches and suburban dinner parties across the country, to larger aid organizations. Even among hipsters, clothing decorated with the image of Africa is beginning to replace last season's Che Guevara T-shirts. 
 ''There is new life in the movement now,'' said Lisa Szarkowski, spokeswoman for Unicef USA, who noted that Africa had been suffering from donor fatigue for years before celebrities like Bono began stumping for Third World debt relief and Angelina Jolie, who recently had a child in Namibia, helped renew interest. Now, there's ''more conversation, more possibility,'' she said. ''There is a lot of momentum.''
 Those newly interested in the continent have been motivated by different atrocities. For some it has been the genocide in Darfur; for others, AIDS orphans. But regardless of anyone's specific interest, most people consistently describe being attracted by what they see as a clarity -- both political and moral -- in Africa's problems. 
 ''I ask myself, 'Why Africa?' Why am I not motivated by Iran or something,'' said Genevieve Parker, a 17-year-old student at the Potomac School in McLean, Va., who just returned from a summer trip to Ethiopia where she helped install pipes for an irrigation system. ''It's just because I don't understand what's going on: who are the good people, who are the bad?'' 
 In Africa, Ms. Parker said: ''there are a lot of problems, but you can group them in together. I can organize Africa in my head, in terms of poverty, droughts, even governments.''
 And for many, at a time when the United States is divided into red and blue, for and against, cease-fire and bombs away, the seemingly unambiguous nature of Africa's needs can be unifying. 
 Daniel Millenson, a Brandeis University sophomore who is a leader of the Sudan Divestment Task Force, a nationwide movement aimed at persuading universities, governments and corporations to stop doing business with Sudan until the genocide there ends, said that Africa-related issues -- famine, genocide, disease -- don't polarize people the way subjects like, say, the Iraq war does. 
 ''The issue is very popular because it can attract people from both sides, whether they support the war in Iraq or not,'' Mr. Millenson said. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the movement to divest from Sudan is one of the most active movements on college campuses in at least 20 years.
 Still, why all the interest now? Yes, celebrities probably deserve much of the credit, but the bridge from Hollywood to Africa was constructed long before Angelina Jolie was born. Danny Kaye was running off to Africa for Unicef as far back as the Eisenhower years, and Bob Geldof pointed legions of superstars toward Africa in 1985 with his Live Aid concerts.
 Some Africa experts believe that the continent could be benefiting from an American public that is antsy to feel its goodness and influence, yet is simultaneously feeling itself shunned around much of the rest of the world.
 William Easterly, a professor of economics at New York University and author of the recent book ''The White Man's Burden: How the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good,'' sees Africa as filling a sort of existential vacuum for Americans struggling in a post-Sept. 11 world.
 ''We had this sudden awareness that there were all these people out there who hated us, and we needed people who, as far as we know, don't hate us, and are in great need and we can help,'' Professor Easterly said. ''It's the perfect meeting of needs -- an intersection where we need Africa and Africa needs us.'' 
 Regardless of the exact reasons why Americans are responding, say educators, philanthropists, and activists, there is little doubt that the current burst of interest in Africa is markedly different from those of the past. Rarely, they say, has the popular interest in Africa spanned so many different issues and countries and inspired so many different people to take action. 
 ''Africa issues in the 80's were usually concentrated on one country,'' said Una Osili, an associate professor of economics and philanthropic studies at Indiana University who grew up in Nigeria. ''Live Aid was concentrated around one issue -- famine relief. Now, multiple issues are being addressed: HIV/AIDS, Darfur, the ongoing issue of poverty.'' The focus now is regional, she said, ''multi-country.'' 
 In terms of financial giving to the continent, no agency keeps track of every dollar directed there, though ''it would be very safe to say it is going up,'' said Carol Adelman, director of the Center on Global Prosperity, at the Hudson Institute in Washington. 
 The fact that dollar-wielding Bills -- Clinton and Gates -- are on the loose, traveling to support their foundations, doesn't hurt. 
 Individually, many smaller charities say they are experiencing unprecedented generosity. ''The response to our outreach has been dramatically improving -- it's risen fivefold'' in the past few years, said Paul Newell, a director in the New York office of the Ubuntu Education Fund, which helps South Africans.
 A recent celebrity-dotted fund-raiser at the Puck Building in Manhattan featuring Kevin Bacon as the master of ceremonies -- Donna Karan and Iman attended -- blew past its initial fund-raising target by 50 percent, to raise $600,000, Mr. Newell said. 
 And people are being inspired to start small charities of their own. In June, for example, 125 people, who in another time might have been content to mail Halloween pennies to Unicef, banded together at a Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., restaurant and held a silent auction to raise money ($30,000) for a hospital in Tanzania. 
 ''To build a hospital, the tangible evidence of where your money is going is very satisfying,'' said Susan Konig, an organizer of the event. She added, ''It was not some amorphous thing, but a tangible cinderblock building where in Tanzania people can get their eyes checked, receive AIDS medication, they can get pregnancy care.''
 The new Africa benefactors also want to experience Africa first-hand, educators and tourist officials say. Over the last few years, tourism among Americans is up in Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia and South Africa, according to national tourist boards and embassies for those countries. From 2003 to 2005, travel to Kenya doubled to 73,000, and is up nearly 16 percent so far this year. American visitors to South Africa leaped to 233,000 in 2005, from 170,000 in 2001. 
 As for students, James Ellis, the director of international relations for the University of Johannesburg in South Africa, also noted a marked increase in Americans coming to study at the university in recent years, and sees a shift in their motives. In the 90's they came out of curiosity to catch a glimpse of post-apartheid South Africa. Now, he said, they come and tutor children and build housing. ''They want,'' Dr. Ellis said, to ''have a sense of 'we've left something, we've done something.' ''
 Similarly, parishioners at Christ Presbyterian Church in Madison, Wis., not only raised $200,000 for Rwanda in five months, but last fall sent seven missionaries there to assist the poor -- one of them Ellen Murdoch, 58, who said she was moved to action after renting the 2004 movie ''Hotel Rwanda'' on DVD. 
 But where does all the good will leave Africa? When it comes to celebrity interest, it's not hard to find cynics, especially since rarely does a day go by that some Page Six personalities are not draping themselves in some African cause -- Jay-Z on clean water, Gwyneth Paltrow on aid to children, and Lucy Liu on AIDS.
 Michael Musto, the Village Voice celebrity columnist, dismisses the current interest in Africa as merely the cause-of-the-moment among A-listers and charities. 
 ''Celebrities,'' Mr. Musto said, ''have added a glamorous patina to it.'' And to themselves, he said, especially if they need a little good press, like Lindsay Lohan, who has suffered through a year of rough tabloid treatment for her party-girl ways and has vowed to visit Kenya in support of the One Campaign.
 And Paul Theroux, a writer who served in the Peace Corps in Africa in the '60's, cautioned against ennobling oneself through grandiose gestures there in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times last December. 
 ''Because Africa seems unfinished and so different from the rest of the world, a landscape on which a person can sketch a new personality, it attracts mythomaniacs,'' he wrote, arguing that Africa needs to cultivate its own saviors.
 But, said Morgan Binswanger, a former liaison between performers and philanthropies for Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles: ''There's self-interest and there's enlightened self-interest, and the fringe between the two is gray. I think those that step forward and really carry out enlightened self-interest move an agenda.''
 Alyssa Milano certainly hopes that is true. The actress, who toured civil-war-torn Angola in 2003 (and strayed into an active minefield, without incident), said Africa is one way celebrities can transform an unprecedented level of scrutiny into their lives into something productive. 
 Don Cheadle, the star of ''Hotel Rwanda,'' declined to pass judgment on whether Africa had indeed become a self-serving celebrity fad, now that even the youngest stars like Ms. Lohan are getting serious about it. 
 But, Mr. Cheadle said he feels that celebrities can have an impact: ''People in Rwanda told me personally that the movie had a huge impact. They said people always used to come to see the gorillas and now they're coming just out of interest in Rwanda itself.''
 The larger question is whether soccer moms and flyover people will continue to care about Africa once the celebrities move on. As Mr. Musto said, ''Just like a trendy restaurant lasts 18 month, so will interest in Africa.'' 

Making The Scene
 SOME of the celebrities who have visited Africa since 2004 and where they went: 
 Clay Aiken (Uganda), India Arie (Kenya), Drew Barrymore (Kenya), Don Cheadle (Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya), Bill Clinton (14 countries), George Clooney (Darfur), Matt Damon (above, Zambia), Mia Farrow and son Ronan Farrow (Darfur), Roger Federer (South Africa), Lawrence Fishburne (South Africa), Bill and Melinda Gates (South Africa, Lesotho), Angelina Jolie (Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia), Quincy Jones (South Africa), Ashley Judd (South Africa), Alicia Keys (South Africa), Lucy Liu (Lesotho), Alyssa Milano (Angola), Brad Pitt (Ethiopia, South Africa, Namibia), Jessica Simpson (Kenya) and Oprah Winfrey (South Africa).


CORRECTION-DATE: August 20, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about an increase in humanitarian aid to Africa referred incorrectly to Ellen Murdoch, a Wisconsin woman who was sent by her church to Rwanda to help the poor. Ms. Murdoch said she was not in fact inspired to go to Rwanda by the movie ''Hotel Rwanda,'' and saw it only after returning home.

HEADLINE: A Charity's Enviable Problem: Race to Spend Buffett Billions

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Although it has long been the largest grant-making foundation in the nation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is facing an unparalleled challenge: how to give away more money -- and do it much faster -- than it ever has before.
 Largely lost in the June announcement of Warren E. Buffett's gift of $31 billion to the foundation were its terms. Mr. Buffet will make the contribution in annual increments. For tax reasons, starting in 2009, the foundation must give away every nickel that he contributed in the previous year.
At the current price of the Berkshire Hathaway stock Mr. Buffett will be donating, the foundation will have to distribute $3 billion annually, or a little more than twice what it distributed last year.
 ''It's like having a second child,'' said Dr. Helene D. Gayle, who left the foundation this year to become president of CARE USA, the international relief group. ''It's not just twice the amount of work; rather, things change in vastly different ways.'' 
 In the next two years, the foundation plans to double its staff to about 600 people to handle the additional money, said Cheryl Scott, the foundation's new chief operating officer, and it is building a new headquarters complex in Seattle. ''We're very thankful for the two years he gave us to ramp up,'' Ms. Scott said. ''I think he understands that you don't just turn this kind of thing on and off.''
 ''I've been a manager for close to 30 years, and this is a well-run organization,'' Ms. Scott added, ''but if you put that kind of a load on the current process we have, it's not going to carry it through.''
 The foundation has said it intends to continue to focus its philanthropy on education and global health while adding a new area, global development, to help the poor in third world countries. Before Mr. Buffett's donation, the Gates Foundation had assets of almost $30 billion.
 Dr. Gayle said the foundation's way of doing business had evolved from its early days, when it believed in giving out a few large grants, rather than many small grants, to avoid building a huge staff and becoming a big institution. Now, she said, it has a more formal, structured process. Increasingly, it creates horse races among potential recipients through requests for proposals, more like a business, Dr. Gayle said.
 ''That takes time and is very hard to do piece by piece, project by project when you're trying to get that much money out the door,'' Dr. Gayle said. ''In addition to the traditional approach of requests for proposals for specific projects, they may need to look at ways of giving out money over longer terms and turning to institutions that have the capacity to spend large resources.'' 
 Externally, the immensity of the amount the foundation will have to give away each year is reviving debate about its size and influence. 
 ''One out of every 10 foundation dollars spent is going to have the Gates name on it, and that gives it influence that is impossible to calculate,'' said Rick Cohen, executive director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a research group. 
 ''And as currently structured, just four people are deciding how to spend all that money,'' Mr. Cohen said, referring to Mr. and Mrs. Gates; William Gates Sr., Mr. Gates's father; and Patty Stonesifer, the foundation's co-chairwoman and president. 
 Mr. Cohen and others said the large amount of money also allowed governments and other donors an excuse not to spend their money. 
 In its 2007 budget proposal, for example, the Bush administration eliminated a $93.5 million program to underwrite the development of smaller schools, specifically citing the increase in support for those schools from ''nonfederal funds'' from the Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation.
 Then there is the issue of accountability. Foundations by and large police themselves because of the paucity of federal and state resources devoted to oversight of the nonprofit sector.
 The Gates Foundation goes further than most in revealing its warts. Its Web site acknowledges various missteps and challenges, be they unexpected complications in starting its AIDS-related program in Botswana or problems with its efforts to develop small schools. Its new headquarters will have a visitors' center, a first for a major foundation.
 ''There is skepticism about whether a foundation can be a responsible and effective steward of this kind of money,'' Ms. Scott said. ''For us, it's a question of teeing up the issue squarely, because it is a real one, and telling the story as fully and openly as we can. We do not want to be a black box.''
 Others say the critics' concerns are overblown because influence can be achieved with even small amounts of money. 
 ''It doesn't take billions of dollars to influence public policy,'' said James Allen Smith, a philanthropic historian at Georgetown University. ''It can be done with tens of millions or even a strategically placed few hundred thousand.''
 Dr. Smith said that although the Gates Foundation grants were typically many times the amount of an average foundation's, its donations paled in comparison with spending by government-financed organizations like the National Institutes of Health, which has an annual budget of $29 billion.
 Foundation officials make the same point. ''It's still, in absolute terms, a small amount of money, given the problems we're working on,'' said Raj Shah, who oversees the foundation's new financial services for the poor and efforts to improve agricultural productivity. Mr. Shah said the foundation's primary focus was on some 550 million households in the world that survive on less than $2 a day.
 Mr. Shah's responsibilities include a new global development program. It is concerned with making financial and agricultural advances, and water and sanitation improvements for the poor. In Malawi, the foundation has underwritten the purchase of thumbprint readers used in establishing savings accounts for the rural poor. 
 The new endeavors, which grew out of a 16-month review aimed at determining how to expand the foundation's operations in ways that complement its work on global health issues, give it new opportunities to spend its money.
 Dr. Gayle said the foundation's work had been evolving in the past year to include broader goals. In reproductive health, for example, it has been moving beyond grants supporting the delivery of services to broader goals like reducing maternal mortality, increasing access to contraception and providing education to girls. 
 The foundation had begun working toward an expansion more than a year before the Buffett gift was announced. The Gateses have long said they intend to give much of their fortune, pegged at $51 billion by Forbes magazine, to the foundation, and Mr. Gates is ceding day-to-day control of Microsoft to devote himself to foundation work.

HEADLINE: Monaco Nods to New York Art: If They Can Make It There Well, You Know

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: MONACO 

 BODY:
What with all the sunning, yachting and gambling going on in Monaco, there is not much time left for culture. Yet this tiny principality keeps trying. It subsidizes an opera house, a ballet company and an orchestra, and every summer it contributes $3.1 million toward a major art exhibition.
 This year's show, ''New York, New York,'' which runs through Sept. 10 at the new Grimaldi Forum, is among the most ambitious to date. Organized by Lisa Dennison, director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, and Germano Celant, senior curator of contemporary art there, it aspires to tell the story of art, architecture, film, performance, photography and video in New York since the late 1940's, when the city replaced Paris as the capital of Western art.
To represent all the main New York art movements and most major American artists of the second half of the 20th century in a single show is perhaps an impossible task. Even with some 200 paintings and sculptures, 300 photographs and scores of film clips and videos, the most ''New York, New York'' can be is an introduction to postwar American art. 
 Still, for Monaco's 32,500 permanent residents and for vacationers visiting from the nearby Cote d'Azur, that is probably just fine. Apart from Andy Warhol, whose large-format works were shown in ''Super-Warhol'' here in 2003, few American artists of any era are household names in Western Europe. A historical overview, therefore, serves a real need. 
 This kind of show is harder to organize than one focusing on a single movement or artist. Here, without the pull of one influential artist, with art used principally to illustrate ideas, Ms. Dennison and Mr. Celant must create a narrative path through enormously varied artistic styles and a half-dozen forms of expression.
 At the same time they must evoke the excitement stirred in New York by successive art movements. In their day each represented a reaction against prevailing norms, each exuded an intense urgency. Now many are as much a part of art history as, say, Cubism and Surrealism before them. 
 To help accomplish their goals, the curators have assembled a weighty 546-page catalog, published in separate editions in English and French and packed with information and interpretation.
 In his opening essay, ''New York: The Art and Communications Brand,'' Mr. Celant contends that the rise of New York to pre-eminence in the art world was inseparable from the rise of a media-driven, mass-market society in which, through galleries, auctions, art fairs and museums, art became the business of ''cultural capitalism.''
 By the late 1940's, he notes, a process had begun by which avant-garde art ''was introduced into the network of communications of the mass media, so that it could be consumed, like any other luxury goods.'' By the 1980's, he writes, this process was completed, and art had become a domain dominated by ''branded'' personalities.
 Mr. Celant also measures the impact of New York's changing economy on artists. Notably, increases in real estate prices and the gentrification of down-at-heel neighborhoods led artists to move from Greenwich Village to SoHo and the East Village and even beyond Manhattan. He notes too that many of the artists in ''New York, New York'' chose to leave the city once they became successful.
 Designed to suggest the chessboard of Manhattan's streets, with blocklike rooms separated by passageways, the exhibition opens in the 1940's with Abstract Expressionism, arguably the first authentically American art movement. The energetic paintings of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline are followed by the calmer abstraction of Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still, with David Smith's sculptures an appropriate companion.
 Reacting against the high seriousness of this movement, Neo-Dada figures like Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Claes Oldenburg appeared on the scene, approaching art through whimsical happenings, assemblage and, in a nod to Marcel Duchamp, a presentation of ordinary objects, albeit on a magnified scale. About the same time, Nam June Paik, a Korean-born artist, began marrying technology and art with the first video installations as part of a movement called Fluxus, which sought to erase the boundaries between different art forms.
 Popular culture then bursts into the show with Pop Art, represented not only by Roy Lichtenstein and his enlarged comic strip images, but also by Red Grooms, Jim Dine, Duane Hanson, George Segal and, most famously, Warhol, who, in Mr. Celant's words, ''intuited before anyone else the process of convergence between art and business, making it into an industry.''
 Perhaps inevitably, ''New York, New York'' is more successful in running through the list of important postwar American artists than in presenting major works of art. Nonetheless the dizzying procession of movements shown here testifies to the city's extraordinary energy and restlessness.
 Thus Minimalism supplanted Pop Art, using industrial material to create geometric abstractions, like Donald Judd's metal boxes, Carl Andre's metal plates and Dan Flavin's multicolored neon lights. Post-Minimalism followed, and it is represented here by Richard Serra and Bruce Nauman, among others. It was then succeeded by Conceptual Art, which embraced language, land art, performance, body art and video.
 In the 1980's painting returned with Neo-Expressionism. Julian Schnabel combined collage with figurative painting, while Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat borrowed from street signs and graffiti. Kiki Smith's sculpture explored the female body and, in an echo of Neo-Dada, Jeff Koons turned simple consumer goods into large, beautifully executed versions of themselves. Also shown here is an excerpt from Matthew Barney's ''Cremaster'' cycle of Neo-Surrealist films.
 Interwoven throughout the exhibition are clips from commercial films associated with New York and, more tellingly, photographs that trace the evolution of the form from social inquiry toward art, as in the case of Cindy Sherman's theatrical self-portraits.
 One movement this show, by design, does not explore is global: that by the end of the century New York had become just one of many centers of contemporary creativity. Artists from London to Shanghai are now as active as those in New York, while the Internet increasingly blurs the notion of city-based art movements.
 ''The art that is being created in New York today continues the vitality, energy and innovation of the last 50 years,'' Ms. Dennison concludes in her catalog essay. That may be true, but the rest of the world is catching up. Certainly artists from all over still want to be recognized in New York. But this may have more to do with the market than the art.

HEADLINE: Come On In: It's the Big Chill of '36

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
The recent heat wave had nothing on the summer of 1936, when temperatures in New York City spiked to a mean-spirited 106 degrees in July, and bodies and minds, still mired in the Great Depression, wilted incrementally as the mercury rose.
 From a marketing standpoint it was a dream come true. One by one, week after week, starting in late June, Fiorello H. La Guardia, the mayor, and Robert Moses, the parks commissioner, unveiled a succession of gifts for the dispirited masses in the five boroughs: 11 enormous, gleaming outdoor swimming pools -- some as regal as a Romanesque fortress or Norman castle, others streamlined Modernist fantasies -- filled with cool, clean water and financed by the federal Works Progress Administration. Their ribbon cuttings drew crowds to watch fireworks, underwater light shows, marching bands and celebrity guests like Bill Robinson (known as Bojangles).
In ''Splash! A 70th Anniversary Celebration of New York City's W.P.A. Pools,'' photographs vintage and contemporary, architectural renderings and color-film clips from the late 1930's chronicle these monuments to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and, more emphatically, to Moses' vision of urban planning. The exhibition is at the Arsenal in Central Park, 64th Street and Fifth Avenue, through Sept. 7. 
 In one image a crane looms over the industrial Greenpoint wasteland in Brooklyn that was to house the McCarren Pool, the Manhattan skyline like a beacon in the distance. In another, children have abandoned the murky East River to frolic under tenements at the Hamilton Fish Pool on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Boys eagerly line up to receive their medals at an Astoria Pool race. 
 These were not the city's first outdoor pools, but they were the largest and, in many cases, the most luxurious. Moses, a swimmer at Yale and captain of the water polo team at Oxford, took office in January 1934. By that summer he had issued a blueprint for his dream: 11 Olympic-size pools scattered in downtrodden sections of the five boroughs. At a time when the city had not yet rebounded from the effects of the Depression, the pools would provide work to unemployed architects, draftsmen, engineers, laborers, and, after they opened, support staff like instructors, lifeguards and maintenance workers: in all, some 80,000 people, said Adrian Benepe, the city's current parks commissioner.
 Perhaps more important, they would help to remove swimmers from the stagnant waters of the city's rivers and floating pools, where infection and disease, let alone drowning, were very real dangers. ''They served a lifesaving function,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''In addition to keeping people cool, they were very much about providing a safe place for the poor.''
 Constructed from inexpensive materials -- bricks, steel, concrete and glass -- the pools followed a three-part prototype: a vast rectangle for ordinary swimming with semi-circular wading and diving areas on either end, said Hilary Ballon, a professor of architectural history at Columbia University. 
 As imagined by the architect Aymar Embury II and his team, these palaces for the poor evoked architecture many New Yorkers weren't likely to have experienced. ''He was a major fan of great historic architecture, and he was giving them sort of a trip to Europe or Asia by visiting a local park,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''You could leave your tenement slum and visit something that was jaw-dropping in its excessive beauty.''
 Turrets and buttresses turned the Colonial Park Pool (renamed for Jackie Robinson in 1978), at West 146th Street and Bradhurst Avenue in Harlem, into a medieval castle. The McCarren in Brooklyn, the only one of the 11 pools that is no longer in use for swimming, though music and dance performances and film screenings are held there, was given a Romanesque attitude. Herbert Magoon, who had designed bathhouses at Jones Beach, conjured up the Crotona, at 173rd Street and Fulton Avenue in the Bronx, as an Art Deco castle, its pool decorated with images of fish, birds and a scorpion. 
 If John Matthews Hatton's gleaming Art Moderne facade at the Betsy Head in Brooklyn didn't move you, maybe the endless sky at the Highbridge Pool in Washington Heights, far above the Harlem River, would. Or the Astoria, one of the largest pools and Moses' favorite, framed by the Hell Gate and his beloved Triborough Bridge.
 Today the city's outdoor pools are free. But Moses wanted his building programs to be self-sustaining, and he charged a 20-cent entrance fee for adults at all times, and a dime for children after 1 p.m., at a time when subway fare was a nickel. 
 And though the pools were not officially segregated, separations occurred. In his biography ''The Power Broker,'' Robert A. Caro writes that Moses said he could keep blacks away from the pools in white neighborhoods by making the water cold. But Kenneth T. Jackson, editor of the Encyclopedia of New York City, expressed doubts that this was true. ''That's not to say they didn't have ethnic tensions in New York, especially in the 1930's,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It was Italians versus Jews versus blacks versus everyone else. Let's don't be Pollyana-ish about it, but it was not correct that Moses intentionally kept African-Americans out of the municipal swimming pools by manipulating the water temperature.''
 Ms. Ballon noted, ''When you look at film footage of Highbridge and others, there was an integrated crowd.'' 
 What is now the Jackie Robinson Pool was built because of pressure from African-Americans to provide services in Harlem, which was terribly underserved, said Marta Gutman, an associate professor of architectural history at City College.
 But systems for heating the water were present in the pools in the 1930's, she added. ''The Moses team, since this issue of public health and hygiene was so important to them, used up-to-date sanitary systems,'' she said.
 City water was filtered through charcoal beds, and then sanitized using chlorine gas. The water in the pools was heated, aerated by large jets and changed three times every 24 hours. Swimmers had to shower before entering the pool and then walk through two footbaths, the first to sterilize, the second to rinse. ''You have to remember, there was no polio vaccine,'' Ms. Gutman said. ''This was serious stuff.''
 There was a time, Mr. Benepe recalled, when he swam in the Jackie Robinson and the Thomas Jefferson, in East Harlem, with his mother at his side. ''These pools continue to play very much the same function as when they opened in 1936, maybe more so,'' he said. ''When the pools opened in the summer of 1936, some 45,000 people used then.''
 During the heat wave two weeks ago, he said, ''around 65,000 came through our pools one day.'' The city now has 51 outdoor pools.
 ''The people who built these felt like they were doing God's work,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''They did an important job, and they did it well, to stand for generations.''

HEADLINE: Aiding Our Enemies

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
 -- George Santayana
 Here we go again.
I wonder if Americans will continue to fall for the political exploitation of their fears of terrorism, or if voters will begin to show some awareness of the fact that they have been cynically manipulated, and that our current policies have been disastrously counterproductive.
 The disrupted plot to blow up as many as 10 passenger jets bound for the United States was a reminder, as if we needed a reminder, that the threat of terror remains both real and imminent. And it was a reminder that the greatest danger to Americans here at home continues to be an attack by a group affiliated with, or inspired by, Al Qaeda. 
 That being the case, what in the world are we doing in Iraq?
 There was something pathetic about the delight with which Republicans seized upon the terror plot last week and began trying to wield it like a whip against their Democratic foes. The G.O.P. message seemed to be that the plot foiled in Britain was somehow proof that the U.S. needed to continue full speed ahead with the Bush administration's disastrous war in Iraq, and that any Democrat who demurred was somehow soft on terrorism.
 The truth, of course, is that the demolition derby policies of the Bush administration are creating enemies of the United States, not defeating them. It cannot be said often enough, for example, that the catastrophic war in Iraq, which has caused the deaths of tens of thousands, was a strategic mistake of the highest magnitude. It diverted our focus, energy and resources from the real enemy, Al Qaeda and its offshoots, and turned Iraq, a country critically important to the Muslim imagination, into a spawning ground for terrorists.
 Almost three years ago, in the immediate aftermath of the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Jessica Stern, who lectures on terrorism at Harvard, wrote in The New York Times that the U.S. had created in Iraq ''precisely the situation the Bush administration has described as a breeding ground for terrorists: a state unable to control its borders or provide for its citizens' rudimentary needs.''
 Ms. Stern went on to say, ''As bad as the situation inside Iraq may be, the effect that the war has had on terrorist recruitment around the globe may be even more worrisome.''
 The situation has grown only worse since then. While Republicans are savoring the political possibilities of a foiled terror plot, the spiraling chaos in Iraq and other Bush administration policies are contributing mightily to the anger and radicalism in the Muslim world.
 Ms. Stern, the author of ''Terror in the Name of God: Why Religious Militants Kill,'' said in an interview last week:
 ''We're in a world where Islamist terrorist leaders are teaching their followers that they have been humiliated. Well, first of all, it's true that Islamic civilization has fallen behind economically, intellectually, politically. It was once the greatest civilization. That's true. But the terrorist leaders teach their followers that not only is this humiliating, but somebody else is to blame -- and that's us. They say that we have deliberately set out to destroy the Islamic world and humiliate Muslims.''
 While it's not true that the United States is trying to humiliate the Muslim world, said Ms. Stern, ''I think that as we contemplate our policy remedies today, we also need to think about how they may ultimately be used by our terrorist enemies to recruit.''
 The debacle in Iraq, and inhumane policies like torture, rendition and the incarceration of Muslims without trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, serve only to strengthen the appeal of militants who are single-mindedly dedicated to the destruction of American lives.
 The U.S. needs to be much, much smarter in its efforts to counter this mortal threat. We should be focused like a laser on the fight against Al Qaeda-type terrorism. We need to ramp up our security efforts here at home. (Even as the terror plot in Britain was emerging, the Bush administration was trying to eliminate millions of dollars in funding for explosives-detection technology. Congress blocked that effort.) We need a new approach to foreign policy that draws on the wisest heads both here and abroad. And we need a strategy for withdrawal from Iraq.
 In a world that is growing more dangerous by the hour, it's time to try something new.

HEADLINE: A Giant Stirs Intrigue With a Big Punt Return

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
With every hip-rattling move and off-balance stride toward the end zone, Giants receiver Michael Jennings did more than score a memorable touchdown on a punt return against the Baltimore Ravens on Friday night. 
 He added a flash of intrigue to the most difficult decisions the Giants will make in the next three weeks: which players to keep on the regular-season roster.
Those decisions largely depend on a borderline player's ability to handle multiple roles. Jennings, struggling to prove himself as a receiver, helped his cause with his pinball-style return. 
 In doing so, he also established the preseason's first what-if moment -- an unsung and somewhat unlikely final-roster candidate making a dazzling case for a full-time job.
 The Giants, like most teams, know how many players they would like to keep at each position. And players know how the pieces of a 53-man roster seem to fit together. 
 Jennings is the first to threaten to scramble those pieces. Before the game, he was not considered a likely candidate for one of six receiver slots, or a viable possibility for a return job. 
 One run helped change that perception, and it serves as an example of the far-reaching repercussions one play can have on a roster. 
 If Jennings makes the Giants, it would probably bump Willie Ponder, a receiver and returner, to unemployment and sever the hopes of several others with promising pass-catching skills but no discernible role on special teams. 
 It could even determine whether the second-round draft choice Sinorice Moss, a receiver who is no threat to be cut but who has missed most of training camp with a pulled quadriceps, is activated for regular-season games. 
 The domino effect stretches to all sides of the roster. Keeping Jennings for his return skills could make the backup defensive back R. W. McQuarters, an experienced returner, more expendable. And it could force the Giants to ponder the role of Chad Morton, the first-team returner for punts and kickoffs. 
 Morton is considered a running back, but he has not carried the ball in an N.F.L. game since 2003 and is not listed among the top five running backs on the team's latest depth chart.
 ''For a guy that's trying to make the team and there's one slot left, who do you go with?'' McQuarters asked. ''Do you go with the guy who can do more, that can do two or three jobs, or the guy that can do one job?''
 He knew the answer. He has been in the league eight years.
 ''The more you can do'' McQuarters concluded without finishing the thought.
 Ponder knows the issue firsthand. He was the team's kickoff returner last year until the ninth game, when he fumbled the opening kick against the Minnesota Vikings. A week later, Morton was handed the duties, and Ponder -- who had no other meaningful role, as a receiver or on the kicking teams -- spent most of the remaining season as a healthy game-day scratch.
 Ponder is getting another chance at the job. He said he did not expect to unseat Morton, so Ponder is practicing kick coverage to increase his roster chances.
 ''I'm fighting for, if not the last spot, one of the last two spots as a receiver, and guys that are in that position, they play a lot of special teams,'' Ponder said. 
 Even Morton is not secure in his role. He has played for four teams in his six-year career. He also spent last year's training camp with the New England Patriots before being cut. The Giants signed him a week before the regular season and installed him as their punt returner.
 Last year, Morton averaged 9.6 yards a punt return, eighth in the N.F.L., and a respectable 23.3 yards a kickoff return. 
 He is still considered the top returner on the team, but Morton is asking for more practice time on kick-coverage squads and at running back. He practiced as a ball carrier last week after Derrick Ward broke his foot.
 ''It puts a little bit more pressure on me, knowing I have to do well at that position, both of them, kick and punt returns,'' Morton said. ''It's fun, because I can just concentrate on that, but it can be tough, especially if you struggle with it. Then you have nothing to fall back on.''
 Jennings is unlikely to make the roster strictly as a receiver or solely as a returner. 
 ''I think I need to do both,'' he said.
 It is an intriguing possibility.

EXTRA POINTS
 Defensive end Justin Tuck is splitting time at defensive tackle, as the Giants experiment with different combinations on the interior of their line. He spent some time with the first team Sunday. Receiver Amani Toomer (sore hamstring) was among those who missed practice. Guard Chris Snee (knee) and linebacker LaVar Arrington (knee) returned after weeklong absences. Guard Rich Seubert has become the backup center, snapping the ball for the first time in his N.F.L. career, he said.

HEADLINE: If a Magazine's List Doubles in Size, Is That Inflation?

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Magazines used to be satisfied with making lists of 50. People had its top-selling 50 Most Beautiful People issue. Vanity Fair picked 50 power players for its annual New Establishment, a list of people who were rarely new and usually were well established. 
 Now the paltry list of 50 has given way to 100, the number atop this year's People's Most Beautiful People, Vanity Fair's New Establishment, the annual Time 100, the Maxim Hot 100 and the new Esquire 100. This week's issue of The Los Angeles Times magazine featured its first ''West 100,'' a list of the 100 most powerful people in Southern California.
If the reason for the switch is typical one-upmanship, no one is admitting it. Vanity Fair is rebranding its list ''the New Establishment: VF 100'' and giving it ''a broader, more global reach,'' said Beth Kseniak, a spokeswoman for the magazine. 
 Larry Hackett, the managing editor of People, wrote in an editor's letter in May that the editors were ''beguiled by so many fabulous faces, we doubled the number.''
 Magazine publishers have reason to be enthusiastic about lists: they can be gold mines of publicity, ad revenues and newsstand sales. The Most Beautiful People issue this year was topped in newsstand sales only by the one featuring baby pictures of Shiloh Jolie-Pitt on its cover. Time magazine spins its annual Time 100 list into endless publicity and a lavish black-tie party in New York. 
 Still, many editors profess to hate lists, features that are, at their worst, unoriginal and gushy. (A heavy-breathing essay in this year's Time 100 described George Clooney as ''a family heirloom'' whose serious bearing makes him ''almost worth killing for.'') 
 ''Magazines do too many lists,'' said David Granger, the editor of Esquire, whose new Esquire 100 makes its debut in the October issue. 
 His is not a ranking of international power players, or Hollywood ingenues, or, as in the Time 100, people who shape our world. Mr. Granger calls it ''the anti-list,'' a mix of thematic essays and items that the editors predict will make news in the coming years. 
 For readers who don't feel like delving into the entire 100-count list, there will be an abbreviated one-page guide to it. (Here's a preview: Egypt is a ''country to watch.'')
 How did the magazine settle on the magic number? ''We debated that quite a bit, whether it should be 100 or not,'' Mr. Granger said, ''but we thought 101 sounded like a cigarette ad.'' JULIE BOSMAN

HEADLINE: More Congestion and Canceled Flights in Britain 

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Heather Timmons in London contributed reporting for this article.; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
As the week begins, passengers face more delays and flight cancellations at busy airports serving trans-Atlantic routes, after British authorities said Thursday that they had uncovered a plot to blow up aircraft flying to the United States from London. 
 In a move meant to ease heavy congestion at checkpoints, BAA, which operates British airports, asked airlines with more than three flights leaving each day to cancel 30 percent of their departures, starting on Sunday.
''It is anticipated that similar measures will need to be put in place tomorrow, although with slightly less cancellations required,'' said Tony Douglas, chief executive of Heathrow airport, describing the outlook for Monday.
 Since the tighter security requirements were put in place, British Airways has canceled about 750 flights to and from Heathrow and 150 to and from Gatwick airport, out of 2,900 scheduled over the four days at the two airports.
 Heathrow passengers bound for destinations in Continental Europe waited for at least an hour Saturday night, in a line that snaked back from security checkpoints and past coffee shops inside Terminal 2.
 Passengers flying to the United States from Britain faced a second screening at the boarding gate that included X-rays, metal detectors and body searches. That check, by the airline, was almost identical to the first one, which was conducted by the airport authority.
 The strict rules imposed in Britain appeared set to remain in force over the coming days, if not weeks, even though some airline executives accused the government of overreacting.
 ''The U.K. government, by insisting on these heavy-handed security measures, is allowing the extremists to achieve many of their objectives,'' said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the low-cost carrier Ryanair, whose business has grown by allowing for last-minute reservations and easy-on, easy-off trips around Europe.
 Mr. O'Leary said security would be adequate if only a quarter of passengers, rather than all of them, were body-searched, provided that ''suspect passengers or routes or groups'' were also targeted.
 The British government ''must act today -- otherwise these extremists will have succeeded by disrupting the economic life of Britain, its air transport industry and its citizens,'' Mr. O'Leary said.
 On Sunday morning, the British home secretary, John Reid, suggested on BBC television that the security measures would eventually be relaxed. ''The present regime is time-limited,'' Reid said. ''We know it is not indefinitely sustainable.''
 Currently, passengers face tight restrictions on what they can bring on board. Most gels, liquids and creams continue to be banned from carry-on luggage in and to the United States. Exceptions include baby food and medicines like insulin.
 Passengers in Britain may take on board only essential travel documents like wallets and passports, and those items must be carried in a transparent plastic bag. Passengers are prohibited from taking music players and laptop computers inside aircraft cabins.

DEAR Diary:
 When I gave the waitress my order at a deli on the Upper West Side, she pointed out that she was new here. Later, I discovered how new when I asked for coffee and rugelach.
''Rugelach coffee,'' she said as she wrote on her pad.
 I clarified my order: ''Coffee and rugelach.'' 
 ''Rugelach coffee,'' she repeated.
 ''And rugelach,'' I said.
 ''Rugelach,'' she said again, to let me know she had gotten my order right.
 A few minutes later the regular coffee arrived -- by itself.
 When I realized that the rugelach wasn't coming, I got the attention of the waitress and brought her over to the cake and cookie display case to show her the rugelach I was talking about.
 ''This,'' I said to her, ''is regular rugelach.''
 I can't imagine what her reaction would have been had I ordered decaf with rugelach. Paul Jackson

Dear Diary:
 I work just south of Union Square in Manhattan, which happens to be a small district for wholesale-only antique stores. Every day, lots of antiques are moved in and out of the stores.
 It was really hot recently (in the 90's and humid) and the movers looked far more tired than they usually do.
 As I was walking back from lunch, I spotted a wonderful sight. 
 A bunch of tired and sweaty movers were taking a break on the curb, next to their truck, sitting comfortably in overstuffed faux-Baroque chairs, their lunches resting securely upon elaborate inlaid tables with a three-foot marble dog (classy!) watching passers-by.

Dear Diary:
 On my way to work one morning, I stopped by my neighborhood fruit and vegetable stand at Third Avenue and 34th Street to buy some summer figs.
 As I reached for my wallet, I realized I had one photo left in a disposable camera in my bag, and impulsively stopped a passer-by and asked her to take a shot of me and the stall vendor.
 The passer-by was tickled, and the vendor was thrilled -- he immediately struck a dramatic pose next to me, holding a grocery bag wide open. 
 Another customer at the stand jumped in to join the pose, grabbing and holding up a bunch of spinach to drop into the vendor's open bag. 
 We all burst into laughter.
 I walked away looking forward to the photo that captured four New Yorkers of different ages and races, stopping in their busy morning to indulge in a moment of silliness together. Avani Mehta Sood

Dear Diary:
 It was a glorious Sunday morning in June, so we rode our bikes on the path adjacent to West Street. 
 We passed quite a few other weekend athletes: joggers, skaters, walkers and bicyclists, all of them engaged in their workouts and enjoying the day.
 Up ahead, we saw someone gliding along in a long-sleeved, ankle-length dress, not your typical exercise clothing for a warm day. 
 As we approached, the figure came into view, but it wasn't until we passed the person that we knew for certain who might wear such unusual garb.
 It was a nun, in traditional habit; her large wooden rosary swung gently back and forth as she skated on her inline skates.
 My husband asked: ''What do you expect? It's Sunday, and she must be late to Mass.'' Janet Falk

Dear Diary:
 I had just returned from a week of vacation at the beach and went to my local Food Emporium to do some shopping. 
 At the checkout I unloaded my cart and pushed it through to where the bagger was standing, and just then realized I had done something wrong. In New York City, the cart never goes past the cashier because the full bags never go into the cart and out to the car. 
 As I turned to pull the cart back out and, I suspected, probably annoy the next customer waiting, I instead found that she was standing aside to let me through.
 She said with sympathy, ''You've been in the country, haven't you?'' Erica Fogg Boyer

HEADLINE: More Data for Online Shoppers, And Plenty of Pictures, Too

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
WHILE the online advertising boom has sent ripples of so-called Web 2.0 innovations through the Internet's media sites, most commerce sites are still stuck on Web 1.0.
 Some expected that situation to change quickly last year, after three companies paid a total of more than $1.7 billion to buy the comparison shopping sites Shopping.com, Shopzilla and Pricegrabber. Since then, though, relatively few entrepreneurs have followed that money into the e-commerce realm.
That may be starting to change, with the recent introduction of two shopping services, Mpire.com and Slide.com, that present new variations on the traditional method of finding items online. While these services are still too new to have gained much of a following, analysts said they at least showed that innovation in this category was far from dead. 
 Of the two new services, Mpire shows perhaps more immediate promise, analysts said. The site, introduced in late June, allows shoppers to view the most recent selling prices of millions of items, based on data from eBay, then compare prices and other attributes on items selling on a handful of major sites, like Overstock, eBay, Craigslist and, starting today, Amazon.com. 
 For instance, someone searching for an iPod Nano with two gigabytes of memory would have seen last week that people paid $153, on average, for the item last month on eBay, and an average shipping price of $16.55. Mpire also displayed a graph of the average prices paid in each of the previous 30 days.
 By contrast, the established comparison shopping sites showed a range of prices from $120 to $270 from various merchants.
 ''I wanted to create the Kelly's Blue Book for everything,'' said Matthew Hulett, Mpire's chief executive. ''I want to show consumers what prices they should actually be paying.''
 That idea follows on the success of Zillow.com, where Mr. Hulett once worked. Zillow.com attracted considerable attention earlier this year when it began listing projected selling prices for homes and condominiums. Unlike Zillow, though, Mpire is earning money from merchants, who pay the site 10 to 20 cents every time someone clicks on their link. 
 Mr. Hulett would not say how many visitors or sales the site had generated since its introduction, but according to Allen Weiner, an analyst for Gartner, a technology consultancy, Mpire's price data sets it apart from other sites in the market. 
 ''Mpire is certainly one of the most interesting companies in the Web 2.0 shopping space, which has been surprisingly sparse,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''There's been a lot done to help people share information about goods, but what most of the new sites lack is that kind of Web 1.0 element of using technology to scour the marketplace.''
 Mpire will also add more social networking components to the site, Mr. Weiner noted, by offering users the ability to send items to friends, add product reviews or link to articles about certain products. ''This will all give people more information to help them make decisions,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''It adds another dimension to the comparison shopping experience.''
 Slide.com, by contrast, seeks to bring the shopping experience directly to the user's computer rather than compelling users to go to a particular Web site. The service, which is led by a PayPal founder, Max Levchin, began as a photo-sharing site, allowing users to present continuous slideshows of photos on their computer screens.
 Mr. Levchin said that feature, which has attracted millions of users, was essentially a testing ground for a shopping service in which users sign up to see slideshows of products they are interested in buying.
 Users first download a piece of software to their computers, then select from various sites products they are interested in seeing. For instance, users can choose to view women's shoes from Zappos.com or jewelry from Bluenile.com, and those items will show in a continuous loop on part of their desktop, along with product descriptions. When users click an item, a browser window opens to the purchase page on the merchant's site.
 Buyers who are interested in the wares of a particular eBay seller may also receive a feed of that seller's items and the time remaining in the auctions, assuming the seller signs up to provide the free service.
 ''One of the problems Slide is trying to solve is the information glut on the Web,'' Mr. Levchin said. ''There are far too many sites showing you things to buy. This allows you to bring things you want to see to your desktop.''
 Slide earns a commission, usually 5 percent to 15 percent, for every purchase made through the site. Mr. Levchin said the total number of sales had not been high, because the service emerged from its testing phase only recently, but early results suggested that the service's users might be avid shoppers. 
 ''Well over half'' of the people who have used the service have purchased something, said Mr. Levchin, who added that was an inflated rate reflecting few users. ''But it means there's a lot of room for it to go down and still be a very successful business,'' he said. The service pulls products from only a handful of sites now, including BlueNile, Zappos and Ujena.com, a swimwear site, but in the next few weeks Mr. Levchin said Slide would add about 50 retailers, including Gap, Old Navy and CompUSA. 
 Sites that distribute merchandise on Slide, Mpire and others say the new services are an important avenue of growth. Greg Isaacs, director of the eBay developers program, which helps syndicate eBay listings across other sites, said he had seen an acceleration in sites looking to help distribute eBay's listings since last year, when eBay started paying more generously for leads.
 In the past, Mr. Isaacs said, eBay paid for each new user an outside service helped bring to the company, but now it pays 40 percent to 65 percent of the revenue eBay makes on each sale an affiliate generates.
 EBay, Amazon and others have also opened much of their technology to outside companies like Mpire and Slide, so these new companies can more easily transfer pricing data, photos, product descriptions and other information directly to their sites. That, Mr. Isaacs said, is a shift from several years ago, when Web sites were more secretive about how their technologies worked.
 ''Now, as long as the user is coming back to the site or somehow we're gaining an economic benefit, there's very little downside,'' Mr. Isaacs said.

HEADLINE: Scripps Is in Search of Its Next Food Network

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
At the Food Network studio in New York, where Rachael Ray whips up her 30-minute dinners, several tables off screen were graced recently with wine glasses and silverware. 
 If the table decor was a bit fancy for Ms. Ray's hugely popular ''30 Minute Meals'' program, that was because it was not for her show. It was a dinner to precede the quarterly board meeting of the E. W. Scripps Company, the Food Network's parent.
The location was appropriate. By starting HGTV, or Home and Garden Television, and by buying control of the Food Network in 1997, Scripps -- once an old-line newspaper company -- had smartly diversified into niche cable networks well before the newspaper business as a whole began to suffer a major downturn. 
 Largely as a result, the company's stock has performed better since 2003 than that of the Washington Post Company, Gannett, The New York Times Company, the Tribune Company, Dow Jones and McClatchy. The cable network unit, Scripps Networks, has driven growth for the last five years, accounting for 44 percent of Scripps's $641 million in revenue in the second quarter, which ended June 30, in contrast to 28 percent from the company's newspapers. 
 But the media landscape continues to change, and now cable networks are, like newspapers, under new competitive pressure from the Web. The question for Scripps, along with many other media companies, is whether it can continue to adapt -- and do so quickly enough.
 Recently, the company made a misstep on its Shop at Home network, and has gambled on new online properties like USwitch, a comparison shopping site. In the last year, with newspaper stocks down and amid fears that cable growth is slowing, Scripps stock has fallen more than 10 percent from the beginning of the year to close at $43.33 a share on Friday. 
 Kenneth W. Lowe, the chief executive of Scripps since 2000, says he believes his company is suffering with other media companies. ''You have a great house,'' he said. ''It just happens to be in a not-so-great neighborhood.''
 While some investors worry that the stock price will continue to struggle, others argue that Mr. Lowe has done an impressive job of diversifying. His recent acquisition of Shopzilla, an online comparison shopping site, will pay off and hasten online expansion online by Scripps, they say.
 ''I think the Scripps Networks will continue to do well because they target such specific markets and their programs lend themselves to video-on-demand,'' said Thomas A. Russo, a partner in the investment firm of Gardner Russo & Gardner, whose clients own shares of Scripps. 
 While journalists measure the success of newspapers by Pulitzer Prizes, investors usually do not. That said, one of the company's 21 newspapers, The Rocky Mountain News, has won four Pulitzers since 2000; the company's papers won five Pulitzers between 1980 and 1999. 
 John Temple, the editor and publisher of The Rocky Mountain News and director of content for Scripps's newspapers, said the company supported the role of the local paper. ''Ken Lowe gives individuals like me who are in positions of responsibility the independence and authority to do the right thing,'' he said. ''Our mantra has been to do what is right for our communities.''
 But John Morton, a veteran newspaper analyst, says that Scripps Newspapers, the company's newspaper unit, ''does not get high marks for its journalism.'' He added, however, that its cash-flow margins -- 28.9 percent in the second quarter -- were among the highest in the industry.
 Mr. Russo said: ''Newspapers are one crummy business. In order to make money in newspapers, you want to cover promos, potlucks and police blotters. The last thing you want to hear about is Pulitzers. And Scripps has done a great job.'' 
 Mr. Lowe, a dapper 56-year-old who has been at the company for 26 years, keeps a low profile. But he has the enormous advantage of strong support from the even-lower-profile Scripps family, which owns 44 percent of Scripps's equity, worth about $3 billion, and controls 87 percent of the votes that elect two-thirds of the board. 
 The heirs' stake is controlled through the Scripps family trust. Two of its trustees, Edward W. Scripps Jr., 47, and Nackey E. Scagliotti, 60, sit on the Scripps board, together with 60-year-old Paul K. Scripps, a cousin from a different branch of the family (who is not a trust beneficiary).
 No Scripps family members hold full-time jobs at Scripps today. Twice a year the extended family, which consists of about 100 heirs, meets with company executives. According to Edward Scripps, tensions that have led other newspaper families to sell their companies do not exist at Scripps. 
 ''We have had these meetings for 15 years, and there has never been any discussion about selling the company,'' Mr. Scripps said. He added that ''there is not the financial pressure that many families have to sell because there is additional income from non-Scripps stock.''
 And whatever the concerns of outside investors, the family remains sanguine about the company, despite the recent downturn in share price. 
 ''We don't get it,'' Mrs. Scagliotti said. ''Some of it can be attributed to the newspaper portfolio.'' She added: ''The family realizes that there will be dips and peaks. Part of that has to do with the price of change.'' 
 The Scripps family owes its fortune to Edward W. Scripps, who started the Scripps enterprise in 1878 when he bought The Cleveland Penny Press, a paper aimed at working-class people who could not afford the 5 cents that many papers then charged. From The Cleveland Penny Press, he expanded with papers across the country and then turned to the telegraph to move news from one paper to another.
 Decades later, Mr. Scripps started United Press International to compete with The Associated Press. His next effort was United Media, which syndicates comics and characters like ''Peanuts'' and ''Dilbert.'' 
 Mrs. Scagliotti and Edward Scripps declined to discuss the trusts' holdings, but the trust has been selling shares of Scripps since the company went public in 1988, reducing the trust's equity from 60 to 44 percent. When Scripps sold its cable systems to the Comcast Corporation in 1995, the trust received roughly $960 million in Comcast stock. 
 The cousins said they had great confidence in their chief executive. It was Mr. Lowe who came up with the idea of HGTV in the early 1990's, when as head of Scripps's broadcast unit he was worried about the future of broadcast TV. 
 Mr. Lowe recalled that he was intrigued at the time by home improvement. On weekends, he said, he and his wife would travel to see shows that showcased new homes and decor. At the time, cable operators like John C. Malone, who then oversaw the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., sought deals to carry new services in exchange for a stake in the network, but Mr. Lowe fought hard to create a service that Scripps would own by itself. By keeping 100 percent of HGTV, and later the Food Network, Scripps managed to keep for itself a much stronger cash flow than its newspapers were providing. Mr. Lowe also made another unorthodox decision: setting up HGTV's headquarters in Knoxville, Tenn. 
 ''I wanted the people who worked for HGTV to be able to afford their own homes,'' Mr. Lowe said. ''It would be too expensive to do that in Cincinnati, New York or Los Angeles.'' The Scripps company is based in Cincinnati.
 HGTV caught on quickly, and is now carried in 90 million homes. The Food Network has been a home run as well, luring viewers interested in cooking. Rachael Ray, who has been on the Food Network since executives spotted her on ''The Today Show,'' said she had developed the concept of 30-minute meals, and the network never tried to change it. 
 ''They made me a national brand, and they never asked me to 'chef up,' '' she said, alluding to swapping out food she had prepared herself for food prepared by a professional. 
 The company's Shop at Home, a cable network and TV station the company bought in 2002 for about $285 million to compete with QVC and the Home Shopping Network, has not been as successful. Mr. Lowe said that Scripps's networks were creating an appetite for cooking and home repair objects they could sell on cable. 
 ''We wanted to build additional streams of revenue aside from advertising,'' he said. For example, so many viewers were interested in a knife that Rachael Ray was using on her show that Scripps started selling it on Food Network's Web site. But despite using Food Network stars like Emeril Lagasse on Shop at Home, the network foundered. 
 ''The network just never got the distribution it needed,'' said Gregory B. Maffei, the chief executive of Liberty Media, which owns QVC and has a stake in the Home Shopping Network. Scripps sold Shop at Home to Jewelry Television and has written off $123 million on its investment. 
 Mr. Lowe said he was disappointed by the results, but the deal led the company to focus more intently on online shopping and to buy privately held Shopzilla for $525 million last year. Though critics worry because Shopzilla does not have proprietary technology, Lauren Rich Fine, who follows newspaper companies for Merrill Lynch, said Scripps had a history of managing its businesses successfully. In the second quarter, Scripps said its interactive unit's revenue was $65 million.
 A bigger concern among investors has been Scripps's $366 million purchase earlier this year of USwitch, a comparison shopping site for the British market. 
 ''I think they overpaid,'' said Ms. Fine, who downgraded the stock when the deal was announced on March 15. She was not the only skeptic. That day, the company's stock fell 3.5 percent. 
 Scripps will need to prove skeptical investors wrong. Last Thursday, the company said that advertising spending on its cable networks had jumped 20 percent in July, and that cable ad revenue was up 17.2 percent, to $286 million, for the quarter. ''That is very good in a soft advertising environment,'' Mr. Russo said.
 If investors are optimistic, Bruce C. Greenwald, a finance professor at Columbia University Business School who teaches a course on the media, said it was because Scripps, ''has done an excellent job of dodging the consequences of the bullets that the new media economy has thrown at them.''

HEADLINE: Surprising Experts, Cuba Stays Calm With Castro on Sidelines 

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 13 

 BODY:
The decline of Fidel Castro, who turned 80 on Sunday and appeared in photographs for the first time since his unspecified intestinal surgery last month, was supposed to be a kind of second Cuban revolution. The notion, put forward by Cuba specialists for years, was that the entire system hung on one man.
 But in the last two weeks, with Mr. Castro turning over power to his brother Raul, at least for now, a different reality has emerged on the island. There was calm and normalcy, not chaos and hysteria that was predicted. Instead of an intervention by the United States, the Bush administration called on the Cuban people to take their future in their own hands. And rather than upheaval within the Cuban government, it appears that the political system may not change much at all.
''American policy toward Cuba has always been based on the fragility of the Cuban system,'' said Philip Peters, an expert on Cuba at the Lexington Institute, a policy group based in Virginia that promotes free-market economics. ''There is this predicate in our policies that the Cuban system is one that can be pushed over with one finger, and that has not been the case.'' 
 If Mr. Castro dies, the country's stability may be more overtly shaken. But so far it appears that Mr. Castro, who has governed Cuba for 47 years, may once again defy the experts and prove his influence, some call it control, over the government and its people, whether he survives or not. 
 Photos published Sunday by the state-run youth newspaper, Juventud Rebelde, showed Mr. Castro looking alert. A message signed by the president, however, made it clear that his recovery would be long, and might not be successful.
 ''I suggest to everyone to be optimistic,'' Mr. Castro's letter said, ''and at the same time to be ready always to face any adverse news.''
 The four photos showed Mr. Castro from the waist up, wearing an Adidas sweat-suit jacket, rather than his signature army fatigues. In two of the photographs, Mr. Castro was speaking on the telephone. In another, he held a copy of a special supplement, published on Saturday by the state-run newspaper Granma, in honor of his birthday.
 ''For all those who care about my health,'' Mr. Castro wrote, ''I promise to fight for it.''
 Upon the announcement that Mr. Castro was temporarily stepping down from power to have surgery, this reporter traveled to Cuba on a tourist visa, and was expelled a week later. Neither during that time, nor since then, has Mr. Castro vowed to return to office. Aides to Mr. Castro have suggested that he might not ever be able to fully reassume his responsibilities. But Julia E. Sweig, the director of the Latin American program at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan organization, predicted he would not. 
 ''I think they are signaling to domestic and international publics that the duration of Fidel's absence may be much longer than the provisional nature he initially stated,'' Ms. Sweig said. ''The transfer is under way.'' 
 She added that in stepping down from power two weeks ago, even if only temporarily, Mr. Castro did more than elevate his brother Raul. She said he also delegated control of government sectors, including energy, education and health care, to other close aides.
 ''It was a promotion for the people who have been running the country with Fidel,'' she said. ''Now they are preparing to run the country without him.''
 Thoughts of a future without Fidel Castro have consumed public attention on the island since the ailing Mr. Castro announced that he had handed interim power to his brother 14 days ago. 
 Rather than making an abrupt departure from power, however, Ms. Sweig said that Mr. Castro had begun a drawn-out campaign aimed at keeping the country stable while his aides quietly worked out the details of the nation's first permanent transition in recent history. On Sunday, Raul Castro made his first appearance as Cuba's temporary president when he greeted Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, at the airport.
 Meanwhile, people across Havana pored over the photos and seemed to see different things in their president's unremarkable expressions. At a Coppelia ice cream shop that draws lines around the block, one man said that Mr. Castro's beard looked freshly dyed. It was a sign, the man said, of recovery.
 A woman in the same line commented on Mr. Castro's eyes, and said, ''He looks so tired.''
 Given the restrictions on political expression in Cuba, it can be hard to know peoples' true thoughts. Still, whether people said they felt relieved or skeptical, they continued on with their normal activities. If there was something unusual happening inside the government, there was hardly any way to tell it on the streets.
 Annual carnival celebrations scheduled for earlier this month were canceled, and the official celebrations of Mr. Castro's birthday were postponed until December, both because of his illness. But neighborhood Revolutionary Defense Committees called residents together for ''reaffirmation ceremonies'' to spread the message that the government was in good hands while Mr. Castro struggled to recover. 
 There were occasional light infantry exercises along the seaside boulevard, known as the Malecon, but they seemed much less spectacular than the everyday rush-hour blitz in which workers cram themselves onto decrepit public buses to get home. 
 Booksellers hawked used texts the way they always do in plazas at the heart of the city's colonial center. Children on summer vacation squealed as dolphins at the National Aquarium balanced balls on their noses and leaped through hoops. Foreign tourists sang along with salsa bands in bars that were once Ernest Hemingway's hangouts.
 All in all, the days after Fidel Castro left power seemed a lot like any other.
 ''We were ill-prepared for the eventuality of continuity rather than change,'' said Damian Fernandez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, referring to policy makers in Washington and Miami. ''All our policies have been built on a foundation of wishful thinking. Now we are confronted with reality, and it's not what we had hoped it would be.''
 A stroll through a working-class neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Havana, called Alamar, offers a glimpse of that reality. It was built in the early 1970's, the heyday of Mr. Castro's government, first for Eastern European technicians working on the island and then for the masses of Cuban workers moving from the countryside to the capital in search of a better life.
 The money and utilitarian design for the project was provided by the former Soviet Union. The politics of the place, home to more than 140,000 people, is pure Castro.
 There is free health care, but so little new housing that young couples often decide against getting married or having children because they have no places of their own. There is free education, but the government restricts access to the Internet and satellite television. Individuals are free to complain about shortages of food and fuel. But more than three residents complaining around a kitchen table can be run out of their homes as ''counterrevolutionaries,'' and charged with treason.
 It was not the police or the military that watched what people said and did, said a retired port worker and his wife. It was the people themselves.
 An architect who could not be identified for his own safety stopped to talk after walking his wife and 2-year-old daughter to a park in Alamar last week. Like other Cubans interviewed there, the architect described himself as a ''Fidelista,'' saying he respected Mr. Castro as a ''person with incredible vision.''
 Still, he complained at length about the Cuban economy, which runs on two currencies: one for Cubans and one for foreigners.
 He said that although he had helped the Cuban military design some of the elegant resorts that had attracted millions of tourists to the island, he did not dream on his $36-a-month salary of spending a night in one of them.
 The bulk of the architect's earnings were in Cuban pesos, good only at state stores with limited stocks. Hotels like the ones he designed accept only ''convertible pesos,'' available to those with foreign currency. The same is true for most supermarkets and clothing stores.
 Although almost everyone has a state job, no one is able to support their families on them, the architect said. Most people, he added, illegally ''invent'' jobs on the side to earn foreign currency. He said he made ends meet with the $100 his father sent him monthly from Miami.
 ''Foreigners live as if it was a paradise,'' the architect said. ''Cubans do not have access to it. Our money is no good in those places. It has generated a long chain of frustration.''
 When asked how it was that frustration had not boiled over into unrest after Mr. Castro stepped down from power, the architect said Cubans had already lived through several waves of uncertainty, from the Bay of Pigs to the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
 Each time, he said, predictions that their government would collapse proved premature. Instead of getting weaker, he said, Mr. Castro's grip on the island seemed to get stronger.
 ''Children who live in countries at war get used to the sounds of bombs,'' he said. ''We are accustomed to living with threats.''

HEADLINE: Fathers Defeated, Democratic Sons Strike Back

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
In the history of the Democratic Party, the election of 1980 looms large: the year the party lost the White House, the Senate, a generation of Midwestern liberals and, in some ways, its confidence that it was the natural, even inevitable, majority party.
 Now, that election has a sequel.
Call it the return of the sons: Chet Culver, the Iowa secretary of state and the son of former Senator John C. Culver, is running for governor of Iowa. Senator Evan Bayh, son of former Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, is organizing and testing the waters for a possible presidential bid in 2008. And Jack Carter, the son of former President Jimmy Carter, has decided at the age of 59 to run an uphill race for the Senate in Nevada, his first foray into electoral politics.
 All of them had their political sensibilities shaped, to some extent, by the election that defeated their fathers and began a generation of conservative dominance. The Democratic strategist William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, described it as the first of ''a series of rolling shocks'' for the Democratic Party that ''started in 1980,'' when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter, ''and really didn't end until 1994.'' 
 They say their values are the same as their fathers', but their political approach is adapted to a different time. In one measure of the difference, the elder Mr. Bayh and Mr. Culver were invariably described as liberals; the sons, in recent interviews, avoided the term.
 ''I find the world just too complex to embrace a single ideological point of view,'' Evan Bayh said. Moreover, he argued, conservative strategists like Karl Rove like nothing better than to push Democrats into an ideological corner. 
 ''It shouldn't be about ideology,'' Mr. Bayh said. ''It ought to be about practical progress, ideas that make sense to people in their daily lives.''
 Chet Culver, who is running against Representative Jim Nussle in the Iowa governor's race, one of the most competitive in the country, describes himself as ''a proud, progressive Democrat.'' He added: ''Labels aren't what matters. It matters what you believe in.''
 At 50, Mr. Bayh has already served two terms as governor of Indiana and is in his second term as senator. He is clearly proud of his ability to run -- and win -- in a conservative, Midwestern state, an important part of the political rationale for his potential presidential candidacy. (He has said he will make a decision by the end of this year.)
 While Birch Bayh was known as a classic ''Great Society liberal,'' as Evan Bayh has put it, and as a champion of causes like the equal rights amendment, the son has long been a careful centrist, a former chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council and a founder of the Third Way, a centrist research group.
 Visiting 22 states over the past year, he has argued that the way for Democrats to win is to reach out to the middle class, demonstrate credibility on national security and show respect for faith and values issues.
 ''The world has changed a lot'' since his father's day, Mr. Bayh said. ''So it's natural that how we solve our problems changes, too.'' For example, he said, the importance of fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets has become increasingly apparent over the years. And from a political standpoint, Democrats have learned over and over since 1980 the power of an ideological campaign when waged against them.
 Mr. Bayh was 24 when his father ran for re-election in 1980; he took a break from law school to be chairman of his campaign. It was clear, early on, that it would be a tough election: double-digit inflation, a hostage crisis, an embattled Democratic president at the top of the ticket, and the emergence of a tough new conservative organization known as the National Conservative Political Action Committee, or Ncpac.
 Ncpac wanted not only to defeat a generation of liberals -- Mr. Bayh, Mr. Culver, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, Senator Frank Church of Idaho and a handful of others -- but also to ''send a shiver down the spine of every other liberal senator and congressman,'' as one official put it. They succeeded at both.
 Afterward, ''I came close to being turned off to politics,'' Evan Bayh said. ''I love my father and I believe in him. And he lost to Dan Quayle. I had a hard time understanding how that could happen.'' 
 But Mr. Bayh said he ultimately came to see the loss as ''an occupational hazard.'' He added: ''Every once in a while, an election comes along and who you are and what you believe gets subsumed in a larger tide. It just happens.''
 People wanted change in 1980, he said. ''And I think people want a change now,'' he added.
 But do Democrats want, in 2008, the practical centrism that Mr. Bayh offers? Or are they hungry, once again, for an unapologetic liberalism to match the conservatism on the right? 
 Mr. Bayh replied that Democrats who ''believe we can stay true to our progressive heritage and implement it in practical ways'' and who are keenly aware that ''the Republicans are trying to pigeonhole us'' will eventually ''make their voices heard.''
 The elder Mr. Bayh, now a 78-year-old lawyer and lobbyist in Washington, said the differences between his politics and those of his son tended to be exaggerated. But in general, said Mr. Bayh, who ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1976, ''I try to remain at arm's length; he's the candidate, not old dad.''
 Chet Culver was 14 when his father was defeated in 1980 by a conservative Iowa farmer and House member: Charles E. Grassley, now chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
 ''The great thing about it was my father gave it everything he had,'' Mr. Culver said after a campaign rally in Waterloo, Iowa, earlier this month. ''Stayed true to his values, was very principled and focused, and went down with a great fight. It was very inspiring.''
 Twenty-six years later, the Republicans constitute the Washington establishment, a point that Mr. Culver drives home. He frames his race against Mr. Nussle, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, as a choice between ''Iowa experience and Iowa values, and D.C. experience and D.C. values.''
 On the stump, the younger Culver, who won the Democratic nomination in a very competitive primary, evokes comparisons to his father. 
 ''He didn't take any guff from anybody either,'' State Senator Bill Dotzler said, watching approvingly in Waterloo. ''They're both big guys. They're both well loved by labor.''
 The Nussle campaign counters that, in the end, Mr. Nussle's track record and accomplishments will prevail.
 Jack Carter, hoping to unseat Senator John Ensign in Nevada, said he had always believed that ''I sort of gave at the office'' when it came to politics, given how much he campaigned for his father.
 But Mr. Carter, who spent his career in the investment and finance industry, said he had grown so ''exasperated'' with the Bush administration that he jumped into a race even though he was widely considered a long shot. ''The Democratic message is what it's always been,'' he said. ''It's that Democrats are for the working men and women in America.''
 A poll for The Las Vegas Review-Journal released over the weekend showed Mr. Ensign with 54 percent to Mr. Carter's 33 percent, although it noted that Mr. Carter had gained ground in recent months. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 Mr. Carter said his father's initial reaction to his candidacy was probablyshock, but the former president is solidly onboard, raising money for his son recently with his former vice president, Walter Mondale.
 The senior Mr. Bayh indicated that he had long ago settled into a supporting role for his son. ''Once he got to be elected governor,'' Mr. Bayh said, ''I thought he was on his own.'' 
 The families' paths continue to cross: Evan Bayh will be campaigning with Chet Culver at the Iowa State Fair this week.

HEADLINE: LOOKING AHEAD

 BODY:

THE PRICE OF EGGS -- Fluctuations in the prices of many things (including eggs) will be described this week by the Labor Department when it releases its monthly Producer Price Index (Tuesday) and the Consumer Price Index (Wednesday). People who study these indexes -- including the policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who give particular weight to the consumer index -- will be on the lookout for inflation. The wholesale figure rose an unexpectedly high 0.5 percent in June, and economists are predicting a 0.4 percent increase for July, according to Bloomberg News. Consumer prices were up 0.2 percent in June; July's rise is projected to be 0.4 percent. 


MORE MEASUREMENTS -- Other economic reports are due out this week, including the Federal Reserve's July figures for industrial production and capacity utilization (Wednesday). The Conference Board will release its leading economic indicators for July (Thursday) and the University of Michigan will offer its preliminary index of consumer sentiment for August (Friday).

FRESH CROP OF EARNINGS -- There will be plenty of companies reporting their results this week, including Agilent Technologies, CA Inc. and Sysco (Monday); Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters, BJ's Wholesale Club, Deere & Company, Home Depot, PetSmart, Saks Inc., Staples Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores (Tuesday); BEA Systems, Gymboree, Hewlett-Packard, Talbots Inc. (Wednesday); Aeropostale Inc., Barnes & Noble, Claire's Stores, Dell, Gap Inc., Nordstrom Inc. and Sears Holdings (Thursday); and AnnTaylor Stores and Foot Locker (Friday).

SPECIAL EARNINGS MENTION -- It cannot be that much fun for a company to report earnings right after it settles some (but not all) shareholder lawsuits over stock option backdating and sees some former executives (including the former chief executive) indicted, but that is what Brocade Communications Systems, a software maker based in San Jose, Calif., is scheduled to do this week (Thursday).

HEADLINE: City Role Expands In BAM District

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Responding to repeated delays, the city is taking a more aggressive role in developing the BAM Cultural District in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, removing control from a nonprofit planning group and shifting the site of a theater designed by Hugh Hardy and Frank Gehry.
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said the city began moving to jump-start the cultural district last spring. 
 ''Projects have languished for a while, and we have taken things forward,'' he said in an interview. ''We've created new structures within the city to better implement plans. We are moving very aggressively.'' ''Having a world-class series of institutions at the heart of the revitalization of downtown Brooklyn is absolutely critical,'' Mr. Doctoroff said of the area surrounding the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
 The BAM Local Development Corporation, which had overseen the art district's budget and planning for its new cultural buildings, will now be subsumed within a new umbrella organization, the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which also includes the Downtown Brooklyn Council, the Fulton Mall Improvement Association and the MetroTech Business Improvement District. 
 Joseph Chan will leave his post as a senior policy adviser in Mr. Doctoroff's office to serve as president of the partnership. It will have its own board of directors. Jeanne Lutfy, the president of the BAM Local Development Corporation, said she did not feel threatened by the city's expanded role. ''We think it's a great thing,'' she said. ''The city has always been a partner in this.'' 
 ''They're just bringing more resources to the table, so we can get it into the ground faster,'' she added. Currently the city has $74 million in financing allocated for the cultural district for fiscal 2006 through 2009.
 Ms. Lutfy said she and Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the corporation, would still take part in the planning. (Mr. Lichtenstein, citing a family illness, referred calls to Ms. Lutfy.) 
 The city has approached the Theater for a New Audience, an Off Broadway troupe known for productions of Shakespearean and classical drama, and asked it to cede its planned site at Flatbush and Lafayette Avenues and build across the street instead. The site it originally hoped to occupy, next to a planned Brooklyn Visual and Performing Arts Library, is being reconceived as a kind of public gateway to the cultural district. ''It's the ninth-inning good idea,'' said Kate D. Levin, the city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner. ''We could configure this differently.''
 City officials note that the theater's new proposed location is slightly larger and might allow the theater to avoid building an underground parking garage, which was part of the original plan. 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Hardy, the main architect on the theater project, said he was unavailable for comment. Mr. Gehry said he was amenable to a new location. ''I think it's fine,'' he said. ''It doesn't hurt anything. It means a little bit of reworking. It gives you some opportunities we didn't have on the other site.''
 The glass-and-stainless-steel building will be the theater's first permanent home. It will house a 299-seat theater, a rehearsal room and a studio that will seat 50. 
 Ms. Levin said the change in site would not delay the project. ''We're hoping to break ground in the next year or so,'' she said. 
 The city has also taken the lead in negotiating with various organizations about sharing a building with the library, designed by Enrique Norten. A partner would help the library pay for construction costs and overhead. Candidates include an international foundation that deals with art and education, officials involved in the talks said, but they refused to identify it. 
 The library is currently without a leader. Two directors have come and gone since planning for the new building began, which has delayed fund-raising.
 The BAM Cultural District was conceived as a $650 million effort to revitalize the area by converting vacant and underused properties into spaces for arts organizations. 
 Yet six years after the district was proposed, ground has not been broken on either of the signature projects. And the master plan for the district has meanwhile passed from Rem Koolhaas and Diller, Scofidio & Renfro to Dan Wood of Work Architecture Company. 
 The $36 million theater project, announced in March 2004, was the first major undertaking of the new district. When Mr. Hardy's design was unveiled a year later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the city was committing $6.2 million to the project, and Kate D. Levin, the cultural affairs commissioner, said she expected the theater to be built within two years. Now officials estimate that the theater will be completed around sometime before 2009. 
 Jeffrey Horowitz, the theater's founder, said his institution had raised an additional $6 million in private money, which he saw as notable progress, given the theater's modest level of support. ''We don't have a huge roster of people with deep pockets,'' he said, adding, ''We're confident that we're going to meet our goal.''
 Mr. Horowitz said the new location might better serve the theater because it offers improved loading access. ''It's a very attractive alternative,'' he said. The theater hopes to reach a formal agreement with the city on the new site by the fall. 
 The Brooklyn Visual and Performing Arts Library has faced similar delays. When Mr. Norten's design was unveiled in May 2002, officials predicted a groundbreaking in 2005 and a grand opening in 2007. Herbert Muschamp, who was then the architecture critic for The New York Times, hailed the project as the city's ''first full-fledged masterwork for the information age.'' 
 Initially the library said it hoped to raise $120 million for the project, $75 million of which would be for construction. It has said that 10 to 15 percent of the overall cost would be met by the local development corporation by using capital funds allocated by the mayor, the borough president and the City Council. For fiscal 2006 and 2007 the city has allocated $8 million for the library.
 Carol Linn, the library's coordinator of special projects and policy analysis, said the cost estimate was likely to be revised, but she declined to be more specific. ''This is still a project that is very much in the forefront for us,'' she said. Mr. Norten, who designed the library, was also upbeat. ''I'm very positive,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shares Are Modestly Higher After Paring Early Gains 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed slightly higher yesterday, again giving up significantly larger gains from earlier in the day. A drop in crude oil prices and the start of a United Nations-brokered cease-fire in the Lebanon war seemed to ease some investors' concerns.
 Sal Arnuk, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, N.J., commented, ''The market opened up strong because of lower oil and the cease-fire, but when the S.& P. got up around 1,280, which is a much-ballyhooed level, it couldn't get past it and then just started drifting lower from that resistance level on fairly light volume.'' 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.84 points, or 0.09 percent, to 11,097.87. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 1.47 points, or 0.12 percent, to finish at 1,268.21. The Nasdaq composite index did best among the major indexes, up 11.33 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,069.04. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks gained 2.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to 681.73.
 During the day, the Dow ranged over 123 points from its session high at 11,202.73 to its low of 11,079.78, when it briefly turned negative.
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those declining by a margin of 11 to 9. Volume was light, with 1.39 billion shares traded on the Big Board, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. 
 Crude oil for September delivery fell 82 cents, to settle at $73.53 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as the truce to end nearly five weeks of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon took hold. 
 Oil prices fell after BP said it would keep pumping at half its Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska while it carried out pipeline repairs.
 The drop in crude oil prices prompted investors to sell some energy shares, with Exxon Mobil down 48 cents, to $69.25, making it the S.& P. 500's biggest loser.
 Technology stocks, which have suffered sharp declines in the last few weeks, were among the gainers. 
 Cisco Systems, the leading maker of networking equipment, rose 55 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $20.09. The shares advanced after Barron's reported that the company was set to benefit from telecommunications companies' upgrading their networks to provide next-generation services like video.
 Intel and I.B.M. were major contributors to the Dow's advance. Intel shares rose 46 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $17.87. I.B.M. closed up $1.20, or 1.6 percent, at $76.68.
 After regular trading ended yesterday, Dell said it would recall more than four million notebook computer batteries that could burst into flames. Dell had closed up 17 cents, at $21.24. After hours, it fell 24 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $21. Sony, which makes the batteries, said it was ''financially supporting'' Dell in the recall. 
 Shares of Whole Foods Market jumped $3.54, or 7.5 percent, to $50.91, after Barron's reported that the stock was undervalued and poised to improve.
 The heaviest drag on the Dow industrials was Caterpillar, which fell $1.07, or 1.6 percent, to $65.96 -- reversing an earlier gain of 1 percent. Caterpillar's fall limited the Dow's gain for the day.
 General Electric closed up 32 cents, or nearly 1 percent, at $32.82.
 On the bond market, Treasury securities fell modestly yesterday as investors awaited inflation data from July: the Producer Price Index today and the Consumer Price Index tomorrow. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 6/32, to settle at 99 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5 percent from 4.97 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Economy Grows Nearly 1% in Europe 

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
With France and Germany leading the way, the economy in the 12 nations that use the euro currency grew at its fastest quarterly rate since 2000, a development that is expected to fortify the resolve of the European Central Bank to raise interest rates again this year. 
 The gross domestic product of the nations grew 0.9 percent from April to June compared with the previous quarter, Eurostat, the statistics agency of the European Union, reported Monday. Growth has recently mostly reflected strong exports, but the latest figure received a lift from business investment and consumers, whose reluctance to spend has been the hallmark of the slow recovery.
 The German economy, where households have been the most tightfisted, also grew 0.9 percent.
 ''Domestic demand is doing its job, finally,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist with Goldman Sachs. ''We finally have a little drive from something other than exports, which is good.''
 The data broadly confirmed figures released by various countries over much of the last week, most recently France on Friday. Though overall growth is accelerating in the euro region, it is uneven, with France growing at a rate of 1.1 percent to 1.2 percent in the quarter, and Italy lagging at 0.5 percent.
 The precise details of the growth pattern are not yet available, but economists said that data on retail sales in Germany points toward strong consumption, as does a fall in unemployment. Business confidence surveys, though they have come off their peaks of earlier this year, are still in line with strong growth.
 ''The situation on the labor market has noticeably improved,'' said Michael Glos, the German economics minister. ''Therefore, the prospects for the year are exceptionally positive.''
 The European Commission on Monday raised its estimate for growth in the third quarter to 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent, slightly higher than it projected in July.
 But the commission cut its forecast to a range of 0.4 percent to 0.9 percent for the fourth quarter, a period when many economists said they expected the softening economy in the United States to drag on European growth.
 With the European economy having accelerated from 0.6 percent growth in the first three months of the year, analysts said the European Central Bank appeared to have ample reason to continue its pattern of slow but steady interest rate increases. Last week, the bank raised its benchmark rate a quarter percentage point, to 3 percent, its fourth move in nine months.
 After the central bank raised borrowing costs, most economists began to predict another step in October, and the strong growth figures raise the prospect of another round in December as well, so that the bank ends the year at 3.5 percent.
 The central bank is grappling with how to steer an economy that is picking up speed, but will probably slow somewhat next year as the effects of slowing growth in the United States take hold. The bank is also worried that the increase in the German value-added tax, to 19 percent from 16 percent, will both harm growth and raise inflation, now running slightly over its target of 2 percent.

HEADLINE: Planned Tower Would Cap Off Revitalization of Times Square

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A New Jersey developer plans to build a $1 billion office tower on the last parcel in the 13-acre Times Square redevelopment district, bringing an end to the 26-year effort to clean up an area that was known as the Deuce when it was a motley collection of movie houses, sex shops, T-shirt stores, pimps and drug dealers.
 If in the past many people feared strolling down 42nd Street, now the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and Times Square itself, are safe for investment bankers, accountants, MTV fans and tourists alike. The theaters, skyscrapers, theme restaurants and nightclubs that have opened in recent years under pulsating neon signs and giant electronic billboards are often packed.
But the decision by the developer, SJP Properties, to build a 40-story tower at the southeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street is remarkable on several fronts. Not only would it complete a major public revitalization project, but urban planners and real estate executives say another first-class tower would also establish Eighth Avenue as a legitimate boulevard for corporate offices. 
 ''This is the last piece of the puzzle,'' said Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the 42nd Street Development Project and the state's top economic development official.
 SJP's 1 million-square-foot building would join two other major office towers on Eighth Avenue: the Worldwide Plaza tower at 49th Street and The New York Times headquarters under construction at 41st Street. Until now, few companies have been willing to locate west of Seventh Avenue or Broadway.
 If the project goes forward as planned, the SJP tower will also be the first major speculative office building -- one built without an anchor tenant -- in a decade and another sign of a resurgent commercial market in Midtown. Builders have erected apartment houses by the dozens over the past five years, but office developers have bemoaned that rents did not justify the cost of building a new tower.
 But commercial rents are now going up quickly, with some tenants paying as much as $150 a square foot per year in prime Midtown buildings, and large blocks of available space are hard to find.
 ''This is the first time in 25 years that we've seen the Midtown market this strong for Class A office space,'' said Steven J. Pozycki, SJP's chairman. ''We're excited about both the opportunity and the timing.''
 SJP Properties has been largely known as a developer of suburban office parks in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But the company has been eager to get into the Manhattan market. It has begun excavation for a 42-story apartment building at 46th Street and Eighth Avenue and plans to build a condominium tower on Park Avenue.
 Mr. Pozycki bought the 42nd Street property last month for $305 million from Howard and Edward Milstein. The Milstein family had acquired the property early in the redevelopment project, in 1983, for $5 million. The Milsteins announced in 2002 that they planned to build a 35-story tower there, but never got beyond erecting a blue construction fence.
 The 42nd Street Development Project gave tentative approval yesterday to SJP's plan for a 40-story tower and a deal to buy additional development rights for $23.2 million. Mr. Pozycki, whose firm hired FX Fowle Architects to design the building, said the office tower would sit above two floors of stores at what would be known as 11 Times Square. Construction should begin in about 10 months, he said. Final approval is expected later this year.
 ''It's ironic that this site, which we thought might be the first one to be developed, ends up being the last one to complete the Times Square project,'' said Carl Weisbrod, who worked on the redevelopment plan as both a state and city official from 1980 to 1995. ''It's turned out to be a highly successful venture, but I don't think any of us thought it would take 26 years.''
 Despite a string of news conferences and much fanfare during the 1980's, the redevelopment of 42nd Street and Times Square was hobbled by 47 lawsuits, opposition from civic groups and a deep recession in the early 1990's. A merchandise mart was originally planned for the two blocks between 40th and 42nd Street, where the Times building is now under construction and SJP's property sits. In 1980, the city had actually passed on an opportunity to buy the SJP property for a couple of million dollars.
 Mr. Gargano said there were two crucial breakthroughs, the first in late 1993, when the Walt Disney Company signed a tentative agreement to renovate the landmark New Amsterdam Theater on 42nd Street. Then in 1996, he said, the developer Douglas Durst began building a skyscraper at 4 Times Square, the first of what would eventually be four office towers in the middle of Times Square. As SJP is doing, the Durst family took the relatively rare step of starting construction without an anchor tenant.
 Ten years later, Mr. Pozycki says the time is right to build another speculative office tower, this time on Eighth Avenue. Oddly enough, his partner is Prudential, the giant insurer that was selected by the state in the 1980's to buy 13 acres between Seventh and Eighth Avenues and develop four office towers in Times Square. But Prudential sold the land for the towers during the 1990's recession.
 The market is hot now, Mr. Pozycki said. The average asking rent in Midtown has climbed to $58.26 a square foot, while the vacancy rate dropped to 8.7 percent last month from 13.1 percent in late 2003, according to Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate broker. 
 And there is little new office space available. Mr. Durst, who is building the Bank of America Tower at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, has signed leases for virtually the entire 2.1 million-square-foot building, including one for $100 a square foot. 
 At The New York Times Building, across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, the newspaper company plans to occupy half the tower next year, and its partner, Forest City Ratner, has leased much of the rest of the building to three law firms and a financial services company.
 Recently, Vornado Realty opened talks with the Port Authority about reviving plans to build an office tower over the bus terminal, across Eighth Avenue from the SJP project.
 Mr. Pozycki said his broker, Stephen B. Siegel of CB Richard Ellis, took him to Howard Milstein earlier this year to talk about a deal. He said Mr. Milstein responded, ''This is my price, take it or leave it.'' Despite the relatively high cost of the land, Mr. Pozycki said it should not be too risky to build without a tenant.
 ''The market and confirmation of the Eighth Avenue neighborhood itself takes a lot of the 'spec' out of speculative,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''What's going on in Midtown is fueled by real job growth and a lack of supply.''

HEADLINE: A Distant Mirror

BYLINE: By THOMAS FRANK. 
Thomas Frank is the author, most recently, of ''What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America.'' He is a guest columnist during August.

 BODY:
By now, even the most dedicated ''values voter'' is aware that an orgy of plunder and predation grinds merrily on in the capital, yet if polls are to be believed, the Democrats can persuade almost nobody to switch their vote on that basis. That's because, while they have many nice slogans on the subject, Democrats offer no larger theory of corruption, no way to help voters understand what is essentially Republican about the pillage currently being visited on our national government. 
 I suggest the Democrats turn their eyes to the conservatives' beloved 19th century, an era that is relevant again in all sorts of startling ways. The reigning economic faith of our time, they will find, is merely a souped-up version of the Victorians' understanding of the market-as-nature. Again Americans thrill to the exploits of the great tycoons, and gradually we are becoming reacquainted with pervasive inequality, the wrenching ''social issue'' of our great-grandparents' time. 
This is why I nominate Matthew Josephson's 1938 masterpiece, ''The Politicos: 1865-1896,'' as the volume of history with the most to teach us about the present. The book is valuable for its surface qualities alone -- its painstaking reconstruction of forgotten scandals, its glimpses of antique slang and high-flown oratory, its remarkable cast of politicians, like the ''Easy Boss'' Tom Platt and the ''Plumed Knight'' James G. Blaine, all of them household names once but today as obscure as Ozymandias. 
 Still, contemporary readers will feel the sharp poke of recognition with nearly every chapter. Then, as now, empty accusations of treason were standard rhetoric. Reformers were routinely taunted as effeminate -- in the manner that conservatives today bandy about terms like ''effete,'' ''French-looking,'' and ''girly man.'' Roscoe Conkling, the sarcastic voice of New York finance, famously laughed off a crusading editor as a ''man milliner.'' 
 And, of course, there was corruption, the unending outrage of money- in-politics. Both parties bid for the favor of big business, and both did a considerable amount of business themselves, as the roll call of forgotten scandals attests: the Whiskey Ring, the Post Office Ring, the Credit Mobilier scheme, and the Grant administration's ceaseless ''saturnalia of plunder.'' But ''The Politicos'' is not merely a catalog of money-in-politics, it is a study of the logic and development of money-in-politics, from the crude grasping of the ''spoilsmen'' in the 1860's to the final union of politics with business in the 1890's, when industries and even individual corporations effectively sent their own representatives to the United States Senate.
 Matthew Josephson was a man of the left, but ''The Politicos'' is not a reassuring tale of liberal triumph. The figure who towers over this dialectic of graft as it roars to its consummation is the greatest of 19th-century political commanders, the industrialist Mark Hanna, who managed the 1896 presidential campaign of William McKinley. Hanna was famously quoted as saying openly what his contemporaries would say only privately: that we were ruled by ''a business state,'' and that ''all questions of government in a democracy were questions of money.'' 
 When confronted by a groundswell for the earnest reformer William Jennings Bryan, Hanna used every weapon available to make an example of the upstart. While his lieutenants portrayed Bryan as an anarchist, Hanna enlisted the financial support of industry for McKinley, going so far as to levy an assessment on the capital of large corporations. He may not have rewarded his supporters with honorifics like ''Pioneer'' and ''Ranger,'' as did his modern disciple Karl Rove, but by the end of the contest Hanna had outspent Bryan by 10 to 1, much of it on ''floaters'' compensated for their votes. 
 Hanna's methods were corrupt, yes. ''But his corruption was rational,'' Josephson tells us. ''It flowed from the very nature of our society and its laws.''
 And as we scratch our heads over all the shocking stories of the last six years we would do well to keep Josephson's dictum in mind. These are not tales of individual venality, separate one from the other. They are expressions of the age. The issue is not merely corruption; it is what old Will Bryan would have called plutocracy.

HEADLINE: Sell the Tiger to Save It

BYLINE: By Barun Mitra. 
Barun Mitra is the director of Liberty Institute, a research organization that promotes free-market economics.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
WHICH country is thinking about applying free-market principles to wildlife preservation and, in the process, improving the survival chances of a long-endangered species while giving its economy a boost? 
 Communist China, of course.
China joined the international effort to protect the tiger in 1993. But today there is a growing recognition among many Chinese officials that a policy of prohibition and trade restrictions has not benefited the tiger as much as it has helped poachers and smugglers of tigers and tiger parts. 
 Conservationists say the worldwide illegal trade in forest products and wildlife is between $10 billion and $12 billion, with more than half of that coming from Asia. 
 Of the planet's estimated 5,000 wild tigers, about 75 percent are in India, which, like most nations, believes that commerce and conservation are incompatible. Only a relative handful of tigers -- probably a few dozen -- can be found in China's forests. (The United States is home to some 10,000 tigers, owned by zoos and private citizens.) The tiger, in short, is still staring at extinction.
 But like forests, animals are renewable resources. If you think of tigers as products, it becomes clear that demand provides opportunity, rather than posing a threat. For instance, there are perhaps 1.5 billion head of cattle and buffalo and 2 billion goats and sheep in the world today. These are among the most exploited of animals, yet they are not in danger of dying out; there is incentive, in these instances, for humans to conserve.
 So it can be for the tiger. In pragmatic terms, this is an extremely valuable animal. Given the growing popularity of traditional Chinese medicines, which make use of everything from tiger claws (to treat insomnia) to tiger fat (leprosy and rheumatism), and the prices this kind of harvesting can bring (as much as $20 for claws, and $20,000 for a skin), the tiger can in effect pay for its own survival. A single farmed specimen might fetch as much as $40,000; the retail value of all the tiger products might be three to five times that amount. 
 Yet for the last 30 or so years, the tiger has been priced at zero, while millions of dollars have been spent to protect it and prohibit trade that might in fact help save the species. Despite the growing environmental bureaucracy and budgets, and despite the proliferation of conservationists and conferences, the tiger is as close to extinction as it has been since Project Tiger, a conservation project backed in part by the World Wildlife Fund, was launched in 1972 and adopted by the government of India a year later. 
 If we truly value the tiger, this crisis presents an opportunity to help it buy its way out of the extinction it now faces. The tiger breeds easily, even in captivity; zoos in India are constantly told by the Central Zoo Authority not to breed tigers because they are expensive to maintain. In China, which has about 4,000 tigers in captivity, breeding has been perfected. According to senior officials I met in China, given a free hand, the country could produce 100,000 tigers in the next 10 to 15 years.
 (Disclosure: I have been writing on tiger conservation for more than 10 years, and over the course of that time have suggested using the power of commerce to save the tiger. Earlier this year, I was invited by the State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China as part of an international group to learn about the Chinese perspective on the issue; the agency paid for my airfare and accommodations.) 
 Wildlife farming and ranching could potentially break the poverty trap that most forest villagers find themselves in. In Zimbabwe, before the current spiral into chaos, villagers had property rights on the wildlife in the forests around them, and they earned revenue by selling a limited number of hunting licenses. They had a stake. 
 At present there is no incentive for forest dwellers to protect tigers, and so poachers, traffickers and unscrupulous traders prevail. The temptation of high profits, in turn, attracts organized crime; this is what happens when government regulations subvert the law of supply and demand. 
 But tiger-breeding facilities will ensure a supply of wildlife at an affordable price, and so eliminate the incentive for poachers and, consequently, the danger for those tigers left in the wild. With selective breeding and the development of reintroduction techniques, it might be possible to return the tiger to some of its remaining natural habitats. And by recognizing the rights of the local villagers to earn legitimate revenue from wildlife sources, the tiger could stage a comeback.
 Market economics greatly favor the tiger. If China decides to unleash the tiger's commercial potential, the king of the forest might be more secure in his kingdom.

HEADLINE: A Public Rebuilding Downtown

 BODY:
Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, New York state and city officials established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation to do what everyone knew would be a thankless job -- finding a master plan for the still-smoking World Trade Center site. The group had to deal with all the competing groups and their powerful emotions and their powerful interests. And it had to move forward -- publicly -- to start rebuilding. Now, with construction crews finally starting to work, those officials are ready to dismantle the corporation. And that raises the disturbing question of who's in charge. 
 The corporation, a stellar group of downtown leaders, did not do everything we hoped for over these last five years. Not all of that was its fault. Gov. George Pataki, retreating in the face of a few very verbal critics, overruled the corporation's desire to establish a museum to celebrate freedom.
 But the corporation has been a force for some of the better and most public planning at Ground Zero. When it disappears, who watches over the master plan to make certain the site works harmoniously? And even more important, where does the public go for a voice in the rebuilding? The answer is to a private developer and also to City Hall and then to Albany, and after that a few government authorities and then a memorial foundation designed to operate like a private organization. It sounds like a recipe for secrecy when openness should be fundamental.
 When the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation was formed, with John Whitehead as its leader, it took control of $2.8 billion. Most of that has been spent for development, the memorial and community projects. One extra large grant of $250 million goes to the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. That is almost half of the cost of the memorial, and that much public money demands public accountability. The public should know about any change in the design or mission, and revisions must not be done quietly by a small group of insiders.
 It is not clear yet what really replaces the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Eliot Spitzer, the leading candidate for governor, has applauded its disappearance and promised, if elected, to help put a new ''structure in place that provides the skills, leadership and accountability we need.'' That sounds right. It also sounds a lot like the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.

HEADLINE: Joel Harnett, 80, Leader of Watchdog Group 

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Joel W. Harnett, a businessman and civic watchdog who finished last in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City in 1977, but fueled debate by helping to force the release of a federal investigative report on questionable financial manipulations by city leaders, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Phoenix. He was 80. 
 The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Lila.
Mr. Harnett, who resigned as chairman of the City Club of New York, a government watchdog group, to run for office, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission to release a report that the commission contended was not yet finished. After a Manhattan federal judge began looking into the evidence, the commission released the report.
 It essentially said that Mayor Abraham D. Beame had deceived the public about the city's perilous financial condition while it was selling a record number of securities to unsuspecting investors. The document drew a storm of caustic comment from Mayor Beame's six challengers.
 The primary campaign ended with Edward I. Koch, then a congressman, winning the Democratic mayoral nomination; Mario M. Cuomo, then lieutenant governor, finishing second, and Mr. Beame third. Mr. Harnett was last in the seven-person race.
 Mr. Harnett focused on economic issues in his campaign, emphasizing a need to cut taxes to remain competitive with other cities and states. A marketing executive at Look magazine himself, he argued that the city needed to sell itself better.
 Joel William Harnett was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the Seagate community on Coney Island. He graduated in 1945 from the University of Richmond, in Virginia, majoring in history and earning Phi Beta Kappa honors.
 He worked for Look for 20 years. As vice president for marketing and sales promotion, he came up with ways of focusing advertising on more affluent areas so makers of luxury goods could reach the rarefied audience they wanted, rather than all of Look's 8 million readers.
 Mr. Harnett then started his own company, Media Horizons Inc., which owned radio stations and specialized in publishing magazines directed to readers who market and advertise disparate products. They included Home Video, Law Enforcement Communications and Biomedical Communications.
 While in business, he also addressed civic issues, first as a member of the City Club, then as its chairman. One of his consistent themes was the need for economic efficiency in city government. He also fought against plans for Westway, a superhighway planned along the Hudson River in Manhattan, and the Second Avenue Subway, arguing that both were unnecessary.
 He joined Jacqueline Onassis and others to fight for landmark status for Grand Central Terminal and criticized the power of municipal labor unions.
 In 1979, Mr. Harnett and his wife moved to Phoenix, where he became involved in the Valley Citizens League, a nonpartisan civic group. He and his wife started Phoenix Home and Garden, an upscale magazine that featured tips on growing plants in a desert climate.
 The couple collected art and made large donations to museums. They gave money for galleries at the Phoenix Art Museum and at the Heard Museum in Phoenix. The University of Richmond named its art museum for them.
 Mr. Harnett wrote and published several of his own books, including the forthcoming ''The Devil's Own Politics: The Explosive Political Rise and Fall of the Evangelical Movement.'' He was a retired major in the Army Reserve.
 In addition to his wife, he is survived by his brother, Bertram.


CORRECTION-DATE: August 17, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Tuesday about Joel W. Harnett, a civic watchdog and businessman who sought the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York in 1977, misidentified the office held at that time by another candidate, Mario M. Cuomo. (Both men lost to Edward I. Koch.) Mr. Cuomo was secretary of state, not lieutenant governor.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Cuomo Tries To Block Rival's Tv Ads 

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo, a candidate for attorney general, asked New York television stations yesterday to refuse to broadcast a new political commercial by Mark Green, one of his rivals for the Democratic nomination in the Sept. 12 primary. The commercial highlights Mr. Green's efforts to fight under-age smoking, and then makes the following charge, ''When Andrew Cuomo was housing secretary, his agency gave Indian reservations $4 million to build discount smoke shops.'' In a letter to stations, Mr. Cuomo's spokeswoman said that as housing secretary during the Clinton administration, he did not have the power to restrict economic development grants to nontobacco purposes. The letter also noted that he later supported a bill to prohibit such use of the funds. But the Green campaign said that he could have denied the grant requests in the first place, and that the Department of Housing and Urban Development approved those grants while rejecting other financial aid requests for some American Indian health clinics and community centers.

HEADLINE: End Welfare Lite As We Know It

BYLINE: By Douglas J. Besharov. 
Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It's been nearly 10 years since President Bill Clinton signed the landmark 1996 welfare reform law. The anniversary has been the occasion for various news stories and opinion pieces, most of them praising the law's success in reducing welfare dependency. 
 And it's true: welfare caseloads have fallen an astounding 60 percent since reform efforts began. But even as a strong supporter of welfare reform, I find it difficult to muster unqualified enthusiasm for the law and how it has been carried out. 
In the years immediately before the law's passage, welfare dependency seemed out of control. From 1989 to 1994, for example, caseloads rose 34 percent. Analysts argued over how much to blame the weak economy; worsening social problems, primarily out-of-wedlock births and drug addiction; and lax agency administration. But few claimed that another 1.3 million people on welfare was a good thing.
 Responding to the growing concern, Mr. Clinton campaigned for president on a promise to ''end welfare as we know it.'' But he had in mind something far different from what the Republicans handed him in 1996. Nevertheless, he signed the legislation that ended the welfare entitlement and gave states wide discretion, as long as they put 50 percent of recipients in work-related activities and imposed a five-year limit on financial aid.
 Many feared a social calamity. But in the years since, although researchers have strived mightily, they've found only small pockets of additional hardship. Even better, the earnings of most single mothers actually rose.
 These twin realities -- decreased caseloads and little sign of serious additional hardship -- are why both Republicans and Democrats think welfare reform has been a success. 
 But the results are more mixed. Caseloads fell, yet they did so seemingly regardless of what actions the states took. They fell in states with strong work-first requirements, and those without them; in states with mandatory work programs, and those without them; in states with job training programs, and those without them; and in states with generous child care subsidies, and those without them. 
 In fact, the consensus among academic researchers is that it took more than welfare reform to end welfare as we knew it. If one looks at all the studies, the most reasonable conclusion is that although welfare reform was an important factor in caseload reduction -- accounting for 25 percent to 35 percent of the decline -- the strong economy was probably more important (35 percent to 45 percent). Expanded aid to low-income, working families, primarily through the Earned Income Tax Credit, was almost as important (20 percent to 30 percent). 
 What's more, the best estimates are that only about 40 percent to 50 percent of mothers who left welfare have steady, full-time jobs. Another 15 percent or so work part time. According to surveys in various states, these mothers are earning about $8 an hour. That's about $16,000 a year for full-time employment. It is their story that the supporters of welfare reform celebrate, but $16,000 is not a lot of money, especially for a mother with two children. 
 What about the other 50 percent of families who left welfare? Well, some mothers did not ''need'' welfare, perhaps because they were living with parents or a boyfriend, and some left because of intense pressure from caseworkers. More troubling, about a quarter of those who leave welfare return to the program, with many cycling in and out as they face temporary ups and downs.
 In addition, when they're off welfare, some of these families survive only because they still receive government assistance -- through food stamps (an average of more than $2,500), the Women, Infants and Children program (about $1,800 for infants and new mothers), Supplemental Security Income (an average of over $6,500), or housing aid (an average of $6,000). Their children also qualify for Medicaid. In reality, these families are still on welfare because they are still receiving benefits and not working -- call it ''welfare lite.''
 So, yes, welfare reform reduced welfare dependency, but not as much as suggested by the political rhetoric, and a great deal of dependency is now diffused and hidden within larger social welfare programs. 
 As a result, public and political concern about dependency has largely disappeared. 
 The tougher work and participation requirements added in this year's reauthorization of the law could help states address the deeper needs of welfare families. But many states are already planning to avoid these new strictures with various administrative gimmicks, like placing the most troubled and disorganized families in state-financed programs where federal rules do not apply. This would only further obscure the high levels of continuing dependency.
 For now, welfare reform deserves only two cheers. Not bad for a historic change in policy, but not good enough for us to be even close to satisfied.

HEADLINE: An Imperfect Institution, but Consider the Alternative

BYLINE: By STEPHEN SCHLESINGER. 
Stephen Schlesinger, former director of the World Policy Institute, is on leave from the New School. He is the author of ''Act of Creation,'' about the founding of the United Nations.

 BODY:

The Parliament of Man
The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations
By Paul Kennedy
361 pages. Random House. $26.95.
 The United Nations has traversed some rough waters over the last half-decade. It has dealt with unrelenting abuse from American right-wingers; the unilateralism of its largest donor, the United States; an abortive internal reform movement; sexual and financial scandals; restlessness among third world nations; a chronic lack of resources; the incurable poverty of some two billion inhabitants of Earth; and other ills. Given this distressing record, what could possibly be its value today? Now comes a retelling of the United Nations story to remind us why it remains a necessary organization.
 Paul Kennedy, Yale's eminent historian, author of the acclaimed work ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' has compiled an artful study of the United Nations from its birth to the present day that helps to set the record straight. Mr. Kennedy's reach is considerable. In an authoritative style he examines the evolution of the variegated missions of the organization over the last 60 years, including its charter, the Security Council, the secretary general, peacekeeping and war making, as well as the body's economic and social roles, its involvement in human rights, proposals for reform and its future. 
 Mr. Kennedy reminds us that the organization had its beginnings with two presidents of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. As World War II was winding down, these two men sought to invent a security body based not on ''coalitions of the willing'' but on the credo of ''collective security'' to guarantee peace around the planet. Learning from the failures of the League of Nations, but equally concerned with national sovereignty, they admixed idealism and realism in drafting the United Nations Charter. 
 In San Francisco in the spring of 1945, together with leaders from 49 other nations, the Americans established a General Assembly where every state has an equal vote: a tip toward idealism. They also set up a Security Council, whose edicts on war and peace are obligatory for all members and on which sit five permanent members, the nations considered the most powerful in 1945 (the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France), as the sole holders of the veto: a reflection of realism. 
 But as the postwar years unfolded, the United Nations' central task, to stymie aggression, quickly withered as a consequence of the cold war stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Security Council. Still, as Mr. Kennedy points out, ''there are in practice many U.N.'s.'' And in fact, during this period, many others did come to the fore. 
 There was, for example, the United Nations of the secretary generals, who soon achieved fame for settling disputes as neutral mediators. There was the United Nations of peacekeeping, often a messy and expensive process, but one that has since proven indispensable to world security and has broadened to encompass nation building, election monitoring and constitution writing. There was the United Nations of poverty alleviation -- still a responsibility. There was the United Nations of ''soft power,'' dealing with women, children, the environment, health, refugees, human rights, culture and law. And subsequently, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, there was the re-emergence of the Security Council. All these mini-United Nations have had mixed records, as Mr. Kennedy admits. But his point is, consider the alternative. 
 There are some weaknesses in Mr. Kennedy's argument. The very title of his book, ''The Parliament of Man'' -- a line borrowed from a poem by Tennyson, ''Locksley Hall'' -- gives a false impression of the organization. As a metaphor for worldwide community, it may be apt. But the United Nations is neither a legislature nor a world government nor even a democratic organization, which Mr. Kennedy concedes. It is a collection of states, some with freely elected rulers, some authoritarian, who appoint representatives to decide what the United Nations can or cannot do. It is simply a mirror of its members. 
 Another downside of Mr. Kennedy's work is that his text sometimes reads as if it were lifted from The World Almanac. His pages of litanies of United Nations activities are dry, despite his best efforts to breathe color and pizzazz into them, and he barely mentions the organization's recent derelictions. 
 Still, his assemblage of data is extraordinary. What becomes clear is that the United Nations does indeed cover the daily life of the planet. Practically every human problem that one can imagine has been addressed by this oft-beleaguered body. Thus, while its doings may not lend themselves to dramatic narrative, what it accomplishes as an organization is dramatic. But how does one get the message out to people -- especially to a sometimes hostile United States Congress -- that the United Nations is useful?
 Mr. Kennedy's closing chapter and his afterword explain what makes it so. He illuminates a myriad of proposals for change and presents his own eloquent brief for the United Nations' existence. He views the organization as an uninterrupted town meeting of the world that lays down the rules for how we can live with one another on our small planet. 
 At one point Mr. Kennedy cites Truman's ''brilliant'' address in San Francisco as a remarkable defense of the United Nations. In this speech Truman summed up the challenge for Americans, reminding those who distrusted global involvement: ''If any nation would keep security for itself, it must be ready and willing to share security with all. That is the price which each nation will have to pay for world peace. Unless we are willing to pay that price, no organization for world peace can accomplish its purpose. And what a reasonable price that is.''

HEADLINE: Pickles, Pies and Blue-Ribbon Biscotti

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
THE corn dogs are coming. From Clackamas County in Oregon to the Iowa State Fair, already in full swing, to the Champlain Valley in Vermont, hundreds of state and county fairs will take place between now and Labor Day. Fairgoers will plan their days around lemonade, funnel cakes and pork chops on a stick. 
 But they may not find the jars of apple butter and the pickled peaches that their grandparents admired.
 Cooking competitions still thrive on the nation's fairgrounds despite declining overall attendance at fairs. New contestants of all ages and more men are venturing into the fray, and cash prizes are bigger than ever. But some traditional skills, like canning vegetables and preserving meat, are falling away. 
 Taking their place are ambitious new categories, like ones for bagels and biscotti, that would have surprised fairgoers a generation ago. Summoning skills they did not need before, judges in Iowa are critiquing ostrich entrees this week alongside the apple pies and the pork barbecue they have long encountered. 
 ''Cooking and gardening are almost hobbies now, not necessary for survival as they were when the fairs began,'' said Diane Roupe, a longtime judge at the Iowa fair. ''But the spirit is just as competitive as it always has been.'' 
 Eileen Gannon, a senior financial consultant for Smith Barney in Des Moines, has won more than 140 ribbons over the last 20 years at the Iowa fair, including last Thursday's victory for honey from her beehives. She said new competitors flock to the fair now that cooking has lost its stigma as women's work, a reputation it had in the early years of the feminist movement. 
 ''Fifteen years ago I felt like I had to hide my fair work from the office because it would compromise my professional image, but now I send the extra cakes to my clients,'' she said. ''There is so much more respect for these domestic arts than there was 15 years ago.''
 To draw men into the fray, many fairs have opened men-only baking divisions. 
 ''We learned that men wanted to enter in baking but were intimidated by the skills of the regular competitors,'' said Lyn Jarvis, culinary supervisor of the Champlain Valley Fair in Vermont, which offered its first men-only contest in 1990. ''Now they are winning best in show ribbons.'' (The Champlain Valley Fair will be held in Essex Junction, Vt., Aug. 26 through Sept. 4.)
 Guy-friendly cooking contests have also begun padding the entertainment schedule at many fairs. Formal judging of canned and baked goods often takes place out of the spotlight, or before a fair begins, but chicken wing cook-offs and barbecue contests have been accepted as spectator sports. 
 Next weekend the Dutchess County Fair, which begins on Tuesday and ends on Aug. 27 in Rhinebeck, N.Y., will pit local firefighters against the county sheriff's department in a hugely popular ''Iron Chef''-style cooking contest. (The secret ingredient is locally grown, like apples or corn.)
 And sponsors like King Arthur Flour, Hershey's cocoa and Vlasic pickles are adopting bigger chunks of the competition, pushing up the prize money: last week Tone Brothers, the spice producer in Ankeny, Iowa, awarded $3,000 for the best cinnamon roll at the Iowa State Fair to Marianne Carlson of Jefferson, Iowa. This year's overall prize money in the food division is $55,000, the most it has ever been. 
 The Iowa fair's food competition is the biggest one in the country. But the changes are playing out at smaller fairs as well. 
 Anne Murray has won three best in show ribbons at the Dutchess County Fair in New York. She has a Ph.D. in engineering and works long hours at I.B.M. in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Having won her first time out with an apricot-filled yeast bread, she said she found the ribbons ''addictive'' and now competes every year. Ms. Murray grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, without much connection to farming. ''But my mother made her own jam, and once you taste that you can't go back,'' she said. ''A lot of people don't get that experience anymore.''
 Many of the serious competitors are only a generation or two removed from working farms. Sue Silkworth, a teacher in Poughkeepsie, in Dutchess County, grows much of the fruit for her winning preserves, like her blueberry basil and five-spice rhubarb jams, in a huge kitchen garden rimmed with grapevines that has been in her family for generations. And Jay Trapp, an architect and repeat winner for breads at the same fair, grew up in farm country in South Carolina, ''shelling butter beans in front of the television every night,'' he said. ''That food was made with care -- I won't say love because it sounds too schmaltzy -- and it did taste different.''
 Herb Eckhouse, another Iowa native, also sees the fair as a part of a bigger picture: the regeneration of American respect for flavor. ''Before Iowa had all this artisanal goat cheese and fancy grass-fed beef and organic dairy, these fairs were already about the bounty of the land and about craftsmanship,'' he said.
 Mr. Eckhouse returned to the state in 2004 after spending three years in Parma, Italy, learning to cure prosciutto and pancetta. His company, La Quercia, is sponsoring a contest at the fair. First prize is half a prosciutto, he said. ''As hard as McDonald's tries to push us out of the kitchen, and although this country produces ever greater quantities of undistinguished food, people are waking up to the fact that a lot of our food just doesn't taste good,'' he said.
 The competitors themselves, wherever they stand on American agricultural policy, are in it for the ribbons. ''Competing at the fair is like cooking for a dinner party,'' Ms. Gannon said. ''It's nice to cook for yourself, but isn't it more fun to show people what you can do?''
 Having fun is easy; winning is hard. Serious competitors spend hours poring over the exhibitors' handbooks, creating elaborate strategies and second-guessing their rivals and the judges. ''You want to look for categories that the regulars might not enter,'' said Terry Jannuzzo, whose chocolate-apricot truffles won a best in class ribbon for candy at Dutchess. ''I'm afraid I'll never win best in show because my pie crusts aren't good enough, and it's almost always a pie that wins,'' she said, sighing. ''The judges love pie.''
 In the more rigorous programs, judges are still home economics teachers or food science faculty members; elsewhere, local television hosts or restaurant owners fill in. Although some fairs have relaxed their standards in the face of declining entries, many judges see themselves as the standard-bearers for all-natural, top-quality, handmade food in America. ''These fairs began as education for farmers and farm wives, and we try to honor what they did,'' said Ms. Roupe, who has been Iowa's head canning judge since 2004. (She won 99 ribbons as a competitor before she began judging.)
 Most exhibitors' handbooks still prohibit shortcuts like graham cracker pie crusts, cake mixes and bread machines, and the Missouri State Fair provides specific written standards that competitors should aspire to. Cakes ''should be light, with fine, even texture, moist and velvety but not sticky.'' For yeast breads, ''flavor should be pleasant with bland nutlike flavor.'' 
 Cathy Poluzzi, co-chairwoman of the food competition at the Dutchess fair, sees herself as a gatekeeper and a den mother, fielding calls from frantic bakers and novice canners throughout the year. ''Canning is the hardest thing to learn from a book, and the women who really knew how to do it are all gone,'' shesaid. ''The new ones don't even know how to choose a peach that won't turn to mush, poor things.''
 On Saturday this year's competitors will drop off their entries and leave them to the tender mercies of the judges, who will deliberate behind closed doors. Ms. Poluzzi's judges are held to a high standard: instead of awarding ribbons, they must give a written critique of each entry that will help competitors correct their mistakes. Overbeating is a common problem, she said, and ''check your oven temperature'' is the most common critique.
 Ms. Poluzzi, according to those who compete under her, is tough but impartial, and unswayed by frills. Her rules prohibit decorative hats on jars of canned food, cookies more than three inches in diameter and all postbaking toppings, like frostings, glazes and even a dusting of confectioners' sugar. 
 ''Oh, yes,'' she said. ''People try to hide a multitude of sins with icing.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally As Inflation Eases Off

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Wall Street rallied yesterday after a government report showing inflation softening at the wholesale level encouraged hopes among investors that the Federal Reserve might be able to avoid further interest rate increases. 
 The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at its highest point in two and a half months and the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index jumped 2.2 percent, to just over 2,115 points.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that prices for goods leaving the factory grew in July at the slowest rate in more than a year. But several analysts questioned whether the slowdown was anything more than a statistical blip, raising the possibility that the consumer price report to be released today could send a different signal. 
 Investors were so cheered by the unexpected slowdown in producer price inflation that they kicked off a surge in stock prices at the opening of the market and, further encouraged by robust earnings reports, kept it going as the day went on.
 The Labor Department's index of producer prices, which measures what manufacturers charge for goods ready for sale, rose a slight 0.1 percent last month, down from 0.5 percent in June. At the same time, the core measure of inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, fell 0.3 percent, its first decline since last October. 
 Taken together, both figures pointed to the possibility that inflation pressures were easing.
 If inflation is on the verge of retreating, the Fed's job will be much easier, allowing it to avoid additional increases in interest rates that might threaten to put the brakes on economic growth. In leaving interest rates untouched for the first time in two years, the Fed's policy-setting committee said last week that it expected inflation would be tempered as the economy slowed naturally. 
 But many economists argued that the numbers could be presenting a distorted picture of inflation. The pace of wholesale price increases last month was held in check largely by falling auto prices, and there were signs in the data that prices are rising in the early phases of manufacturing.
 ''In terms of what it actually tells us about overall inflation, I'm not sure it's all that important,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. 
 Ethan Harris, chief United States economist with Lehman Brothers, said, ''It looks to us like this is a fluke.''
 The figures surprised economists, who had generally forecast a larger gain in the overall index and a rise in the core index.
 With opinion divided on yesterday's report, attention will shift to the Labor Department's more important measure of consumer prices, which includes services as well as goods. While overall prices in June probably continued to advance, analysts said the core Consumer Price Index might not show much change.
 Producer prices in July fell in numerous categories, but were particularly weighed down by lower vehicle prices, reflecting heavy discounting by American automakers. Passenger car prices fell 0.8 percent. Prices of light trucks, including sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, dropped 3.1 percent. 
 Food prices also fell widely. Egg prices were down 26.1 percent, processed turkeys fell 3.9 percent and shellfish fell 9.1 percent.
 The cost of home heating oil also dropped, but gasoline rose.
 What was more troublesome to many economists was the upturn in prices further up the manufacturing chain. So-called intermediate prices, which include everything from refined sugar to plywood to auto parts, rose 0.5 percent, after a 0.7 rise in June. ''There are a lot of pipeline inflation pressures,'' said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist for Barclays Capital. 
 A concern among some economists is that those inflation pressures will not ease unless interest rates rise further and the economy slows sharply enough that unemployment turns up. 
 ''The Fed is basically betting that economic weakness is going to do away with these inflation pressures,'' Mr. Hatzius of Goldman Sachs said. ''I agree, although I think you may actually need more economic weakness than the Fed is anticipating.''
 Many economists expect economic weakness to come in large part from a slowdown in the housing sector. Yesterday, there was further evidence of a softening housing market in a new report from the National Association of Realtors, which said sales of existing homes fell from April through June in 28 states. The decline was led by states once at the top of the housing boom, like Arizona, California and Florida, which all experienced declines of more than 25 percent.
 The National Association of Home Builders also reported yesterday that confidence among builders fell to the lowest level in 15 years.
 And despite the evidence that the housing sector is deteriorating rapidly, investors looked favorably at Home Depot, which yesterday reported profits that topped Wall Street's expectations. Its shares jumped 3.6 percent after the company said it earned $1.86 billion in the second quarter, up from $1.77 billion a year earlier.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: With Its Stock Still Lackluster, G.E. Confronts the Curse of the Conglomerate 

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch

 BODY:
LATE last month, an array of General Electric executives stood before about 100 analysts at an NBC broadcast studio in Rockefeller Center and did something that very few big companies have to do: proved that all of G.E.'s wildly disparate units, whether consumer finance or aircraft engines, march to the same tune.
 The locomotive division showed how G.E. techniques helped it discern that customers wanted to speed up the time between order and delivery, and then to whittle that time down to 10 days from 31.
The consumer finance division showed how it was using the same tools to shorten the 63 days it takes for G.E. to agree to administer a store's private-label credit card. 
 Several other G.E. businesses followed the same drill. And then, lest anyone still miss the point -- that all of these businesses were benefiting from being part of the G.E. machine -- Lloyd G. Trotter, the executive vice president for operations, talked about how the company would use methods like outsourcing to get profit margins up across the board. 
 In a sense, G.E. was preaching to the choir. All but one of the 20 analysts that register their recommendations with Thomson Financial already rate G.E. shares a buy.
 But investors are not heeding the advice. For more than a year, analysts have predicted that the stock would reach $40 or more. Instead, it has hovered around the mid-30's, sometimes rising to $36, more often dropping to $32. 
 ''G.E. has gone through a rigorous portfolio transformation,'' said Deane M. Dray of Goldman Sachs, who has a $40 price target on the shares, ''but the stock just isn't responding to what G.E. does or does not do.'' 
 The problem, said Robert T. Cornell of Lehman Brothers, who is looking for a $43 price, is that ''the market doesn't understand that G.E.'s growth is a function of all of its processes.''
 The company, based in Fairfield, Conn., is striving to change that. For several years, it has used analyst meetings primarily to showcase how specific businesses contribute to its revenue. Now, it has temporarily tabled that approach in favor of one that lays out how G.E. helps its businesses grow, not just the other way around.
 ''We are definitely honing the total G.E. message, trying to make everyone understand how the pieces of G.E. fit together,'' said Keith S. Sherin, the chief financial officer. ''Investors should realize that G.E.'s management spends tons of time focusing on processes to achieve growth.''
 It has certainly tried almost everything else to jump-start its stock. It has sold its insurance operations, excising a source of great unpredictability in its financial results. It has greatly increased sales in China, India and other emerging economies. It has pumped huge amounts of money into fast-growing businesses like fuel-efficient engines, security devices, water quality and consumer finance.
 In December 2004, Jeffrey R. Immelt, its chief executive, promised investors that G.E. would deliver 8 percent growth without acquisitions. And, for the last 18 months, it has done just that.
 But somehow, G.E. cannot wash away the stigma of the conglomerate that dogs almost every diversified industrial company.
 ''G.E. is in so many businesses that it remains one of the hardest companies on the planet for investors to understand,'' said Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has written extensively about G.E. 
 Worse, others say, is the reverse halo effect its diversity causes. Investors tend to judge the company by its weakest link. If NBC falls behind in the ratings, or G.E. Plastics suffers squeezed margins, investors flee. ''There's this perception that G.E. is broken unless every segment is operating at peak efficiency,'' Mr. Dray of Goldman Sachs said. 
 Investors also bridle at buying a pie when all they want is a slice. There is no way to invest in, say, G.E.'s water business without buying into its aircraft engine and commercial finance businesses as well. 
 ''Investors can get in and out of businesses according to the cycle they are in, but G.E. just can't,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management, which does not own the stock.
 G.E. executives do not try to refute this inescapable logic. Instead, they seek to persuade investors, through analysts, that the value of G.E.'s corporate processes more than eclipses any flexibility that single-industry companies can offer investors. 
 ''We need investors,'' Mr. Sherin said, ''to understand that we are an operating company, not a conglomerate that just holds on to businesses.'' 
 To that end, G.E. held a meeting in May that focused on how its research yields technologies that work over a range of disparate businesses -- sensors, say, that do double duty in security systems and medical diagnostic devices. It showed how G.E. was increasing its revenue from high-margin services by cross-selling financing and fleet management and equipment. 
 ''We tried to get investors to understand how much synergy and leverage there is across the portfolio,'' Mr. Sherin said. 
 And last month it concentrated on new techniques like Lean Six Sigma, a process by which each business can streamline methods for processing orders and delivering goods and services. And it introduced Net Promoter Score, a deceptively simple process by which G.E. businesses ask customers if they would recommend G.E. to others. On the basis of their answers, customers are tagged as promoters, neutral or detractors. Subtract detractors from promoters, and that's the score. 
 G.E. also used the meeting to telegraph more subtle signals. Mr. Immelt did not attend, something that Mr. Cornell of Lehman Brothers called a ''missed opportunity to show his C.E.O.-level determination.'' But others said they thought that Mr. Immelt's absence was deliberate. 
 ''They gave us a good glimpse of G.E.'s bench, a sense of how sharp the next generation of G.E. management will be,'' Mr. Dray said. 
 Just as important, Mr. Tichy said, ''it showed that the business leaders are all singing from the same G.E. hymnal.'' (The company's official stance: The meeting last month was held in part to ''showcase the many experienced G.E. business leaders,'' a spokesman, Russell Wilkerson, said.)
 The new approach has not yet given a long-term boost to the stock, although the shares did close up 38 cents yesterday, at $33.20.
 Investors remain optimistic. ''G.E. is doing nothing wrong,'' said William H. Miller III, chairman of Legg Mason Capital Management, which owned more than three million G.E. shares as of June 30. ''G.E. will perform quite well over the next five years, as its consistent earnings and dividend growth recapture the market's attention.''

PERSON: Alice Stone Ilchman

HEADLINE: Alice S. Ilchman, 71, Economist Who Headed Sarah Lawrence

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Alice Stone Ilchman, an economist and political scientist who was president of Sarah Lawrence College for nearly 20 years, died on Friday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 71. 
 The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said Judith Schwartzstein, a spokeswoman for the college, which is in Bronxville.
The eighth president of Sarah Lawrence, Ms. Ilchman (pronounced ILTSCH-man) was also its longest serving, holding the post from 1981 until 1998. She was previously an assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in the administration of President Jimmy Carter.
 At her death, Ms. Ilchman was the director of the Jeannette K. Watson Fellowship of the Thomas J. Watson Foundation. From 1995 to 2000, she was chairwoman of the Rockefeller Foundation.
 Alice Stone was born in Cincinnati on April 18, 1935. Her father, Donald Crawford Stone, was an educator and federal planner in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations. She earned a bachelor's degree from Mount Holyoke in 1957; a master's from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1958; and a Ph.D. from the London School of Economics in 1965. She married Warren F. Ilchman in 1960.
 After earning her doctorate, Ms. Ilchman directed the Peace Corps training program for India and taught at the University of California, Berkeley. She later taught economics at Wellesley, where she was Dean of the College 
 During Ms. Ilchman's tenure at Sarah Lawrence, the college's endowment grew from $3 million to $30 million. She oversaw the construction of two new buildings, including a science center, which was named for her this May.
 Besides her husband, a former president of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn who is now the director of the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans, Ms. Ilchman is survived by a son, Frederick, of Boston; a daughter, Sarah Hollinger of New York; two sisters, Nancy Dickinson of Indianapolis and Elizabeth Stone of Los Angeles; and a brother, Donald C. Stone Jr. of Oakland, Calif.

HEADLINE: New York Area Is a Magnet For Graduates 

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
These days, it seems, you need a college degree just to live in or around New York City.
 Almost 5 million people over the age of 25 in the New York metropolitan area -- more than a third of the region's population -- had at least a bachelor's degree in 2005, according to the latest data from the Census Bureau. In Manhattan, nearly three out of five residents were college graduates and one out of four had advanced degrees, forming one of the highest concentrations of highly educated people in any American city.
 The degree-holders are rapidly displacing the dropouts, a trend that may help reduce the demand for social services and drive down crime rates. But the trend also worries some sociologists who say it is evidence that lower-income residents are being pushed out. 
 Between 2000 and 2005, the number of people in the metropolitan area over 25 who had not finished high school declined by 520,000, a drop of almost 20 percent. During the same period, the number of college graduates in the region rose by almost 700,000. 
 ''These numbers are startling,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College of the City University of New York. ''It means the labor force in New York is becoming much more educated.''
 Mr. Beveridge said the statistics also portended that the next set of census numbers, which are due in two weeks, will reveal a widening gap between rich and poor in the city. ''If a big chunk of the labor force has become more educated, we can expect even more income inequality,'' he said.
 Pedro A. Noguera, a sociologist at New York University and the director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, said many New Yorkers would see the growing ranks of college graduates among them as a positive development that could ease the burdens on city services and lead to a lower crime rate.
 ''But unfortunately, it's more likely to mean that it's increasingly difficult for poor people without college degrees,'' he said. ''Affordable housing is not as available. The people who make the city work, who do the hard work in the city -- the waiters and janitors -- are not going to be able to live in the city.'' 
 Mr. Noguera said the trend was not confined to New York. ''Certain cities have become extremely attractive to affluent people,'' he said, citing San Francisco and Seattle as others. 
 But according to the latest data, which comes from the 2005 American Community Survey, college graduates are flocking to New York City at a faster pace. 
 Many of the city's new arrivals, including immigrants, have college educations, Mr. Beveridge said. And many of the residents who have died or retired and moved away had never finished high school, he said.
 The rise in the ranks of the college-educated in the city is a blend of college graduates moving in to take high-paying jobs and residents obtaining degrees, said Joseph Salvo, director of the population division of the Department of City Planning. He noted that enrollment at the City University of New York had increased to 218,000 students in 2004, up about 12 percent from 2000. 
 From 2000 to 2005, the number of New York City residents with at least a bachelor's degree increased by about 285,000, a gain equal to the total number of college-educated people in San Francisco. During that period, the share of New Yorkers with a college degree rose to 32.2 percent from 26 percent, ranking New York fourth among the biggest American cities. 
 All parts of New York City became more educated, but Manhattan and Brooklyn stood out. In Manhattan, more than 57 percent of all residents had at least a bachelor's degree, up from 50 percent in 2000. 
 That concentration ranked Manhattan first among counties with more than 1 million residents and seventh among all counties.
 Brooklyn is becoming educated even faster. Since 2000, the number of college graduates there has risen by about 80,000, or 24 percent, while residents without a high-school diploma have declined by about 110,000, a 24 percent decline.
 Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, said that Brooklyn was seeing immigrants and young professionals flood in and that a home there ''is becoming less attainable for people that don't have their college degree or more.''
 He cited the continuing loss of manufacturing jobs and the shortage of affordable housing in the borough as factors fueling the change.
 ''We need those jobs too,'' he said. ''There will always be those who for whatever reason cannot attain high school or college education. There has to be room for them, too.''
 But Mr. Markowitz also attributed the changes in Brooklyn to a wave of Chinese immigrants for whom ''education is the center of their lives'' and ''an influx of residents from Manhattan and from across the country where Brooklyn is considered chic.''
 New arrivals with college degrees say the city has become a more attractive place to start careers.
 Jennifer Becker, 26, lived in Virginia after graduating from the University of Virginia, but moved to Manhattan last year when her husband, Christian, joined a law firm in the city.
 ''Part of it was just to be in the big city,'' said Ms. Becker, the executive director of the university's alumni club in New York. ''I think people tend to come here for a few years and then move somewhere else.''
 From the University of Virginia, for example, about 120 graduates head to New York to live each spring, up from about 75 just five years ago, said Carol Wood, assistant vice president for university relations. ''We're definitely seeing a lot of young grads come up here for jobs right after school,'' Ms. Becker said.

HEADLINE: Inexperienced but Trained 

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DURING her final days as principal of Public School 7 in the Bronx late last month, Dita Wolf cleaned out her desk. She came upon a snapshot of herself dressed up for the school's Storybook Day as the title character in ''Casey at the Bat.'' She found a photo of Pete Seeger from the time he visited. And after she had emptied out all the other artifacts, there remained in the bottom left drawer a hammer and wrench.
 She had discovered them in the same place on the day she took over as principal in September 1998. Her predecessor, Milton Fein, had left them, partly because they had come in handy for hanging pictures and fixing the movie projector, and partly as a material symbol of all else he had given Ms. Wolf.
Mr. Fein had attended P.S. 7 himself as a boy and gone on to serve as its principal for 27 years. For nearly half of them, Ms. Wolf worked there as a teacher, librarian, assistant principal and heir apparent. Through the perpetually open door of his office, from which he routinely summoned Ms. Wolf with the shout, ''Hey, Dita,'' Mr. Fein had taught her budgeting and grant writing, scheduling and programming, and also the more undefined knack of becoming a fixture in the Kingsbridge neighborhood. 
 In her years heading P.S. 7, whose student body is 97 percent nonwhite and 83 percent low-income, Ms. Wolf steadily raised scores on citywide reading and math tests. P.S. 7 outperformed schools with similar racial and economic profiles. It also, in a way statistics cannot convey, offered an unusually rich arts program, turning every corridor into a gallery of student work.
 Now Ms. Wolf has passed the mantle to an incoming principal almost exactly half her age -- 28 to Ms. Wolf's 55. Renee Cloutier, the successor, has taught for four years and been an assistant principal for nine months. She does not yet have a master's degree. What she does have by way of pedigree is graduation from the Department of Education's Leadership Academy, which groomed her during the past year.
 The divide between Ms. Wolf and Ms. Cloutier is more than simply generational. It vividly illustrates a radical change in the nature of educational leadership in New York's public schools. The success or failure of that change remains to be seen; the policy certainly rates as one of the biggest gambles of Joel I. Klein's tenure as chancellor.
 Ms. Wolf embodied the traditional way of becoming a principal, rising gradually up the career ladder and being either formally or informally trained by a mentor. Ms. Cloutier typifies the new approach of fast-tracking promising candidates into positions of authority. More than a third of her classmates in the Leadership Academy had taught for five years or less, and barely a fourth had been an assistant principal.
 The upheaval in New York's corps of 1,451 principals -- more than half have resigned or retired in five years -- cannot be laid entirely to Mr. Klein and his approach. Higher salaries in the suburbs, periodic buyout offers and protracted periods without a new contract have all contributed to the current situation. 
 The method of filling those vacancies, however, has been markedly altered under Mr. Klein. As chancellor, he jettisoned the so-called Distinguished Faculty program, which used veteran or newly retired principals to nurture newly appointed ones. The Distinguished Faculty program, which reached 500 principals for a total cost of $1.5 million, was replaced by the $70-million Leadership Academy, which drew much of its curriculum from corporate management training. The academy's first leader, Robert E. Knowling Jr., had most recently demonstrated his leadership skills as chief executive officer of the telecommunications company Covad, which he left $1.4 billion in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy while he received a $1.5 million severance package. 
 The controversy over the academy has outlasted Mr. Knowling, who resigned in April 2005. In its first three years, the academy has produced 162 principals from 275 enrollees. A former Department of Education official, Barbara Bartholomew, wrote recently in Educational Leadership magazine that the academy was part of a misguided policy of ''disbanding an operable system that required thoughtful reform, not dissolution.''
 Sandra J. Stein, Mr. Knowling's successor as leader of the academy, replied on the magazine's Web site that the program was the victim of a ''barrage of misinformation.'' While acknowledging the resistance the academy's principals have sometimes faced, she went on, ''In most cases, this is because they represent reform.''
 What the debate finally comes down to is whether people like Renee Cloutier can do the job. In a recent interview, Ms. Cloutier projected confidence and ambition. Her roots in education run deeper than her resume alone conveys; she was the niece and protegee of a childless aunt who was a teacher and later a principal in Hudson, N.Y. 
 Ms. Cloutier moved to New York immediately after graduating from Russell Sage College in Troy in 2000. ''It seemed like there was no equity in the school system,'' she said, ''and I wanted to be part of assuring that all kids got a quality education.'' She taught for four years at Public School 306 in the Bronx, a troubled school going through a state-ordered reorganization, before becoming a literacy coach and assistant principal.
 JUDITH PETERSEN, a Leadership Academy staff member whom Ms. Cloutier described as a mentor, wrote of her in a recent e-mail message: ''I believe that Renee has the capacity to be a leader who will work with others to create a school where all children have access to good instruction, every day and in every classroom.'' 
 Still, the question is not whether Ms. Cloutier is idealistic, or whether she is skillful in the classroom. The question is whether she can know as much after six years in education as Dita Wolf knew in the 27 years she spent in P.S. 7 and three other Bronx schools before being named a principal.
 ''I'm not hiding my age or defending my age,'' Ms. Cloutier said. ''It's all about showing I can do the work.''
 In that effort, she has the advantage of inheriting a school that already functions well. She also has inherited all of the internal memos and reports Ms. Wolf produced last year, a kind of institutional memory. And in the bottom left drawer of the principal's desk remain Milton Fein's hammer and wrench, evidence of a continuity that will either be preserved or ruptured in Ms. Cloutier's hands.
 ''Look, I'm hoping that Renee is going to succeed,'' Ms. Wolf put it. ''Because if she doesn't, then years of my life go down the tubes. And that's something I don't want to see.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 24, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The On Education column on Aug. 16, about the experience levels of principals being promoted in New York City schools, referred incorrectly to the educational qualifications of Renee Cloutier, the new principal at P.S. 7 in the Bronx. She does indeed have a master's degree. (She received it this year in education administration from Baruch College School of Public Affairs.)

HEADLINE: State Fairs, Sagging, Arrive at County Crossroads 

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Aug. 11 

 BODY:
The cacophony of smells -- waves of manure, tractor fuel, all things deep fried -- signaled the opening of the state fair here on Friday. Piglets squealed in a pen, sheep tolerated last-minute haircuts, and dutiful ponies stepped around a wheel in slow motion, bearing children on their backs. 
 But attendance has dropped sharply in recent years, as it has at other state fairs in the nation's midsection.
An auditor general's report found that the Illinois fair spent millions of dollars more than it brought in last year, as it had in years past. 
 Elsewhere, the problems have grown severe enough to lead political leaders to question the spending of tax dollars to keep the fairs afloat.
 ''Nothing is forever,'' said William M. Napoli, a state senator in South Dakota, where a legislative committee concluded this year that the state fair's fate appeared bleak and where some lawmakers want it abolished. 
 ''We're trying to keep a dinosaur alive that's probably outlived its purpose,'' Mr. Napoli, of Rapid City, said.
 In Colorado, Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, signed a bill in June to rescue that fair from its mounting debt with $4 million from the state. Facing the possibility of bankruptcy, Nebraska resorted to a bailout in 2004, with voters' agreeing to a constitutional amendment to direct lottery winnings to prop up its fair. 
 Though critics say slipping attendance and increasing subsidies show that fairs have lost their role in an era in which entertainment can be found almost around every corner, defenders point to the original purposes, to teach about farming and industry, and stir a sense of community.
 American fairs, whose roots can be traced at least 199 years back, to a New England farmer, Elkanah Watson, who put a small exhibition of sheep under an old elm in Pittsfield, Mass., have been a staple of rural life and a chance to promote agriculture, animal husbandry and local industry. ''A state fair is not a business,'' said Pat Haley, a state representative from Huron, S.D., home to a fair whose preview night is Aug. 30. ''A state fair is a social event, much like a family reunion.''
 Many state fairs, meanwhile, say they remain successful.
 Among them, said Jim D. Tucker, president and chief executive of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions, are fairs in Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana, Georgia and Washington State. 
 Mr. Tucker's group is a 116-year-old organization that mainly represents 1,300 state, county and other agricultural fairs. 
 He said that fairs grew in popularity in a wave of sentiment after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and that many member groups reported growing or at least stable attendance in 2005 over 2004. 
 Though the State Fair of Texas, which boasts that it has the largest attendance figures in its 24 days, acknowledges that it has tried modern attractions like bungee jumping and a trained-housecats act, it also says its old-fashioned jams, jellies and quilts still draw crowds. 
 ''We brought the pig races back last year, and you couldn't find a seat,'' said Sue Gooding, a spokeswoman.
 Skeptics theorize that the struggling fairs are merely facing up, at last, to the swirl of options like casinos, water parks, sprawling movie complexes, malls, theme parks and sports parks.
 Attendance at the Oregon fair dipped 10 percent last year, in addition to 10 percent in 2004, even as repair and maintenance backlogs at the fairgrounds climbed, by some estimates to $18 million.
 ''It's a classic marketing and business problem,'' the Oregon fair manager, Dave Koellermeier, said. ''The product that you're selling was losing appeal.''
 Mr. Tucker questioned whether broad, changing economic factors were harming fairs and said management problems might help explain certain fairs' troubles. Besides, he added, fairs have been through ebbs and flows of popularity before, and many have long received financial assistance from states. 
 ''The bottom line of why I think fairs have a bright future is animals,'' Mr. Tucker said. ''This generation that's growing up right now probably have seen more zoo animals than farm animals.''
 The notion of a state fair has grown more complicated than it once was; fairs' affiliations with government vary vastly from state to state.
 Though at least 65 events carry names suggesting that they are state run, some receive little or no state money and are operated mainly by nonprofit groups. Meanwhile, some states, including Illinois, sponsor more than one fair.
 A spokeswoman for the Illinois fair, Chris Herbert, said its more than $4 million in annual operating expenses were covered by its revenue, leaving the state to pay $2.8 million each year in ''indirect costs'' like setting up the event and cleaning up after it, and $600,000 for awards and premiums. 
 General admission here is $3, among the lowest in the country.
 Asked what might have caused a sudden drop in attendance, to 672,615 in 2005 from more than 1.2 million in 2002, according to figures released by the fair, Ms. Herbert said all sorts of factors, including weather, particular stage acts and improved accuracy in estimating attendance, could explain it. 
 Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democrat who faces a competitive re-election fight in November and who raced, drenched in sweat, from person to person along the ''Main Street'' on a recent evening at the fairgrounds, defended the fair as successful.
 ''You don't want to lose inordinate amounts of money, but the purpose isn't to make money,'' Mr. Blagojevich said. ''You've got the other, intangible part of it.'' 
 Although the governor said he saw a ''certain timelessness'' in the fair, he also said fair officials here, as elsewhere, were working hard to come up with new acts to appeal to a crowd that might never have seen a state fair, like young people in Chicago and its suburbs. 
 There were many signs of the urgent search for relevance. Not so far from the cows were animals not native to the rural fields of downstate Illinois: Bengal tigers, dancing black bears, sharks and alligators. 
 Skateboarders and other daredevils performed in a ''maximum velocity stunt show.'' And the simpler days of the biggest-gourd contest have been overtaken by 8,700 competitive events, many of which require not so much as ever setting foot near a farm -- best smile, longest ponytail, fastest crawling baby, prettiest diaper decoration and on and on.
 Asked about the fair tradition, a cluster of local teenagers scoffed, mocking the livestock events less than 100 yards away. 
 But Paul Killion, who has lived in rural southern Illinois for all of his 83 years, fended off the scalding sun with an umbrella as high school bands, antique tractors, fire trucks and the queen of the fair, draped in turquoise, floated by in the opening parade. Mr. Killion said he first attended this fair when he was 6. 
 ''The money doesn't matter,'' Mr. Killion said, adding quickly that those who argue that state fairs should pay for themselves are ''dead wrong.'' The fairs of years past included more livestock, more vegetables, more farm equipment, Mr. Killion said, but they remain a crucial August tradition for his family.
 ''Everything has changed, hasn't it?'' he said. ''But there will always be a state fair.''

HEADLINE: Recent Moves By Kyrgyzstan Indicate Shift From West 

BYLINE: By ILAN GREENBERG

DATELINE: KARA-SUU, Kyrgyzstan 

 BODY:
A series of recent incidents, including the killing last week of a popular religious leader by government security forces in this restive southern border town, has many here calling into question the pro-Western orientation of Kyrgyzstan.
 Expectations that the Central Asian nation would lead its neighbors toward a pro-Western -- and especially pro-American -- alignment crested after it ousted its president in March 2005. The so-called Tulip Revolution was part of a wave of ''colored revolutions'' that overthrew leaders aligned with Russia in Georgia and Ukraine and swept into power pro-Western administrations.
But in July, Kyrgyzstan expelled two American envoys, the first expulsion of American diplomats from any Central Asian country. The United States responded by ejecting two Kyrgyz diplomats. 
 Last week, the Kyrgyz government repatriated five Uzbeks with United Nations-sanctioned refugee status whom Uzbekistan's authoritarian government wanted to try in connection with an uprising last year in the Uzbek city of Andijon, in which hundreds of people were killed by government security forces. The decision was denounced by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as a ''shocking'' violation of Kyrgyzstan's international commitments.
 On Aug. 6, Kyrgyz and Uzbek security forces killed an outspoken imam, Rafiq Qori Kamalov, in his car as he drove down a street in the city of Osh, near the Uzbek border. He and two people with him were accused by the government of being members of a shadowy British-based organization called Hizb ut-Tahrir, which is banned by most Central Asian countries. The organization advocates a caliphate, or a unified Islamic government, over all of Central Asia, but says it is nonviolent.
 A government spokesman, acknowledging the killings, said munitions and a map scrawled with the word ''jihad'' were found in the vehicle. 
 To experts on the region, the events seemed to be part of a deliberate policy shift by the Kyrgyz government. 
 Traditionally, small Central Asian nations like Kyrgyzstan have tended to balance binational relationships rather than cast their lot with one nation over another. But increasingly, say Western diplomats and political analysts here, Kyrgyzstan seems to be embracing Russia and Uzbekistan at the expense of its relationship with the United States.
 ''The Kyrgyz aren't acting in as haphazard a way as it looks,'' said Michael Hall, Central Asia project director for the International Crisis Group, an independent policy analysis group. ''Given the demands and conditions from the United States, the Kyrgyz are simply thinking it is more in their interest to play along with Russia and Uzbekistan, neighbors that can make life difficult for Kyrgyzstan in the long term.'' 
 Here in this border area dominated by ethnic Uzbeks, anti-government hostility runs deep, and a traditional, politically engaged Islam is an increasingly powerful force. But elsewhere in the country, admiration for the government of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev seems to be growing, while the American presence continues to dim.
 ''There's unhappiness with the economic situation, especially in the south,'' said a political analyst with a Western-backed civil society organization. ''But while the Kyrgyz may want a government that is more progressive and is doing more, things are also stable and people seem to have accepted by and large that Bakiyev is in charge.'' The analyst asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.
 Like its Central Asian neighbors, Kyrgyzstan is a country with a Sunni Muslim majority whose government discourages religious fervor and has a history of clamping down on organizations that espouse a mixing of politics and Islam. 
 Kyrgyzstan has been hesitant in the past to collaborate with Uzbekistan, which has shown little regard for human rights in its pursuit of what it labels Muslim militants. ''What's new this week is the cooperation between the Kyrgyz and Uzbek security forces,'' said the political analyst.

HEADLINE: Now Some Good News

 BODY:
In 1995, civil war ended in Bosnia, leaving 200,000 dead, half of those who survived displaced, and 90 percent of the infrastructure destroyed. When the United States and Europe began trying to put Bosnia back together, critics said nation-building was a fool's errand. They were wrong. Today Bosnia is a mostly harmonious, increasingly prosperous country on the way to becoming normal. 
 The international community, once it got involved, did not stint. After Slobodan Milosevic, the war's perpetrator, was pressured into signing a peace accord, Bosnia became an international protectorate. A country of only four million was policed by 60,000 NATO troops and governed by a series of international High Representatives, who had near total control over the bitterly divided ethnic groups.
It was hard. Even the task of getting refugees safely back into their houses seemed nearly impossible. But things improved. The robust international force established security. The High Representative sacked mayors and held back aid from villages that refused to reintegrate. The international tribunal in The Hague removed many war criminals -- the very men causing postwar problems. 
 By 2000, Bosnia was speedily reintegrating, and it is now free of ethnic violence. Even the rate of common crime is low by European standards. Bosnia's politicians lag, but are increasingly working together. Some government tasks, like customs and tax collection, have been centralized. In the army, soldiers of all ethnic groups serve together. Serb Republic politicians still talk of breaking away, but are pragmatically working with the federation.
 The Office of the High Representative will close next year, and it is time for the country to stand on its own. Bosnians, of all ethnic groups, are eager to join the European Union, which should provide pressure for further political and economic reform. 
 Living in a good neighborhood (Europe) is part of the reason for Bosnia's good news. But nation-building also succeeded because no one scrimped. It is impossible to say if a much larger peacekeeping force or more attentive leadership would have made the same difference in Iraq. But the Bush administration chose to ignore plenty of early warnings -- much of them drawn from the lessons of Bosnia.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Official Says a Qaeda Leader Was Plot's Mastermind

BYLINE: By ISMAIL KHAN and CARLOTTA GALL; Absar Alam contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
A senior Pakistani intelligence official told reporters here Tuesday night that a leader of Al Qaeda based in Afghanistan was the mastermind of the reported plot in Britain to blow up American airliners. 
 But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not identify the leader or provide other details. He said the supposed mastermind was comparable in importance to Abu Faraj al-Libbi, a Libyan said to have been a high-ranking Qaeda official, whom Pakistan arrested in May 2005 and turned over to the United States.
''It is not Osama bin Laden and it's not Ayman al-Zawahri but it was someone close to the rank of Abu Faraj al-Libbi,'' the intelligence official said, referring to the top two Qaeda leaders.
 Since the plot was disclosed last week, Pakistani officials have said it was linked to Qaeda operatives based in Afghanistan.
 But American officials and experts on terrorism have said they believed that many senior Qaeda members were hiding on the Pakistani side of the border with Afghanistan, an area that Pakistan has struggled to control. 
 Seth Jones, an analyst with the RAND Corporation who follows Afghanistan, said ''most of them are on the Pakistani side of the border.'' 
 The Pakistani intelligence official also said British security officials who were monitoring the reported plot wanted to let the suspects go ahead with a dry run but were dissuaded by the United States and Pakistan.
 ''We went for the disruption approach,'' he said. He also said that Pakistani officials had arrested six or seven people linked to the plot along with Rashid Rauf, a British citizen born in Pakistan who has been described as one of its leaders.
 He said that the arrest of Mr. Rauf was the key to foiling the plot and that he was a link between Al Qaeda and the suspects arrested in Britain. 
 Earlier Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed reports that investigators were looking into whether charity money raised for earthquake relief had been diverted to plotters. 
 ''These are all absurd stories,'' the spokeswoman, Tasneem Aslam, said at a news briefing, referring to articles in The New York Times and The Washington Post. ''The objective is to malign Pakistan and to cast a shadow on the efforts made by Pakistan to uncover and foil this terrorist plot. The invidious and ridiculous nature of these claims becomes evident from the fact that the claim is that money was transferred to Pakistan at the time of the earthquake and then transferred back to England.''
 She said that relief funds had been handled in a very transparent way and that there was no link between relief money and the reported plot.
 Ms. Aslam also denied reports that Mr. Rauf was linked to any relief or Islamist organization in Pakistan.
 ''Rashid Rauf had nothing to do with any charity involved in the earthquake relief work or with any relief work as such,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Rank Colleges, But Rank Them Right

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EARLY this morning, U.S. News & World Report will send e-mail messages to hundreds of college administrators, giving them an advance peek at the magazine's annual college ranking. They will find out whether Princeton will be at the top of the list for the seventh straight year, whether Emory can break into the top 15 and where their own university ranks. The administrators must agree to keep the information to themselves until Friday at midnight, when the list goes live on the U.S. News Web site, but the e-mail message gives them a couple of days to prepare a response.
 By now, 23 years after U.S. News got into this game, the responses have become pretty predictable. Disappointed college officials dismiss the ranking as being beneath the lofty aims of a university, while administrators pleased with their status order new marketing materials bragging about it -- and then tell anyone who asks that, obviously, they realize the ranking is beneath the lofty aims of a university.
 There are indeed some silly aspects to the U.S. News franchise and its many imitators. The largest part of a university's U.S. News score, for instance, is based on a survey of presidents, provosts and admissions deans, most of whom have never sat in a class at the colleges they're judging. 
 That's made it easy to dismiss all the efforts to rate colleges as the product of a status-obsessed society with a need to turn everything, even learning, into a competition. As Richard R. Beeman, a historian and former dean at the University of Pennsylvania, has argued, ''The very idea that universities with very different institutional cultures and program priorities can be compared, and that the resulting rankings can be useful to students, is highly problematic.''
 Of course, the same argument could be made about students. They come from different cultures, they learn in different ways and no one-dimensional scoring system can ever fully capture how well they have mastered a subject. Yet colleges go on giving grades, drawing fine lines that determine who is summa cum laude and bestowing graduation prizes -- all for good reason.
 HUMAN beings do a better job of just about anything when their performance is evaluated and they are held accountable for it. You can't manage what you don't measure, as the management adage says, and because higher education is by all accounts critical to the country's economic future, it sure seems to be deserving of rigorous measurement. 
 So do we spend too much time worrying about college rankings? Or not nearly enough?
 Not so long ago, college administrators could respond that they seemed to be doing just fine. American universities have long attracted talented students from other continents, and this country's population was once the most educated in the world. 
 But it isn't anymore. Today the United States ranks ninth among industrialized nations in higher-education attainment, in large measure because only 53 percent of students who enter college emerge with a bachelor's degree, according to census data. And those who don't finish pay an enormous price. For every $1 earned by a college graduate, someone leaving before obtaining a four-year degree earns only 67 cents. 
 Last week, in a report to the Education Department, a group called the Commission on the Future of Higher Education bluntly pointed out the economic dangers of these trends. ''What we have learned over the last year makes clear that American higher education has become what, in the business world, would be called a mature enterprise: increasingly risk-averse, at times self-satisfied, and unduly expensive,'' it said. ''To meet the challenges of the 21st century, higher education must change from a system primarily based on reputation to one based on performance.'' 
 The report comes with a handful of recommendations -- simplify financial aid, give more of it to low-income students, control university costs -- but says they all depend on universities becoming more accountable. Tellingly, only one of the commission's 19 members, who included executives from Boeing, I.B.M. and Microsoft and former university presidents, refused to sign the report: David Ward, president of the nation's largest association of colleges and universities, the American Council on Education. But that's to be expected. Many students don't enjoy being graded, either. The task of grading colleges will fall to the federal government, which gives enough money to universities to demand accountability, and to private groups outside higher education.
 ''The degree of defensiveness that colleges have is unreasonable,'' said Michael S. McPherson, a former president of Macalester College in Minnesota who now runs the Spencer Foundation in Chicago. ''It's just the usual resistance to having someone interfere with their own marketing efforts.''
 The commission urged the Education Department to create an easily navigable Web site that allows comparisons of colleges based on their actual cost (not just list price), admissions data and meaningful graduation rates. (Right now, the statistics don't distinguish between students who transfer and true dropouts.) Eventually, it said, the site should include data on ''learning outcomes.''
 Measuring how well students learn is incredibly difficult, but there are some worthy efforts being made. Researchers at Indiana University ask students around the country how they spend their time and how engaged they are in their education, while another group is measuring whether students become better writers and problem solvers during their college years. 
 As Mr. McPherson points out, all the yardsticks for universities have their drawbacks. Yet parents and students are clearly desperate for information. Without it, they turn to U.S. News, causing applications to jump at colleges that move up the ranking, even though some colleges that are highly ranked may not actually excel at making students smarter than they were upon arrival. To take one small example that's highlighted in the current issue of Washington Monthly, Emory has an unimpressive graduation rate given the affluence and S.A.T. scores of its incoming freshmen.
 When U.S. News started its ranking back in the 1980's, universities released even less information about themselves than they do today. But the attention that the project received forced colleges to become a little more open. Imagine, then, what might happen if a big foundation or another magazine -- or U.S. News -- announced that it would rank schools based on how well they did on measures like the Indiana survey.
 The elite universities would surely skip it, confident that they had nothing to gain, but there is a much larger group of colleges that can't rest on a brand name. The ones that did well would be rewarded with applications from just the sort of students universities supposedly want -- ones who are willing to keep an open mind and be persuaded by evidence.

HEADLINE: Deere Profit Rises 13% on Cost Cuts and Sales 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill., Aug. 15 

 BODY:
The farm and lawn-care equipment maker Deere & Company said Tuesday that its quarterly profit rose 13 percent, helped by cost-cutting and an 8 percent increase in sales. 
 Net income was $436 million, or $1.85 a share, compared with $387 million, or $1.58 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the period, which ended July 31 and was the third quarter of Deere's fiscal year, increased to $6.27 billion from $5.82 billion.
Deere said continuing efforts to hold down costs by reducing inventories helped increase earnings.
 ''We are seeing continued benefit from our successful efforts to restrain costs and operate with lower assets,'' the chief executive, Robert W. Lane, said in a statement.
 Equipment sales in the United States and Canada grew 6 percent, while sales outside the two countries, excluding the effect of currency conversion, rose 3 percent.
 Sales of construction equipment rose 13 percent, while commercial and consumer equipment sales were up 8 percent, paced by demand for landscaping products. Farm equipment sales rose 1 percent, largely as a result of higher prices and favorable exchange rates.
 The company said inventory reductions would continue. It plans to cut production about 10 percent in the fourth quarter and 5 percent for the year.
 For the year, farm machinery sales are expected to decline about 4 percent as higher interest rates and energy costs weigh on farm incomes and spending. Construction equipment sales are expected to rise about 12 percent as increased nonresidential construction offsets a slight decline in home building. Sales of commercial and consumer equipment are expected to increase 8 percent for the year, buoyed by demand for landscape products and a new line of riding lawn equipment.
 Stock in Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill., rose 33 cents to close at $69 a share.

HEADLINE: Monsanto Buys Delta and Pine Land, Top Supplier of Cotton Seeds in U.S. 

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Monsanto will acquire the Delta and Pine Land Company, the nation's leading supplier of cotton seeds, in a move that would add to Monsanto's commanding position in the business of biotechnology crops. 
 The $1.5 billion cash deal, announced yesterday, would give Monsanto control of half the American market for cotton seeds and could face tough antitrust scrutiny at a time when smaller seed companies are being gobbled up by larger ones.
Indeed, Monsanto tried to buy Delta and Pine Land in 1998, only to drop the deal the following year, saying it could not obtain approval from federal regulators. Delta and Pine Land, saying Monsanto did not try hard enough to win clearance, sued for $2 billion in damages and the companies have had a somewhat fractious relationship ever since. 
 The new deal would end that litigation as well as an arbitration proceeding in which Monsanto is seeking the right to revoke Delta and Pine Land's license to use Monsanto's genetically engineered technology to provide cotton with herbicide and insect resistance. 
 ''We're not naive to the history between the parties, but we're both genuinely committed to make the transaction work,'' Hugh Grant, the chief executive of Monsanto, said in a conference call with analysts. 
 He said that the market had changed since 1998 and that the deal could win clearance this time. Delta's share of the cotton seed market has fallen to a little over 50 percent, from about 80 percent, largely because of competition from Bayer CropScience. 
 Mr. Grant said Monsanto expected that to win clearance it would have to divest itself of the American cotton seed business of Stoneville, a company it acquired last year that has about 12 percent of the market. If the deal cannot win clearance, Monsanto may have to pay Delta and Pine Land as much as $600 million. 
 Monsanto also dominates the market for the genetically engineered traits for insect and herbicide resistance, which could also present an antitrust issue. ''It's a concentration issue that should be a matter of concern,'' said Neil E. Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. 
 But Mr. Grant said that other big companies were now developing such traits. ''It's a much more competitive business than it was a decade ago,'' he said. 
 The deal for Delta, which must still be approved by that company's shareholders, is worth $42 a share, a 16 percent premium to Delta's closing price on Monday. The company, based in Scott, Miss., had $366 million in sales last year. 
 Delta's stock yesterday rose $4.10, or 11 percent, to $40.34. Monsanto shares gained 39 cents, to $45.56. Mr. Grant said the deal would allow Monsanto to get more of its biotech traits into cotton, both in the United States and around the world. 
 Monsanto, based in St. Louis, licenses its biotechnology traits to seed companies, including Delta, which incorporate them in their own varieties. More than 80 percent of the cotton grown in the United States this year was genetically engineered, according to the Department of Agriculture. 
 Monsanto also sells seeds on its own and has been buying seed companies, in part to obtain desirable varieties in which to insert its genetically engineered traits. While it is strong in sales of corn and soybeans, it has been weaker in cotton. Monsanto also paid about $1 billion last year to buy Seminis, the world's largest supplier of fruit and vegetable seeds, 
 Mr. Grant said Delta had been slow to incorporate the latest Monsanto crops into its cotton varieties. Buying the company ''could significantly accelerate our technology penetration into this business,'' he said. 
 Monsanto could also be aiming to significantly decelerate the penetration of its agricultural biotechnology rivals into the cotton business. In recent years, Delta and Pine Land has signed deals to use new technology for herbicide and insect resistance developed by DuPont and Syngenta. 
 Tom Jagodinski, chief executive of Delta, said in an interview that his company stood to make more money from the DuPont and Syngenta traits because it negotiated more favorable terms than it did with Monsanto. 
 But once Monsanto buys Delta, it could de-emphasize the DuPont or Syngenta technology, or those companies could withdraw from their deals. 
 Mr. Jagodinski told analysts in a conference call that the deals with Syngenta and DuPont can survive a change in control of his company. ''We're going to continue to work with them up until the closing,'' he said. ''What Monsanto does with them after that is up to Monsanto.'' 
 A spokeswoman for Monsanto said the company ''would be delighted to continue to offer those traits'' but does not yet know the details of the contracts between the companies. 
 The deal could also conceivably deal a blow to a controversial genetic engineering technology that makes sterile seeds as a way of forcing farmers to buy new biotech seeds each year rather than saving the seed from one year's crop to plant the next. Delta, which developed the technology along with the United States Department of Agriculture, has continued to work on it. But Monsanto has pledged that it will not commercialize sterile seed technology.

HEADLINE: Muslim Myopia

BYLINE: By Irshad Manji. 
Irshad Manji, a fellow at Yale University, is the author of ''The Trouble with Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faith.''

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
LAST week, the luminaries of the British Muslim mainstream -- lobbyists, lords and members of Parliament -- published an open letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair, telling him that the ''debacle'' of both Iraq and Lebanon provides ''ammunition to extremists who threaten us all.'' In increasingly antiwar America, a similar argument is gaining traction: The United States brutalizes Muslims, which in turn foments Islamist terror.
 But violent jihadists have rarely needed foreign policy grievances to justify their hot heads. There was no equivalent to the Iraq debacle in 1993, when Islamists first tried to blow up the World Trade Center, or in 2000, when they attacked the American destroyer Cole. Indeed, that assault took place after United States-led military intervention saved thousands of Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. 
If Islamists cared about changing Iraq policy, they would not have bothered to abduct two journalists from France -- probably the most antiwar, anti-Bush nation in the West. Even overt solidarity with Iraqi suffering did not prevent Margaret Hassan, who ran a world-renowned relief agency in Baghdad, from being executed by insurgents. 
 Meanwhile, at least as many Muslims are dying at the hands of other Muslims as under the boots of any foreign imperial power. In Sudan, black Muslims are starved, raped, enslaved and slaughtered by Arab militias, with the consent of an Islamic government. Where is the ''official'' Muslim fury against that genocide? Do Muslim lives count only when snuffed out by non-Muslims? If not, then here is an idea for Muslim representatives in the West: Go ahead and lecture the politicians that their foreign policies give succor to radicals. At the same time, however, challenge the educated and angry young Muslims to hold their own accountable, too.
 This means reminding them that in Pakistan, Sunnis hunt down Shiites every day; that in northern Israel, Katuysha rockets launched by Hezbollah have ripped through the homes of Arab Muslims as well as Jews; that in Egypt, the riot police of President Hosni Mubarak routinely club, rape, torture and murder Muslim activists promoting democracy; and, above all, that civil wars have become hallmarks of the Islamic world.
 Muslim figureheads will not dare be so honest. They would sooner replicate the very sins for which they castigate the Bush and Blair governments -- namely, switching rationales and pretending integrity.
 In the wake of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Iqbal Sacranie, then the head of the influential Muslim Council of Britain, insisted that economic discrimination lay at the root of Islamist radicalism in his country. When it came to light that some of the suspects enjoyed middle-class upbringings, university educations, jobs and cars, Mr. Sacranie found a new culprit: foreign policy. In so doing, he boarded the groupthink express steered by Muslim elites.
 The good news is that ordinary people of faith are capable of self-criticism. Two months ago, 65 percent of British Muslims polled believed that their communities should increase efforts to integrate. The same poll also produced troubling results: 13 percent lionized the July 7 terrorists, and 16 percent sympathized. Still, these figures total 29 percent -- less than half the number who sought to belong more fully to British society. 
 Whether in Britain or America, those who claim to speak for Muslims have a responsibility to the majority, which wants to reconcile Islam with pluralism. Whatever their imperial urges, it is not for Tony Blair or George W. Bush to restore Islam's better angels. That duty -- and glory -- goes to Muslims.

HEADLINE: For Venezuela, as Distaste for U.S. Grows, So Does Trade 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 15 

 BODY:
''Capitalism will lead to the destruction of humanity,'' President Hugo Chavez said this month in a speech in Vietnam, during an overseas tour that included stops in Iran and Belarus. The United States, he added, ''is the devil that represents capitalism.'' 
 Yet even as the talk from Caracas and Washington grows more hostile and the countries seem to be growing ever farther apart, trade between Venezuela and the United States is surging.
Venezuela's oil exports, of course, account for the bulk of that trade, as the country remains the fourth largest oil supplier to the United States. Pulled largely by those rising oil revenues, trade climbed 36 percent in 2005, to $40.4 billion, the fastest growth in cargo value among America's top 20 trading partners, according to WorldCity, a Miami company that closely tracks American trade.
 But American companies are also benefiting, as Venezuela's thirst for American products like cars, construction machinery and computers has steadily grown, rising to $6.4 billion last year, from $4.8 billion a year earlier. 
 The new growth comes even as Mr. Chavez has done his best to try to redirect his nation's trade toward what he considers more likeminded nations. He has formed a new socialist trade agreement with Cuba and Bolivia. A few Chinese cars can now be glimpsed in showrooms here. Iranian tractors are rolling off a new assembly line. And a Russian company plans to open a Kalashnikov rifle factory soon. 
 Washington has moved to halt American weapons sales to Venezuela, for what it says is a lack of cooperation in combating terrorism, as Mr. Chavez deepens ties with countries like Iran.
 But while the leaders in Washington and Caracas may regard each other with distaste, there is little getting around the fact that the appetite for trade in both nations belies those differences. Especially when it comes to oil, the economies remain mutually dependent.
 Some say the ties have left the two nations entangled to a degree that political or ideological disputes would have a hard time undoing. ''The U.S. has been Venezuela's principal trading partner for a century,'' said Robert Bottome, editor and publisher of Veneconomia, the country's leading business newsletter. ''It's not easy to dismantle such a relationship, though that is probably Chavez's ultimate desire.'' 
 Venezuela moved in that direction on Tuesday, with its national oil company saying it had agreed to sell its stake in a Houston refinery for more than $1.3 billion in cash. 
 Still, the trade numbers illustrate a widening gulf between Mr. Chavez's increasingly anti-American speeches, aimed at revving his political base, and the needs of Venezuela's otherwise freewheeling economy. 
 For instance, non-oil exports to the United States climbed 116 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the National Statistics Institute. Venezuela also maintains close ties to Wall Street banks, with Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse advising the governments of Venezuela and Argentina on their coming sale of $2 billion of bonds. 
 The growth in economic ties has touched several sectors, even if political tensions have left American companies generally hesitant to call attention to their good fortune or to offer detailed comments on their operations.
 Regulatory filings show that Venezuela's economy, which grew 9.6 percent in the first half of the year, is lifting profits for many American companies. 
 Most delicately, oil services companies like Halliburton, an emblem of the Venezuelan government's distaste with American foreign policy, are at the forefront of the deepening interdependence. 
 ''There's rhetoric and there's business,'' said an official with the United States Commerce Department who closely follows trade with Venezuela, and asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of relations between the countries. ''The Venezuelans can't produce their oil without our equipment. It's as simple as that.''
 With 10 offices and 1,000 employees in Venezuela, Halliburton recently won a contract to assist Petrozuata, a venture between Venezuela's national oil company and ConocoPhillips, in extracting oil from fields in eastern Venezuela. 
 Melissa Norcross, a Halliburton spokeswoman in Houston, declined to comment specifically on activities in Venezuela, but noted that the company had operated in the country for more than 50 years. 
 In its July filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Halliburton reported that its energy services group, which helps companies drill for oil, hit double-digit sales growth in Venezuela in the first six months of 2006, offsetting a decline in Mexico. 
 At the same time, Venezuela's government often speaks out against the strength of American multinationals, and recently has exerted greater control over the oil industry, with the largest American oil company, Exxon Mobil, publicly chafing at its treatment. 
 Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, said last month that Venezuela's reorganization of its oil industry would cut Chevron's output by 90,000 barrels a day later this year.
 Mr. Chavez has also been critical of American software companies like Microsoft, and has issued a decree ordering the country's government offices to move toward open-source alternatives like Linux. Government-financed cooperatives in urban barrios and the countryside, meanwhile, churn out everything from shoes to organic cocoa. 
 Still, demand for American products remains strong. General Motors, Ford and other car manufacturers are trying to meet soaring demand, with sales up 28 percent in July from last year. G.M., Venezuela's largest car manufacturer, said this month that it would invest $20 million to expand output by 30 percent, adding 600 new workers. 
 Here in Venezuela's frenetic capital, the pervasive presence of American brands and advertising for American products stands in contrast to the colorful murals heroically depicting Mr. Chavez and Simon Bolivar, and billboards emblazoned with slogans taunting President Bush. (One reads: ''Mister Danger, Let Us Make Love and Not War.'') 
 The resilient ties with the United States are too much for some of Mr. Chavez's critics on the left, including Douglas Bravo, a former Marxist guerrilla commander who was once close to Mr. Chavez, but who has broken with him over Venezuela's heavy reliance on energy companies from rich industrial countries. 
 ''If you look at its speech and discourse, this is a revolutionary government,'' Mr. Bravo said in a recent interview with the newspaper El Nacional. ''But if you look at what it has accomplished, it is a neoliberal government.'' 
 Some government policies have unexpectedly benefited American companies. For instance, after Venezuela restricted access to foreign currency for trips abroad to prevent capital flight during a sharp downturn in the economy in 2003, MasterCard profited because travelers were still allowed to spend up to $2,500 on their credit cards outside Venezuela. 
 Though MasterCard has recently stopped breaking out figures for Venezuela, it credited the exchange controls with helping to raise its gross dollar volume in the country by 82 percent, to $460 million, in the third quarter of 2005. 
 ''We're going to have to pass on this one,'' Janet Rivera, a MasterCard spokeswoman, replied when asked about operations in Venezuela. 
 Other American companies continue betting on Venezuela, even as Washington looks at tightening trade ties. Susan Schwab, the United States trade representative, placed Venezuela last week on a list of 11 developing countries with relatively high income levels that could lose preferential trade benefits, a move that drew criticism in Brazil and Argentina but barely a shrug here. 
 The agricultural giant Cargill spent $10 million in July to acquire a Venezuelan flour-milling concern, though it has also expressed concern over delays in being able to send dividends to its Minnesota owners. 
 The AES Corporation of Arlington, Va., owner of the utility that provides electricity to Caracas, is enjoying growth of 5 percent a year here, said Andres Gluski, a Venezuelan who heads AES's operations in the region. ''There is no question that the stronger economic system in Venezuela has helped our business,'' Mr. Gluski said. 
 But the biggest beneficiary of Venezuela's commercially robust relationship with the United States is, paradoxically, the government itself, which directly controls the oil producer Petroleos de Venezuela. 
 Despite persistent criticism of Mr. Chavez's economic policies from his political opponents, Venezuela enjoyed a $27.6 billion trade surplus last year with the United States, by far the largest market for its oil. 
 ''I'm reticent to attract much attention to this subject,'' said Edmond Saade, president of the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with 1,200 members. ''But really, we'd like to leave well enough alone.''

HEADLINE: Its Future Uncertain, a Mall Developer Pulls Back 

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Madrid Xanadu gave Europe its first taste of the Mills Corporation's innovative blend of shopping and entertainment, with anchors ranging from a 350,000-square-foot branch of Spain's largest retailer, El Corte Ingles, to a 17-story snow dome for indoor skiing.
 The project was an immediate success when it opened in 2003, prompting the company to plan other ''consumer theme parks,'' as its chief executive, Laurence C. Siegel, described them, in Spain, Italy and Scotland.
But Mills's dream of becoming the first American shopping mall company with a large presence in Europe proved elusive. Earlier this week, the company said it expected to sell Madrid Xanadu and its half-interest in two other malls, Vaughan Mills in Ontario and St. Enoch Centre in Glasgow, to Ivanhoe Cambridge, a Montreal company that is Mills's partner in the Canadian and Scottish properties. 
 The deal valued the three properties at $1.5 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations and giving them the first piece of good news to report about the company in months.
 Last week, Mills, a real estate investment trust based in Chevy Chase, Md., that owns all or part of 42 malls, disclosed a new series of accounting errors and said it would reduce the stated value of its assets by as much as $315 million. The disclosure, made in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, sent share prices tumbling and caused some analysts to downgrade the stock. 
 The company, which is searching for a buyer, also acknowledged that Meadowlands Xanadu, the 2.2-million-square-foot shopping-and-entertainment center it is building on 104 leased acres surrounding the Continental Arena in northern New Jersey, would cost $2 billion, a full $800 million more than its earlier estimate. The company did not explain the reasons for the cost overrun.
 In the filing, Mills also said Ernst & Young was expected to raise doubts in an audit about whether the company could remain a going concern because it faced a Dec. 31 deadline to pay off a $1.9 billion loan from Goldman Sachs. 
 David Douglass, a Mills spokesman, said executives would not agree to be interviewed. 
 Mills's problems have been mounting for more than a year. Since September, the company has lost 70 percent of its value, during a period in which REIT stocks as a whole have risen 20 percent, said Keven J. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va. The company has not issued any financial statements since the third quarter of 2005 and has dismissed about 220 employees, including its chief operating officer and director of development.
 Some analysts say that for a company that is no longer developing new malls, Mills is still top-heavy with senior executives.
 Mr. Siegel, who was the company's visionary leader in happier times, remains the chief executive, but several analysts said the day-to-day operations were being handled by Mark S. Ordan, who was named chief operating officer in March. Mr. Ordan is the former chairman of another retail REIT, Federal Realty Investment Trust, and a co-founder of the Fresh Fields supermarket chain.
 In a regulatory filing yesterday, Mills said that its president, Mark Ettenger, was no longer in that post but would remain at the company. He had been in charge of selling the company or its assets. 
 Adding to Mills's woes, its accounting practices are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the company is facing a number of shareholder suits.
 It has been quite a comedown for the company, which began making a name for itself in 1985 when it opened Potomac Mills in Prince William County, Va., the first large mall to feature factory outlet stores with no department store anchors.
 The company went public in 1994. But as it grew, so did the scope of its ambitions. It successfully competed for major development projects, including the site of the former Mercati Generali fruit and vegetable market in Rome, and a long-vacant site in the Chicago Loop. It built Vaughan Mills, the first new enclosed mall in Canada in 14 years. And it also bought important but tired traditional malls in the United States, including Del Amo Fashion Center in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance and Southdale Center in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina, one of the oldest enclosed malls in the country.
 Real estate specialists say the company took on too much debt and was not equipped to handle a multitude of developments on such a large scale. ''They started down this road when they made the acquisition of these conventional malls and everybody told them how great they were,'' said Barry Vinocur, the editor of Realty Stock Review, a newsletter. ''They forgot that they couldn't jump tall buildings in a single bound.''
 After buying Del Amo, one of the largest malls in the country, in 2003, Mills planned a $300 million expansion and renovation. An open-air addition with an Eddie Bauer store and a P. F. Chang's restaurant is nearing completion, but the renovation of the mall itself appears to be stalled.
 ''We were waiting very anxiously for the renovation of the existing mall,'' said Steven B. Greenberg, the president of the Greenberg Group, a company that represents retail tenants. ''When that didn't happen, we started looking at other choices.''
 At Southdale, space once occupied by a Mervyn's has languished without a replacement tenant, said John J. Johannson, a senior vice president of the Welsh Companies, a Minneapolis real estate brokerage firm.
 ''It's a little bit discouraging that our strongest mall can't get a deal done,'' he said. ''Even worse, you don't feel there's a lot of energy there.''
 But the opportunity to add value at malls like Del Amo and Southdale will make those malls attractive to potential buyers, analysts say.
 That is hardly the case with Meadowlands Xanadu, said Ross Nussbaum, a senior REIT analyst at Banc of America Securities, who calculates that the initial annual rate of return for the project will be 3.9 percent. ''I don't think there's a buyer on this planet who will pay anywhere near $2 billion for it,'' he said. 
 Mills and its financial partner, the KanAm Group, a German investment fund, have already spent nearly $800 million on Xanadu, but only a handful of tenants have been announced so far. The Star-Ledger of Newark reported Sunday that the company will make public the names of several new entertainment anchors today. 
 David Fick, a managing director at the financial services firm of Stifel Nicolaus who served as chief financial officer of Mills from 1991 to 1993, said more are to come. ''I believe they have a significant amount of leases that have not been announced,'' he said. But he said that most retailers insist on contingencies allowing them to back out if the mall does not attract a critical mass of high-quality tenants. 
 Mr. Nussbaum has recommended that Mills abandon Xanadu and write off its loss, but he said the company's agreement with New Jersey might bar it from withdrawing from the project. The state has authorized $350 million in bonds for Xanadu and has committed about $60 million more for road improvements.
 But Mr. Fick, citing both the company's legal obligations and the merits of the project, said it would not make economic sense for Mills to walk away from Xanadu. ''We think that in three to five years the project will be successful,'' he said. ''It will be a painful learning experience for those involved, including shareholders.'' He predicted that its Cabela sporting goods store alone would draw millions of shoppers. 
 Well before then, Mr. Fick said, Meadowlands Xanadu and the other projects should be in the hands of an owner other than Mills. ''I don't believe there's any scenario where it's reasonable for them to exist as a company,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Home Depot 2nd-Quarter Profit Exceeds Forecasts by Analysts 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, posted second-quarter profit yesterday that exceeded analysts' expectations, aided by higher sales to professional builders. 
 Home Depot said net income increased 5.3 percent, to $1.86 billion, or 90 cents a share, from $1.77 billion, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 17 percent, to $26 billion, from $22.3 billion. 
Sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.2 percent. 
 The company will invest $350 million this year to modernize stores and add employee hours to try to gain market share from its rival, the Lowe's Companies. 
 The chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, said the company expected a ''challenging second half'' of the year and that profit and sales would come in at the ''low end'' of its projections for the year ending January 2007.
 Home Depot has forecast sales growth of 14 percent to 17 percent and earnings of $2.99 to $3.10 a share for the year.
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had estimated $3.04 a share.
 The second-quarter sales results at stores open at least a year were the lowest in three years. 
 The chief financial officer, Carol B. Tome, said such sales rose 0.2 percent in the first quarter as the company reversed its decision not to disclose that benchmark measure.
 Revenue was helped by a fourfold increase in sales from its Home Depot Supply division for professional builders, the company said.
 Mr. Nardelli said in a conference call with analysts that he was seeing mixed signals from the factors that drive home-improvement spending. 
 More Americans own homes, wages have increased and unemployment is low, he said, but fuel prices and interest rates have climbed, putting pressure on the consumer.
 ''We are planning conservatively over all, but not in the retail business,'' Mr. Nardelli said. ''You will see more associates in the stores than in prior fall seasons.''
 ''I think in a down market, you have to get more aggressive to hold share, and that is clearly a priority for us in the second half,'' Mr. Nardelli said.

 BODY:
With Labor Day less than three weeks away, and with the big books of fall looming, this may not be the moment to start a blockbuster-size beach read. Happily, to fill the late-August gap, there are a number of briefer volumes (most under 300 pages, some under 200) in bookstores for end-of-the-summer reading. 

A Tale of Two Sisters

By Anna Maxted
356 pages. Dutton. $24.95.
 In her earlier novels Anna Maxted, a British chick-lit writer, took on the death of a parent, marriage and eating disorders, along with the genre's usual romantic and career anxieties. In her latest, told in the alternating voices of the London sisters Lizbet and Cassie Montgomery, she has moved on to the next demographic stage: babies. When Lizbet becomes pregnant, Cassie's cold reaction to the news -- ''A few slow seconds of stunned silence. And a distinctly frosty 'Oh' ''-- drives a wedge between the two women. But Cassie has her own reasons, and issues, to resolve, along with the plot. 

Brief Encounters With Che Guevara

By Ben Fountain
229 pages. Ecco. $24.95.
 
 In many of Ben Fountain's stories, an American innocent (more or less) abroad encounters a world that is far stranger and more complex than he might have imagined. A graduate student in ornithology is kidnapped by Colombian rebels, only to become a truer believer than his captors. A down-on-his-luck golf pro named Sonny is offered a job as Myanmar's ''ambassador of golf,'' available for consultation on matters of tourism and sport, and private instruction to the generals of the ruling junta. 
 ''Sure, like he had something better to do?'' Sonny thinks. ''In Dallas his ex-wife was about to impound his car for nonpayment of child support. Back there lay failure and angst, the permanent hangover of a badly blown youth.'' Mr. Fountain is the fiction editor of Southwest Review and the winner of a 2005 O. Henry Prize for ''Fantasy for Eleven Fingers,'' one of the eight stories included in this collection. 

The Driftless Area

By Tom Drury
213 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $22.
 Tom Drury's latest novel (his fourth) is equal parts heist caper, ghost story and romance. It takes its title from a portion of the American Midwest that was untouched by the glaciers of the last ice age, leaving the terrain more rugged than the surrounding plains. Pierre Hunter, the main character, has grown up there, in the small town of Shale, waiting for his life to happen. Mr. Drury tell his story in prose that is spare and sly. When Pierre's high school girlfriend dumps him, a friend comes to tell him: '' 'Listen, Rebecca's breaking up with you,' said Carrie. 'She wanted you to be the first to know.'
 '' 'Oh, good,' said Pierre.''
 Skating across the local lake to work one day, Pierre falls through the ice and is saved by a beautiful (and mysterious) young woman named Stella Rosmarin. The ensuing drama involves a backpack, a pickup truck and a bundle of money. 

Grayson

By Lynne Cox
148 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $16.95.
 Early one morning when she was 17, Lynne Cox, who by then had already swum the English Channel twice, went out for a training swim in the Pacific Ocean. Paddling in the dark, she suddenly felt a strange energy in the water. ''I couldn't see anything, but I knew something was there,'' Ms. Cox writes. ''I felt like there was a spaceship moving right below me. I had never felt anything this big in the water before.'' 
 The ''something'' turns out to be a female gray whale, whose baby becomes separated from her. The baby whale (Ms. Cox names him Grayson) follows Ms. Cox almost to shore, putting himself in danger of running aground. So she begins to swim again, accompanying the baby whale as he searches the cold ocean waters for his mother. 
 Together they journey to the eventual mother-and-child reunion through a fantastical world of giant ocean sunfish, bat rays with five-foot wingspans and a school of dolphins who, after doing somersaults and tail-walks, ''chattered and squeaked like cheerleaders.''

Anonymous Lawyer

By Jeremy Blachman
276 pages. Henry Holt & Company. $25.
 Jeremy Blachman's ''Anonymous Lawyer'' is part of the growing genre of blog novels: it grew out of a blog by the same name that Mr. Blachman writes, in which he poses as the hiring partner for a large corporate law firm somewhere in America. In the book version Anonymous conspires to become the firm's chairman, going up against a nameless rival he calls the Jerk. 
 The rest of the cast includes the firm's summer associates and its other lawyers, known variously as the Short One, the Dumb One, the One With the Limp, the One Who's Never Getting Married, the One Who Missed Her Kid's Funeral, who exist mostly to be humiliated. To humanize the main character (if only slightly), there is Anonymous Niece, of whom he's actually fond.

Giraffe

By J. M. Ledgard
298 pages. The Penguin Press. $24.95.
 In about 2001, when he was Eastern Europe correspondent for the British magazine The Economist, J. M. Ledgard read a brief item in a Czech newspaper about the killing of a herd of giraffes in the Dvur Kralove zoo. Mr. Ledgard spent years researching the incident and has now spun it into a novel. The book begins in Africa in 1971 with the birth of Snehurka (Snow White, in Czech), a reticulated giraffe who is caught and shipped to Czechoslovakia as part of a breeding herd. 
 In this fable of ''the Communist moment,'' Mr. Ledgard's human characters include Emil, a hemodynamicist (he studies the movement of blood through the body) who reads Dickens, and Amina, an orphaned factory worker named for the heroine of Vincenzo Bellini's opera ''La Sonnambula,'' who feels awakened by the giraffes' arrival.

HEADLINE: Inflation Gives Signs Of Slowing 

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The government's latest report on consumer prices, issued yesterday, suggests that inflation is slowing.
 The overall rise came to a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in July, mainly because of a surge in gasoline prices and in the monthly cost of renting a home, even as the housing market itself deteriorated.
Nothing else went up very much, the government reported, and apparel prices plunged because of deep discounts in women's summer clothing as retailers sought to work down inventories. 
 This latest reading for the Consumer Price Index comes a week after the Federal Reserve halted its string of 17 consecutive interest rate increases. 
 The Fed argued that a slowing economy, in response to the accumulating rate increases, justified the pause -- and that the slowdown, in turn, would moderate inflation. Yesterday's report seemed to support that contention.
 ''What has started as a pause is maturing into a full stop,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. 
 The mild inflation data sent stocks sharply higher yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.86 percent to reach its highest level in three months, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.63 percent. [Page C14.]
 A surge in gasoline prices last month -- not yet repeated in August -- accounted for much of the 0.4 percent increase. Excluding energy and similarly volatile food prices, the so-called core inflation rate rose 0.2 percent, the smallest increase in five months.
 Core inflation ''was on the tamer side of what people on Wall Street expected,'' said James Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. 
 The bond market seemed to agree. Yields fell on the 10-year Treasury note, apparently in anticipation of milder inflation. Mortgage rates often move in tandem with 10-year Treasury yields. 
 The Fed's policy makers focus on core inflation, and so do most forecasters. Not only was the 0.2 percent increase less than expected, but more than half of it was a result of a jump in the monthly cost of renting a home, said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the monthly Consumer Price Index. 
 ''You had a sharp movement from renters to buyers with the advent of low interest rates and now you are getting the converse,'' Mr. Jackman said. ''The rising interest rates have made it more difficult for renters to become homeowners, and that has tightened the rental market.''
 Reflecting the declining demand for home ownership, new single-family home construction fell 2.5 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.795 million starts, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The number of building permits filed for future construction fell 6.5 percent, the largest monthly decline since September 1999. 
 In yet another report issued yesterday measuring the economy, the government said that industrial production rose 0.4 percent in July on top of a 0.8 percent increase in June.
 Some of the July rise was a result of an increase in the output of electricity to keep air-conditioners going during a particularly hot month. But factories also operated at a faster pace, prompting Richard Berner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley, to argue that many companies still have enough pricing power to keep inflation front-and-center as an issue.
 ''This new consumer price report does not mark the beginning of lower inflation,'' Mr. Berner said. 
 That is true. Core inflation in July was up 2.7 percent year over year. By comparison, the annualized rate was 2.1 percent in January. Most of the increase came in the spring. The rise in the annual rate was only 0.1 percent last month, but it has not yet fallen.
 Mr. Berner predicted that the Fed would raise rates at least one more time this year, and then at some point next year, its policy makers ''will back off, but the circumstances will be when they begin to see inflation come down.''
 That is already happening to over-all inflation; prices were 4.3 percent higher in June than 12 months earlier, and 4.1 percent higher in July. The downward trend is likely to continue in August, if for no other reason than gasoline prices. 
 They rose 5.3 percent in July, but were up only 1.3 percent, on average, in the first two weeks of August.
 In the case of core inflation, housing dominated the 0.2 percent increase. The Consumer Price Index does not measure fluctuations in housing prices. Rather, the Bureau of Labor Statistics relies on a survey of 6,000 rental properties in representative neighborhoods to determine the cost of living in a home. 
 Rent, in effect, becomes a proxy for the monthly cost of home ownership. What homes sell for plays no role.
 Each month's survey is compared with a similar rental survey six months earlier, and the result is weighted to represent 30 percent of the entire Consumer Price Index. Housing in July, measured this way, rose 0.3 percent. 
 That rise represented more than half of the 0.2 percent increase in the core inflation rate, which is so much a focus of the Fed and of Wall Street's forecasters.
 ''It's a quirky way of measuring the cost of shelter,'' Mr. Glassman said, ''at a time when home prices are going down and most mortgage payments are fixed.''
 Elsewhere in the monthly index, airline fares were up in July, mainly because of rising fuel costs. But with the summer travel season ending, discounted fares are starting to be advertised, Mr. Jackman said. 
 Medical care, another source of rising prices, went up only 0.2 percent in July, the smallest rise in six months. That easing may continue in August as patent protection -- and pricing power -- ends for two big-selling drugs: Zocor and Zoloft.
 ''We were getting inflationary pressure from the medical sector,'' Mr. Glassman said, ''and now we are getting some relief.''

HEADLINE: What Baseball Can Teach Those Who Dream of Creating the Next Silicon Valley 

BYLINE: By Austan Goolsbee. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a research fellow at the American Bar Foundation. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THEY say that everything is bigger in Texas. Last week, the state tried to bring that attitude to academics with the announcement of a $2.5 billion initiative for science teaching and research in the University of Texas system. The hope, it seems, is to use the university system to jump-start economic development and continue to move Texas away from its traditional dependence on energy, raw materials and real estate.
 A primary focus is building the research capacity at campuses away from the flagship in Austin, with much of the money going for science centers at campuses in San Antonio, El Paso and Arlington in an attempt to turn those places into the next Silicon Valley. 
We have heard that argument before. And Texas, which has a bona fide technology center in Austin, is certainly not alone in wanting to create new Silicon Valleys: states all over the country are trying to turn their universities into engines of regional economic development.
 If Stanford can hatch world-famous companies around Palo Alto, politicians assume, their colleges can, too. But with so many trying to spin universities away from their traditional academic focus into engines of economic development, it is worth considering whether investing in local universities can achieve that goal.
 This strategy is based on the view that research done by professors can form the basis for local start-up companies and that the graduates of the university can supply the entrepreneurs and employees.
 But advocates should remember an old maxim of economic development: Beware of investing in things that can move. As it turns out, graduates and research ideas both tend to move around a lot. 
 Subsidizing teaching is problematic as a development strategy because graduates frequently move out of state.
 A study by the economists John Bound, Jeffrey Groen and Gabor Kezdi of the University of Michigan and Sarah Turner of the University of Virginia, ''Trade in University Training: Cross-State Variation in the Production and Stock of College-Educated Labor,'' (http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15840383) found little evidence of people staying in places because they went to college there.
 The more likely smart people are to leave, the more money their state is spending on helping another area's economy develop. Marc Andreessen, for example, invented the Web browser while at the University of Illinois, but then founded Netscape in the actual Silicon Valley rather than starting a new one in Urbana.
 Texas may subsidize science teaching at the University of Texas, El Paso, but the chance that its graduates will stay and transform the local area into Silicon Rio Grande is remote. 
 So if a state's subsidies to graduates from a university will not create new Silicon Valleys, how about subsidizing the research? There is no question that academic research has hatched many of today's booming technology industries. But scientific and engineering ideas also travel quickly.
 Recall the 1980's, when Japanese companies rose to prominence by producing things that had been invented in the United States, like photocopiers, computer memory chips and video recorders.
 In a recent study of the determinants of the creation of high-tech firms in different locations, ''Movement of Star Scientists and Engineers and High-Tech Firm Entry'' (www.nber.org/papers/w12172), Professors Lynne G. Zucker and Michael R. Darby of the University of California, Los Angeles, examined the importance of what they called ''disembodied discoveries.''
 They looked at such factors as having successful patents at universities or where highly influential science articles had originated. They found little evidence that the ideas helped local businesses any more than businesses in other areas.
 For every Stanford in Silicon Valley, there seem to be several Purdues in West Lafayette, Ind., or Cornells of Ithaca, N.Y. -- places filled with path-breaking discoveries but with local economies that are seldom seen as the next Silicon Valley.
 The one thing the study does find to be consistently associated with high-tech start-ups is the presence of star scientists -- not the ideas, which can be copied, but the scientists themselves. This seems to be the one way in which a university can be used as an engine of business growth.
 Landing the best scientists in the world can start a place on the way to economic superstardom. The catch is, there are not many superstars and they mainly want to be near one another.
 The study covered 1981-2004 but identified only 1,838 scientific superstars. That is about the same number of people who played in Major League Baseball over that period. 
 Framed that way, trying to make some town into the next Silicon Valley by attracting the best scientists is rather like trying to start a new baseball team and turn it into the New York Yankees. If dozens of sports-mad billionaire team owners can't do that, how easy would it be for the economic development office at the University of Texas, Arlington? 
 What is worse, it is a safe bet that as these development incentives become a primary motivation for financing higher education, the competition among universities for stars will start looking much more like today's baseball scene. Ambitious state university systems will find it easier to steal the stars of another team than to develop their own prospects. As a result, salaries will go through the roof -- just as in baseball.
 And while everyone pays more, only a tiny number of cities will ever win the World Series. One will increasingly hear about how the costs of college are rising everywhere and that local economies have little to show for it. 
 Universities are immensely important and they are filled with students and ideas. Some of those students will go on to be famous. Some of those ideas will change the world. But counting on them to make you the next Silicon Valley is, alas, more like betting on my beloved Cubs to win it all.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Regional Inflation Moderated 

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in the New York region last month, the smallest rise since February, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. In the last 12 months, the index, which is the primary gauge of inflation, has risen 5 percent. That annual rate was down from 5.6 percent in June, which had been the highest recorded in the region since December 1990, said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of labor statistics. In July, rising costs of housing and energy contributed to inflation, but were partially offset by a sharp drop in the price of women's clothing, Mr. Dolfman said. PATRICK McGEEHAN (NYT)

PERSON: Gen. Alfredo Stroessner

HEADLINE: Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, Ruled Paraguay Through Fear for 35 Years, Dies in Exile at 93

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the former president of Paraguay whose harsh and capricious 35-year hold on power made him South America's most enduring dictator during the cold war and gave him the aura of a character out of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel, died yesterday. He was 93. 
 The cause of death was a stroke, The Associated Press said, citing information from a grandson, Alfredo Dominguez Stroessner.
General Stroessner had lived in Brazil since 1989, moving there after his ouster by his second in command, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, a relative by marriage. 
 Formally, General Stroessner was a fugitive from justice, wanted by the Paraguayan courts for trial on charges of homicide. Despite an extradition treaty between Brazil and Paraguay, however, there were never any serious moves to bring the general to justice in his home country, where his cabinet members and associates remained the stewards of government long after his fall.
 Under the terms of his asylum in Brazil, General Stroessner was forbidden to get involved in politics, and he unfailingly stuck to his part of the bargain. He and a son, Gustavo Adolfo, split their time between a gated house by the South Lake in Brasilia, the capital, and a fazenda, or ranch, outside Belo Horizonte. 
 General Stroessner, a tall, husky artilleryman proud of his crisp military bearing, seized power in Paraguay in 1954, through a coup. He quickly won American help in establishing his secret police, but hopes that his dictatorship would give way to democracy faded during a string of elections in which he faced token or no opposition and which were generally considered to be fraudulent. During his long rule, Paraguay was the country with the most uneven distribution of land and wealth.
 Under General Stroessner, Paraguay's security forces became so efficient at intimidating potential opposition figures that eventually fear itself -- fear of arrest, torture, exile and murder -- became one of his prime levers for staying in power. 
 The country became a haven for Nazis, with new passports and visas sold for a price. Among those sheltered was Josef Mengele, the ''Angel of Death'' who selected victims for the gas chambers at Auschwitz and conducted medical experiments on humans. In addition, hundreds of political prisoners and their families were imprisoned at concentration camps like Emboscada, about 20 miles outside the capital city of Asuncion, in the 1970's. 
 The other keys to General's Stroessner's longevity as president were his alliance with the Colorado Party, which remains in power today; his grip on the military; and his skill at exploiting the weaknesses of others. The general also found help in Paraguay's authoritarian past, which effectively paved the way for dictatorship by one figure or another. ''He didn't break any prior democratic tradition, as existed in other countries,'' said Alfredo Boccia Paz, a physician in Asuncion who has written several books on the Stroessner era.
 Never one for understatement, President Stroessner's name, written in neon, flashed nightly over the Asuncion cityscape during his reign, and his face was plastered daily in newspapers and on television. He was known for turning up in his powder-blue military uniform every Thursday at the general staff headquarters of the armed forces, driving home his authority as commander in chief. 
 One former American ambassador to Paraguay, Robert E. White, remembered General Stroessner as darkly brilliant at profiting from others' mistakes. Once, Mr. White recalled, the Paraguayan ambassador to Argentina had gambled away the embassy's entire budget. The ambassador was immediately summoned to Asuncion and was handed a confession to sign. General Stroessner then promoted him to foreign minister. ''He could never have an independent thought or deed after that,'' Mr. White explained.
 General Stroessner's takeover in 1954 put an end to decades of instability, in which presidential faces seemed as fleeting as the pictures on a slot machine. His small landlocked nation had no experience of a democratic transition of power in its 143-year history. 
 Paraguay was an underpopulated backwater the size of California, with a penchant for wars that would swallow its male population in battles of dubious, if operatic, purpose. Among the worst was a disastrous war Paraguay waged simultaneously against Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil from 1865 to 1870, which shrank its population from 525,000 to 221,000 and left the nation with only 28,000 men. 
 The 1930's and 40's were a period of turmoil for Paraguay, which suffered 100,000 dead between 1932 and 1935 in a war with Bolivia over the desolate Chaco region, a swampland that ultimately had none of the mineral resources the two sides imagined were there. 
 It was in the Chaco War, however, that Alfredo Stroessner distinguished himself and was promoted to second lieutenant of artillery. By the time the war ended, he had been promoted again to first lieutenant. 
 The son of a German immigrant from Bavaria and his indigenous peasant wife, a member of the majority Guarani people, Alfredo Stroessner was born Nov. 3, 1912, in Encarnacion, on the Argentine border southeast of Asuncion. His father, Hugo Stroessner, was an accountant at a brewery. President Stroessner seldom spoke of his parents, and his official biography listed no siblings. 
 His studies geared young Alfredo for a military life. He completed his basic education in Asuncion and in Rio de Janeiro, entering the Asuncion Military College in 1929. Before completing his studies there, he joined the war effort against Bolivia. In 1940, he traveled to Brazil for artillery training, and in 1943, Captain Stroessner was honored with a nomination to Paraguay's Superior War College, graduating in 1945. 
 He profited well from the power grabs that surrounded him, typically backing and then betraying the presidents he served , according to Paul H. Lewis, author of the 1980 book, ''Paraguay Under Stroessner.'' He climbed from commander of an artillery regiment to commander in chief of the army in 1951.
 Between 1948 and 1954, six presidents of Paraguay were overthrown through military takeovers. After his own successful coup, General Stroessner repelled two efforts to unseat him, one in 1955 by Epifanio Mendez Fleitas, president of the Central Bank, who was a friend of President Juan Domingo Peron of Argentina, and another in November 1956 by Rafael Franco, a former dictator.
 In 1959, General Stroessner briefly experimented with lifting a state of siege that had been in force since 1930, and restoring constitutional liberties. But when student protests over trolley fare increases broke out, so did the reflexes of the iron hand. General Stroessner restored the state of siege, and the police put an end to the demonstrations with the wholesale arrest and torture of the protesters.
 ''Were it not for an occasional headless body floating down the Parana River, it might be possible to consider the gaudily uniformed and medaled dictator of Paraguay -- the last of the breed in South America -- a character out of Gilbert and Sullivan,'' Joseph P. Lash wrote in The New York Post in 1961. 
 But General Stroessner surprised the political pundits and held on through seven successive elections marked by rigged voting. In time he became the prototype for a new crop of South American dictators friendly to American interests. Backed by the United States, military rulers later seized power in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia. 
 Security forces in these countries worked closely together, formalizing their cooperation in a joint intelligence plan called Operation Condor. Though Condor's official goal was to undercut Marxist or terrorist threats to the dictatorships, in practice it served to uproot almost any political opposition or stirrings for democracy in its member nations.
 General Stroessner's harshest repression occurred in the 1950's and the 1970's. Senator Carlos Levi Rufinelli, the leader of the opposition Liberal party, had been imprisoned 19 times and tortured 6 times by 1975. ''Most of the time I did not know what they wanted,'' he told The New York Times that year. ''They did not even know what they wanted. But when they put the needles under your fingernails, you tell them anything. You denounce everybody, and then they say, 'See, you were lying to us all the time.' ''
 President Stroessner enjoyed all the trappings of dictatorship: guaranteed electoral victories, an absence of checks and balances, unremitting public adulation and regular kickbacks. Nonetheless, he bridled at being called a dictator. ''So, you have come to see the dictator,'' he once told a visiting reporter in the 1960's. ''He was unsmiling, and there was flat sarcasm in his voice,'' the reporter noted.
 General Stroessner frequently complained that the international news media overlooked the advances he had brought to Paraguay. His most ambitious project was the multibillion-dollar Itaipu Dam, the largest in the world at the time of its construction in the 1970's. Brazil financed it in exchange for the right to purchase electricity at reduced rates for several years. Throughout his decades in office, he made a practice of personally inaugurating every new school or filtration station that opened and inviting the entire diplomatic corps to watch. 
 John Vinocur, writing in The New York Times Magazine in 1984, offered this snapshot of Paraguay as its army goose-stepped down the boulevards to celebrate General Stroessner's 30 years in power: ''A continual state of siege over the entire period that literally places the president above the law; people with occasionally uncontrollable urges to fall into rivers or jump from planes with their arms and legs bound; serenades in front of the presidential palace featuring the ever-popular 'Forward, My General' and 'Congratulations, My Great Friend'; foreign thieves, brutes and madmen hidden at a price; an economy administered so corruptly it is officially explained away as the 'cost of peace'; a United Nations voting record on so-called key issues more favorable to the United States than any other 'ally;' a party newspaper that prints six front-page color pictures of the general every day.''
 George Landau, who preceded Mr. White as the American ambassador, recalled that General Stroessner treated his cabinet roughly. ''He was God to them,'' Mr. Landau said. 
 For his part, Mr. Landau described the Paraguay of General Stroessner as ''benign, as dictatorships go.'' Those arrested, he said, could usually win release if they had friends in the right places. He said that many times, President Stroessner complained that he wanted only to retire to a life of fishing and hunting, but that his country needed him. 
 ''He believed, as most dictators do, that he was absolutely irreplaceable,'' Mr. Landau recalled.
 President Stroessner got his chance to retire in February 1989, when a military faction led by General Rodriguez seized power in a coup. General Rodriguez, who was nicknamed the Tiger, pounced when he appeared to be losing his standing in the battle for succession after President Stroessner's death. 
 Rebel troops attacked the presidential guard and ended the Stroessner era, after one-third of a century, with eight hours of combat that caused numerous casualties. Paraguayans celebrated in the streets as General Rodriguez spoke of democracy and human rights. But he promoted himself to president the day after the coup, and was voted into the job three months later. It was not until 1993 that Paraguayans could elect a civilian president. 
 President Stroessner did not leave in disgrace, but flew out of Asuncion airport after a ceremony that Paraguayans who watched it on television remember as being more suitable for a statesman embarking on an overseas visit than a fleeing dictator. 
 His ouster came through military jockeying, rather than from a democratic groundswell, and little changed in Paraguay immediately after his departure. Civil liberties eventually returned, but citizens were so disconnected from the political system and so conditioned to fear that they had little to say. The same acceptance of corruption prevailed, and even the faces of the leaders remained the same for several years. 
 ''What you have is Stroessnerism without Stroessner,'' Mr. Landau said in an interview in 1999. ''Not in terms of civil liberties, but in terms of corruption.'' 
 Once in exile, General Stroessner never traveled openly outside of Brazil, perhaps fearful of sharing the fate of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who traveled to London for medical care and ended up fighting extradition to Spain to face trial for his acts as dictator of Chile.
 Mr. Landau said General Stroessner wrote him around 1997, asking for help in securing authorization to visit the United States for a gallbladder operation. The ambassador advised the general to stay away, warning that he could become the target for a lawsuit by Paraguayans. General Stroessner ended up having the operation in Sao Paulo, Mr. Landau said.
 General Stroessner was married to the former Eligia Mora. They had a daughter, Graciela Concepcion de Dominguez, and another son, Alfredo, who died in the 1980's; he had been a cocaine addict who had married General Rodriguez's daughter Martha and had treated her badly. It was not clear who survived him, other than his grandson. 
 Martin Almada, a schoolteacher imprisoned during the 1970's as an ''intellectual terrorist,'' said General Stroessner's legacy was ''terror and corruption.'' Mr. Almada's wife died at the age of 33 after, he said, security agents played her a tape of his screams under torture. 
 In 1992, Mr. Almada discovered a trove of government documents that came to be known as the Archives of Terror, which detailed the political arrests of thousands of Paraguayans and unveiled the workings of Operation Condor. ''Fear became our second skin,'' Mr. Almada said.

HEADLINE: Hungry for Fresh Recruits, Cult-Like Islamic Groups Know Just When to Pounce

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL; Souad Mekhennet contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
When he converted to Islam six years ago, Nicholas Lock said, he faced two immediate difficulties. One was the aggressive skepticism of his father, an English professor and Oxford graduate who mockingly asked, ''Do we have a convert on our hands?'' and then proceeded to cook pork for dinner -- bacon, sausages, chops -- every night for a week. 
 The other, potentially more troubling in its way, was the greedily opportunistic reaction of various Muslim groups to Mr. Lock when he arrived at the University of Leeds to begin his studies that fall. They fell upon him as if he were a prodigal son.
''As a new convert, when you first become a Muslim, a lot of people try things out on you,'' said Mr. Lock, 24, who also uses the Muslim given name Mahdi and runs a support network for Muslim converts in Nottingham. ''They want you to come to this meeting, this talk. Certain radical groups want you because you're impressionable, and it looks good to get white guys.'' 
 Mr. Lock likened some of the organizations that approached him to cults, like Hizb ut-Tahrir, which says it is nonviolent but preaches the establishment of a caliphate, or pan-Islamic government, and has been banned from some Middle Eastern countries. ''They think you don't know anything, and they pounce.'' 
 The potential vulnerability of converts to extremism -- especially young men --is of particular concern now, considering that 3 of the 24 people arrested last week on suspicion of plotting to use explosives to blow up trans-Atlantic airplanes were converts. Neighbors and friends of the three have said that at least from the outside, it appeared that their transformations from aimless Western youths to highly observant Muslims were bewilderingly thorough.
 One of the suspects, Abdul Waheed, whose late father was a local Conservative Party official, is said to have converted within the last six months, changing his appearance, behavior and friends, and marrying a Muslim woman believed to be from Morocco.
 In addition, Richard Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, was a British-born convert to Islam who discovered religion while serving a prison sentence for a string of petty street crimes and muggings. He is currently serving a life sentence in the United States after being convicted of trying to blow up an airplane over the Atlantic by igniting explosives in his shoe.
 There are no official statistics on how many converts to Islam live in Britain. Yahya Birt, a convert who is a research fellow at the Islamic Center in rural Leicestershire, puts the number at slightly more than 14,000, an extrapolation based on the number of people who described themselves as Islamic converts in the Scottish 2001 census (the census for England and Wales did not ask about conversion).
 Clearly, only a minuscule percentage of converts turn to active radicalism, and there are many reasons for converting: an admiration of Islamic texts and practices; a desire by women to remove themselves from what they perceive as the aggressive sexualization of Western life; the countercultural rebellion of the younger generation against their parents' liberalism; a sense of outrage at Western policy in places like Iraq and Lebanon. 
 But among young people in Britain, a common theme seems to be adolescent anomie, a longing for answers in a world full of intractable questions. 
 ''It's not a physical thing -- it's a passionate approach,'' said Khalad Walaad, a spokesman for the Bradford Islamic Center, in the north of England. ''When someone is looking for something, it's us who can lead him as a human being.''
 Myfanwy Franks, a researcher who has studied converts to Islam and is the author of ''Women and Revivalism in the West: Choosing Fundamentalism in a Liberal Democracy,'' said, ''Being troubled does not necessarily lead people to conversion -- people who aren't troubled convert -- but it could lead to extreme radicalization.'' 
 Mentioning reports in the news media that Mr. Waheed was a heavy drinker and drug user before turning to Islam, Ms. Franks added: ''I think there's a tendency for some people, when they stop using some kind of addictive substance, to be left with a big hole in their lives. To do something extreme is the easiest way to go, because it fills that big hole.'' 
 Britain has a number of well-known converts, including Mr. Birt, 38, who is the son of John Birt, the former director general of the British Broadcasting Corporation and who changed his name from Jonathan when he converted, 16 years ago; Joe Ahmed-Dobson, 30, the son of Frank Dobson, a former Labor health secretary; and the singer and Muslim campaigner Yusuf Islam, formerly known as Cat Stevens. 
 Perhaps the highest-profile female convert is Yvonne Ridley, a former correspondent for The Sunday Express who began studying Islam after she was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. Now the host of a daily current affairs talk program on the Islamic Channel, Ms. Ridley, who wears a hijab that covers her hair and neck, said that Islam for her is a welcome antidote to Western libertinism. ''What's more liberating -- being judged on the size of your I.Q., or on the size of your bust?'' Divorced, with a 13-year-old daughter, she has stopped drinking and having flings. ''I never sit in, waiting for the telephone to ring,'' she said, ''and I'm never dragged in to immaterial rows by inconsiderate, useless men.'' 
 Many converts are apolitical, but for people like Ms. Ridley, who says that ''this war on terror is a war on Islam,'' religion is inextricably bound with politics. Increasingly, that seems to be the case, among Muslims in general, and among converts.
 ''It's become much more political since 9/11,'' Ms. Franks, the researcher, said. 
 Before Sept. 11, converts tended to discuss spiritualism and personal choice, she said, ''but now they're not talking like that.'' She added: ''I think there's this polarization now. It's like the middle ground has disappeared.'' Where women once tended to wear head scarves -- even in her hometown of Bradford, in West Yorkshire -- she says that she sees many more in garments that cover their entire bodies, including their eyes. ''It's a political statement,'' she said.
 For young white men in economically blighted sections of the north, where jobs are scarce and disaffection is high, she said, Islam speaks to their masculinity, offering a place of refuge and a solid political base from which to reject their heritage. ''The greater Muslim community is transnational and supranational,'' she said. ''It gives them an identify and a togetherness which is inevitably going to be against the West, because of their identity with other Muslims.''
 Since the government began cracking down on imams who preach violent jihad against the West, many mosques have posted signs that expressly forbid political discussion inside. So recruiters who single out converts or the newly pious tend to do it on the streets outside the mosque or in universities and prisons, with their captive and impressionable populations. 
 ''A lot of conversion happens at life changes, and there's no doubt that you have radical recruiters who see new converts who come in to the faith as really good targets for their perverted ideologies,'' Mr. Birt said. ''The crucial thing is getting them near the time of their conversion, when they're not settled in, where there's a lot of feelings and emotions.''

HEADLINE: 6 Native Nations, and None Have a Word for 'Suburbia' 

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MASON

DATELINE: CALEDONIA, Ontario, Aug. 10 

 BODY:
Blame it on the American Revolution. 
 At the time, six Indian tribes that had lived for centuries in what is now upstate New York sided with the British Crown, lost and were forced from their lands. For their troubles, however, Britain granted them a paradise rich in moose and deer, across the new border, in southern Ontario.
Today the game are largely gone. The wilderness has been transformed into suburban sprawl. The once pristine lands of the so-called Six Nations Reserve have been whittled away. 
 This year, one more housing development on the edge of town was one too many, and the Native Canadians decided to make a stand. 
 Since February, hundreds have blockaded roads, set bonfires, confronted the police with bags of rocks and lacrosse sticks, cut the maple leaf out of a Canadian flag and refused to obey court orders to vacate. During the height of tensions, a van was driven into a power station and set on fire, leaving residents in the dark for days. 
 The protests have become the knottiest of Canada's many native land disputes and paralyzed the local economy. 
 ''Some businesses are down 30, 40 percent,'' said Neil Dring, who publishes a weekly newspaper here. ''This has really hurt.'' 
 For the Native Canadians, however, the dispute is a matter of mending a broken promise by the government to manage the land on their behalf. ''Through the years, our people said, 'You can come here, you can settle here,' but that didn't mean they could take over,'' said Hazel Hill, who lives on the reserve. 
 Police officers brought in from all over the province now watch the occupied site around the clock, while town residents whose backyards border the land must show identification to be allowed down their street. 
 Confrontations have been laced with racial slurs and crude signs. Native Canadian protesters have surrounded the site with traditional flags, and many don fatigues when tensions are at their highest. 
 In early August, Native Canadians used a fire hose to repel crowds who marched to the site from the town to protest their refusal to obey a court order to leave the disputed land. 
 ''People who live near the site are stressed beyond belief,'' said Jason Clark, who lives in town. ''They see flags flying and people wearing camouflage -- it's intimidating.'' 
 A mile down the road from the site, downtown Caledonia is slow moving and rich in history. Canadian flags line the main street and businesses are a mix of restored heritage buildings and newer developments that have come with the town's growing status as a bedroom community for cities like Hamilton and Brantford. 
 ''We had a tremendous amount of housing growth in recent years,'' Mr. Clark said. ''But that's come to a complete stop. That occupation is creating a lot of economic hardships in Caledonia.'' 
 The police conducted a raid on the protesters in April, but they retreated when waves of Native Canadians arrived to reinforce the occupation. 
 ''They really did us a favor,'' Mrs. Hill said of the raid. ''That's when internal politics were put aside and everyone came together.'' 
 The occupied land covers 100 acres among tens of thousands taken over by the government from the Native Canadians in the 19th century after a disagreement that lasted decades over whether the Native Canadians had the right to sell their land to British settlers. 
 The Native Canadians filed a lawsuit over the land in 1995, on behalf of the Six Nations: the Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida and Tuscarora. But, tired of waiting while housing developments encroached on the land, they took matters into their own hands. 
 A younger generation of Native Canadians has led a resurgence of indigenous culture across the country. Unlike many of their parents and grandparents, these Native Canadians did not attend residential schools, where Native Canadian students were often hit with a strap for speaking their own languages. Entire generations of culture were submerged. 
 The revival has not only restored pride; it has also opened old wounds over how the British and, later, Canadian governments negotiated land deals with chiefs. 
 In one such deal, chiefs had signed a document that the British interpreted as surrendering the land where Toronto now sits, but it was later disclosed that the chiefs had signed a blank piece of paper. 
 Native bands elsewhere are watching Caledonia, wondering if the protesters here have found a new way of forcing governments to settle land claims, or at least expedite them. The brash and confrontational nature of the dispute contrasts with the glacial system the Canadian government uses to settle land claims with its Native Canadian population. 
 Of the 29 claims filed by the Six Nations since the 1970's, only one has been settled. There are some 770 outstanding claims across Canada, with more than twice as many claims coming in each year as are being settled. 
 ''They've created a system to deal with these land disputes, but they take years in the courts,'' Mrs. Hill said at the barricaded entrance to the occupation. ''They're the ones with the money who can afford that process. We decided it was time to deal with things differently.'' 
 Whether their approach will work depends on politicians, the behavior of protesters on both sides, and the response by the police. 
 Nearly six months into the occupation, the Native Canadians have persuaded the provincial government to buy the disputed land from developers while forcing both sides to begin negotiating a settlement. 
 The question is whether, in the meantime, the Native Canadians and the townspeople can keep the peace. 
 ''I'm concerned that at some point we're going to see more violence,'' said Mr. Clark, the Caledonia resident. ''That's not a threat, that's just reality. People can only withstand so much.''

HEADLINE: Is Hamas Ready To Deal?

BYLINE: By Scott Atran. 
Scott Atran is a research scientist at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris, the University of Michigan and the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.

DATELINE: Paris 

 BODY:
WHATEVER the endgame between Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas, one thing is certain: Israel's hopes of ensuring its security by walling itself off from resentful neighbors are dead. One lesson from Israel's assault on Lebanon and its military operation in Gaza is that the missiles blow back. 
 We can hope that multinational cooperation will help to secure Israel's border with Lebanon. But what about the Palestinian issue, which has been seemingly pushed to the back burner by the war in Lebanon?
A bold gesture now by Israel would surprise its adversaries, convey strength, and even catch domestic political opposition off guard. And as strange as it may seem, were the United States able to help Israel help Hamas, it might turn the rising tide of global Muslim resentment. 
 Recent discussions I've had with Hamas leaders and their supporters around the globe indicate that Israel might just find a reasonable and influential bargaining partner. 
 Hamas's top elected official, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, now accepts that to stop his people's suffering, his government must forsake its all-or-nothing call for Israel's destruction. ''We have no problem with a sovereign Palestinian state over all our lands within the 1967 borders, living in calm,'' Mr. Haniya told me in his Gaza City office in late June, shortly before an Israeli missile destroyed it. ''But we need the West as a partner to help us through.'' 
 Mr. Haniya's government had just agreed to a historic compromise with Fatah and its leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, forming a national coalition that implicitly accepts the coexistence alongside Israel. But this breakthrough was quickly overshadowed by Israel's offensive into Gaza in retaliation for the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, by Palestinian militants, including members of Hamas's military wing. 
 Many Israelis consider the rescue of a soldier a ''sacred value,'' worth almost any cost, including military action leading to other Israeli soldiers dying. But the Israeli offensive also had a larger strategic goal: to destroy whatever potential the Hamas government had to prevent Israel from unilaterally redrawing its boundaries to include some West Bank settlements. Doing so was something that Israel had intended as soon as it could convince the United States that with Hamas having defeated Fatah at the polls, there was no legitimate Palestinian partner to negotiate with. 
 Khaled Meshal, the Damascus-based head of the Hamas politburo, refused to release Corporal Shalit unless Israel freed hundreds of prisoners. While it is true that Israel has shown willingness to release hundreds of Palestinian detainees in return for a single Israeli in the past, Mr. Meshal's stand might have been part of a larger political game. 
 As a senior adviser to President Abbas told me of Mr. Meshal: ''He has tried to undermine the Haniya government's authority by presenting himself as Hamas's true decision maker, and he will not be remembered as the person who legitimized Israel and sacrificed sacred land.''
 Prime Minster Haniya and many of Hamas's other Sunni leaders are known to be uncomfortable with the loose coalition that Mr. Meshal has been forging with Shiite Iran and Hezbollah. Hasan Yusuf, a Hamas official held in Israel's Ketziot prison, doesn't think President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran's declaration that the main solution to the Middle East crisis is for the elimination of the ''Zionist regime'' is practical or wise. ''The outcome in Lebanon doesn't change our view,'' Mr. Yusuf informed me last weekend. ''We believe in two states living side by side.''
 He also said that ''all Hamas factions have agreed to a unilateral cease-fire, including halting Qassam rockets; the movement is ready to go farther if it receives any encouraging responses from Israel and the West.''
 But even moderate Hamas figures feel that as long as Israel, the United States and Europe boycott the elected government in Gaza and the West Bank, there is little choice but to accept whatever help comes along. 
 This is doubly unfortunate. While Mr. Meshal says Islam allows only a long-term truce with Israel, Hamas officials closer to Prime Minister Haniya believe that a formal peace deal is possible, especially if negotiations can begin out of the spotlight and proceed by degrees. 
 ''You can't expect us to take off all of our clothes at once,'' one Hamas leader told me, ''or we'll be naked in the cold, like Arafat in his last years.'' This official said that if Hamas moved too fast, it would alienate its base, but if his government continued to be isolated, the base would radicalize. ''Either way, you could wind up with a bunch of little Al Qaedas.'' 
 Although Prime Minister Haniya has more popular support, Mr. Meshal controls the militias and the money. If financing -- perhaps from moderate Arab states -- could be channeled to Mr. Haniya's government for social services like salaries, fuel, food, building repairs, garbage collection and so forth, then Mr. Meshal's (mostly Iranian) bankroll would be less of a factor, and popular pressure could help rein in Hamas's military wing. 
 Prime Minister Haniya's position comes down to this: ''We need you, as you need us.'' For the United States and Europe, the stakes are also high. Mr. Haniya wants Americans and Europeans to recognize that the region has welcomed Hamas's election to power as a genuine exercise in democracy. 
 If America were to engage his government, he believes, it would be the West's best opportunity to reverse its steep decline in the esteem of Arabs and Muslims everywhere. ''We need a dialogue of civilizations,'' he said, ''not a clash of civilizations.'' 
 A survey by the Pew Center's Global Attitudes Project released in June found that Muslim opinions about the West had worsened drastically over the past year. 
 This month President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, warned that continued Middle East hostilities involving Israel ''will radicalize the Muslim world, even those of us who are moderate today. From there, it will be just one step away to that ultimate nightmare: a clash of civilizations.'' 
 But Khurshid Ahmad, a senator in Pakistan and leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, one of the world's oldest and most important Islamist movements, recently told me that if Hamas accepted a two-state solution, ''with both Palestine and Israel having full economic, political and military sovereignty over their pre-1967 territories, and with Palestinians allowed into Palestine and Jews into Israel, then I would recommend this solution to the entire Muslim community.'' 
 Tangible results, like prisoner exchanges, are important. However, so are symbolic actions. Hamas officials have stressed the importance of Israel's recognizing their suffering from the original loss of Palestinian land. And survey research of Palestinian refugees and Hamas by my colleagues and I, supported by the National Science Foundation, reliably finds that violent opposition to peace decreases if the adversary is seen to compromise its own moral position, even if the compromise has no material value. 
 ''Israel freeing some of our prisoners will help us to stop others from attacking it,'' said the Hamas government spokesman, Ghazi Hamad. ''But Israel must apologize for our tragedy in 1948 before we can talk about negotiating over our right of return to historic Palestine.'' 
 As the Pew survey made clear, the Israel-Palestinian issue has become the principal fault line in world conflict. There would be some sad satisfaction if the bloodshed in Gaza and at the Lebanon border served as a starting point for bringing the larger conflict to an end.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Hired After Storm Sue New Orleans Hotel Executive

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
In a new twist on the labor problems bedeviling New Orleans, a group of guest workers from Latin America, brought in to maintain some of the city's hotels after Hurricane Katrina, filed a lawsuit yesterday complaining that they were being shortchanged by a prominent hotel executive and developer.
 The workers are in the country legally on visas obtained for them by Decatur Hotels, which is owned by F. Patrick Quinn III, a real estate investor who became known for his determination to find opportunity in the wake of the hurricane. 
 Drawn to New Orleans by promises that they would work 40 hours a week plus overtime, the workers said, they are instead working as little as 10 hours a week for as little as $6.14 an hour, and, under the terms of their visas, cannot find other jobs. That has left them unable to repay several thousand dollars owed to recruiters in their home countries of Peru, Bolivia and the Dominican Republic.
 ''The amount of money we are earning, it's not enough to get our investment back and to send money home -- it's not enough to survive,'' said Rodolfo A. Valdez-Baez, 40, who said he borrowed $3,000 to get the job and to pay for travel to and from the Dominican Republic.
 Among other labor problems, illegal workers have complained of abuse in the region's reconstruction industry, and local residents have complained they are being undercut for rebuilding jobs. 
 In a statement, Mr. Quinn said the workers were brought in after much of the local work force had evacuated after Hurricane Katrina. He said his company, which operates 15 hotels in central New Orleans, contracted ''with an international work force recruitment company so it could continue to operate and house first responders, evacuees, volunteers, workers and guests.''
 He added, ''To further the recovery efforts, Decatur Hotels has provided many additional benefits outside the scope of the agreement.'' 
 His statement did not address the specific issues in the lawsuit. 
 The workers said they were paying $50 a week to stay in hotel rooms provided by the company. 
 Almost since Hurricane Katrina made land in New Orleans last Aug. 29, the city has been vexed by tension over the influx of workers from out of state and overseas. A study released in June found that a quarter of the workers rebuilding the city were illegal immigrants, almost all of them Hispanic, making far less money than legal workers. 
 Mr. Quinn's wife, Julie Quinn, is a state senator representing some of the New Orleans area, and his son James is executive director of the state Republican Party. 
 Lawyers for the guest workers said that last fall, Mr. Quinn applied to the federal government for temporary work visas under what is known as the H-2B program, saying that he could not find qualified workers in the United States. But the workers did not arrive until this spring, the lawyers said. 
 The lawsuit contends that the company's goal was to ''was to drive down wages and working conditions.''
 The foreign workers are receiving $6 or $7 an hour, said Jennifer J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is representing 82 of the guest workers. ''That is not what you have to pay a desk clerk in your luxury hotel here, and it is not a living wage to live here,'' she said from New Orleans.

HEADLINE: Supply and Innovation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Scarcity, Mother of Invention,'' by Stephen L. Sass (Op-ed, Aug. 10):
The ultimate drivers for technology inventions in the past have been economic benefits, convenience and security. But today's energy problem is different. 
 Its solution should address not only short-term problems like a higher cost of living, economic depression and inconvenience, but also long-term problems like global climate change, preservation of natural resources and global equity.
 Unlike the technology-focused Manhattan Project or the invention of machinery to replace labor, the solution lies within the people -- with the aid of technology. Everyone must understand his or her responsibility and contribute to the solution of the energy problem.

Harold Kung
Evanston, Ill., Aug. 14, 2006

The writer is a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern University.

To the Editor:
 Stephen L. Sass shows how resource scarcity has promoted innovation and advancements in technology and people's welfare. He says the lesson to learn from history is that we need ''something like a Manhattan Project'' to address the ''harsh reality of fossil fuel scarcity.'' 
 But governments have a dismal record in picking technology winners. Billions in federal subsidies haven't produced any viable alternative energy technologies. Fossil fuels aren't even particularly scarce -- known reserves could last hundreds of years and continue to grow exactly because of the scarcity-driven innovation Mr. Sass identifies. 
 Recent supply problems result mainly from governments' market interference, rather than underlying scarcity of the actual fossil fuels.
 Innovation results when inventors and entrepreneurs apply their expertise and take financial risks to seek economically viable solutions to real problems. Having central planners spend other people's money on politically driven pet projects is a recipe for waste.

HEADLINE: Glimpsing The Future On 65th St.

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
It's not so much the mounds of debris in Alice Tully Hall's lobby or the churned-up pavement next to the Juilliard School that seem so startling these days at Lincoln Center. It's what you will soon see for the first time in decades when you glance up from the middle of West 65th Street: the sky. 
 The massive bridge above the street, between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway, known as the Paul Milstein Plaza is coming down. On Monday night, workers set about dismantling its 42 concrete beams with a 500-ton crane.
The plaza, measuring 85 feet long and 204 feet wide, has connected the north part of Lincoln Center's campus to the south since 1964. Its demolition is part of the first phase of Lincoln Center's extensive redevelopment plan, a $650 million overhaul of West 65th Street, the institution's main artery. 
 The work under way brings home the reality that a cultural landmark is being remade: an upgraded auditorium for Alice Tully Hall, an addition to the Juilliard School, new entrances for the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Lincoln Center Theater, wider sidewalks and new signs to signal a strong identity for each component. 
 ''Lincoln Center is iconic,'' said Andrew S. Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University. ''It was the first of the major cultural centers, and it really set the stage for a whole explosion of cultural centers in America.'' He described the reconstruction as ''significant historically and significant architecturally,'' predicting that it will bring about ''a vast change in the character of the complex.''
 For planners at Lincoln Center, that is part of the point. One of their goals is to open the institution up to the city, making it seem more welcoming and less elitist both physically and in spirit. 
 The overall design for the first phase, by Diller, Scofidio & Renfro in collaboration with FX Fowle, will be decidedly more contemporary. Planners hope to have all of the work done by the 2009-10 season, when Lincoln Center celebrates its 50th anniversary. Work has also begun on Amsterdam Avenue at West 64th Street, where a modified entrance is being created for the underground parking garage and the north tunnel. The tunnel will serve as a new loading dock for Avery Fisher Hall, a retail shop, a restaurant and the Film Society. 
 The second phase of the redevelopment, known as the Promenade Project, will include an upgrade of Josie Robertson Plaza and the Columbus Avenue entrance, including a new fountain. 
 Getting to this point wasn't easy. For years there was internal tension over the notion of tampering with the original Lincoln Center, a momentous building project of its time with its own prominent architects, including Philip Johnson, who designed the fountain and the New York State Theater, and Eero Saarinen, who designed the Vivian Beaumont Theater.
 Since the redevelopment project was announced in 1999, there have been disagreements among the 12 participating constituent groups about aspects of the design and who should pay for what. There was the shock of 9/11 and the economic downturn that followed. 
 There have been changes of leadership. And there have been naming concerns, like what Avery Fisher Hall would be called if it were replaced with a new home for the New York Philharmonic. (Demolition has since been ruled out, and the hall will keep its name.) 
 Lincoln Center officials also had to figure out what to do about the name Milstein Plaza. The Milstein family recently agreed to transfer the name to the reflecting pool and terrace in front of the Vivian Beaumont and Mitzi E. Newhouse theaters.
 The reflecting pool, designed by Dan Kiley, has also been a source of conflict: plans to alter its design set off an impassioned preservation debate that has yet to be resolved. Mr. Dolkart is among those who object to the redesign of the pool, which he calls ''the great masterpiece of architecture on campus.'' 
 Work will eventually begin on a restaurant planned near the reflecting pool. Over the last year a mock-up of its curved lawn roof, where visitors might one day relax or picnic, has been tested in a Jersey City parking lot. 
 ''We don't want anything too steep,'' said Kevin Rice, the project leader at Diller, Scofidio & Renfro. ''When the grass is wet, are you going to feel like you're going to slide down? Can you get traction?''
 The architects are also considering which species of grass will fare best through the winter months; the tall fescue has proved hardier than the mid-Atlantic blue or midnight blue. Similarly, the architects are testing a prototype of the glowing walls planned for the Alice Tully auditorium. Light will be emitted directly through the walls' resin panels, which are to be sheathed in wood veneer. 
 Ms. Diller said she and her colleagues were exploring different lighting sources -- it looks as if L.E.D. has won out over fluorescent and halogen -- as well as various types of wood and ventilation systems.
 The box office will move back to Tully during the first week of September, after the lobby demolition is done. Concerts will continue through April 30, when a farewell gala concert called ''Good Night Alice'' is planned before the hall closes for 15 months.
 The 65th Street bridge will be dismantled by September, and a new one will be installed by 2008, said Jerry Hastings, the executive director of the Lincoln Center Development Project, who is overseeing the work with Jasper J. DeFazio, vice president of Turner Construction. The new bridge, still in the design phase, will be narrower and translucent, opening up 65th Street to more sunlight. 
 The city's parks department plans to remove the weeping cherries from their planters on the east and west sides of the bridge and replant them at a site near the off-ramp of the Triboro Bridge on the Manhattan side; the Tully organ will be stored upstate during construction.
 All of Lincoln Center's programs will proceed as scheduled throughout the remainder of the summer.
 City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who represents the West Side of Manhattan, said the construction had so far not been unduly disruptive. ''With cranes and construction everywhere in our community, and change that threatens the middle-class fabric of our neighborhood, the Lincoln Center project is the most positive construction site,'' she said. 
 Officials of some of Lincoln Center's constituent groups said they were buoyed by the tumult of work in progress. 
 ''It's obviously in the abstract phase, where you're stepping through dirt and dust and hearing lots of noise,'' said Richard Pena, the program director of the Film Society. ''You tell people to come, and they have to figure out how to get there. But you can feel that it's taken that important first step.''
 Joseph W. Polisi, the president of Juilliard, described the revamping as ''an investment for the next 40 to 50 years.'' 
 ''The whole idea was to break down the walls of Lincoln Center,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Luring Top Stem Cell Researchers With Financing and Freedom

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
You can't buy Wrigley's Spearmint gum in Singapore. But human embryonic stem cells? That's a different matter.
 Last month a local company, ES Cell International, claimed to be the first company to commercially produce human embryonic stem cell lines in a way that makes them suitable for clinical trials. Researchers can buy vials of stem cells from ES Cell over the Internet for $6,000.
Singapore, notably conservative on most social issues -- including a ban on most types of chewing gum -- is emerging as a hotbed for stem cell research, thanks to liberal laws in that field and equally liberal government financing. 
 Lately the tiny island-state's ambition of joining the ranks of Boston and the Bay Area as a biotech hub has been getting a hand from an unexpected quarter: the White House. Bush administration policies that restrict federal money for stem cell research have prompted an increasing number of top scientists to pack their bags and head for this equatorial city. 
 Two of America's most prominent cancer researchers, Neal G. Copeland and Nancy A. Jenkins, are planning to arrive here next month to take posts at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. The husband-and-wife team, who worked for 20 years at the National Cancer Institute in Maryland, said politics and budget cuts had left financing in the United States too hard to come by.
 ''We wanted to be in a place where they are excited by science and things are moving upward,'' said Dr. Copeland, who said he and his wife had already rented a condominium near Singapore's shopping district and had joined the local American Club.
 Scientists say President Bush's veto last month of legislation to raise limits on federal financing for stem cell research was the latest in a series of setbacks, which they say are stifling the research environment and eroding the edge in basic medical science that the United States has held since World War II. 
 Shrinking research grants, a greater corporate emphasis on quick profits and the political firestorm over stem cells have left many American scientists frustrated and discouraged. Waiting in the wings with encouragement and cash is authoritarian Singapore, which has begun to earn a reputation as a haven for biomedical freedom. 
 The motive is economic. Faced with declining returns in electronics, the industry that vaulted Singapore into the ranks of the world's richest nations, Singapore in 2000 began an initiative in biotechnology. 
 ''It was part of the overall strategy of diversifying the base of our economy and, more specifically, adding on a research-intensive sector,'' said Beh Swan Gin, who heads the Biomedical Sciences Group at the Economic Development Board.
 Biotech joins a widening portfolio of industries Singapore is promoting. The nation is rapidly becoming a major center for private banking, for example, and it plans to build two of the world's most expensive casino resorts to rev up tourism.
 Using the same combination of tax holidays and incentives that made it a base for the world's biggest electronics makers, Singapore has already managed to lure big drug companies. Factories pumping out pharmaceuticals for the likes of Merck, Pfizer and Schering-Plough now generate roughly 18 billion Singapore dollars ($11.4 billion) in annual revenue, and account for 5 percent of Singapore's economy.
 But Singapore wants companies to do more than make drugs here. To persuade them to conduct basic drug research and development as well, Singapore offered to pay up to 30 percent of their building costs. At least 30 companies have responded, including the Swiss drug giant Novartis, which has opened an institute here to develop drugs to fight tuberculosis and the dengue virus. 
 The centerpiece of Singapore's biotechnology effort is the Biopolis, a seven-building biomedical hive that opened in late 2003 at a cost of 500 million Singapore dollars. It is outfitted with the latest high-tech equipment and features a bar, a day care center and an underground facility made to house a quarter-million laboratory mice. 
 Authorities are now building a stem cell bank at Biopolis, which will be able to count on some of the world's most liberal laws on human embryonic cell usage. 
 Researchers hope that stem cells, the all-purpose building blocks that eventually turn into specific tissue like bone, muscle or nerves, can be harnessed and used to treat injuries or medical defects. Scientists have found that stem cells from embryos, unlike those in adults, have a greater flexibility and shelf life. 
 Bush administration opposition to stem cell research is based on the argument that it requires destroying embryos, each potentially representing a human life. Singapore allows stem cells to be taken from aborted fetuses or discarded embryos, and these embryos can be cloned and kept for up to 14 days to produce stem cells. 
 Singapore officials say they have spent 1.5 billion Singapore dollars ($949 million) on biotechnology since 2000 and have budgeted another 1.44 billion Singapore dollars more over the next five years to finance development of new therapies and drugs. 
 That is not much compared with the approximately $27 billion the National Institutes of Health spends each year. But it is spread among a much smaller crowd. While scientists working for government research institutions here say they are warned not to talk about money, they readily acknowledge that Singapore's salaries exceed those they can earn in the United States. 
 Lavish salaries and lofty titles have helped Singapore staff Biopolis with a roster of foreign luminaries. In 2001, the same year President Bush first imposed limits on financing of stem cell research, Singapore snagged the National Cancer Institute researcher Edison Liu Tak-Bun. 
 Dr. Liu said he had felt hemmed in by outdated academic structures and the biotechnology industry's preoccupation with financial survival. 
 ''Singapore, however, welcomed new ideas and, because of its newness, provided degrees of organizational freedom necessary for me to succeed,'' Dr. Liu said in an e-mail interview. He now works at Biopolis as head of the Genome Institute.
 In 2003, Singapore lured Jackie Y. Ying from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she had become its youngest tenured professor ever, to head up its Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology at Biopolis.
 Earlier this year, Singapore scored another pair of Americans, the dean of the University of California, San Diego's school of medicine, Edward W. Holmes, and his wife, Judith L. Swain. Dr. Swain was the school's dean of translational medicine -- the specialty of turning laboratory discoveries into practical drugs or therapies. 
 Although they will continue to work part of the time at the University of California, San Diego, Dr. Holmes gave up his $450,000 dean's salary to become an executive deputy chairman at the Biomedical Research Council in Singapore. Dr. Swain will become executive director of a new organization, the Institute for Clinical Sciences. 
 Singapore has not limited its poaching to the United States. The same year Dr. Liu came to Singapore, the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology imported the cancer researcher Yoshiaki Ito, who at the age of 63 was facing forced retirement from Kyoto University in Japan. 
 In 2004, the British cancer expert Sir David P. Lane, renowned for his discovery of the p53 tumor-suppressing gene and for his warnings that financing shortages would lead to a British brain drain, announced that he, too, would move to Biopolis. He is now the executive director of Biopolis's cell biology institute. 
 Probably the best known of Singapore's imports was also one of its first -- Alan Colman, who helped clone Dolly the sheep in 1996. Unable to find backers willing to wait for his research on diabetes to pay off, he found a ready investor in the Economic Development Board in Singapore, which helped finance ES Cell with a group of Australian investors.
 ''In Singapore, they want a return on investment in the long term,'' said Dr. Colman, now ES Cell's chief executive. ''That's why I came: I could get hold of the money to do the work in a commercial environment that I couldn't do in the U.S. or the U.K.'' 
 Not all imports are scientific bigwigs, either. Amber Sawyer, 28, a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, came here this year with her husband, a sculptor. After meeting another institute import, an Australian stem-cell researcher, Simon Cool, last year, Dr. Sawyer said she was convinced Singapore was an ideal place to continue her research into using animal stem cells to grow bone.
 ES Cell is hoping sales of its $6,000-a-vial cell lines can help pay for the company's own research into finding stem cell treatments for diabetes and heart disease. 
 There is other evidence that Singapore's efforts to bolster home-grown discoveries are yielding results. It was Singapore doctors, for example, who in 2001 first succeeded in curing a young boy's congenital anemia by using stem cells from the umbilical cord of an unrelated child.
 Last year, local scientists here demonstrated in experiments with mice that stem cells could enter the brain via the bloodstream rather than be introduced directly through an invasive procedure. 
 Researchers at Biopolis also recently published new findings on just how stem cells gain their ability to transform into other types of cells, a discovery that could help steer stem cells into specific treatments. 
 Not every foreign move into Singapore works out. A joint venture at Biopolis between Johns Hopkins University and Singapore's top scientific agency is closing down after the agency said Johns Hopkins was falling short of its recruitment goals. 
 But scientists say the addition of Dr. Copeland and Dr. Jenkins is a particular coup for Singapore -- and an equally severe blow to the American research community. 
 ''This is a sad, and I think for U.S. cancer patients, a tragic loss,'' said Irving Weissman, director of the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine in California.
 Dr. Weissman's institute, along with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, had been ardently recruiting the two scientists, who were looking to find more secure financing for their work, which involves using mice to model human cancers. 
 ''We have the biggest mouse colony in the United States,'' said Dr. Copeland, ''and it takes a lot of money to run that.''
 The two were favoring Stanford, which stood to benefit from California Proposition 71 -- the program meant to unleash $3 billion in state financing for stem cell research. But legal challenges have kept that money in limbo. 
 Faced with the prospect of scraping for dwindling grants in an uncertain legal environment, the two scientists decided to follow the advice of their former National Cancer Institute colleagues, Mr. Liu and Mr. Ito, and move to the Biopolis. 
 Now, Dr. Copeland said, his biggest concern is not money for his mice, but how to get his cellar full of vintage wines halfway around the world from Maryland to tropical Singapore.

HEADLINE: A Senator's Opening Salvo

BYLINE: By ANNE E. KORNBLUT

 BODY:
A 60-second television spot for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York began running yesterday on broadcast and cable stations in upstate New York and on cable stations in Westchester County and on Long Island.

PRODUCER -- Mandy Grunwald

THE SCRIPT -- Local leaders who were skeptical of Mrs. Clinton during her 2000 campaign open the reel. ''I was very unsure,'' says Geri Barish, an activist on Long Island for breast cancer awareness. Then Mrs. Clinton appears, wearing a pink and white striped shirt and a pearl choker, sitting in a homey setting with family photographs and a vase of pink roses in the background. 
 ''New Yorkers took a chance on me in 2000, and I have worked hard every single day to deserve that chance,'' she says, facing the camera but speaking as if to someone off to one side. ''Once in a while we can really make a difference and help one child or one family.''

THE TITLE -- ''Standing Up for New York''

ON THE SCREEN -- Clips of four men praising the senator for bringing money, jobs and services to constituents. Capt. Peter L. Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, credits her with helping bring $20 billion in federal money to the state after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. Thomas Maguire, the state's former adjutant general, praises her for fighting to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open. Brian Hammond, a worker in Waddington, N.Y., says she helped the economy. And Joseph Ward, a father in Lisbon, N.Y., says that when his son needed a bone marrow transplant, Mrs. Clinton's office assured him that the hospital would help absorb the cost.

ACCURACY -- She is widely credited with delivering federal money to New York City after Sept. 11. On the economic front, critics accuse Mrs. Clinton of exaggerating her success in revitalizing upstate New York, arguing that manufacturing jobs are still being lost in the region; in the ad, Mr. Hammond says only that her efforts ''brought some life to our economy up here.''

SCORECARD -- This is Mrs. Clinton's first ad in her 2006 Senate race, and it is characteristically on message, focusing on her work for New York without any allusion to a possible presidential bid. But the subtext -- that she can win over skeptics -- is one that could be applied in a presidential race. And there is no mention of the Iraq war, which Mrs. Clinton voted to authorize, a subject that has become increasingly problematic for candidates across the board. ANNE E. KORNBLUT

HEADLINE: Congressman Endorses Suffolk County Plan to Bar Contractors From Using Illegal Immigrants 

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, N.Y., Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Suffolk County's plan to prohibit local government contractors from hiring illegal immigrants won an endorsement on Wednesday from a key member of Congress on domestic security issues, who urged communities across the nation to follow the county's example in grappling with immigration.
 Until the federal government itself gets the problem under control, Suffolk's proposed law ''should be emulated throughout the country,'' said Representative Peter T. King, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, who sees immigration as a security issue as well as an economic one. 
 Mr. King, whose district includes part of Suffolk, spoke at a news conference here with County Executive Steve Levy, who drafted the legislation. The congressman said local actions would prod Washington, where his own immigration bill has passed the House but not the Senate. That measure would authorize a 700-mile fence along the Mexican border; raise the crime of illegal immigration to a felony; and criminalize giving assistance, including food and water, to illegal immigrants. 
 Mr. Levy, a co-founder of a national coalition called Mayors and Executives for Immigration Reform, said his goal was ''to help stem the flow of illegal immigrants.'' The concept ''will spread like wildfire'' and ''have a major impact from California to Maine,'' he predicted.
 Similar efforts are already being made elsewhere. Hazleton, Pa., recently adopted a measure denying business permits to companies that hire illegal immigrants and fining landlords who rent to them. Civil rights groups are challenging that law in court.
 The Suffolk bill is the latest turn in a long-running and strident debate on Long Island, where Mr. Levy has drawn both praise and criticism for his crackdown on illegal immigration. Previously he proposed but backed away from a plan to deputize county police officers to help enforce immigration laws. Last year he was accused of failing to provide county aid to relocate tenants evicted when the Town of Brookhaven raided homes overcrowded with dozens of immigrants.
 The new legislation is sharply opposed by various religious and immigrant groups and some labor unions. This week the Long Island Council of Churches weighed in against it. But the proposal has overwhelming backing in the Suffolk County Legislature, which is expected to adopt it next month. 
 Mr. Levy said the public also widely supported the proposed ban. The critics ''are trumped by a 10-to-1 margin from everyday residents who say, 'Thank goodness, it's about time,' '' he said. 
 Mr. King agreed. ''The American people have spoken loudly and clearly that they want to stop illegal immigration,'' he said. 
 The bill would apply to about 6,000 companies and agencies that have contracts with Suffolk County that are paid entirely with county funds. The legislation would require those employers to verify that their workers are in the country legally. Employers could be fined and face up to six months in jail; repeated violations could forfeit the employers' county contracts. 
 The aim, Mr. Levy said, is to protect honest contractors against unfair competition from companies that exploit illegal workers by underpaying them. ''This bill will level the playing field,'' he said. ''If you want a contract with Suffolk County, you have to play by the rules.''
 Though some people have objected that the county legislation duplicates existing federal law, Mr. Levy says the law is unenforced. So does Mr. King, who said ''there's a real failure on the part of the federal government.''
 Skeptics say illegal aliens generally work in landscaping, restaurants and private construction, rather than on county projects. ''I haven't seen any data indicating this is a problem. I haven't seen any rampant abuse by employers. Why do we need this law?'' said Vivian Viloria-Fisher. She is one of two Hispanic members of the Suffolk Legislature, the only members who have announced they will vote against the bill.
 The bill's ''draconian measures'' could make employers afraid to hire people with darker skins, ethnic names and foreign accents, Ms. Viloria-Fisher said. She criticized the bill for not including an anti-discrimination clause like the one in federal law.
 The legislation is ''a symbolic gesture'' that ''fans the flames of hatred and divisiveness,'' she said. 
 Carlos Canales, a labor organizer at the Workplace Project, an advocacy group for immigrants in Hempstead, N.Y., called Mr. Levy ''an anti-immigrant politician'' who is using the issue for political gain. ''All he has done is to pick up a whip to whip the immigrant, to attack us,'' he said.
 But Mr. Levy dismissed his critics as ''ridiculous'' and said that local government must act because ''we have to bear the consequences'' of illegal immigration in added costs to schools, hospitals and the criminal justice system.
 Mr. Levy, a Democrat, was flanked Wednesday by construction union leaders who support his bill. Mr. King, who is a Republican, said the issue cuts across party lines. 
 ''I don't know anyone in the country who is more reflecting the view of the American people than Steve Levy, and he does it under terrible abuse, attack and distortion,'' Mr. King said. ''He is standing up, and I give him credit for doing it.''

HEADLINE: EYE ON ELECTION, DEMOCRATS RUN AS WAL-MART FOE

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MICHAEL BARBARO; Adam Nagourney reported from Des Moines for this article, and Michael Barbaro from New York.

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a likely Democratic presidential candidate in 2008, delivered a 15-minute, blistering attack to warm applause from Democrats and union organizers here on Wednesday. But Mr. Biden's main target was not Republicans in Washington, or even his prospective presidential rivals.
 It was Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private employer.
Among Democrats, Mr. Biden is not alone. Across Iowa this week and across much of the country this month, Democratic leaders have found a new rallying cry that many of them say could prove powerful in the midterm elections and into 2008: denouncing Wal-Mart for what they say are substandard wages and health care benefits. 
 Six Democratic presidential contenders have appeared at rallies like the one Mr. Biden headlined, along with some Democratic candidates for Congress in some of the toughest-fought races in the country. 
 ''My problem with Wal-Mart is that I don't see any indication that they care about the fate of middle-class people,'' Mr. Biden said, standing on the sweltering rooftop of the State Historical Society building here. ''They talk about paying them $10 an hour. That's true. How can you live a middle-class life on that?''
 The focus on Wal-Mart is part of a broader strategy of addressing what Democrats say is general economic anxiety and a growing sense that economic gains of recent years have not benefited the middle class or the working poor. 
 Their alliance with the anti-Wal-Mart campaign dovetails with their emphasis in Washington on raising the minimum wage and doing more to make health insurance affordable. It also suggests they will go into the midterm Congressional elections this fall and the 2008 presidential race striking a populist tone.
 Some Democrats expressed concern about the direction the party was heading, saying it could turn back efforts by such party leaders as former President Bill Clinton to erase the image of the party as anti-business and scare off corporations that might be inclined to make contributions.
 Still, what is striking about this campaign is the ideological breadth of the Democrats who have joined in, including some who in the past have warned the party against appearing hostile to business interests.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who was a member of Wal-Mart's board when she lived in Arkansas, the corporation's home state, returned a $5,000 campaign contribution from the company last year. Mrs. Clinton said she did so to protest Wal-Mart's health care benefits, and she has continued to distance herself from the policies of a company she was close to when she was the first lady of Arkansas. 
 Scheduling conflicts prevented Mrs. Clinton from attending any of the rallies being organized, her aides said. But she supported many of the campaign's goals, they added.
 ''It's not anti-business,'' said Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a former head of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, appearing at an anti-Wal-Mart rally on Tuesday. ''Wal-Mart has become emblematic of the anxiety around the country, and the middle-class squeeze.''
 ''All you need to know is Joe Lieberman and Ned Lamont have appeared at these events,'' Mr. Bayh said, speaking of the Connecticut senator and the man who defeated him in the Democratic primary on Aug. 8. ''That's pretty good evidence that Democrats across the country are rallying around this issue.''
 Yet there are clear risks for Democrats, not least in alienating Wal-Mart employees and customers. 
 Wal-Mart has begun a counterattack. In interviews on Wednesday, company executives warned that they would alert their 1.3 million American employees to the anti-Wal-Mart campaign. They also pointed to a poll the company financed that reported that Americans were generally supportive of the company.
 ''There is far more evidence to show that this short-sighted political strategy will backfire than that it will actually work,'' said Mona Williams, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Stores. ''We believe our associates vote, and it is our responsibility to let them know when a politician speaks out for or against our company.''
 In a letter to its workers in Iowa, Wal-Mart warned of the political events, including appearances by Mr. Bayh, Mr. Biden and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico.
 Wal-Mart ''would never suggest to you how to vote,'' the letter said, ''but we have an obligation to tell you when politicians are saying something about your company that isn't true. After all, you are Wal-Mart.'' 
 Some Republicans said Democrats were trying to appease liberal bloggers, union leaders and an Democratic left wing invigorated by Mr. Lieberman's defeat in the primary. 
 But Democrats say they are sure they have a message that will resonate. John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator and Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004, appeared at an anti-Wal-Mart rally in Pittsburgh two weeks ago. Mr. Edwards said in an interview that his party was not vulnerable to a backlash for this criticism so long as Democrats made clear that their main goal was improving policies for the poor and the middle class.
 ''Wal-Mart as an example of the problems that exist in America today is a powerful political issue,'' he said in an interview on Wednesday. ''I think our party pretty much across the board agrees that people who work hard should be able to support their families. When a company like Wal-Mart fails to meet its corporate responsibility, it make it impossible for that to occur.''
 Democrats say Wal-Mart is a potent symbol of corporate excess. The company earned $11 billion in profit last year, but fewer than half of its employees in the United States are covered by its health care plan, and the average worker earns less than $20,000 a year. 
 Wal-Mart counters that its average wage is more than $10 an hour, and that more than 150,000 Americans who had no health insurance now have it through the company. It also says it has saved consumers billions of dollars by squeezing costs.
 The challenges to Wal-Mart are hardly new: it has been the target of political attacks as far back as when Patrick J. Buchanan ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996, and said Wal-Mart was guilty of ''gigantism'' for crushing smaller businesses.
 The criticism has become more intense as Wal-Mart has grown into an increasingly major influence on the American economy and culture. For example, there is an ongoing cross-country bus tour, now in Iowa, organized by Wake Up Wal-Mart, a union-financed group highly critical of the retailer. The campaign includes news conferences with elected leaders in 19 states, may be the most ambitious tactic to date.
 Wake Up Wal-Mart's communications director, Chris Kofinis, said a large cast of Democratic candidates was joining the rallies. They include candidates in Senate races in Ohio and Maryland, and the governor's race in Maryland, where Wal-Mart's practices have been the subject of a legislative battle. ''Who can disagree with the proposition that corporations should provide affordable health care, pay decent wages, protect American jobs and help provide a safe and just workplace?'' Mr. Kofinis said. 
 Ms. Williams, the Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the rallies would not resonate with voters. Democrats, she said, were ''attending a union-sponsored protest with small crowds of faithful union activists, and there is not a swing vote in sight.''
 ''They are preaching to the choir,'' Ms. Williams said.
 Foryears, labor activists have characterized Wal-Mart as beholden to Republicans. In the last election cycle, they note, the company gave 80 percent of its contributions to Republicans. Many of its stores are in Republican-dominated territory in the rural South.
 But as Wal-Mart has grown in size and power, it has tried to establish ties to the Democratic party. Its chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., has grown close to Mr. Clinton, who personally thanked him for Wal-Mart's relief work after Hurricane Katrina and played host to Mr. Scott at his home in New York last month. In addition, Mr. Scott recently played host to the former Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, to talk about the environment, and he appeared on the New York radio show of the Democratic activist Al Sharpton.
 Even the Democrats who have been at the forefront of the recent attacks have not always had difficult relations with the corporation. Mr. Bayh, for example, took a total of $10,000 in contributions from Wal-Mart in the 2002 and 2004 campaigns. 
 ''It's clear that the contributions did not have any influence on how he has approached this issue,'' said Dan Pfieffer, a spokesman for Mr. Bayh.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Fathers Defeated, Democratic Sons Strike Back'' (front page, Aug. 14):
In dodging the label ''liberal,'' the Democratic politicians' sons are miscalculating.
 All they have to do is list issues like Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicare, civil rights, voting rights, child labor laws and the G.I. Bill, and ask their conservative opponents which one of these they would like to revoke. If they did that, ''liberal'' would be a badge of honor and a vote-getter, rather than a foul epithet. 
 Courage is the better part of valor.

HEADLINE: Hewlett-Packard Nears Goal of Overtaking I.B.M.

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 16 

 BODY:
Continuing to grow at a pace that will enable it to usurp I.B.M.'s title as the world's largest technology company, Hewlett-Packard reported quarterly earnings on Wednesday that exceeded analysts' expectations. 
 Revenue in its third quarter rose to $21.9 billion, up 5 percent or $1.1 billion from a year ago. At this rate of growth, most Hewlett-Packard executives think the company could take I.B.M.'s long-held title this year. Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, said he expected revenue of $92.1 billion for the year. Analysts expect I.B.M.'s full-year revenue will be $89.9 billion.
On a trailing 12-month basis, H.P. already has the title, $90 billion to $88.5 billion. ''This is something that people really didn't see coming,'' said Cindy Shaw, an analyst with Moors & Cabot Investments. 
 Hewlett-Packard reported third-quarter net income of $1.38 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with $73 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Before adjustments, income was 52 cents a share, exceeding analysts' expectations by 5 cents.
 The 2005 quarter was affected by a larger-than-normal provision for taxes of $960 million resulting from the company's decision to repatriate $14.5 billion in cash from foreign earnings. In terms of operating income, the company reported a 65.4 percent improvement year over year. 
 Hewlett-Packard's sure-footedness impressed analysts. ''Almost everyone else seems to be tripping over themselves or going out of their way to cite problems in the overall economic environment, but H.P. is doing neither,'' said Laura Conigliaro, a Goldman Sachs analyst. 
 Hewlett-Packard beat analysts' estimates for net income, as it has done every quarter since Mr. Hurd took the top job early last year. ''That consistency is something that investors really like,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 The company also announced that it would buy back $6 billion in stock, its largest repurchase ever, representing more than 6 percent of its shares at current prices. The stock rose about 6 percent in after-hours trading. Before the earnings announcement, it ended the regular session at $34.43, up 44 cents.
 After restructuring the company and doing some major cost-cutting in personnel and real estate, Mr. Hurd has in recent months been pushing his executives to seek more revenue growth. He said Wednesday during a conference call with reporters that the company would continue to trim costs as it fostered growth. ''Costs and growth are different sides of the same coin,'' he said. ''We will spend money to save money and save money to spend money. We will never be done looking at our cost structure.''
 Not only did the company see higher companywide operating margins -- the percentage of revenue left over after production and overhead costs -- of 6.9 percent, but even previously lagging divisions, like services and software, were finally seeing profitable revenue growth.
 One of the biggest surprises was how profitable the company's computer division was in a very competitive market in which Dell, the company's chief rival, was cutting prices of PC's. Hewlett-Packard said the division's operating profit margin was 4 percent, the highest it has been since the merger with Compaq in 2002.
 Revenue from PC's grew 8 percent, to $6.9 billion, with strong growth of 14 percent in the sales of notebook computers. ''I was particularly pleased because this is our seasonally weakest quarter,'' Mr. Hurd said.
 The company's computer division grew much faster than the comparable results that Dell is expected to report Thursday. Dell has said that it expected revenue growth of about 4.3 percent from a year ago. 
 This quarter's results confirmed that Hewlett-Packard is doing more than profiting from Dell's mistakes. Dell is having no impact on Hewlett-Packard. ''It shows that through restructuring and execution, H.P. has significantly changed the competitive landscape,'' William Shope, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, said. ''A lot of people were concerned that Dell's woes would spread to H.P., but we are not seeing any signs of that.'' 
 The printing and imaging division continued to be the cash-generating engine of the company. Revenue grew 5 percent, to $6.2 billion. An operating margin of 14.2 percent was lower than last quarter, but the company had been saying it would lower margins to increase the sales of printers that use a lot of ink. Printer shipments were up 15 percent over all and up 23 percent in the commercial segment. The company makes its highest profit margin on ink and toner sales, and strong sales of printers in this quarter will lead to future strong sales of ink. 
 Hewlett-Packard also said it ended the quarter with $16 billion in cash. It had free cash flow, or cash from operations after capital expenditure, so far this year of $8.1 billion, ''a full-year record in just three quarters,'' Mr. Hurd said. Hewlett-Packard intends to use some of that cash for the $4.5 billion acquisition of Mercury Interactive, a business software company. H.P. is also hiring more sales representatives for its efforts to expand in services and commercial printing.
 Ms. Conigliaro said the company could continue to achieve its target of 4 to 6 percent revenue growth without more major acquisitions. But she said that over the longer term the company would need acquisitions to sustain growth.

HEADLINE: Next Season's Hit Shows? They're the Talk of the Web 

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
YEARS ago, to learn about the coming television season, ''you'd have to wait for the fall preview issue of TV Guide'' each September, recalls Shari Ann Brill, vice president and director for the Carat Programming division of the Carat USA media agency in New York.
 Now, coverage of the shows begins in May, appearing everywhere from ''Access Hollywood'' to Entertainment Weekly magazine to televisionwithoutpity.com. And the networks offer elaborate sneak peeks at the new series on their Web sites, as well as on DVD's, in custom-published magazines and through other sites like itunes.com.
As a result, discussions among viewers about what to watch (or avoid) begin earlier than ever. That becomes an opportunity for media agencies, which help marketers select the series on which to buy commercial time (or avoid). They can begin to gather consumer intelligence in the spring and summer, rather than waiting until fall. 
 The Internet also makes the task easier, as the consumer chatter on Web sites, blogs and message boards can be readily monitored.
 That is what the Consumer Experience Practice, part of the Interpublic Media unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has been doing for three years in what are called PropheSee reports. It plans to release today the first report that will preview the 2006-7 season, summarizing consumer sentiment online about more than two dozen new series.
 Of the five new shows that consumers were discussing most often online in May and June, according to the report, four will be on NBC: ''Heroes,'' ranked first; ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,'' second; ''30 Rock,'' fourth; and ''Friday Night Lights,'' fifth.
 One of the five, ''Vanished,'' will be on Fox; it is ranked No. 3.
 Of the five new shows the report says were being discussed least often online in May and June, two will be on Fox -- ''Happy Hour,'' 25th, and ''Standoff,'' 26th -- and three will be on ABC: ''Notes from the Underbelly,'' No. 22; ''Big Day,'' No. 23; and ''Help Me Help You,'' No. 24.
 (Since the data were gathered, ABC has rescheduled ''Big Day'' and ''Notes from the Underbelly.'' They will have their premieres in midseason rather than in the fall.)
 The series in the top five share several characteristics, said Stacey Lynn Koerner, president at the Consumer Experience Practice.
 All will have serialized plots, meaning that the story lines will be threaded through each episode, requiring viewers to watch regularly to keep track of the fate of the characters. 
 That contrasts with series like ''C.S.I.,'' with plots that are generally self-contained in each episode and do not continue from week to week.
 Several series that were identified as potential sleeper hits in past PropheSee reports, like ''Lost'' on ABC and ''Supernatural'' on WB, have serialized plots. Such shows stimulate conversations, Ms. Koerner said, as viewers speculate about the potential fates of the characters.
 Another trait shared by the top five series, Ms. Koerner said, is interest in the actors who will be in the casts -- many of them are familiar to viewers from other programs in which they have appeared.
 For instance, Ms. Koerner said, 26 percent of the online discussions of ''Heroes,'' a drama at 9 p.m. Monday about everyday people with unusual powers, were centered on cast members like Milo Ventimiglia (''Gilmore Girls'').
 And 37 percent of the online discussions about ''Vanished,'' another drama at 9 p.m. Monday, about a senator's missing wife, were centered on cast members like Ming-Na (''E.R.'') and Esai Morales (''N.Y.P.D. Blue'').
 A third commonality among many of the top five new series, Ms. Koerner said, is that they are created or produced by ''TV auteurs,'' that is, executives who have developed followings for their work.
 For example, ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' is from Aaron Sorkin, of ''The West Wing'' fame, and the talents behind ''30 Rock'' include Lorne Michaels and Tina Fey of ''Saturday Night Live.''
 Both ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,'' a comedy-drama at 10 p.m. Monday, and ''30 Rock,'' a comedy at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, are about TV shows not unlike ''Saturday Night Live.''
 ''A lot of the conversation is whether the behind-the-scenes idea is a good idea,'' Ms. Koerner said, and whether viewers will be interested in two such shows in one season on one network.
 The Consumer Experience Practice plans to release two additional reports before the fall season starts, Ms. Koerner said.
 One, covering online discussions last month, is expected in two to three weeks, she added, and the other, covering August, is expected in mid-September.
 The PropheSee reports last year, before the 2005-6 season, identified three sleeper hits that are returning for 2006-7. They were, in addition to ''Supernatural,'' ''Everybody Hates Chris,'' on CW, and ''Ghost Whisperer,'' on CBS.
 But the reports also listed ''Commander in Chief,'' on ABC, and ''Threshold,'' on CBS, as having the potential to be hits, and neither one is returning.
 ''It's not an exact science,'' Ms. Koerner acknowledged.
 Ms. Brill of Carat USA, part of the Carat division of the Aegis Group, said the attention new series are getting before their premieres ''is interesting, but it does not give me a sense of how a show will perform over time.''
 ''It's about getting viewers there a second time,'' she added.
 Ms. Koerner, asked to identify some of the 2006-7 series that could be sleepers, said she wanted to ''wait for more data'' before drawing up a final list.
 She offered five shows on a preliminary list: ''Heroes''; ''Vanished''; ''Friday Night Lights,'' a drama at 8 p.m. Tuesday about a football team; ''Jericho,'' a drama at 8 p.m. Wednesday on CBS, about a Kansas town that survives a nuclear apocalypse; and ''Ugly Betty,'' a comedy-drama at 8 p.m. Thursday on ABC, based on a popular Spanish-language telenovela with a Cinderella-type plot.
 Sometimes, Ms. Koerner said, she is surprised at the subjects that generate discussion online. For example, she said, many viewers were asking why NBC is scheduling a show titled ''Friday Night Lights'' on Tuesday nights.
 The answer is that the series is about football as played by a high school team. If the show were on Friday nights, when most high schools play their football games, it could miss out on a lot of viewers.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Martin A. Armstrong, a financial adviser who has been in jail since January 2000 on a civil contempt charge, pleaded guilty yesterday to a charge of securities fraud in a criminal case stemming from trading losses incurred by his firm in 1999. 
 At a hearing yesterday afternoon in United States District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Armstrong, founder of Princeton Economics International, admitted to deceiving corporate investors and improperly commingling client funds in a case that prosecutors said resulted in commodities losses of more than $700 million.
Judge John F. Keenan said that Mr. Armstrong, 56, could receive a sentence of as much as five years in prison and a fine of at least $250,000. 
 The judge said he had not decided whether to credit Mr. Armstrong with the time he had already spent in jail when he sentences him on Jan. 3. Mr. Armstrong's lawyer said the financier should have been released from jail after 18 months as required by the civil contempt statute.
 Mr. Armstrong, jailed in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge after spending almost a week in segregated confinement, Victoria Armstrong, his daughter, said. Prison officials segregated him after contending that he had damaged an air vent in a recreational area of the jail, she said.
 ''I think the government just wore Marty out,'' said Thomas V. Sjoblom, a partner at Proskauer Rose who represents Mr. Armstrong. ''The court system has not been gracious in any respect toward Martin Armstrong since the criminal judge in Trenton gave him bail in September 1999.''
 After being released on bail in New Jersey seven years ago as the case was unfolding, Mr. Armstrong was indicted again by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, Mr. Sjoblom said. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Mr. Armstrong in October 1999 and ordered him to turn over assets. Mr. Armstrong was jailed on civil contempt charges after failing to surrender $14.9 million in gold bars and rare coins to the government, assets that Mr. Armstrong maintained he did not have. 
 Last January, Mr. Sjoblom argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that Mr. Armstrong had been imprisoned unlawfully for six and a half years and should be released; the appellate court has not ruled on the matter. 
 ''The court of appeals needs to resolve this contempt issue because it impacts the sentencing in the criminal case,'' Mr. Sjoblom said.
 Mr. Armstrong's guilty plea came as he and his lawyers prepared for his criminal trial, scheduled to begin on Oct. 24. Three weeks ago, the judge that had overseen the criminal case since 2000 was replaced by Judge Keenan, who immediately scheduled a trial for Mr. Armstrong.
 At the peak of his career, Mr. Armstrong managed $3 billion in assets. The unraveling of his firm followed a bet against the Japanese yen that led to substantial losses. In January 2002, Republic Securities, a brokerage firm that housed Princeton Economic's accounts, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud charges in the case and paid $569 million to victims. 
 Ms. Armstrong spoke with her father after he appeared in court. ''He didn't sound too happy,'' she said. ''But he had been in there almost seven years with no end in sight. I certainly feel good about his decision.''

HEADLINE: Hollywood, The I.R.S. Is Watching

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Hollywood celebrities who show up at awards ceremonies and leave with armloads of booty can expect one more item with their gift baskets: a tax form. 
 The Internal Revenue Service announced Thursday that it had settled a tax matter with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over gift baskets -- which this year were worth about $100,000 each -- given to presenters and performers at the Oscar ceremony.
 The academy, which votes on and distributes the Oscars, said it would send 1099 tax forms to those who received the gift baskets this year, and a representative confirmed that the organization had paid an undisclosed settlement to the I.R.S. to cover taxes owed by those who received gifts for previous years. 
 The organization also disclosed that its board decided in April to discontinue the practice of giving baskets filled with gifts provided by businesses promoting their goods and services. Still, the agreement with the I.R.S. sent a signal that other groups that shower celebrities with gifts will be expected to deal with the tax consequences.
 ''The academy had an obligation to do the reporting to us,'' said Mark W. Everson, the I.R.S. commissioner, in an interview. ''They have fulfilled that obligation.'' 
 The academy contacted the I.R.S. earlier this year, concerned that there might be a tax obligation attached to the increasingly expensive gift bags given at the ceremony. This year the basket included a four-night stay at a Honolulu hotel and a Krups espresso machine. The organization sought to pay any tax bill that might eventually be charged to the presenters. 
 Academy officials said Thursday that the decision to discontinue the gifts reflected a growing unease with the practice rather than a specific response to the tax problem. ''It's time for us to move on'' from gift baskets, said Sid Ganis, the president of the academy. ''Lately it has become this gigantic thing that has names attached to it, and implications to it, that don't feel pleasant. And we're surrounded by other venues that do it in a way that the press has noted as privileged and excessive. We try not to do that.'' 
 In the last few years gift baskets and ''gifting suites'' have become an integral part of the Hollywood awards season, a marketing juggernaut for the luxury industry. Most of the major awards, including the Golden Globes, the Grammys and the Emmys, hand out gift baskets including everything from digital gadgets to fully paid vacations. 
 Mr. Everson said the I.R.S. would now turn its attention to other award organizations, including the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which will hand out the Emmys on Aug. 27, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which dispenses the Golden Globes in January. 
 A spokeswoman for the Emmys said ''it was premature'' to consider whether the television academy would discontinue its gift giving to presenters. But in a letter currently being sent to presenters at this year's Emmy ceremony, the academy is reminding recipients of their tax obligations. Presenters will receive their gift baskets only if they send back a signed copy of the letter. 
 The president of the Foreign Press Association, Philip Berk, said he had instructed the group's tax lawyer to be in touch with the I.R.S. regarding past taxes owed on gift bags. He said the board would be discussing at its next meeting the possibility of discontinuing gifts at the awards. 
 This year's Emmy gift basket is estimated to be worth about $30,000, and includes luggage, skin-care products and a five-night vacation at a New Zealand country manor.
 But many celebrities do not take advantage of many, or even most, of the more expensive items offered by coupon in their baskets. Experts in the swag industry acknowledge that usually fewer than 10 percent, and sometimes fewer than 5 percent, of the high-ticket items, like the cruises and trips, are redeemed. And this year George Clooney, a double-nominee at the Oscars, gave his gift bag to the United Way, which auctioned it to benefit hurricane relief efforts.
 Mr. Everson said that although the value of baskets -- most of them in the range of tens of thousands of dollars -- was not significant income to many of the celebrities who receive them, there was a principle at work. 
 ''They need to meet their tax obligations, just like anybody else,'' he said. ''I don't think it's fair to say that we should look the other way. Just because someone makes 10, 20, 30 million dollars for a picture, if they get 20 or 30 thousand of income, that they should feel they shouldn't have to report that.''
 He added that if the situation were neglected, it might become a significant loophole in the tax system, with celebrities choosing to sidestep taxes by taking payment in commodities, rather than cash. ''If you let things like this grow, they will just give actors houses and apartment buildings as compensation for films,'' he said. ''It could lead to a barter economy for the truly wealthy.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about a tax settlement between the Internal Revenue Service and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over gift baskets given to presenters and performers at the Oscar ceremony misstated the number of nominations received this year by George Clooney, who donated his gifts to the United Way. It was three, not two.

HEADLINE: A Quiet Place To Start a Revolution 

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
THERE are no falls in Seneca Falls. The waterfalls that gave this old Finger Lakes village in upstate New York its name were obliterated long ago in favor of the 12-mile-long Cayuga-Seneca Canal, connecting the two lakes that Seneca Falls sits between.
 The physical imprint of the event that gave Seneca Falls its place in history came close to obliteration, too. On July 19 and 20, 1848, more than 300 people gathered in the Wesleyan Chapel on Fall Street for the first women's rights convention. There, Elizabeth Cady Stanton read, and the delegates adopted, a Declaration of Sentiments, modeled on the Declaration of Independence and making the radical assertion that ''all men and women are created equal.''
Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed the declaration, and the women's rights movement was born.
 But by 1985, when the National Park Service rescued the old Methodist church by buying it, there was almost nothing left to save. After the congregation outgrew and sold it in 1871, the building spent time as an opera house, a silent movie theater, apartments, an automobile dealership and a coin laundry. 
 It was remodeled countless times, mongrelized beyond recognition. Of the original structure, only portions of two brick walls and a few roof beams remained. No one passing by on the way to a Finger Lakes winery or to Cornell University, 40 miles to the south, would have had any reason to suppose that history had been made there.
 But on a hot midsummer morning, my husband, Eugene Fidell, and I were standing with a dozen other visitors under the chapel's rebuilt roof to hear a park ranger tell the story of the women's rights convention. The Wesleyan Chapel, along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton's home in Seneca Falls and the houses in the adjacent village of Waterloo of two other convention participants, are parts of the Women's Rights National Historical Park.
 That the park, after more than 20 years, is still a work in progress is somehow appropriate; after all, the history that it celebrates is still unfolding. The Waterloo home of Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, Quakers who were active abolitionists and at whose parlor table Stanton drafted the declaration, opened to the public only a few years ago. (The round mahogany table in the house is a reproduction; the original is at the National Museum of American History in Washington.) 
 The considerably more imposing nearby home of Jane and Richard Hunt is still being renovated; the Hunts were major land owners in the area, and three of their commercial buildings on the north side of Main Street still dominate Waterloo's tiny downtown. 
 It was at a ladies' tea at the Hunts' home on July 9, 1848, that Stanton encountered Lucretia Mott, who was passing through the area, and resumed a conversation the two had begun eight years earlier at an anti-slavery convention in London about the need for a convention to start a movement for women's suffrage and other improvements in the female social, political and economic condition.
 Scattered as it is in several small pieces over some five miles (making a car a necessity), the Women's Rights National Historical Park does not conform to the image of a typical national park. The park service, to its credit, has worked hard and effectively to make the most of what it has there, not only recapturing history but making that history relevant and accessible. 
 The two-story visitor center, a recycled Seneca Falls municipal building, offers a 30-minute orientation film and a serious bookstore along with interactive exhibits that pose questions about sex discrimination, sexual harassment and equality in the workplace. A photo and audio exhibit about the 14 women now in the United States Senate is on display this summer in a temporary exhibition gallery. 
 Elsewhere in the center, a bulletin board offers visitors a chance to post their answers to the question, ''What will it be like when men and women are truly equal?''
 ''It will be like nothing we have ever experienced,'' read one unsigned response.
 Someone else answered more prosaically: ''Work would get done sooner.''
 A small park, with the text of the Declaration of Sentiments carved on a wall under gently flowing water, separates the visitor center from the remains of Wesleyan Chapel. The park service has not tried to restore the chapel. It is an empty but affecting ruin, sheltered by a simple timbered roof but open on the sides, a place not so much for viewing as imagining.
 Elizabeth Cady Stanton's house requires less of an imaginative leap. The park service has restored the six-room cottage, which sits on two acres in a tidy residential neighborhood a little less than a mile east of the visitor center, close to the way it looked when Stanton lived there with her husband, Henry, a lawyer who served in the New York State Legislature, and their seven children, who shared two bedrooms. All but one eventually received college educations. 
 The heavy dose of domesticity weighed heavily on Elizabeth Stanton, who described herself as a ''caged lioness'' in her boredom and isolation. ''Radical reform must start in our homes, in our nurseries, in ourselves,'' she wrote. 
 As a granddaughter of Col. James Livingston, who fought the British in the American war for independence, she undoubtedly understood the power of ideas to start a revolution. The house is sparsely furnished with a few period pieces, but does not feel empty. 
 In restoring it, the park service dug under layers of wallpaper to find those from the time of the Stantons' residence. These were then copied and hung. Most are bright and cheerful. 
 Jessica Queener, the park ranger who was our guide through the house, made a special effort to engage the two young children in the group, asking them to think about what it would have been like to grow up there with all those siblings.
 Among other worthwhile places to visit in the area is the National Women's Hall of Fame, a private organization housed in an old bank building just down Fall Street from the Wesleyan Chapel. It honors 217 American women of achievement from Abigail Adams and Edith Wharton to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Billie Jean King.
 For a break from women's history, drive five miles northeast of Seneca Falls to the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge, a 7,000-acre wetland and major migratory bird stopover that offers easily accessible viewing areas and a self-guided driving tour on a 3.5-mile paved road. A summer afternoon is an inauspicious time for finding birds, let alone migratory birds, but we managed to see dozens of herons and made a mental note to try to return in the spring or fall. 
 The New York State Barge Canal runs through the refuge. Summer traffic through a series of locks peaks at about 10 boats a day. We got out of the car at Lock 25 for a close-up view of the equipment, which dates to 1892 but looked lovingly tended, with fresh paint and even a little flower garden to brighten a boater's view.
 The Finger Lakes region is a major tourist destination, famous for its wineries, scenery and attractions like the Corning Museum of Glass and the auto racing track at Watkins Glen. Gene and I stayed at the Aurora Inn in Aurora, N.Y., on the eastern shore of Cayuga Lake and just down the road from Wells College, about half an hour from Seneca Falls. Our second-floor room opened onto a porch with two chair swings, perfect for looking out over the lake. 
 Just up State Route 90 is the production facility and retail store of MacKenzie-Childs, where the furniture and pottery designs are either completely charming or completely over the top, depending on one's taste.
 Aurora and the wildlife refuge are more pieces of a local landscape that gets more interesting the closer you look. For many New York City residents, and undoubtedly for most of my friends and neighbors in Washington, the area of the map north of Westchester County and south of Canada is pretty much a blank. But one accomplishment of the Women's Rights National Historical Park is to show how the women's rights movement grew from fertile soil in a region where social reform movements from temperance to abolition nourished one another during a period that was as intense and thrilling as it was brief.
 Elizabeth Cady Stanton saved her press clippings, and reproductions of some of them are on display at the visitors' center. On Aug. 19, 1848, a newspaper called the Mechanics Advocate editorialized on the radicalism of the women's platform and warned that its goals, if achieved ''would set the world by the ears.''
 They still would.

HISTORY LESSON

Small Town That's Home To a Big Idea
 SENECA Falls is about 275 miles northwest of New York City by car, easily reached by the New York Thruway. The Syracuse airport is about 50 miles away. 
 The Visitor Center of the Women's Rights National Historical Park (136 Fall Street; 315-568-2991; www.nps.gov/wori) is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $3 for visitors over 16 and free for those who are younger. Even in summer, the peak season, the park is not crowded, averaging only about 90 visitors a day.
 Allow about three hours to visit all components of the park. The actual time will depend in part on how long you have to wait for a tour of the Stanton house, which is offered in summer daily at 10:15 and 11:15 a.m. and 2:15 and 3:15 p.m., but at other times from the middle of March to the middle of December only twice a day. The tour costs $1. 
 You'll find the National Women's Hall of Fame (315-568-8060; www.greatwomen.org), a private organization, in an old bank building just down Fall Street from the Wesleyan Chapel, at No. 76. General admission is $3.
 The Aurora Inn (391 Main Street, Aurora; 866-364-8808; www.aurora-inn.com), is about a half-hour from Seneca Falls. Built in 1833, it was completely remodeled and reopened in 2003. The inn has 10 rooms from $125 to $350, depending on season and view.

Whirlwind Sets Weather Vanes Spinning
 Folk art portraits may be doing well commercially, but antique weather vanes are doing even better. The market for some weather vanes today is hotter than the sun that once made them shine. (Many weather vanes were originally gilded or covered in gold paint.)
 On Aug. 5 Ron Bourgeault, owner of Northeast Auctions in New Hampshire, sold an 1880's weather vane of a locomotive, part of the Raymond and Susan Egan collection, for $1.2 million (including commission). Todd Prickett of Yardley, Pa., one of the country's most respected Americana dealers, was the buyer. 
''It was my first million-dollar object ever,'' said Mr. Bourgeault, the auctioneer. ''Part of my first $10 million auction.'' He was thrilled.
 ''Weather vanes are so American and so sculptural,'' he said. ''They may have been made in other countries as well, but they are really an American phenomenon.''
 Jean M. Burks, senior curator at the Shelburne Museum in Vermont, echoed his views. She said weather vanes in the New World were signs of social and political equality. ''In an independent nation you could have your own symbol and fly it like a make-believe coat of arms over your farm or home,'' she said. ''It wasn't like England in the Middle Ages, when English kings granted knights the right to fly vanes.'' (Vane is an ancient word meaning both flag and weather vane.)
 That $1.2 million locomotive beat the previous auction record, set in January when Christie's sold a Goddess of Liberty weather vane for $1 million to Stephen Score, a Boston folk art dealer. (Both dealers may have been acting on behalf of private clients.) 
 Through next Thursday Sotheby's is exhibiting an imposing weather vane in its 10th-floor galleries in Manhattan, one of the highlights of the fall auctions. It is a 62-inch-tall molded-copper Indian chief weather vane from about 1900 that is attributed to the J. L. Mott Iron Works Company of New York and Chicago, a manufacturer of plumbing supplies. It is among several weather vanes from the 450-lot collection of Josephine and Walter Buhl Ford II that is to be auctioned on Oct. 6.
 (Both Mr. and Mrs. Ford were born Fords, although they were not related. Josephine Clay Ford, who died last year, was the granddaughter of Henry Ford, the automobile pioneer. Walter Ford, an architect, headed the design firm Ford & Earl and was chairman of the Founders Society of the Detroit Institute of Arts. He died in 1991. The Ford house in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., was a showcase for their collections of Impressionist, Modern and American art, Americana, European ceramics and silver.)
 The weather vane's Indian wears a fringed skirt. He has his bow drawn, about to release an arrow. His face is similar to that on an Indian-head nickel. Shading in red and tiny traces of gilding enhance the piece's weathered verdigris.
 ''It was probably made as a special order for a fraternal lodge or civic building,'' said Nancy Druckman, a folk art specialist at Sotheby's. ''Such three-dimensional figure weather vanes are all strong now, and they are what the market is favoring. This one has a wonderful size and patina.'' It is estimated to sell for $100,000 to $150,000.
 Ms. Burks organized this summer's show of 55 antique weather vanes at the Shelburne Museum, drawn from 130 hand-crafted and manufactured examples in its collection (through Oct. 31).
 In the catalog she tracks the religious and secular traditions associated with weather vanes. Placing rooster weather vanes on steeples, for example, became popular after a ninth-century pope declared them a good way to remind the faithful of St. Peter, who the Bible says denied Jesus three times before the cock crowed. Years later angels replaced roosters.
 In the Middle Ages knights carried pennants bearing a family crest or coat of arms into battle and flew them atop their castle turrets to proclaim rank. Metal banners eventually replaced cloth ones.
 Weather vanes also have practical uses: they help farmers, sailors and fisherman study the wind, to forecast the weather. ''Before the development of the barometer, farmers could anticipate approaching weather systems by studying the direction of prevailing winds,'' Ms. Burks writes. She quotes an 1851 issue of the Old Farmer's Almanac: ''Wind from the west is the softest and the best.''
 She also quotes an 1848 fisherman's rhyme by J. O. Halliwell: ''When the wind is in the east, then the fishes bite the least. When the wind is in the west, then the fishes bite the best; when the wind is in the north, then the fishes do come forth; when the wind is in the south, it blows the bait in the fish's mouth.''
 Examples of Americana weather vanes in Ms. Burks's current show include Indians, Lady Liberty, a Paul Revere on horseback and an American eagle, along with some cows, sheep and horses.
 Weather vanes were once excellent community markers. ''Whether depicting barnyard animals in agricultural areas; fish, whales and ships in coastal communities; angels on church steeples; writing quills on libraries and schools; locomotives, automobiles or airplanes, weather vane subjects often mirrored shared values, the foundation of a local economy or acknowledged the novelty of technological developments,'' writes Richard Miller, former curator of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum in Virginia, in an essay from ''Expressions of Innocence and Eloquence,'' a forthcoming book from Yale University Press about the Americana collected by Jane Katcher of Florida.

Vintage in the Hamptons
 Stella Show Management has organized ''Antiques & Design in the Hamptons,'' a two-day fair with 50 exhibitors, this weekend at the Bridgehampton Historical Society. The variety of dealer specialties is wide. John Bermingham will sell antique garden decor. Michele Fox has vintage quilts. Paul Manning has World War II binoculars. 
 Most appropriate for the East End perhaps are the rattan offerings of Rico Baca's Objects in the Loft and the vintage New England wicker furniture ensembles of James Butterworth.
 Mr. Butterworth is especially proud of a bright red Arts and Crafts wicker beach chair. ''It has a hood for those who didn't want to be in the sun all the time,'' he said. ''In the 19th century a bellman would have brought it down to the beach, where you could have rented it for a whole day for maybe 5 cents.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Rise In Unemployment 

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent in July, up from 5.1 percent in June, the State Department of Labor said yesterday. The state's unemployment rate also rose last month, to 5.1 percent from 4.6 percent. But the Labor Department also said that private-sector job growth in the city and state continued through July. In the last 12 months, private employment in the city has grown 2.2 percent, ahead of the national rate of 1.4 percent. The number of jobs in the state is up 1.2 percent in the past year, the department said. PATRICK McGEEHAN (NYT)

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Sets New Limits On Marketing of Cigarettes

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON; Melanie Warner contributed reporting from Boulder, Colo., for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
A federal judge ordered strict new limitations on tobacco marketing on Thursday after finding that cigarette makers deserved to be punished for a decades-old conspiracy to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. 
 The deception, Judge Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said, resulted in ''an immeasurable amount of human suffering.''
But in her ruling here in a racketeering suit brought by the Justice Department against the industry, Judge Kessler also had good news for the leading tobacco companies. 
 Judge Kessler ordered the companies to stop labeling cigarettes as ''low tar'' or ''light'' or ''natural'' or with other ''deceptive brand descriptors which implicitly or explicitly convey to the smoker and potential smoker that they are less hazardous to health than full-flavor cigarettes.'' 
 She rejected a government proposal that the industry be forced to underwrite a multibillion-dollar program to help smokers quit and to educate young people about the hazards of tobacco. Judge Kessler said that under a recent appeals court ruling she had no power to impose such large financial damages.
 The judge said she regretted not being able to punish the companies further.
 Her ruling said they were shown in a nine-month trial to have ''marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.''
 Her 1,742-page decision amounted to a detailed history of the efforts of the industry -- and, notably, its lawyers -- over almost 50 years to confuse the public about a danger that was evident to the health professions. 
 Cigarette makers, the judge said, profit from ''selling a highly addictive product which causes diseases that lead to a staggering number of deaths per year, an immeasurable amount of human suffering and economic loss and a profound burden on our national health care system.''
 Although the failure to impose tougher penalties disappointed antitobacco groups, the decision could force tobacco companies to overhaul some ways of doing business, especially in marketing and advertising cigarettes and other tobacco products.
 Judge Kessler also ordered the companies to begin an advertising campaign in newspapers and on television networks on ''the adverse health effects of smoking.''
 The remedies apply to Batco; Brown & Williamson; Lorillard; Philip Morris and its parent, Altria; and R. J. Reynolds, part of Reynolds American. Another defendant, Liggett, was excluded. The judge said it did ''not have a reasonable likelihood of future violations.'' 
 The Justice Department, which brought the case in 1999 in the Clinton administration and had seemed less eager to pursue it under President Bush, said in a statement it was disappointed that the court did not impose all of the penalties the department had recommended. 
 But the department said that it was ''hopeful that the remedies that were imposed by the court have a significant, positive impact on the health of the American people.'' 
 In a statement on Thursday night, William S. Ohlemeyer, an Altria vice president and lawyer, said the companies believed that many parts of the decision were ''not supported by the law or the evidence presented at trial, and appear to be constitutionally impermissible or infringe on Congress' sole right to provide for the regulation of tobacco products.''
 Wall Street analysts hailed the case as a big victory for the companies. ''There's nothing in this ruling that is going to hurt the profitability of the businesses,'' said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
 Mr. Adelman said the ruling threw into question the fate of major brands like Marlboro Lights and Camel Lights. Sales of light brands constitute more than 50 percent of the cigarette market in the United States, Mr. Adelman said.
 Analysts also said they believed that the companies had strong legal grounds for a successful appeal.
 ''The likelihood that the 'light' issue ends here is low,'' said Marc Greenberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. ''I think this will get appealed to D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and there may even be issues here for the Supreme Court.''
 William V. Corr, executive director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an antismoking group linked to the government suit, said he had hoped for tougher penalties. But Mr. Corr said he was pleased that the judge had identified the tobacco companies as a ''rogue industry'' that was guilty of ''50 years of lying to the American people.'' 
 Mr. Adelman said he did not think that the companies would be damaged by the finding that they were deceptive. ''This industry is not a bunch of Boy Scouts,'' he said. ''It's an industry that was not well regarded by the public, anyway. So I don't think there are significant public relations or legal ramifications from the decision.''
 The decision was issued after American stock markets had closed. In early after-hours trading, the stocks of Altria, Reynolds American and other tobacco makers rose. 
 Among the companies named in the suit, Altria, the country's largest maker of cigarettes, stands to gain the most, as the ruling clears the way for a much anticipated spinoff of its Kraft Foods unit.
 The Associated Press reported that a spokesman for Reynolds, Mark Smith, said executives were ''gratified that the court did not award unjustified and extraordinarily expensive monetary penalties.'' 
 Mr. Smith said Reynolds was disappointed by other parts of the ruling, which its lawyers will analyze before suggesting action. 
 Representatives at Brown & Williamson did not return calls. 
 Before the ruling, tobacco companies had won a string of victories in cases involving the dangers of smoking. Last month, the Florida Supreme Court upheld a decision to toss out a $145 billion judgment in a class-action suit. In December, the Illinois Supreme Court threw out a similar $10 billion judgment against Philip Morris. 
 Cigarette makers have argued that it was unfair for the federal government to seek additional penalties in light of their $246 billion settlement in 1998 with state governments.
 The federal case dates from 1999, when President Bill Clinton promised in his State of the Union address to unleash the Justice Department to bring a civil racketeering suit against tobacco manufacturers. The suit filed that year was one of the government's largest in the scope of charges and the resources devoted to it, accusing cigarette makers of decades of fraud, deceptive advertising and dangerous marketing.
 But the election of Mr. Bush, a major recipient of campaign donations from the industry, brought a re-examination of the case. John Ashcroft, the new attorney general, called the suit weak and pushed for an out-of-court settlement. 
 Career prosecutors working on the case protested a Justice Department decision last year to scale back its request for the companies to finance the national stop-smoking campaign, to $10 billion from $130 billion.
 The department said it was forced to reduce the amount because of an appeals court decision last year that blocked the department from trying to seize ill-gotten profits from the tobacco industry's past practices. At the time, Judge Kessler said the appeals court decision was a ''body blow to the government's case.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Take a Turn at Turning a Sub-Saharan Profit

BYLINE: By Lydia Polgreen; Elizabeth Dickinson contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
The Boulevard du Centenaire was once the preferred address of a certain class of this city's Paris-educated elite -- the career civil servants, university administrators and other upper-level functionaries of the vast state bureaucracy. 
 These days the street, one of the loveliest in this seaside capital, is more likely to be home to Chinese merchants who sell shoes, electronics, plastic jewelry and toys from storefronts built into Centenaire's grand old villas. 
China, it seems, is suddenly everywhere in Africa, not just in oil-rich states. Trade between Africa and China has almost quadrupled since 2001, and last year reached almost $40 billion.
 China is hardly the first nation to seek its fortune in Africa. First the Arabs and then the Europeans built empires on African riches and sweat, followed by the cold warriors, fighting proxy ideological battles for influence and profit. 
 Through all the iterations of the world's engagement with Africa, most of its nations have remained stuck in an economic trap in which they primarily supply valuable raw materials to the developed world while serving as a marketplace for cheap manufactured goods. 
 But China seems to be offering Africa something new, a straightforward business relationship between equals based on mutual interest and noninterference in the internal affairs of its allies. Or as the economist Jeffrey Sachs put it at a conference in Beijing this week, ''China gives fewer lectures and more practical help.'' 
 But is China's interest in Africa truly different from that of the earlier powers? Or is Beijing, as some are beginning to say, peddling the same exploitative formula in an attractive dressing of third world solidarity? 
 Certainly, China sees itself as offering something superior to the standard Western prescription. ''Now African countries have more choices,'' said Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to Senegal. ''They have the panaceas of the World Bank and the I.M.F., and at the same time the experience of China. They can compare and choose the best.'' 
 China's recent history presents seductive possibilities for sub-Saharan Africa. In the past two decades, China has pulled hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty and transformed itself from an agrarian backwater into the world's fastest-growing economy. 
 Its presence is certainly greatest in the resource-rich countries like Nigeria, Angola and Sudan (where its role has been criticized as contributing to the crisis in Darfur). 
 But China's growing presence is also manifest in less obvious spots. In Sierra Leone, Chinese companies have built and renovated hotels and restaurants. In Mozambique, Chinese companies are investing in soybean processing and prawn production. At the African Union summit meeting in Banjul, Gambia, last month, the Chinese delegation dwarfed the ones sent by France, Britain and the United States. 
 Here in Senegal, a country whose economy was long dominated by peanut farming, Chinese construction companies are working on roads, bridges, waterworks and other projects. Small-scale Chinese enterprises have sprung up, importing inexpensive manufactured goods, and running restaurants and Chinese medical clinics. 
 But the economic history of African nations is a cautionary tale of exploitation and failed schemes to transform the continent's rich endowment of resources into wealth for its people -- even in the decades after the depredations of the colonial and imperialist eras.
 In the post-independence era, the fad was state control aimed at rapid industrialization, an expensive and generally badly managed experiment in most countries. In the post-Soviet world, many adopted the ''Washington consensus,'' of open markets, macroeconomic stability, loosened state controls and more transparent government. 
 Whether these prescriptions have helped African economies, or been carried out to a sufficient extent, is a subject of much debate. Some countries have doubled growth rates and most have inflation under control. But many Africans say economic reform has yet to improve their lives and have grown disenchanted with the West.
 ''The West has closed its doors to us,'' said Amadou Niang, a Senegalese forestry expert working in Mali on a United Nations development project. ''Even if we follow their plans, at the end of the day their interests are more important.'' 
 In addition, he said, Chinese technology and expertise are more relevant and affordable, and Chinese cultural values are closer to Africa's.
 Moussa Lamine Sane, a Senegalese executive at Henan Chine, a Chinese construction company in Dakar, said the West was too paternal in its approach. ''Senegal is in a position where it is not necessarily in need of a tutor, but it is in need of friends,'' Mr. Sane said. ''It is no longer a question of colonizer and colonized. It is an exchange.'' 
 But it may be too soon to say that China will be different. A study published this year concluded that China's main interest in Africa so far has been raw materials. ''China has predominantly imported a limited number of products -- mostly oil and hard commodities,'' the report said. In return, it said, China mainly exports manufactured goods. 
 In other words, China has done pretty much what the rest of the world has done in Africa, but without the moralizing about good government and fighting corruption.
 Indeed, the Chinese model could prove deceptive and destructive. 
 ''I think the strongest argument you can make for China's growth is that you had some very capable people in charge of making economic decisions who were given a mandate insulated from political thinking,'' said Todd Moss, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, which studies aid and growth. ''But in Africa, there is no place where economic thinking is insulated from political thinking.'' 
 But whatever role China ultimately plays, perhaps the most important element it introduces is competition. The West has for too long relied on one set of ideas aimed at fixing Africa's problems, said Duncan Green, head of research at the British aid organization Oxfam. 
 ''For Africans it is quite a welcome change from the approach they get from Western governments that manages to be both patronizing and demeaning at the same time,'' Mr. Green said. ''I think we underestimate the importance of having an alternative to a single path.''

HEADLINE: Boeing to End Its Service For Using Internet Aloft 

BYLINE: By THOMAS CRAMPTON

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
Maybe it was the Internet bubble in the sky or perhaps it was just that the business plan could not fly. 
 Boeing announced on Thursday that it planned to scrap its in-flight Internet service, saying there was not enough demand.
 That might upset the people who use it. According to the German airline Lufthansa, which has offered the service more extensively than any other carrier, passengers like the option of staying connected while flying. 
 ''I will be extremely sad if this service ends,'' said Marcel Reichart, a managing director for strategy in Munich at Hubert Burda Media who flies frequently and used the service nearly a dozen times while flying to the United States. ''There is a stable connection that allows me to get a full day of work done while speaking over Skype, sending e-mails and everything.'' 
 The service is much like that in a Web cafe, with passengers gaining access to the Internet through a high-speed wireless network. The system, which is also used by executive jets as well as oil rigs and vessels at sea, bounces the Internet connection off a series of satellites. 
 Boeing published a survey of 3,200 airline passengers in April that seemed to indicate that the airborne Internet would soar in popularity. The survey found that 83 percent said Internet availability would have an impact on their future travel plans and choice of airline. Of those who actually used the service, called Connexion, 92 percent said they would recommend it. 
 The problem, it seems, is that enthusiasm for the idea far exceeded the number of people who actually paid for the service. 
 In announcing the project in 2000, Boeing predicted that the market for in-flight Internet access would be worth $70 billion over 10 years. But the company said Thursday that the number of passengers using the service on the 156 aircraft with 12 airlines amounted to little more than ''low single digits'' a flight. Boeing declined to say how much it cost to run the service. 
 The cost to airline passengers is $9.95 an hour or $26.95 for an entire flight and revenue is shared between Boeing and the airlines. 
 Lufthansa, which operates 62 aircraft using the system, said that the maximum number of passengers ever connected at one time was about 40 a flight, usually on routes to North America and Asia. 
 ''Given the usage level, we just didn't see the kind of numbers that add up to a business,'' said John Dern, a Boeing spokesman. ''You could say it flew well technically, but it didn't fly so well as a business.'' 
 Mr. Dern said that the shutdown was unrelated to the airport security alert in Britain last week, when laptops were not allowed on flights. But the difficulties faced by airlines after 9/11 have not helped, he said.
 Ken Dulaney at Gartner Research in San Jose, Calif., predicted that the system would rise again. ''It seems clear to me there is a business there, just not the way Boeing built it,'' he said. ''There will be a fire sale of Boeing's investments and then someone will take over this niche market.'' 
 ''The biggest problem right now is that airlines can barely afford a new tire, much less a service like this,'' Mr. Dulaney said. 
 Airbus, Boeing's biggest rival, seems to agree that Internet service on planes has a future. 
 ''We are full speed ahead with deploying wireless Internet on board our aircraft,'' said Justin Dubon, an Airbus spokesman.
 Airbus plans to introduce its own Internet service with the delivery of the first of the giant A380's to Singapore Airlines at the end of this year, Mr. Dubon said. The provider of the service, OnAir, is a joint venture of Airbus and SITA. 
 Lufthansa offers Internet on several Airbus aircraft, but uses the Boeing system. 
 Customers flying Airbus can expect the Internet to be a crucial part of their in-flight experience, Mr. Dubon said. 
 ''The possibilities are really endless once you put Internet in an aircraft,'' Mr. Dubon said. ''Passengers might be able to download films or even send a message to someone they see across the aisle.'' 
 For Lufthansa, Boeing's imminent shutdown of the system is a problem. 
 ''We really want to continue offering this service, but right now we just don't know how we will,'' said Michael Lamberty, a spokesman for Lufthansa. ''Fortunately, Boeing said the service will continue for several months, so perhaps we can find a solution.''

HEADLINE: EarthLink Hurls Itself Into a Heady New Telecom Universe

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Garry Beatty, the chief executive of EarthLink, has an expression he uses to talk about companies that, despite obvious flaws, enjoyed success during the Internet bubble: ''Even turkeys can fly in high wind.'' 
 The question is whether that maxim might now apply to his own company: do EarthLink's investors have a turkey on their hands?
EarthLink's core business is dial-up Internet access, and it soared during the dot-com boom, becoming a widely known brand and the second-largest Internet on-ramp after America Online. But that business is threatened with obsolescence in the era of broadband, and without a network of its own, EarthLink has had trouble competing with the cable and phone companies in selling high-speed access. 
 Although the dial-up business still generates a mountain of cash, that is likely to dwindle. So EarthLink, which is based in Atlanta, is pouring money into new ventures as it tries to turn itself into a full-service telecommunications company. 
 That kind of transformation would be hard for any company to pull off. Much attention has been paid lately to the makeover efforts of AOL, which is choosing a different route and moving to a media-style business model that, in the spirit of Google, relies on free or low-cost services with targeted advertising. It is not yet clear that the strategy will succeed.
 Dial-up companies ''can either go down the telco path or go down the media path, and both are extremely challenging,'' said James H. Friedland, an analyst with Cowen & Company, who has a sell rating on EarthLink's stock. Mr. Friedland says he believes there is no middle ground for EarthLink -- either the company's new investments will fail, leaving it in deep trouble, or they will succeed. ''And if it succeeds, it could be a home run,'' Mr. Friedland said. ''If they're successful, the stock is cheap.''
 Mr. Beatty counters that the new path is less dangerous than it may seem, in part because EarthLink's dial-up business will not die overnight. 
 ''My track record, the company's track record, should be a harbinger,'' Mr. Beatty said. ''We have 10 years of history. That should be worth something.''
 He adds, though, that ''no one that started in dial-up has made any transition like this.''
 EarthLink has introduced three new efforts: it is offering packages of phone service and fast broadband, building citywide wireless networks in places like Philadelphia and San Francisco, and, most daring of all, embarking on a $450 million joint venture with SK Telecom called Helio, a mobile phone service aimed at well-off young adults.
 Mr. Beatty said that the new ventures were natural outgrowths of its business, and that it would take only a small slice of a new market to give a lift to EarthLink's $1.3 billion in annual sales. Helio, which he called the riskiest of the three efforts, has predicted that it will have $2 billion in revenue and three million subscribers by 2009.
 Shares of EarthLink, which peaked at a split-adjusted $62.47 in 1999, plummeted along with the rest of the industry when the boom went bust. They closed at $7.56 on Thursday, near their 52-week low of $7.03.
 In an interview in the Los Angeles headquarters of Helio, Mr. Beatty, 49, conceded that the transition would inflict short-term pain on EarthLink's balance sheet. Last month, the company announced second-quarter earnings of $16.6 million, down from $43.8 million a year ago. 
 In a conference call with analysts, the company said that for the full year it expected to have profits of zero to $20 million, down from $143 million a year earlier.
 But Mr. Beatty, a regular dispenser of homegrown homilies and frank analysis, has seen challenging times before at EarthLink. When he came to the company in 1995, it had 200 employees chaotically carrying out the vision of Sky Dayton, then 24, who founded it as an alternative to the major dial-up players.
 At the time, EarthLink was adding subscribers hand over fist, growing 10 to 15 percent a week, but it was also losing money just as quickly. ''We were functionally bankrupt for all of 1996,'' Mr. Beatty said. ''I think only I and the C.F.O. really knew.''
 The company borrowed money on the promise of its speedy growth and went public in the first quarter of 1997, along with Amazon.
 The company built a reputation for customer service and as a consumer-friendly alternative to America Online and the smaller Prodigy and CompuServe. Back then, dial-up Internet access was the only game in town, and EarthLink blossomed, growing to $1.2 billion in revenue in 2000.
 But that was about the time broadband began to go mainstream, as the cable companies pushed high-speed service, with the Bell companies soon to follow with D.S.L.
 As those technologies have added customers, EarthLink's brand has faded. At one time, the name was recognized by 95 percent of consumers, but that number has slid to around 65 percent, Mr. Beatty said.
 The company still has some things going for it, notably how much cash it generates: around $36 million each quarter. That is a function of the high profit margins of the dial-up business; not including sales and marketing costs, the company earns $12.50 for each subscriber to its $21.95 monthly premium dial-up plan, which includes spam and pop-up blockers and free customer service. EarthLink also offers stripped-down service under the PeoplePC name for $10.95 a month, and $6.50 of that is profit.
 ''They have a great brand, great customer service, and they've done a great job managing expenses,'' said Timothy Horan, a telecommunications industry analyst with CIBC World Markets. Mr. Horan has a sell rating on the stock because he is not certain EarthLink can fulfill its vision for growth. 
 The dial-up customers are not going away so much as shifting from the premium service to PeoplePC and to EarthLink's own broadband service, which it offers by leasing lines from cable and phone companies. In its second quarter, it said it lost 163,000 premium dial-up customers, but added 48,000 PeoplePC customers and 116,000 broadband subscribers. 
 Over all, EarthLink has 3.5 million dial-up subscribers and 1.8 million on broadband, where growth has been slow because EarthLink has not been able to reach deals with some cable companies.
 Mr. Beatty said the dial-up business would not disappear too quickly because there were still considerable pockets around the country unable to get broadband. But he said the company was not content to just ride out the dial-up wave. ''As people in the tech business, that's not our aspiration,'' he said. 
 Perhaps the most visible part of EarthLink's new strategy so far has been its effort to build citywide wireless networks. It is operating such a network in Anaheim, Calif., and building one in Philadelphia. It has contracts to build in several other cities, including New Orleans, and is working on a final agreement in San Francisco, where it plans to work with Google.
 The idea behind the networks is to provide a wireless alternative to broadband for city residents and give tourists and business travelers a place to log on for the day. The projects are expensive: $85,000 a square mile, or $10 million to $15 million to cover all of Philadelphia, for example. Mike Gallentine, vice president of investor relations for EarthLink, said the business took advantage of expertise the company already had: ''In terms of the skill set we need, it's the same as what we're already doing, which is Internet access.''
 But analysts counter that building and operating a Wi-Fi network presents considerable new challenges for EarthLink, and returns are uncertain. ''It's got possibilities for them, but it's a start-up, a full start-up,'' Mr. Friedland said of the concept.
 The second major part of EarthLink's plan is Helio, a joint venture with SK Telecom, South Korea's largest telecommunications provider. Each company has invested around $225 million in cash and assets into Helio, which opened its doors in May, offering two slick phones aimed at 18- to 32-year-olds. Helio is putting an emphasis on data services like text messaging that are popular with young people, including an exclusive deal that provides easy mobile access to the social networking site Myspace.com.
 In the mobile phone market, ''the U.S. is dominated by large generalists,'' said Mr. Dayton, who is now Helio's chief executive and is no longer involved in running EarthLink, but remains its largest shareholder. The service is aimed at ''young, passionate consumers who like high-end devices,'' he said.
 And who, apparently, have relatively deep pockets. Until this month, the lowest cost of service from Helio was $85 for unlimited data and 1,000 minutes of talk time; unlimited calling and data costs $130 a month. The company recently added a $65 plan. Its phones cost more than $200.
 Asked whether young people could afford such expensive service, Mr. Beatty said the company was aiming at a generation it calls ''feed me, see me, spoil me,'' who have some cash to burn. ''How many kids drive around with BMW's?'' he said. ''They have the money.''
 But Helio is not the first carrier chasing a niche market, and some others have struggled to find a large enough audience to justify the investment, industry analysts said. 
 Mr. Dayton declined to give subscriber figures, but he said Helio was on track to meet its goals. 
 EarthLink has gotten into the voice business on a second front with two new products. One is an Internet-based telephone service like Vonage that costs $24.95 for unlimited calling and has around 13,000 subscribers.
 The second product is more unusual. It combines extremely fast broadband Internet access (up to 8 megabits a second, more than four times as fast as most services) with traditional phone service, delivered over lines leased from local phone companies by its partner Covad. The price for the package, with unlimited calling, is $70, a cost EarthLink believes will allow it to undercut and beat cable and telephone companies at their own game. 
 The company now offers the package in four cities: Seattle, San Jose, Calif., Dallas and San Francisco, where it opened a storefront last month to promote its new services.
 On a recent afternoon, the sales staff at the San Francisco store succeeded in signing up a new convert, Linda Hegenbarth, a legal secretary. She had used AT&T for phone service but had been looking to switch after reading that AT&T had turned over phone records to the National Security Agency.
 Her choice seemed to be more of a rejection of another company than a pure embrace of EarthLink. But, from Mr. Dayton's perspective, that's not such a bad thing.
 ''We've always been about being an alternative,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Some Call for New Jersey to Intervene to Save Xanadu Project

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
As the half-built, multibillion-dollar Xanadu shopping and entertainment complex in the Meadowlands unravels along with its parent company's finances, some top officials conceded the failure on Thursday and called for New Jersey to intervene, or even get rid of the developer. 
 It appears unlikely that the developer, the Mills Corporation, can finish the $2 billion project at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and real estate experts and stock analysts say it is hardly more likely that the state can find another developer to finish it as planned. Even if it did, New Jersey could stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars on a project that many criticized as ill conceived from the start. 
''I'm deeply troubled,'' Gov. Jon S. Corzine said, referring to huge cost overruns and the expected dissolution of Mills, the company building Meadowlands Xanadu, a Disneyesque mall under construction on a huge swath of state land at the sports complex. 
 Mr. Corzine said at a news conference that his administration was deeply involved in trying to salvage Xanadu, although Gary Rose, the governor's executive director for economic development, declined to discuss the issue. But Senate President Richard J. Codey urged the state to ''pull the plug'' on Mills and find a new plan and a new developer. 
 ''It's obvious that Mills can't get this done, and anybody who says so has been dancing with Dorothy down the yellow brick road for too long,'' said Senator Codey, who has long been a detractor of the Xanadu complex. 
 But George Zoffinger, the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, who has tangled with Mr. Codey in the past over development in the Meadowlands, dismissed his comments by saying, ''I'm not going to respond to that.''
 As for Mr. Corzine's concern, Mr. Zoffinger said: ''I'm very pleased that the governor and his staff are assisting us and working with us on Xanadu. We're gathering all the information necessary for the right evaluations to be made, and we welcome their continued involvement.'' 
 The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority struck the deal with Mills in 2003 in an effort to revitalize the Meadowlands complex, which several professional sports teams were making plans to leave. 
 The Nets basketball team is abandoning the Continental Arena for Brooklyn, and the Devils hockey franchise is moving to Newark. And while the Jets and Giants will be moving into a new home, the two rivals have battled over the size, shape and cost of the new stadium.
 Indeed, development of this corner of the Meadowlands has been something of a headache for the past several governors as the four teams have threatened at various times to move to either the other side of the Hudson or Passaic River.
 Xanadu was to be the biggest and most spectacular of Mills's approximately 40 malls around the world. The company, building on a base of successful off-price centers like Franklin Mills in Philadelphia and Potomac Mills in Prince William County, Va., was pitching a newer idea that it called ''shoppertainment'' when it won the contract to be the lead developer of 104 acres of parking lots and wetlands at the sports complex.
 But from the start, critics said Xanadu would be little more than a big shopping mall, while sports authority officials insisted that the entertainment offerings would draw hordes of tourists and generate substantial tax revenue.
 Mills promised a minor-league baseball park, an indoor ski slope, a miniature drag-racing park, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel, and a home for the Meadowlands Y.M.C.A. Of those, only the Ferris wheel and ski slope -- which Mills does not have a contractor for -- remain in the company's plan.
 But the company, a real estate investment trust based in Chevy Chase, Md., put itself on the block in April, after it came under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for accounting irregularities. 
 In the past week, Mills's fortunes have tumbled even further. It announced that it would sell a property in Spain and its half-interest in two other foreign properties to raise money. But its stock plunged after the company announced that restated earnings might erase $210 million in income from the books, raised the cost estimate on Xanadu to $2 billion, up from $1.2 billion, and dismissed its president, Mark Ettinger, once a partner of Mr. Corzine's at Goldman Sachs.
 The company also disclosed that its auditors would issue a report expressing doubts about Mills's ability to ''continue as a going concern.'' 
 By Thursday, Mills's stock price, which was at a high of $66.44 last August, had fallen to $13.45.
 It is under these circumstances that New Jersey and Mills must reconsider Xanadu, the company's most valuable property. Mills has already paid the state $160 million in rent, although $27 million was returned to the company in exchange for other property it owned in the Meadowlands. 
 Only a handful of the approximately 200 needed tenants have signed leases. The sports authority has set deadlines several times in the last year, and then extended them, for Mills to produce new leases, which are essential to continued construction financing.
 Several stock analysts have said this week that Mills should stop construction to protect its shareholders from further losses. They also said no developer would step in to complete Xanadu as planned and assume the cost of a $2 billion project because market rents would not provide enough return. 
 ''No one's going to buy it,'' said Greg Andrews at Green Street Advisors, a research firm in Newport Beach, Calif. ''If someone's going to come in to complete it, they might have to be paid to do it.'' 
 Rich Moore, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that even if the state negotiates a new agreement for a scaled-down project, ''there will be pain all around.'' 
 ''The state will probably be in a position where they'll have to help out, either the old guys a little bit or the new guys a little bit,'' Mr. Moore said. ''If the new guys say to the state, 'I guess we can't do anything unless you give us $100 million for some infrastructure,' what are they going to say?''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a call by New Jersey leaders for the state to intervene to save a faltering multibillion-dollar mall project in the Meadowlands referred imprecisely to the Nets basketball team, which plays there. The team is considering a move to a Brooklyn arena that would be built as part of the Atlantic Yards project, which has not yet been approved; the Nets have not yet abandoned their home for Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Turns on the Charm to Lure the Next Democratic Party Convention in '08

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

DATELINE: CHICAGO, August 17 

 BODY:
There were the themed drinks: Manhattans and electric-green Big Apple martinis. There was a celebrity: Lorraine Bracco, bringing a whiff of glamour in a slim white suit. And there were the cheesy one-liners from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had orchestrated a reception here for delegates at a Democratic Party gathering to pitch bringing the 2008 convention to New York.
 ''This is the coolest crowd that has blown into the Windy City in recent days,'' said Mr. Bloomberg, who switched to the Republican Party to run for mayor. ''I haven't been in the company of such a large group of passionate, dedicated Democrats since I was one,'' he added, to laughter, good-natured grumbling and cries of ''Come back'' and ''Welcome home.'' 
Both Mr. Bloomberg and the idea of New York holding the Democratic National Convention were warmly received by many of the Democrats gathered in the wood-paneled room in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park.
 ''We don't hold the fact that he's a Republican against him,'' Mark Brewer, the chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, laughing. ''It's a great convention city.'' 
 And, referring to Bill Clinton, he continued, ''It's where we nominated our last Democratic president.'' 
 ''The best one!'' added Joyce Lalonde, a delegate at the meeting, who is with the Michigan Education Association.
 Still, some Democrats expressed frustration with Mr. Bloomberg's party affiliation, which they said was out of step with his political views. After Mr. Bloomberg joked that he did not have a psychiatrist (Ms. Bracco plays one on television) but that his children probably think he needs one, a man shouted, ''You do, for being a Republican.''
 Ray Buckley, chairman of the eastern region of the Democratic National Committee, said that although he did not think it would hurt the city's chance of landing the convention, many Democrats were still upset by his party switch.
 ''His cuddling up to George W. Bush was pretty painful to watch, knowing that in reality that's not his true philosophy,'' Mr. Buckley said.
 Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, New York City's ranking Democrat, accompanied the mayor for his pitch, the essence of which was that the force of the city would help their candidate's chances. Mr. Bloomberg pointed out that both Democrats nominated in New York in recent years, Mr. Clinton and Jimmy Carter, had gone on to become president.
 ''We won't pick your candidate, but with the energy of our city we will make your candidate better,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We won't craft your message, but with New York as a backdrop we will make your message better.''
 New York is up against Denver and Minneapolis-St. Paul to hold the convention, which is scheduled to begin on Aug. 25, 2008. New York, which was the site of the 2004 Republican National Convention, is also competing to hold the Republicans' convention in 2008.
 A decision from the Democrats could come next month, officials said.
 In recent months, Mr. Bloomberg has made efforts to raise his profile across the country, lobbying for policy changes on national issues like gun control and immigration. In some settings he has seemed to flirt with the idea of a presidential bid.
 But if the Democrats sipping those green cocktails were an indication, his efforts have not been sinking in much beyond New York and the Washington Beltway.
 Jake Metcalfe, the chairman of Alaska's Democratic Party, said, ''Among political types in Alaska, people would know who he was, but I don't think they'd know whether he was a Democrat or a Republican.''
 He added, ''He's a national figure in the sense that he's mayor of the economic capital of the United States, so I think people recognize him, but he doesn't get the traction that Hillary Clinton does, or a Schumer or Pataki,'' referring to Senator Charles E. Schumer and Gov. George E. Pataki.
 As for a Bloomberg presidential bid, Mr. Buckley echoed several other Democrats from across the country. ''Well,'' he said, laughing, ''I haven't heard it in New Hampshire.''

HEADLINE: Wages, Wealth And Politics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Recently, Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, acknowledged that economic inequality is rising in America. In a break with previous administration pronouncements, he also conceded that this might be cause for concern.
 But he quickly reverted to form, falsely implying that rising inequality is mainly a story about rising wages for the highly educated. And he argued that nothing can be done about this trend, that ''it is simply an economic reality, and it is neither fair nor useful to blame any political party.''
History suggests otherwise. 
 I've been studying the long-term history of inequality in the United States. And it's hard to avoid the sense that it matters a lot which political party, or more accurately, which political ideology rules Washington.
 Since the 1920's there have been four eras of American inequality:
 The Great Compression, 1929-1947: The birth of middle-class America. The real wages of production workers in manufacturing rose 67 percent, while the real income of the richest 1 percent of Americans actually fell 17 percent.
 The Postwar Boom, 1947-1973: An era of widely shared growth. Real wages rose 81 percent, and the income of the richest 1 percent rose 38 percent. 
 Stagflation, 1973-1980: Everyone lost ground. Real wages fell 3 percent, and the income of the richest 1 percent fell 4 percent.
 The New Gilded Age, 1980-?: Big gains at the very top, stagnation below. Between 1980 and 2004, real wages in manufacturing fell 1 percent, while the real income of the richest 1 percent -- people with incomes of more than $277,000 in 2004 -- rose 135 percent.
 What's noticeable is that except during stagflation, when virtually all Americans were hurt by a tenfold increase in oil prices, what happened in each era was what the dominant political tendency of that era wanted to happen. 
 Franklin Roosevelt favored the interests of workers while declaring of plutocrats who considered him a class traitor, ''I welcome their hatred.'' Sure enough, under the New Deal wages surged while the rich lost ground.
 What followed was an era of bipartisanship and political moderation; Dwight Eisenhower said of those who wanted to roll back the New Deal, ''Their number is negligible, and they are stupid.'' Sure enough, it was also an era of equable growth.
 Finally, since 1980 the U.S. political scene has been dominated by a conservative movement firmly committed to the view that what's good for the rich is good for America. Sure enough, the rich have seen their incomes soar, while working Americans have seen few if any gains. 
 By the way: Yes, Bill Clinton was president for eight years. But for six of those years Congress was controlled by hard-line right-wingers. Moreover, in practice Mr. Clinton governed well to the right of both Eisenhower and Nixon.
 Now, this chronology doesn't prove that politics drives changes in inequality. There were certainly other factors at work, including technological change, globalization and immigration, an issue that cuts across party lines. 
 But it seems likely that government policies have played a big role in America's growing economic polarization -- not just easily measured policies like tax rates for the rich and the level of the minimum wage, but things like the shift in Labor Department policy from protection of worker rights to tacit support for union-busting.
 And if that's true, it matters a lot which party is in power -- and more important, which ideology. For the last few decades, even Democrats have been afraid to make an issue out of inequality, fearing that they would be accused of practicing class warfare and lose the support of wealthy campaign contributors. 
 That may be changing. Inequality seems to be an issue whose time has finally come, and if the growing movement to pressure Wal-Mart to treat its workers better is any indication, economic populism is making a comeback. It's still unclear when the Democrats might regain power, or what economic policies they'll pursue when they do. But if and when we get a government that tries to do something about rising inequality, rather than responding with a mixture of denial and fatalism, we may find that Mr. Paulson's ''economic reality'' is a lot easier to change than he supposes.

HEADLINE: Brighter '06 Deficit Outlook, but Long Term Looks Grim

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17 

 BODY:
The federal budget deficit will shrink this year to its lowest level since 2001, but the fiscal outlook for the next 10 years is as bleak as ever, the Congressional Budget Office said Thursday.
 The budget office estimated the deficit for the 2006 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, at $260 billion. That would be $58 billion less than last year, $112 billion less than the agency estimated in March and even lower than the White House's most recent forecast.
 The improvement is almost entirely a result of an unexpectedly big jump in tax revenue, particularly in corporate tax receipts and what appear to be higher payments by the nation's wealthiest households. 
 Measured as a share of the nation's total output, this year's deficit would equal about 2 percent of gross domestic product, a level that Donald B. Marron, acting director of the budget office, described as ''sustainable.''
 But the nonpartisan agency also offered ample evidence that deficits would be above $300 billion, perhaps well above, for much of the next decade.
 Extending President Bush's tax cuts beyond 2010, as Republican leaders want, would cost $1.75 trillion over the next 10 years and widen deficits by about $250 billion a year from 2011 through 2016, the report said.
 On top of that, it said, the government will incur an additional $1 trillion in debt, nearly $100 billion a year, if it prevents an expansion of the alternative minimum tax. That levy was originally aimed at millionaires but is set to engulf many middle-class households because it is not adjusted for inflation. 
 Republicans and Democrats have both pledged to restrain or simply abolish the alternative minimum tax. But the White House budget and the Congressional ''baseline'' forecast released Thursday, which assumes no changes in tax law and a continuation of current spending policy, both presuppose that the tax will remain in place, generating extra revenue.
 Because of the rules that govern the budget office, the baseline analysis calculates estimates of future spending by assuming that military costs in Iraq and Afghanistan, about $95 billion this year, will continue and rise with inflation over the next decade.
 But the new report suggests that even if those costs disappear, as envisioned in the agency's estimates for ''policy alternatives,'' the deficit will still be more than $300 billion in 2016 if Mr. Bush's tax cuts are all extended and the alternative minimum tax is curbed. 
 The new analysis also illustrates the toll being taken by heavy borrowing. One of the biggest single costs in the federal budget, and the one that has grown by far the fastest this year, is interest payments on the government's debt.
 Those payments have jumped almost 20 percent in 2006, to $220 billion, more than what is being spent on Medicaid or on the combined total for all federal income-support programs: unemployment compensation, food stamps, child nutrition programs and the earned-income tax credit.
 Further, the budget office predicted, the interest payments will climb to nearly $300 billion a year by 2010.
 The gain in tax revenue this year, and resulting drop in the deficit, was hailed by Republicans as vindication of their argument that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 had been a powerful economic stimulus.
 The new report ''indicates that Republican pro-growth tax policies are working to grow the economy and generate a strong flow of revenue to the government,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
 Tax revenue has jumped 11.6 percent this year, almost $100 billion more than either the White House or Congress predicted a year ago. Corporate tax revenue has soared 22 percent, to $340 billion. That jump reflects a second straight year of big profit increases as well as the expiration of temporary tax breaks for investments in new equipment. 
 In addition, individual tax collections have climbed more than 14 percent for the second consecutive year. Though full data will not be available for at least another year, analysts believe that the increase resulted primarily from high-income earners' cashing in stock market profits and employee stock options, or receiving big executive bonuses.
 But the new report also projects that tax revenue will climb far more slowly over the next few years. Indeed, it projects a small decline in corporate tax receipts in 2007 and virtually no increase over the next 10 years.
 In a briefing for reporters, Mr. Marron, the budget office's acting chief, said corporate tax receipts were likely to be held down in part because corporate profit margins, which have been unusually high, would probably shrink to more typical levels.
 Democrats said the new report confirmed that under Mr. Bush, deficits would remain high just as the nation prepared for an explosion in Social Security and Medicare costs with the onset of retirement by baby boomers.
 ''Most countries in our circumstances would be running surpluses right now, would be paying down debt or would be prepaying the liability that they know is to come,'' said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. ''Instead, our country, under the Bush administration leadership, is running up massive debt before the baby boomers retire.''
 The looming costs were already apparent in the new report. The oldest of the nation's 76 million baby boomers become eligible to claim Social Security benefits in 2008. Annual spending on Social Security and Medicare is expected to double by 2016, reaching $1.8 trillion.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Leader Faces Increasing Political Challenges

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA; David Rohde contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 14 

 BODY:
Nearly five years after Sept. 11 turned Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, into one of Washington's most indispensable allies, he finds himself squeezed from many directions, leading to one of the most serious political binds of his nearly seven-year tenure. 
 His two main political foes, who undermined each other for years, are linking arms in an effort to restore civilian rule. Some erstwhile allies on the religious right, emboldened by spreading rage against General Musharraf's pro-American stance, have stepped up their criticism.
Corruption scandals have dogged some of his partners, including the prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, who faces a no-confidence motion in Parliament next week. Inflation has increased. An ethnic insurgency in Baluchistan refuses to subside; Pakistan attributes it to unfriendly neighbors.
 No one doubts that the president, who is also the army chief of staff, remains the most powerful man in Pakistan and enjoys the backing of the United States. ''He still makes the political weather,'' as one Western diplomat put it. But there are signs of weakness. 
 Last month a letter signed by a group of retired generals and government officials, including those who once worked with him, called for ''the military's disengagement from political power,'' urging General Musharraf to shed his military uniform if he was to remain president. 
 In Washington there are also simmering concerns. A series of planned terrorist attacks with links to Pakistan as well as a sharp rise in crossborder Taliban attacks in Afghanistan have prompted renewed debate within the Defense Department about Pakistan, according to two people involved who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. 
 They said that in particular, the sharply rising American casualty rate in Afghanistan had increased skepticism among some American military officers about the Pakistani intelligence service's efforts to rein in the Taliban.
 ''There is an increasing view in the United States that Pakistan isn't very helpful,'' said one researcher involved in the debate, referring to frustration among some officers. ''There are people who are really thinking twice about this relationship with Pakistan.''
 At home, General Musharraf has been criticized for having little to show for his overtures toward India. Likewise, his post-Sept. 11 assault on suspected militants taking shelter in the tribal areas along the Afghan border, done at the behest of the Bush administration, has resulted in the capture of a number of leaders of Al Qaeda but also the deaths of hundreds of Pakistani troops and a mounting rage in the tribal areas. 
 At the same time, Afghanistan and India have been nipping at the general's heels for not doing enough to crack down on militants who they say export violence to their respective countries. Religious radical groups continue to operate here, including those that have links with banned terrorist outfits. 
 They continue to be implicated in investigations of terrorism suspects half a world away, most recently the group Jamaat ud Dawa in the London airplane bombing plot. Even General Musharraf's promise to reform radical madrasas, as Islamic religious schools are called, has yet to be fulfilled. 
 ''There are new domestic eruptions, and he hasn't yet drenched the fires on the foreign policy front,'' said Najam Sethi, editor of The Daily Times in Lahore. 
 A Western diplomat here in Pakistan said, ''Musharraf is in a weaker position than he has been in the past, no doubt about it.'' The diplomat, who could not be identified by name because he was not authorized to comment publicly on the politics of this country, added, ''There are constraints on him.'' 
 But in Washington the official view remains strongly supportive. Richard A. Boucher, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, credited General Musharraf with having kept his promise to ''break'' with the Taliban and their Qaeda allies. 
 Although the Taliban have reorganized inside Pakistan, Mr. Boucher said, General Musharraf's government is trying to gain control of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. 
 ''They've closed some camps; they've outlawed some groups,'' he said in an interview. ''You have to understand how deeply rooted extremism is in Pakistan.'' Of the general's cooperation with Washington, he added: ''I think we've seen plenty. We certainly work with Musharraf.'' 
 The coming months pose a big question mark. With elections expected before the end of next year, there is a concern among friends and critics alike: Will domestic politics further compromise his ability to drive through promised reforms? 
 For the sake of staying in power, political observers say, he must broaden his support. If he broadens it in favor of the right, his ability to crack down on religious extremists will be further compromised. 
 If he broadens in favor of the political left, he will be more able to carry out his promise to crack down on extremism, but will then have to embrace a political nemesis: Benazir Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, who lives in exile, having been convicted of corruption. She has signed a pact with Nawaz Sharif, the other main opposition party leader, also in exile, and his Pakistan Muslim League. 
 ''He is getting increasingly isolated and cornered,'' Lt. Gen. Talat Masood, now retired from the army and one of the signers of the letter, said of General Musharraf. ''There is a genuine urge and demand in the country to revert to democracy and give a fair deal to all the parties.'' 
 For his part, the president presented a lengthy defense of his record in a speech to the nation in late July -- one that also revealed the breadth of his troubles. Addressing inflation, he announced that government shops would sell basic staples to the poor at controlled prices. 
 He said the domestic budget had more than doubled during his nearly seven-year tenure, he outlined a development plan for restive Baluchistan, and he rattled off how many tractors and motorcycles were being produced in the country. The economy has grown at an annual clip of 7 percent over the last three years.
 He criticized India and Afghanistan for suggesting that his efforts to tackle terrorist groups were less than robust. And on the subject of religious radicals, he urged mosques to refrain from using loudspeakers, demanded that ''hate material'' not be circulated and urged government officials to ''look at the problem and take it seriously.'' 
 It was remarkably similar to, though far more tepid than, wish lists he has presented before. 
 General Musharraf's promise of madrasa reform fell under renewed scrutiny in the aftermath of the London subway and bus bombings in July 2005. At the time, he promised to expel foreigners studying in Pakistani madrasas and he ordered his government to register all of the madrasas by the end of last year.
 Resistance was swift, especially from the coalition of Islamic religious parties. The government has not persuaded all madrasas to register. It has allowed foreign students to remain, so long as they have permission from their home governments. Enforcement is daunting. 
 Even his fiercest critics acknowledge that some of his troubles are the doings of others. For instance, they say, India's recalcitrance at his Kashmir proposals -- principally his offer to soften the so-called Line of Control that divides the territory between the countries -- has weakened his credibility at home. 
 Except for the release of prisoners and opening of transportation links, they argue, nearly every piece of the India-Pakistan peace agenda remains unresolved, from smaller territorial issues to the hardest nut of all: the fate of Kashmir. 
 ''He has tried, he has failed, and the Indians share responsibility for that,'' said one of the general's most trenchant opposition critics, Aitzaz Ahsan of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. 
 Likewise, there are the tribal areas. No civilian government, Mr. Ahsan conceded, could have sent hundreds of Pakistani troops to face the Taliban -- and die -- in the hilly redoubts in the north, as General Musharraf did at American urging. 
 But his policy has helped to push the tribal regions further beyond the writ of the government and has not quieted the Taliban and their allies. The Pakistani government insists that it is trying its best to root out Taliban and that it is unfairly blamed for Afghanistan's failure to expel them from inside its own borders. 
 There is another opinion: that five years after Sept. 11 and Washington's weariness in Afghanistan, Pakistan has no interest in completely quelling the Taliban. It would not be in General Musharraf's interest, the argument goes, to forever lose all political influence over Kabul. 
 ''The Pakistanis saw their concessions as temporary,'' argued Stephen P. Cohen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''They have permanent interests in Afghanistan and are waiting for the U.S. to depart. Now that we are on our way out of Kabul, I can expect Islamabad to try to increase its support for its clients in Afghanistan.''

An article last Friday about political pressure on Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, misstated the legal status of Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister who lives in exile and who has called for restoration of civilian rule. While she was convicted twice on money laundering charges, Ms. Bhutto successfully appealed the verdicts, and both convictions were set aside.

HEADLINE: Plan for New Rail Station Appears Stalled Once Again 

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The $900 million plan to transform the city's former general post office building on Eighth Avenue into a dramatic new transit hub connected to Pennsylvania Station appears to be delayed again.
 State and city officials had hoped that the Public Authorities Control Board would approve the long-awaited project, which would be called Moynihan Station, at its meeting in Albany today. They want construction to begin this fall on what proponents say would be a grand gateway to New York City and a necessary expansion of the nation's busiest transit center. But that now seems unlikely.
Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, who controls the state board together with Gov. George E. Pataki and Joseph L. Bruno, the state Senate majority leader, said yesterday that there are still too many unresolved questions. 
 In addition, he said, there is also a new, more comprehensive proposal to modernize and expand Penn Station on both sides of Eighth Avenue, between 31st and 33rd Streets, by moving Madison Square Garden a block west to the back of the post office building that was to be converted into Moynihan Station.
 ''There are a lot of questions about the financing and what the final project will look like,'' Mr. Silver said in an interview yesterday. ''It does not appear we'll have the answers in time for tomorrow's meeting.''
 Mr. Silver's decision was supported by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is running for governor. He expressed concern that the plan had been rushed before the state board. 
 ''Unfortunately, this is part of a pattern of irresponsible actions by the outgoing Pataki administration,'' said a spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer, Christine Anderson, who added that the state board ''should not approve this project until these unanswered questions are resolved.''
 The prospect of yet another delay angered some proponents of the plan and delighted others.
 State officials bristled at Mr. Spitzer's criticism. ''We should move forward with what this Moynihan Station was all about from the beginning, expanding Penn Station to meet the needs of transit riders today and in the future,'' said Charles A. Gargano, the state's top economic-development official. He said that going forward with Moynihan Station now would not preclude doing the larger proposal, which, he added, would take a minimum of 18 months to put into place.
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who died in 2003, championed the conversion of the James A. Farley post office building into a great train station for more than a decade. Much of the financing was put in place in 2001. Last year, the state selected two developers -- Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty, and Stephen M. Ross, chairman of the Related Companies.
 Aside from the political sparring, the nub of the issue today is that the developers subsequently put together what some are calling Plan B: the complete renovation of Penn Station, which sits below Madison Square Garden, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. The current Garden would be demolished to make way for office towers, a soaring glass canopy and a commercial complex. Across Eighth Avenue, the post office would be converted to an adjunct train station.
 The nascent proposal has sparked widespread interest.
 ''This larger project has so much more economic benefit that it's really important to focus on getting the entire project, including Madison Square Garden, locked down,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, who supports the delay.
 But city officials and some civic groups said that work on Moynihan Station should begin now. The developers, who declined to comment on the vote in Albany, have told state and city officials that the work on the Farley building would not preclude the larger project. ''We'd like to see something move forward now,'' said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff. ''There's no downside to going ahead with the current plan. It will not compromise our ability to work out the larger plan.''
 The Municipal Art Society, which has long supported the Moynihan Station project and has expressed reservations about the larger plan, also opposed further delays. ''Whatever the virtues of Plan B, it is years away from starting,'' said Kent Barwick, the society's president.

HEADLINE: Off the Beaten Path, Offbeat Sports Are Thriving

BYLINE: By JASON SKOG

 BODY:
Sprouting almost overnight, a maze of yellow tents and shiny aluminum bleachers covers a swath of Coney Island beachfront typically inhabited by sunbathers and sand castle builders.
 The Association of Volleyball Professionals Crocs Tour is in town, and the sand will not be the same until the athletes pack up and move on to the next city.
Last weekend in Long Beach, N.Y., the Beach Tennis USA tour held a regional tournament, and it will return there for the national championships Sept. 2-3. 
 Touring sporting events are nothing new, but the sports event travel industry involving amateur participatory sports is growing. Recent studies suggest the events generate as much as $4 billion each year. 
 The industry includes events like soccer and softball tournaments, surfing contests and the N.C.A.A. Final Four. The tournaments attract young and old, male and female, weekend warriors and seasoned professionals. They may be traditional youth baseball tournaments that are held in the same stadium with new players and new crowds every year, but more often they are itinerant events, parachuting into communities and transforming beachfronts, parking lots and vacant fields for a few days each summer.
 The events can attract a few dozen to a few thousand people, who spend money in local hotels, restaurants and shops. The trend is a contrast to high-profile professional franchises pursuing multiyear television deals and multimillion-dollar stadiums.
 ''This is an industry,'' said Don Schumacher, executive director of the National Association of Sports Commissions in Cincinnati. ''We're not just talking about a few zealots around the country who like beach volleyball.''
 Schumacher's organization was founded in 1992 with 15 sporting commissions and authorities. Now there are more than 400 member organizations representing more than 350 cities competing for sports-travel events.
 The most popular sports are soccer, basketball, baseball, softball and volleyball, but rugby and lacrosse events are making big gains. ''Those sports weren't even in view 10 years ago,'' Schumacher said.
 Beach tennis was not an organized sport in the United States 18 months ago. Marc Altheim happened upon the sport -- which combines a beach volleyball court with the rules and scoring of tennis (without the bouncing) -- in 2003 while vacationing in Aruba. By May 2005, the beach tennis tour had held its inaugural event in Charleston, S.C. This year, a truck filled with customized nets, racquets and balls and emblazoned with the Beach Tennis USA logo made its way across the country to introduce the sport to the West Coast.
 Altheim and his team set up seven courts in Santa Monica, Calif., and Long Beach, Calif., and more than 750 people stopped by to take a whack. ''In some places, people are more apt to stop and watch,'' Altheim said. ''In California, we couldn't keep up with the waiting list of people who wanted to play.''
 Altheim said he has been receiving more and more calls from interested host cities.
 ''Pretty much everybody we talk to about it wants us to do it,'' he said. ''The only problem is getting a permit. We are so new, they have to fit us under a category they don't have.''
 The Coney Island stop on the A.V.P. Crocs Tour brought 32 men's teams and 32 women's teams, a total of 128 players, which were expected to draw tens of thousands of fans.
 Leonard Armato, commissioner of the A.V.P. tour, said the tour stops were selected based on corporate sponsors, community partners and facilities.
 ''We want to build flagship events,'' he said. ''We want people to be able to circle their calendars.''
 He said cities were eager to hold the A.V.P. because it attracts the coveted 18-to-34-year-old demographic.
 Buddy Wheeler, sports marketing coordinator for Virginia Beach, said traveling sports were spreading.
 ''Beach wrestling has taken off all of a sudden, and I got a group in Raleigh that was concerned because they didn't have a beach,'' Wheeler said. ''But they can do the same thing. I don't think it's confined to beach communities.''
 Many cities truck in sand to hold events typically reserved for coastal beach communities. Altheim's beach tennis tour may make a stop in Milwaukee. ''I don't even know if Milwaukee has a beach,'' Altheim said, ''but we're trying to meet their needs.''
 Wheeler said he thought America's appetite for sports was growing more diverse.
 ''It used to be the only thing on TV was baseball, basketball and football in season,'' he said. ''Now you flip around on cable and you see everything.''
 The North American Sand Soccer Championships in Virginia Beach started in the early 1990's with 26 teams. In 2006, it had more than 8,000 players on 739 teams.
 ''If you include all the players, their moms, dads, kids, wives and girlfriends, and you've got more than 25,000 people,'' said Dick Whalen, the event's executive director. ''They bring their lawn chair and picnic basket or sit in the bleachers and see everything that's going on and then go right back to what they were doing.''
 Schumacher said several factors had contributed to the growth of participatory sporting events, including the desire of baby boomers to stay in shape while spending more time with their families. 
 And the smallest athletes produce the biggest payoffs. ''The younger the athlete, the more people travel with the team,'' Schumacher said. ''And as far as the grand slam? Young female travelers. Daughters will produce grandma and grandpa, whereas a son most likely will not.'' 
 A soccer team of about 18 players will easily generate 40 or 50 travelers, he said. ''This is a business. It's not just for fun. It's very rewarding.''
 Cities are most interested in events that fill hotel rooms, measuring success by the number of ''room nights'' they bring, said Schumacher, who is working on a report on what makes sports-travel events attractive to cities.
 ''The No. 1 reason communities are in the business is room nights,'' he said. ''Because if you get the room nights, visitors will spend money in other ways. You get the meals, the car rental, shopping and ancillary spending at a water park, a round of golf or a museum.''
 National television exposure used to be a priority for cities, Schumacher said. ''People used to say if you were hosting the Super Bowl, it was an honor,'' he said. ''But if you're a Super Bowl city or an N.C.A.A. Final Four host, it's not worth it if there aren't people staying in your hotels.''
 Marc Schreiber, vice president of marketing and development for the St. Louis Sports Commission, said that while the economic impact of an event was always a consideration, the top priority is finding events that excite St. Louis residents.
 ''If you're bringing in things that people yawn about, you're not doing it right,'' Schreiber said.
 Schreiber said the commission received credit for the events it attracted, ''but we should get more credit for the events we don't bring,'' he said. 
 ''There's a whole host of things that get passed over as you evaluate what's going to fit here and what isn't,'' he said. ''It may not be a good fit financially, or it may not play as well here.''
 The Long Island Sports Commission, a division of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau, worked for years to land the A.V.P. Crocs Tour. But this weekend's event is just one of more than 100 the commission has worked to attract.
 ''Some of them take two or three years to organize,'' said Regina Zara, director of sales and sports development for the Long Island Sports Commission. ''But it's worth it.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 26, 2006

 CORRECTION:
A sports article last Saturday about the popularity of offbeat sporting events misidentified the organization responsible for bringing the Association of Volleyball Professionals Crocs Tour to Coney Island last weekend. It was the New York City Sports Commission, not the Long Island Sports Commission. The article, in mistakenly crediting the Long Island group, misconstrued a comment by Regina Zara, director of sales and sports development for that commission. In referring to the activities of the Long Island group, she was not saying it sponsored the event on Coney Island.

HEADLINE: Economy Is Slowing. That's Reason to: (a) Cheer (b) Fret. 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
ECONOMICS quiz: The economy showed signs of slowing this week. Is that good or bad?
 The consensus among economists and investors is that a slowdown is good. At least as long as it's not too much and as long as inflation is kept in check.
The news was less positive for some big names in business: Wal-Mart and Dell. One disclosed a worrying drop-off in sales while the other warned of an unexpected spike in costs.

COOLING OFF -- Despite higher energy prices and rising rents, the government's latest report on consumer prices suggests that inflation is moderating. 
 Over all, prices rose 0.4 percent last month -- and 2.7 percent above July of last year, which is well above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. But after excluding two volatile components, energy and food prices, the so-called core inflation rate rose 0.2 percent, the smallest increase in five months.
 Clothing prices actually fell significantly last month as retailers sought to work down inventories.
 The report seemed to affirm the Fed's decision last week to stop its string of 17 consecutive interest rate increases. Policy makers said they saw signs that higher rates were a drag on the economy and were thus curbing inflation, as intended, and that no more increases were warranted at the time.
 Affirmation of a slower economy may come on Thursday, when the Commerce Department releases durable-goods orders for July. Analysts expect no increase over June, when orders rose a brisk 2.9 percent.

A BELLWETHER SLIPS -- For the first time in a decade, Wal-Mart posted a decline in its quarterly profit. The drop came after the company pulled out of Germany, where it had struggled for years, but more worrying for Wal-Mart watchers was tepid growth in the United States, by far its largest market.
 For the quarter ended July 31, Wal-Mart said its profit dropped 26 percent, to $2.08 billion, even as sales rose 11 percent, to $84.5 billion. Sales in the United States grew only 6.9 percent.
 Wal-Mart executives attributed the stalling of domestic sales to high gasoline prices, which affect its customers -- many of whom make less than $30,000 a year -- more than those of other retailers.
 Another big retailer, the Lowe's Companies, is scheduled to post its second-quarter earnings before the stock market opens on Monday.

RECORD RECALL -- Dell is recalling 4.1 million notebook computer batteries in the largest safety recall ever in the consumer electronics industry, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
 Dell said it moved to recall the lithium-ion batteries because they could erupt in flames. It told the safety agency it knew of six cases since December in which notebooks overheated or caught on fire. None caused injuries or death. Sony made the batteries that Dell said were defective.
 Depending on how many of the batteries are still being used, the recall could cost $300 million or more. The recall affects almost one in five notebook computers that Dell made during the period in question.
 The recall raises broader questions about the safety of lithium-ion batteries, which are also used in cellphones, camcorders, digital cameras and MP3 players, especially after several recent fires involving notebook computers, some aboard planes.

WIND AND WATER -- A federal judge in Mississippi decided that home insurance companies did not have to pay for damage from flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina, but affirmed that they must pay for damage from the hurricane's high winds.
 Insurers have already paid $17.6 billion for residential damage attributed to wind only. Had they been forced to cover damage from flooding caused by the storm, as policyholders demanded, insurers would have been liable for billions more in claims.
 Homeowners and the insurance industry had watched the case closely as the first test of whether insurers are responsible for paying for damages caused by both wind and water. Insurers said their policies ruled out coverage for flooding; homeowners said the policies had so many references to hurricanes that many customers concluded that any hurricane damage would be covered.
 For the couple who brought the lawsuit, Paul and Julie Leonard of Pascagoula, Miss., the ruling means they will receive about $3,000 to cover damage to their home, rather than the more than $130,000 they had sought.

THINK GLOBALLY -- PepsiCo named its president and chief financial officer, Indra K. Nooyi, 50, to succeed Steven S. Reinemund as chief executive, becoming the largest company by market capitalization to be led by a woman.
 When she steps up, in October, Ms. Nooyi, who was born in India, will become PepsiCo's fifth chief executive in its 41-year history. She takes over at a time when both PepsiCo and its rival, Coca-Cola, are fighting efforts to ban their drinks in some areas of India.
 Since coming to PepsiCo in 1994, Ms. Nooyi worked closely with Mr. Reinemund as the company's revenue increased by more than $9 billion, to $33 billion. This year, PepsiCo's market capitalization passed that of Coca-Cola.
 Only 16.7 percent of corporate officers are women, a small rise from 15.7 percent in 2002, according to the women's research organization Catalyst.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Tumbles To Lowest Level Since October 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Terrorism fears and higher gasoline prices unexpectedly drove confidence among consumers this month to its lowest level since October.
 The University of Michigan's preliminary index of sentiment declined more than forecast, to 78.7 from 84.7 in July. Waning optimism threatens to slow consumer spending, which accounts for about three-fourths of gross domestic product. 
The survey came after reports earlier in the week pointed to a continuing slowdown in the economy that might allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged after ending a two-year credit tightening last week. The conflict in Lebanon, which drove energy prices higher, and news of a foiled plot to blow up airliners probably contributed to the decline in confidence, economists said.
 ''The headline news about the foiled terror plot and high gasoline prices are rattling consumer attitudes,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research. ''This helps the Fed's cause of pausing in the interest rate cycle.''
 The university's report also showed an increase in inflation expectations, possibly a reflection of the rise in energy costs earlier this month. 
 Consumers in the Michigan survey said they expected an inflation rate of 4.2 percent in one year, up from 3.2 percent in the July survey and the highest since October 2005.
 Excluding September and October, when inflation expectations jumped in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the one-year price reading would be the highest since December 1990, shortly before the start of the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
 The Michigan index was expected by economists to decline to 83.8 in August. 
 The expectations index, which some economists view as an indicator of consumer spending, declined to 64.5 from a July reading of 72.5.

HEADLINE: A Car-Sales Indicator Suggests a Recession Is Near or Already Here

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IF things are miserable for America's new-car dealers, can a recession be averted? History says it cannot and suggests a downturn may have already begun.
 The accompanying chart shows the rate of change in sales by new-car dealers, comparing the most recent 12 months with the 12 months before that; it is adjusted for inflation. The rule -- unveiled here for the first time -- is that if the figure is down 2 percent or more, a recession is either under way or set to begin within a few months. The figure fell to a negative 2.4 percent when June sales figures were released last week by the Census Bureau.
The available data go back to 1968, a period in which the American economy has recorded six recessions. The ''dealer doldrums indicator,'' as we will call it, called five of them, missing the 1981-82 recession only because it was not persuaded that the 1980 downturn had ever ended. It has never warned of a recession that did not occur. 
 The risk of using 12-month figures is that by the time bad news is clear from new-car sales, it can be overwhelmingly obvious from other economic indicators. But such long periods avoid the possibility of false readings because of the volatility of new-car sales.
 The chart measures all sales by new-car dealers, which is how the retail sales statistics report the data. So it includes their revenue from used-car sales, parts and service. But it does not include sales by dealers who sell only used cars or repair garages that are not also car dealers.
 New-car dealers, according to Census Bureau officials who compile the data, typically generate about half their revenue from selling new cars, a quarter from selling used cars and the rest from sales of parts and from repair and service. So we constructed a new-car-dealer inflation index based on the consumer price indexes for those categories and used it to make the figures comparable, since inflation varied widely over the period.
 The accompanying table shows that the indicator sounded two months before the 1980 recession began, but otherwise went off after downturns had started but before they had ended. In some cases, a recession was indicated before it was officially recognized by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
 No indicator is perfect, of course, and this one was developed knowing when the earlier recessions had occurred. But it makes sense, in part because there are often cheaper alternatives to new-car dealers, whether for service or for buying used cars that may be older or have more miles than the preowned vehicles that new-car dealers feature on their used-car lots. So such dealers are likely to lose market share when times turn bad.
 If a recession is under way, this economic recovery will have been the least beneficial one ever for the new-car dealers. The best inflation-adjusted year-over-year increase in their revenue during the recovery was 6.9 percent, far below the peaks of other recoveries. 
 There is, of course, no mystery now as to what the problems are for car dealers. They are pinched by the slumping real estate market because people can take less money out of home equity to buy cars. And soaring gasoline prices have made driving much more expensive and new-car payments more burdensome. In July, sales at gasoline stations accounted for 10 percent of all retail sales, the highest figure in decades.
 Dealers are hurting. The rest of us may soon share their pain.

HEADLINE: When one thinks about forces on religion, does the spirit of the open road come up for consideration?

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
What would you put on a list of forces that have shaped and reshaped religion in the United States? 
 Broad religious movements like frontier revivalism, the Social Gospel or the pluralism of faiths owed to Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu immigrants?
Theological currents like Transcendentalism in the 19th century or neo-Orthodoxy in the 20th? 
 Theological battles like those over slavery, evolution and church-state ties? 
 Charismatic preachers like George Whitefield, Billy Graham and Martin Luther King Jr.? 
 How about the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956? Signed into law 50 years ago last June by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, it started the Interstate Highway System, one of the largest public works programs in the nation's history. It transformed the United States' physical landscape and, it seems, its religious one. 
 ''The nation's embrace of automobility profoundly affected its spiritual life,'' Jenna Weissman Joselit noted three weeks ago in a shrewd reflection on this 50th anniversary. Writing in The Daily Jewish Forward on Aug. 4, Ms. Joselit examined the impact that the iron triangle of car, highway and suburbia had had on Jewish life, and on Conservative Judaism in particular. 
 Delicately balanced between the traditional strictures of Orthodox Judaism and the modernizing flexibility of Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism seemed to take naturally to the suburban mixture of old values and new setting. The movement, Ms. Joselit wrote, ''experienced its greatest and most sustained period of growth during the 1950's and 60's.''
 But the car culture of suburbia proved to be a snake in the garden, especially for that central element of Jewish life, observance of the Sabbath. The new ease of transportation reinforced the temptation to spend the day not as a holy day of rest and spiritual renewal but as a busy one of errands, golf and family outings. 
 To complicate matters, the low density of suburban populations -- and all the more so of suburban Jewish populations -- militated against having a synagogue within walking distance, as required by Conservative Judaism, as well as Orthodox Judaism's position that driving was not permitted on the Sabbath. 
 But what if synagogue attendance, and therefore an important element of Sabbath observance and Jewish life, could actually be strengthened by revoking this traditional ban, at least to permit driving to public worship on the Sabbath when it would otherwise be difficult? 
 In 1958, that is the question that the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly tackled. After intense analysis and argument over venerable rabbinic rulings, like those barring lighting fires on the Sabbath or riding during that day on a horse or in a wagon, the committee issued a historic ''Responsum on the Sabbath.'' It permitted Sabbath travel by car, provided, as Ms. Joselit wrote, ''it was headed in the direction of the synagogue, not the shopping center.'' 
 Orthodox authorities, of course, dismissed this ruling, and from 1958 to this day the Responsum has continued to have notable critics within Conservative ranks. Ms. Joselit limits herself to saying that ''for all its good intentions, the Responsum on the Sabbath did little to change things.'' 
 ''The siren call of the open road, of freedom,'' she wrote, ''proved just too hard to resist.''
 Ms. Joselit's article caught the attention of Martin E. Marty, the Nestor of American religious history. Commenting on it in the online newsletter Sightings, he did not dispute her conclusion but offered a somewhat different moral to the story. 
 Her piece ''illustrated a main theme favored by historians of religion,'' Dr. Marty wrote on Aug. 14. ''Changes that affect understandings of God, attendance at worship and other aspects of religious life derive less from concordats and changed creeds than from subtle shifts in behavior.''
 ''The high rise and the long weekend,'' he said, ''are bigger God killers than Nietzsche ever was.'' 
 Dr. Marty mentioned that the half-century since the introduction of the Interstate Highway System helped birth an America on wheels had also brought conservative Protestantism's accommodation to Sunday shopping and Sunday spectator sports. He could have added that the movement from city neighborhoods to suburbia affected Roman Catholics as profoundly as it did Jews. 
 Along with the G.I. Bill of Rights' giving many working-class Catholics access to higher education and the professions, the move to suburbia probably did more to break up the highly defined, tightly organized and ethnically rooted Catholic subculture than did the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960's. That reality gets lost in the continuing dustups among Catholics about the council and its aftermath.
 Likewise, in the endless debates about the shrinking of mainline Protestant denominations and the growth of evangelical ones, comparative birth rates and population movements may be as significant as theological doctrines or pastoral strategies. You learn that only by reading sociologists, not theologians or church leaders. 
 The importance of such sociological and economic developments for religious life ought to be obvious; but it is striking how often they are ignored in the theological wrangles that divide religious groups. 
 Those theological wrangles must not be belittled. It makes a great difference whether the Conservative rabbis who voted to permit travel by car to Sabbath services were advancing or undercutting their tradition's basic principles in the way that they interpreted authoritative texts and contemporary needs. 
 Still, their decision, one way or the other, was not going to block the era of smooth roadways and fast transportation that President Eisenhower helped usher in on June 29, 1956. Whatever they did, the consequences would be lived out in a dramatically changed environment. Religious bodies find themselves in that situation more often than they like to admit. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 25, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The Beliefs column on Saturday, about the impact of the automobile and suburbia on Jewish life, misstated the date of the Responsum on the Sabbath, a ruling by Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards that permitted travel by car to synagogue services on the Sabbath. It was 1950, not 1958.

HEADLINE: Time Shares Are Shedding The Faint Odor of Disrepute

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You have probably seen the marketing pitches in the mail promising luxury hotel accommodations or new televisions just for listening to a time-share presentation.
 Tempting, but no, I'd say, tossing the brochure in the trash. Trapped in a room with someone giving me the hard sell is not my idea of fun. Besides, time shares always seemed to be the used-car dealerships of vacations -- slightly sleazy, with a real chance of being a scheme.
But increasingly, friends and family are mentioning that they are flying to Hawaii or South Africa or France to stay in their time shares. And they brag about how it costs them almost nothing and how they can trade their time share for a vacation site practically anywhere in the world.
 Maybe it's time for a second look. 
 Lisa Ann Schreier, who worked in time share sales and is founder of Timeshare Insights (timeshareinsights.com), says they can be a good vacation option if you go in knowing what to expect.
 ''Don't believe everything good or bad that you hear,'' Ms. Schreier, author of ''Timeshare Vacations for Dummies,'' (Wiley, 2005) said. ''There's no such thing as 'free, perfect, always and never.' Nothing is free, nothing is perfect and don't believe assurances that you can always get the time share trade you want or maintenance fees never go up.''
 The negative reputation time shares have dates to the early days, about 30 years ago, when it was not unheard-of for customers to put down money based on wild promises of beautiful resorts soon to be built.
 The complexes were never constructed, the developers disappeared and the money was never seen again.
 That practice is much less common now, with a flurry of laws passed by most states in the mid-1980's regulating the industry, but the whiff of disrepute also has to do with the free offers and often high-pressure sales tactics that are still used by some developers.
 ''If Circuit City offered two free tickets to '21' for coming to look at a TV, you'd think something is wrong with the TV,'' Ms. Schreier said. ''But the time share industry refuses to change.''
 Nonetheless, she said, it is a good idea to look beyond the sales pitches and see the reality.
 The term time share encompasses many options, but generally, in this country, it is joint ownership or lease of a vacation property that you can use for part of the year, usually one or two weeks annually.
 In some cases -- primarily overseas -- the time share is available on a lease for a predetermined number of years.
 Time shares now include hotel rooms, yachts and castles, but the resort condominiums with pools and tennis courts still dominate; Florida has almost 28 percent of the entire United States inventory. 
 Another term, ''fractional ownership,'' pops up when discussing time shares. These are generally more upscale properties that people buy for longer periods of time, three weeks or a month. For example, Marriott International, which owns the Ritz-Carlton, offers fractional ownership programs at the Ritz-Carlton.
 Ms. Schreier's rule of thumb is if you vacation more than five nights a year, spend $70 or more a night and enjoy knowing pretty much what kind of quality you're going to get, time shares might be a good option.
 In the universe of all time shares, a midrange two-bedroom time share in a good location in a good season can cost $12,000 to $20,000.
 Prices can climb up to $117,000 for a penthouse in Maui during prime time, like Christmas or New Year's, said Ed Kinney, a spokesman for Marriott Vacation Club International.
 The upfront price does not include annual maintenance fees, which can run several hundred dollars a year and up.
 Then there's the issue of exchanging your place for another. There are almost 6,000 time share resorts worldwide, with the majority affiliated either with Resort Condominiums International or Interval International.
 These companies make money by charging fees to exchange property -- $100 to $200 a transaction, depending on the company and whether the trade is domestic or international.
 The big players offer more choices, but some consumers prefer to go with smaller companies that they say offer better customer service, for example, Trading Places (tradingplaces.com) and Dial an Exchange (daelive.com).
 The ability to exchange your place depends on what size it is, how upscale the resort, how desirable the location (think of Orlando, Fla., or Hawaii) and the supply of time shares in the area you're looking to go.
 ''If you have a time share in Mississippi, you better like it, because you'll have a hard time trading it,'' Ms. Schreier said.
 The system seems byzantine to an outsider, but apparently once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple to figure out how to get where you want to go when you want to go.
 My friend Veronica bought a three-bedroom time share in Orlando three years ago, five years after attending a sales presentation.
 ''We didn't purchase then, but it opened our eyes to what a time share was,'' she said. They waited until they could afford $15,000 for the property, and so far have been more than happy.
 They have already been to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and this year they are off to California and Hawaii.
 For Veronica, one of the best things about a time share is that it is already paid for (minus the travel expenses), which means her workaholic husband is much more likely to actually take vacations.
 ''That's what they told us at the sales pitch,'' she said. ''You don't want to waste your money, so this way you'll go on vacation -- and in our experience that's true.''
 Ray Jacobs, editor of TimeSharing Today (tstoday.com), an independent magazine devoted to the industry, said surveys showed customer satisfaction with time shares hovered around 85 percent. 
 The most common complaint is an inability to exchange at a convenient time.
 ''Many people are unrealistic about where and when they want to go, but a lot of people also don't have much flexibility,'' Mr. Jacobs said.
 A class-action suit was filed in March against RCI, asserting the company rents out empty time shares to the general public rather than making them available in the exchange pool. RCI said it would not comment on pending litigation.
 Mr. Jacobs pointed out, however, that RCI, which dominates the market, made 2.6 million time share exchanges last year.
 According to Kenneth May, chief executive and chairman of RCI, the time share industry has grown by 12 percent to 15 percent annually over the last 15 years. It's now even expanding to China.
 ''The person most likely to buy a time share is someone who already owns one,'' he said.
 But don't buy a time share with the idea that you're investing in something that will appreciate over time. 
 ''It's an emotional investment,'' Mr. May said. ''The resale market is not one of the strengths of time shares yet -- it still has to be developed.''
 Mr. Jacobs agreed that time shares were not the place to make a real estate killing, as properties depreciate immediately, but noted that the resales were becoming more popular; he estimated they were now 15 percent of the market. If an owner sells a time share bought new from a developer, he or she will probably get only half the purchase price, Mr. Jacobs said; people who buy from other individuals usually break even when they sell.
 Some words of advice from those who've seen it all before:
 Make sure the time share is ''salable, rentable and willable,'' Ms. Schreier said. 
 Find out if you have to use the time share on a fixed week every year, or if it floats, which allows owners to pick a week to vacation, usually within a particular season. Both fixed and floating have benefits -- do you have to have a place every spring break, or are you more flexible?
 Does the insurance cover the replacement cost if your time share is wrecked by, say, a hurricane?
 Is there a cap on maintenance fees? Can they be raised arbitrarily?
 So, with this newfound knowledge, would we buy a time share? I would no longer dismiss it out of hand, but for economic reasons alone, it's not something that's going to happen in the near future. For now, we're going to rely on an even older method of vacation sharing -- staying free with relatives.

HEADLINE: Quattrone May Avoid 3rd Trial

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Frank P. Quattrone, the Silicon Valley banker who helped drive the 1990's boom in technology, has reached a deal with federal prosecutors that will allow him to avoid a third criminal trial on obstruction charges and resume a career in finance, people briefed on the negotiations said yesterday. 
 Mr. Quattrone will enter into a deferred-prosecution agreement that will impose no penalty if he does not violate any laws in the next several years, these people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the judge has not yet formally approved the settlement. While deferred-prosecution agreements often include an admission of wrongdoing, there is no such statement by Mr. Quattrone in the settlement, they said. 
For federal prosecutors who had once sought to portray Mr. Quattrone as a symbol of Wall Street greed and manipulation during the dot-com bubble, the settlement is a significant retreat. The case against Mr. Quattrone had been the most prominent prosecution of a Wall Street figure since Michael R. Milken, who pleaded guilty to six securities charges in 1990.
 Now, speculation has been rampant in Silicon Valley that Mr. Quattrone will start a boutique advisory and private equity firm focused on technology companies. He may even try to reassemble some of his former team of bankers from his old firm, Credit Suisse First Boston.
 The agreement is expected to be presented for approval before Judge George B. Daniels of Federal District Court in Manhattan at a hearing on Tuesday. 
 A spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Quattrone also declined to comment.
 Mr. Quattrone, who as an investment banker led the initial public offerings of companies like Amazon.com and Cisco Systems, was convicted in May 2004 of obstruction of justice as a result of endorsing a colleague's e-mail message in December 2000 that urged his staff to ''clean up those files.'' An earlier trial on the same charges resulted in a deadlocked jury and was declared a mistrial.
 But in March, a federal appeals court overturned the 2004 conviction, finding that the judge's instructions to the jurors had failed to adequately require that they establish that Mr. Quattrone intended to thwart a government investigation.
 That reversal was the first in a series of victories for Mr. Quattrone. A few days later, the Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the lifetime ban from the securities industry that it had imposed on Mr. Quattrone. And in June, NASD, the brokerage industry's regulator, dropped its charges against him. 
 As a result, Mr. Quattrone, 50, can now return to Wall Street and to deal making for the first time since he left Credit Suisse First Boston in March 2003. 
 Still, all the publicity surrounding Mr. Quattrone means that he probably will not return to a major Wall Street firm immediately. The son of a Philadelphia garment worker, Mr. Quattrone was a banker at Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston, now Credit Suisse.
 The agreement with prosecutors is not expected to limit whatever business venture he pursues next. 
 Deferred-prosecution agreements are being used in a growing number of white-collar cases, chiefly with the companies themselves in order to avoid an indictment of the company. For many businesses, an indictment is an effective death knell, as it was for the accounting firm Arthur Andersen in 2002. The drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb, the accounting firm KPMG and others have reached such agreements with federal prosecutors. Their use with individuals is more common in drug cases than in white-collar investigations. 
 In throwing out the conviction and ordering a new trial, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, did find that there was enough evidence to retry Mr. Quattrone.
 But after five years, two trials, thousands of hours of work and millions of dollars, the United States attorney's office in Manhattan has apparently decided that a third trial was not in the public's interest. 
 And since it first began investigating whether First Boston was soliciting kickbacks from investors in exchange for access to hot stock offerings, the United States attorney's office has secured a number of prominent white-collar victories: the convictions of Martha Stewart, Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom and John J. Rigas of Adelphia Communications, among others.

HEADLINE: Rents Are Rising Rapidly After Long Lull

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mike Gain, the co-owner of a property management firm in Seattle, took a step this spring that he had avoided for years: he raised rents.
 ''We had been afraid to do that,'' Mr. Gain said. ''Over the years, we were actually reducing rents. But we increased rents by 3 to 5 percent and there were absolutely zero repercussions.''
This kind of shift is under way in many cities across the country, including Atlanta, where rents actually fell from 2003 through the first half of last year, as well as Cincinnati, Dallas and Phoenix. The only region of the country that is resisting the trend is the Midwest, where industrial job losses and other factors continue to hold rents down. 
 According to government data, in both June and July average rents across the country were 3.5 percent higher than a year earlier, the steepest gains in almost four years. And it is feeding into a broader rise in inflation. 
 The rise in apartment rents is in many ways a consequence of what has happened to home prices. As mortgage rates have begun to creep up and as home prices have soared out of reach of many Americans, many renters who a couple of years ago might have bought a home are staying put. This is tightening the rental market to the point where apartment owners now have more leverage to demand higher monthly payments.
 In New York City, where a steady stream of young arrivals, limited space and rent controls limit the supply of available apartments, rents never fell as they did in many other cities. Now they are advancing at a much faster clip. 
 In the metropolitan area covering New York, Long Island and Northern New Jersey, annual increases in rent surpassed 5 percent in the second half of last year for the first time since 1990, according to government statistics. And brokers and landlords in the city speak of even sharper rises lately.
 ''There's been a big change in the last three months,'' said Laurie Zucker, vice chairwoman of Manhattan Skyline Management, which manages about 4,000 apartments up and down Manhattan. ''We can barely keep up with how fast we need to raise rents.''
 For example, a one-bedroom apartment in the Murray Hill area of Manhattan that six months ago went for $2,400 to $2,500 a month can now fetch $3,200 to $3,300, Ms. Zucker said. 
 Rents, which account, directly and indirectly, for almost 30 percent of the overall Consumer Price Index, are one of the main forces pushing prices up at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve is comfortable with. 
 In July, rising rents nationwide accounted for more than half of the 2.7 percent increase from a year earlier in so-called core prices, the Fed's most closely watched gauge of underlying inflation, which excludes food and energy costs. 
 ''The buoyancy of rental rates is a very big force determining the direction of core inflation,'' said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation, a large bank. 
 While most apartment dwellers have less money than the average homeowner, there is an intricate connection between the rental and home-buying markets.
 In the early years of this decade, low interest rates and rising home prices prompted more Americans to buy, both because of the lure of a healthy profit and the fear of being left out of the game. As a consequence, demand for rental properties shrank -- pushing up vacancy rates and pulling down rents. 
 By the fourth quarter of 2004, rental vacancy rates had risen to 10.4 percent, the highest level since the government started tracking them in 1960. Overall rent gains slowed to a modest 2.5 percent through early 2004, their slowest since the mid- 1990's. And in the bigger rental complexes, according to the National Association of Realtors, rents fell nationally in 2002 and 2003 and inched up only marginally in 2004.
 That was an era that landlords remember for the generous sweeteners needed to help attract renters to their properties.
 ''Owners were providing one month free rent, or no security deposit,'' said David Kelley, who owns Apartment Guys of Chicago, a small rental agency serving downtown and the North Side. ''Some were allowing pets. Some even gave a free DVD player.''
 With costs rising and profits sparse, developers poured their money instead into condominiums, shunning investment in rental properties. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of former rental properties were bought and converted into condos for sale.
 The research firm Real Capital Analytics found that 28,000 units were converted in September 2005 alone, compared with 2,600 in the same month two years earlier. 
 But as home prices rose and apartment dwellers found that they could not afford to buy, the demand for rental apartments quickly ran up against diminishing supply. By the second quarter of this year, vacancy rates had declined to 9.6 percent. 
 And the market is much tighter than that in many growing cities. 
 ''Right now, properties are reporting they are 98 percent full; they are turning away renters,'' said Mike Wade, a broker at Atlanta Apartment Connection. ''As apartment locators, we're having to tell people, 'We're going to have a hard time finding you a place to live.' ''
 By this June, with the returns to landlords improving, condo conversions fell to 3,400 units. 
 Prospective tenants are in for a shock. Take Manhattan, arguably the tightest rental market in the country. According to Citi Habitats, a big rental agency in town, the median rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan rose to $3,599 in July from $3,100 in June. 
 Vacancy rates have shrunk to 0.8 percent, it estimated, and as low as 0.5 percent in hot areas like the East Village. And the demand is spilling into adjacent boroughs, like Brooklyn and Queens.
 Jeffrey Vogel, a Citi Habitats agent, said that new renters in New York are suffering a form of culture shock when their expectations meet the reality of the market.
 ''Even return clients who live in the city,'' he said, ''have a shock when they entertain moving to a larger apartment and compare what they would pay if they relocated against what they've been paying for in the past few years.''
 Nicola Sylvester-Evans will not reveal the rent for her two-bedroom apartment in Battery Park in Lower Manhattan. But she admits that her expectations were way out of line when she came from London in April to look at prospective places to live after her husband, James, a trader at an investment bank, was transferred to New York. 
 ''We were moving from a four-bedroom house with a garden in London; I was hoping for a three-bedroom apartment,'' Ms. Sylvester-Evans said. ''There was certainly a readjustment in size and budget.''
 She says they increased their housing budget 40 to 50 percent.
 And when she finally found the right apartment, she had to decide on the spot -- making a firm commitment to take it the day she saw it and providing a signed application first thing the next morning.
 ''New York is so much faster-moving than London,'' she said. ''I never felt the pressure to make my decision by the end of the day.''
 New York stands out, in part because of its rent control laws, which limit increases for hundreds of thousands of apartments across the city. That helps increase rents everywhere else by limiting the supply of market-priced housing. (Controlled units can be decontrolled when the monthly rent exceeds $2,000 and the tenant is either new or earns more than $175,000 a year.) 
 In many other areas of the country, rents have not yet recovered from the last few years. In places like Detroit, where the declining fortunes of the homegrown automobile industry devastated the local economy, rents are still falling as people continue to move out of town. 
 Still, nationally, most analysts expect the rental market to tighten further. 
 Rising home prices have pushed the cost of homeownership above what many Americans can afford. The National Association of Realtors estimates that the typical monthly mortgage payment for a single-family home reached $1,166 in the second quarter, 36 percent more than in the full year of 2003, eating up 23.6 percent of the typical family's income. The numbers are much higher in New York, South Florida and the San Francisco area. 
 If buying a home no longer looks like the killer investment of a few years ago, more renters are likely to stay put until the market readjusts.
 ''Rents are a huge bargain relative to home prices,'' said Chaz Mueller, chief financial officer of Archstone-Smith, a real estate investment trust that invests mainly in rental properties in New York, Southern California and Washington. ''With the condo and single-family market cooling, we think people are deciding to take advantage of that bargain by renting.''
 The upshot is that rents should continue rising. The Realtors' association forecasts rents in the big apartment complexes it tracks will rise 5.1 percent this year. That will force renters to pay more, but it has landlords around the country perking up. 
 ''Everybody in our region,'' Mr. Gain, the Seattle apartment owner, said, ''is feeling we are going to be able to ride an up market for three to five years.''

HEADLINE: Optimism Continues Despite Warning Signs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Investors eked out Wall Street's fifth consecutive day of gains yesterday, bucking concerns about lagging consumer sentiment and disappointing second-quarter results from Dell.
 Trading got off to a shaky start after the University of Michigan released its preliminary consumer sentiment index, which fell to 78.7 in August, down from 84.7 a month earlier. Wall Street had been looking for the index to slide to 83.8, and the greater-than-expected drop was viewed as a signal the economy may weaken too much.
The poor sentiment index threatened to stall the market's rally this week, which came on evidence of lower inflation risk and a gently slowing economy. Yet the market's recovery from its session lows -- aided by an annoucement that Microsoft was raising its stock buyback plan to $36 billion, from $20 billion -- showed that investors remained optimistic that the Federal Reserve would keep the economy strong enough to withstand recession while keeping inflation contained. 
 ''If this rally continues on bad economic news, that's saying that investors have already made a decision we're going to have a soft landing in this economy,'' said Alexander Paris, economist and market analyst at Barrington Research in Chicago.
 Technology stocks nevertheless were under pressure after Dell reported on Thursday that second-quarter profit fell 51 percent, with sales growth slowing to the lowest rate in three years. Dell -- already reeling from a large laptop battery recall earlier in the week -- also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating its accounting for a year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.51 points , or 0.41 percent, to 11,381.47.
 Broader stock indicators also made modest gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 4.82 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,302.30, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 6.34 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,163.95.
 For the week, the Dow jumped 2.65 percent, the S.& P. 500 gained 2.81 percent and the Nasdaq surged 5.16 percent.
 Bonds pushed toward gains for a fourth consecutive session, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.84 percent from 4.86 percent late Thursday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 Oil prices moved higher in trading after tumbling a day earlier on cooling of Middle East tensions; crude oil rose 98 cents, to $71.04. On Thursday, oil fell as low as $69.60 a barrel -- a level not seen since June 21.
 But Dell's results cast a shadow over the Nasdaq, as the company's shares fell 64 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $22.16, while a rival, Hewlett-Packard, which reported strong earnings this week, added 37 cents, to $35.52. Intel fell 16 cents, to $18.40, while its main rival in computer chips, Advanced Micro Devices, fell 27 cents, to $23.93.
 Gap gave up 65 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $16.65, after reporting a 53 percent drop in second-quarter profit as aggressive markdowns put the squeeze on margins.
 And Ford said it would cut fourth-quarter production by 21 percent to accelerate its turnaround plan. Ford fell 17 cents, to $8.
 Shares of the Altria Group and Reynolds American rose after a judge's ruling held that tobacco companies violated federal racketeering laws, though the judge said she was unable to order financial remedies. Altria gained $3.22, or 4 percent, to $83.97, and Reynolds added 91 cents, to $64.98.
 Several economic reports could drive the market next week as earnings reports begin to slow.
 On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors will issue its existing-home sales report for July, which will be closely watched by investors in the housing sector. Existing sales are expected to slip to an annualized rate of 6.58 million, compared with 6.62 million for June.
 And on Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on new-home sales for July, which are expected to decline 1.1 million after a decline of 1.131 million in June. Also on Thursday, the government will release its July report on orders for durable goods, defined as big-ticket items expected to last at least three years. 
 Durable-goods orders are expected to be flat in July, compared with a sharp 2.9 percent jump in June.

HEADLINE: Hold the Champagne

 BODY:
When this week's government reports showed tamer inflation than had been anticipated, investors almost certainly overreacted, pushing up stocks and bonds as if all was right with the economy. A slowdown is certainly preferable to an overheating economy, which raises the likelihood of much higher interest rates and widespread unemployment. But a slowdown is still bound to be painful, especially for the Americans -- and they are the majority -- whose wages have been stagnating through much of the current economic cycle. 
 Investors' jubilation was also likely a reflection of their own relief. This week's evidence of decelerating inflation has vindicated the judgment of Ben Bernanke, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, who decided last week to pause in the two-year-old campaign to raise interest rates. That display of acumen boosted investors' confidence in his ability to correctly call the shots.
What the market doesn't seem to be considering is the possibility of problems for which the Fed has no good answers. The depth and duration of an economic slowdown will depend in large part on the ultimate fate of the housing boom. As the housing sector continues to weaken, employment could take a big hit; the Economic Policy Institute calculates that housing-related jobs accounted for 15 percent of nation's job growth in 2005. Consumer spending could also be affected, via higher unemployment, less home-equity borrowing and a general reversal in the wealth effect -- that free-spending feeling people get when their assets are appreciating. 
 At the same time, the slowdown is likely to weaken the dollar. Theoretically, a weaker dollar should help the economy over time by increasing American exports. But that assumes that the economies of other countries will continue to chug along, even prosper, as the United States endures a slowdown. Moreover, the ill effects of a housing decline could soon be upon us, while the potentially beneficial effects of a weaker dollar would most likely need time to take hold. 
 The result could be a slowdown that is more severe than currently anticipated and that could be impervious to interest rate calibrations.
 Of course, that is a scenario, not a prediction. The important point is that today's economy has problems that go beyond price inflation. The last time the Fed successfully orchestrated a slowdown -- in the mid-1990's -- the economy was not coming off a housing boom. The federal budget was heading toward the black, the trade deficit was a fraction of its current size as a share of the economy, and oil prices, while volatile, were relatively low. 
 Now is a time for watchful waiting, not uncorking the Champagne.

HEADLINE: With 'Minefields' at Home, War Isn't Over for Lebanese

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Robert F. Worth contributed reporting from Beirut for this article.

DATELINE: TYRE, Lebanon, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
Marwa al-Miri, 10, and her 12-year-old cousin Sekneh could not resist the chance of a treasure hunt when they were finally allowed to go out and play on Thursday evening, three days after returning home to Ayt el Shaab. 
 Almost everywhere the girls and their playmates looked in their rubble-strewn town there was a gem -- papers and books covered in dust, dented appliances and, best of all, the occasional toy. Even the metallic gray canister that Marwa held up, the size of a battery with a head that looked like a cigarette lighter, had some allure for the children. 
But when she pitched it to her 10-year-old friend Hassan Tahini, it exploded in a loud bang that brought out all the adults in the area. In a split second, Hassan was on the ground unconscious, his gut split open; Marwa was screaming in pain with shrapnel wounds in her legs; and Sekneh was riddled with shrapnel in her chest and struggling for her life. 
 ''It looked like a little can; it was interesting,'' Marwa recalled Friday, moaning in pain at Jabal Amel Hospital in Tyre, where the three children were being treated. 
 Thousands of so-called bomblets, smaller than a hand grenade but far more deadly, have turned homes, schools and even hospitals in southern Lebanon into virtual minefields, threatening communities for months, possibly even years to come, say human rights campaigners and mine cleanup groups. 
 In towns like Yahmour and Nabatiye along the Litani River Valley, where Israeli troops prepared to face off with Hezbollah fighters in the final days of the conflict, thousands of bomblets released by shells fired into the area litter everything from streets to farmland. 
 In Tibnin, near some of the heaviest fighting along the Israeli border, the little bomblets landed in front of a major hospital, in the middle of the main road through town, in tree branches and even inside cars. 
 Cluster munitions like the ones used by Israel's military are legal weapons under the Geneva Conventions. Israel acknowledges that it dropped cluster bombs during the monthlong war, but says it tried to avoid using them in civilian areas. 
 On a battlefield, the multipurpose cluster bombs like the ones fired on Lebanon, many of them made by American contractors, are designed to penetrate thick armor as well as to kill or maim enemy soldiers within several yards, mine clearance officials said. They release small bomblets in midair, expected to fall to the ground and explode on impact across a wide area. That allows for much greater ''coverage'' than a single artillery shell can provide. 
 But groups like Human Rights Watch, which has led a campaign to ban the weapons, say they are too inaccurate and unreliable, especially when used in civilian areas, where they can pose a danger long after a war is over. 
 The bombs are especially dangerous because of their high failure rates, leaving hundreds of the bomblets unexploded on the ground, said Marc Garlasco, a senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch. The artillery shells used by the Israeli military in Lebanon delivered 88 bomblets per shell and have an official failure rate of up to 14 percent, though mine cleanup groups operating in southern Lebanon say the failure rate can reach 40 percent. 
 ''A cluster bomb cannot differentiate between civilian and military areas,'' Mr. Garlasco said. ''You could say maybe the town was empty of civilians when it was fired, but the people eventually come home and have to face a minefield. It becomes a humanitarian nightmare.''
 In effect, Mr. Garlasco says, when the shells are fired in triplets, as is customary with most artillery, ''you're creating 35 to 50 new landmines every time you use them.''
 By Friday, several cases of deaths and injuries from exploding cluster bombs were reported as residents in southern Lebanon returned to their homes and began the cleanup. Two people were killed in Kafr Rumman and Masaydoun, according to the Mines Advisory Group, a British-based nongovernmental organization. In Yahmour, an elderly woman was seriously wounded when she set off one of the bomblets while sweeping inside her home and was hit by shrapnel in her head, legs and arms. In the town of Haboush, two children were killed when they uncovered a bomblet. 
 In all, at least 16 people have been wounded by unexploded bombs since the cease-fire on Monday, said David Shearer, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in southern Lebanon. The bomblets have also seriously hampered reconstruction efforts.
 ''People can't go into their banana plantations because they are scared of unexploded ordnance,'' Mr. Shearer said. ''It is the biggest obstacle to restarting the economy.'' 
 ''We consider these more dangerous than antipersonnel mines,'' said Frank Masche, a technical field manager with the Mine Advisory Group, who was examining the main highway near the Tibnin hospital on Thursday for unexploded bombs. ''When there's a minefield, people know they can't walk there. Here, people think it is safe to walk around anywhere.''
 The group has been slowly looking over roads and homes in heavily hit areas of southern Lebanon, working in conjunction with the Lebanese Army to detonate the bombs. On Friday, crews inched up the main road in Yahmour, marking the bombs and then exploding them. The process can take 15 to 30 minutes per bomb; crews there estimate there are hundreds in the town alone. 
 ''The war may be over, but we're still living in a war,'' said Suad el-Miri, the aunt of Marwa and Sekneh, as she watched over them in the intensive care ward at Jabal Amel Hospital on Friday. ''People think it's over, but there are still so many bombs around that our lives and our children's lives remain at risk.''

HEADLINE: Where Is Euphrates Etiquette?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
You know W. is burned up at the Iraqis.
 You know Rummy got disgusted with nation-building ages ago. (In Baghdad in April, Rummy doodled at a news conference while Condi went on about her hopes for Iraq's future.)
You can tell that Condi has grown fed up with the intractable mess in Iraq because she's so focused on the intractable mess in Lebanon. 
 And certainly Dick Cheney has given up on those obstreperous Iraqis to move on to the more gratifying task of plotting how to liberate Iran and Syria.
 W., unschooled in Middle East quicksand politics, learned the hard way that too many Iraqis prefer jihad to Jefferson. The Iraqi forces can't stand up so we can scamper out. The Shiites we gave the country to prefer Iran and Hezbollah to the U.S. and Israel. And our rebellious yet incompetent Iraqi puppets have had the temerity to criticize both the U.S. and Israel for brutal behavior in the region.
 How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child, as the Bard said, and the Bush administration has always condescendingly treated Iraq as though it were an ungrateful child. Rummy, Paul Wolfowitz and Republican lawmakers liked to compare the occupied nation to a tyke on a bike. ''If you never take the training wheels off a kid's bicycle,'' Wolfie would say, ''he'll never learn to ride without them.''
 Thom Shanker and Mark Mazzetti of The Times reported that the president seemed dissatisfied this week in a private meeting at the Pentagon with his war cabinet and outside Middle East experts.
 ''I sensed a frustration with the lack of progress on the bigger picture of Iraq generally -- that we continue to lose a lot of lives, it continues to sap our budget,'' one person who attended the meeting told The Times. ''The president wants the people in Iraq to get more on board to bring success.'' Another said that W. was confounded that 10,000 Iraqi Shiites would take to the streets to rally behind Hezbollah.
 W. is sick of holding on to the bike as his legacy crashes. He wants to see some gratitude from his charges -- pronto.
 The Iraqis have no doubt offended W.'s keen sense of loyalty. He went back to sack Saddam to make up for his father's lack of loyalty to the Shiites who were slaughtered after Poppy encouraged them to rise up, and now the Shiites show little loyalty to W.
 Carole O'Leary, an American University professor who is working in Iraq on a State Department grant, told The Times that Mr. Bush offered the view that ''the Shia-led government needs to clearly and publicly express the same appreciation for United States efforts and sacrifices as they do in private.''
 Naturally, Tony Snow denied that President Resolute was frustrated. But if W. can behold how his plans have backfired and not be frustrated, then he's out of touch with reality. And the reason W. is meeting with outside experts is to demonstrate that he is, too, in touch with reality. Even though he doesn't use that expertise to reshape his plan in Iraq, which shows again that he's out of touch with reality. 
 Reviewing Paul Bremer's book in The New York Review of Books, Peter Galbraith wrote: ''In Bremer's account, the president was seriously interested in one issue: whether the leaders of the government that followed the [Coalition Provisional Authority] would publicly thank the United States. Bush had only one demand: 'It's important to have someone who's willing to stand up and thank the American people for their sacrifice in liberating Iraq.' ''
 You can take the boy out of Kennebunkport, but you can't take Kennebunkport out of the boy. The erstwhile black sheep is now as obsessed with manners as his dad. He's furious that he got no thank-you note from the Iraqis for the big present of allowing them the opportunity to be like us. They refused our gift, after everything W. did for them -- invading their country under the false pretense of protecting our country, shattering their shaky infrastructure, and starting a shame spiral that's led to civil war. 
 His foreign policy has been more force majeure than the noblesse oblige of his father and grandfather. But now he has embraced noblesse, and puzzles over why the poor Iraqis do not feel more obliged after being blessed with America's philosophical, economic and political riches. How on earth do these benighted folk not understand the difference between the good guys and the bad guys?

HEADLINE: The Modern Studio Executive Navigates Wall Street and Piracy

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
For many here, Stacey Snider was the Hollywood executive who had it all. As chairwoman of Universal Pictures, she hobnobbed with celebrities at the Academy Awards. She was feted at charity events as well as in the fashion pages of Vogue. But after General Electric acquired Universal Pictures in 2004, the bright lights lost their brilliance.
 Films like the Peter Jackson ''King Kong'' were considered disappointments, despite bringing in $547 million at the worldwide box office. And like many of her industry peers facing similar oversight, she regarded the scrutiny of the studio's quarterly returns as, at times, oppressive. So much so that Ms. Snider quit her job in February to become chief executive of DreamWorks, now a division of Paramount Pictures, to work with the director Steven Spielberg on far fewer projects.
''It's not like I view this as a private, artistic enterprise,'' Ms. Snider, 45, said in a recent telephone interview. Still, she said: ''I certainly felt the pressure. I felt the uncertainty. It galvanized the angst. We went from making movies to making product and content. I didn't want to make franchises. I wanted to make movies.'' 
 Hers is a common refrain in Hollywood these days. Despite a domestic box-office surge after years of declining attendance, 2006 is shaping up to be a time of Hollywood discontent. Studio executives have waged war on actor salaries, as high-profile projects with stars like Jim Carrey have been put off. Movie production deals, like the one Tom Cruise has at Paramount, are being renegotiated. Studios are also making fewer big-budget movies. 
 But while Hollywood has undergone periodic shifts like this before, many people here agree that there is something different this time, a permanence to Hollywood's new austerity plan. Executives are facing too many unknowns, among them, changing moviegoer habits, rising costs and the threat of piracy.
 ''In this Wall Street and corporate world, the discussion has become: What is the proven, unique selling property of this product?'' said Warren Beatty, the actor, who is upbeat about the industry's prospects. 
 But he, too, agreed the industry was in transition. ''The problem is you can't sell entertainment the way you sell cars or air-conditioners,'' he said. ''Entertainment is dependent, to some extent, on surprise.''
 The concern so far seems largely psychological, although many here predict dark days ahead. Movie-making is no longer a growth business, and has lost its luster among investors. Even the most well-run large movie studios often return only 5 percent to 7 percent annually. And other forms of entertainment -- the Internet, sports and video games -- are fiercely competing for consumers' attention.
 ''When you hear what people are afraid of, it's that movies are not special anymore,'' said Terry Press, who runs worldwide marketing at DreamWorks Animation. ''It's the single issue no wants to think about or say out loud.'' 
 The tipping point, many here agree, was Walt Disney's announcement last month that it would eliminate 650 jobs in its movie division, fire its production chief and sharply reduce the number of films it makes to a dozen or so a year from as many as 20. 
 What's more, the company said it would focus mostly on Disney-branded films like the popular ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' franchise, which it can exploit across all divisions. 
 ''Where Disney may have sent ripples, it begged the question, Who knows what others will do?'' said Leonard Goldberg, the movie producer and former business partner of Aaron Spelling who was known for television shows like ''Charlie's Angels'' and ''Fantasy Island.''
 Slow-growing movie studios are wilting under Wall Street's demands to deliver a box-office hit like the ''X-Men'' series or ''Pirates'' every time out. Executives say the decline in DVD sales, which began in early 2005, is taking a toll on budgets. And to complicate matters, studios have not figured out a money-making digital strategy to deflect piracy while, at the same time, appeasing fickle consumers who want movies online.
 ''Stress is a function of fear,'' said Alan F. Horn, who has been in the movie business three decades and is president of Warner Brothers. While he says he is optimistic about the future, he conceded that running a studio ''has never been tougher.''
 Warner has had one of its worst summers in years, with disappointments like ''Lady in the Water'' by M. Night Shyamalan, the big-budget remake of ''The Poseidon Adventure'' and the animated ''Ant Bully.'' But even profitable Warner movies are cause for anxiety because Hollywood is quick to label anything a loser that does not meet prerelease expectations. 
 For example, ''Superman Returns'' by Warner cost $209 million to make and Mr. Horn predicted it would garner $400 million at the worldwide box office (a respectable sum), which he said ensured a profit after DVD and television sales. But many in Hollywood expected it to bring in at least $500 million given Superman's popularity and the publicity around the movie's release. Mr. Horn said, ''People are asking, 'Are you disappointed?' I don't know how to relate to that. I don't know what to say.''
 There are few economic indicators that reflect Hollywood's apparent unease. Art dealers who cater to studio executives, actors and producers said buying had not slowed. Nor have sales of homes that cost $5 million to $10 million, several real estate agents said. And despite layoffs at all the major studios, the number of film and television production jobs has increased.
 In the first six months of 2006, 130,000 people were employed in entertainment in Los Angeles, compared with 127,200 in 2005, according to the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation. That growth is being fueled largely by an explosion in independent film production. Jack Kyser, the group's chief economist, said 23 of the 30 films being made here in mid-August were from independent production companies.
 But those statistics reflect only part of the story. 
 Robert Shaye, the founder of New Line Cinema, a division of Time Warner that will celebrate its 40th anniversary next year, said a fundamental driver of Hollywood's unease was the high cost of making and marketing films. (The average in 2005 was $96 million.) Investment funds have poured money into movies, reducing the sting of studio cost-cutting. But investment funds are not immune to losses, either. A newcomer, Legendary Pictures, invested in ''Lady in The Water'' and ''The Ant Bully,'' Studios are also under attack from digital pirates who distribute illegal copies online. As a result of the piracy, studio executives can no longer depend on waves of re-releases for steady income. ''Once it's out there, it's out there,'' Mr. Shaye said.
 With digital pirates and the pressure from Wall Street to produce predictable profits, the dialogue about what movies are made and marketed was bound to change. 
 If there is fear among some in Hollywood that brand managers are taking over, it is because two studios recently filled top creative jobs with executives whose expertise is movie marketing. At Disney, Nina Jacobson, the well-respected president of production, was fired and succeeded by Oren Aviv, the marketing chief. Ms. Snider, who joined DreamWorks, was succeeded in March by two executives, including Universal's top movie marketer, Marc Shmuger.
 Tom Staggs, Disney's chieffinancial officer, argues that the concerns are unfounded. ''The suits aren't running the studio,'' he said. ''I think Hollywood has to constantly challenge itself to remain relevant.'' Still, he added: ''If we let it become a cookie-cutter, brand-flapping exercise, it is not going to work. We have to focus on the creative side.''
 Some promising young executives are seeking to pursue creativity outside the studio. Last year, Mary Parent, 39, and Scott Stuber, 37, set in motion an option in their contract that allowed them to quit their jobs as presidents of production at Universal Pictures to become producers. Both said they did not leave the studio because they were unhappy; their producing deal is at Universal. Instead, they wanted the opportunity to flex their creative might before they got too old or started families.
 ''It reaches a point where it is hard to enjoy it,'' said Ms. Parent, reflecting on being a studio executive. ''Just the sheer volume of meetings between phone calls. You are trying to cut through the tide. It was grueling. You were at a test screening every night until midnight; you have scripts to read. You don't want to be that person just scratching the surface.''
 Of course, being a producer, particularly a new one, is no less demanding. In the last year, Ms. Parent has made five weeklong trips to New Zealand where she is a producer for the film ''Halo.'' Mr. Stuber has spent much of the summer in Arizona on the set of ''The Kingdom,'' where temperatures have spiked to as much as 110 degrees. ''It's not like it's less busy,'' Mr. Stuber said. ''But you get to spend three hours in an editing room if you want to. You can't lose sight of the fact that the job is to entertain.''
 Whatever the challenges ahead, Mr. Goldberg, the producer, said Hollywood would adapt as it did when silent movies became talkies, and three decades ago, when the VCR was perceived as a threat.
 He had no sympathy for those who do nothing but complain. ''Let them get a real job,'' he said. ''They get paid a lot. They go to great parties. They fly around in jets, not only for business reasons, but for personal things, too. I think there are worse jobs to have.''

HEADLINE: Bush Predicts Appeals Court Will Lift Ban on Wiretaps

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
President Bush predicted Friday that an appeals court would ultimately overturn a decision this week declaring his warrantless wiretapping program illegal, and he said that ''those who herald this decision simply do not understand the nature of the world in which we live.''
 ''I strongly disagree with that decision, strongly disagree,'' Mr. Bush said of a ruling issued Thursday by Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, a Federal District Court judge in Detroit, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. 
The decision quickly became a political firecracker, as the Republican National Committee sought to play off the ruling to rally supporters. 
 In a ''Dear Republican'' letter, the committee pointed out that the decision was issued by a ''Democratic-appointed judge.'' It asked, ''If you are outraged by this latest development, will you sign the petition against this decision weakening the tools we need to fight the war on terror?''
 But Democrats and some legal scholars said they regarded the decision by Judge Taylor, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, as an important affirmation of the separation of powers and limits on presidential authority even in a time of war. 
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the decision affirmed his view that the wiretapping program was illegal. Mr. Leahy described the program as ''another unfortunate example of how White House misdirection, arrogance and mismanagement have needlessly complicated our goal of protecting the American people.''
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, did not comment directly on Judge Taylor's decision but said Republican efforts to ''divert people's attention'' from what he described as the Bush administration's missteps on foreign policy would not work.
 ''The bottom line is that most Americans fundamentally believe that you can give the president all the tools he needs to protect us and at the same time uphold the rule of law,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''There's only a very few in the administration who don't hold that view.''
 In her ruling, Judge Taylor found that the wiretapping program, which allows the National Security Agency to wiretap the international communications of Americans suspected of ties to terrorism without a court warrant, violated both the First and Fourth Amendments, as well as a 1978 law restricting the use of intelligence wiretaps. Nor did a 2001 measure in Congress authorizing the use of military force in Afghanistan give the president power to conduct wiretaps without a warrant, she ruled in ordering a stop to the program.
 ''It was never the intent of the framers to give the president such unfettered control, particularly when his actions blatantly disregard the parameters clearly enumerated in the Bill of Rights,'' she wrote. ''The three separate branches of government were developed as a check and balance for one another.''
 In a view echoed by other legal experts interviewed Friday, Peter M. Shane, a law professor at Ohio State University who specializes in separation of powers issues, said he agreed with Judge Taylor's ultimate determination but took issue with elements of her legal analysis, including her reading of constitutional law.
 ''I agree very strongly that the president's national security powers are not sufficient in this area to defy Congress's express determination,'' Mr. Shane said. ''I just wish she had written it more carefully.''
 Bush administration officials said Friday that they were eager to exploit what they saw as flaws and omissions in Judge Taylor's legal reasoning. 
 ''What was surprising was the weak reasoning of the opinion,'' said a senior Justice Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the department is still preparing its appeal. ''It lacked any meaningful legal analysis of the substantive issues.''
 The Justice Department has already appealed the ruling, and the A.C.L.U. agreed that the judge's order would not be enforced until a hearing is held next month, meaning that the program can continue in the interim. Meanwhile, Justice Department officials continued parsing the ruling Friday to prepare for an appeal that lawyers say could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
 President Bush, speaking with reporters on Friday at Camp David, sounded confident that the administration would prevail in the courts. 
 Administration officials ''strongly believe'' the program is constitutional, Mr. Bush said. Because he disagreed so strongly with the judge's opinion, Mr. Bush said, ''that's why I instructed the Justice Department to appeal immediately. And I believe our appeals will be upheld.''
 He pointed to the plot announced last week in London to bomb planes bound for the United States as further evidence of the need for strong and aggressive counterterrorism measures. 
 ''The American people expect us to protect them, and therefore, I put this program in place,'' Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: What Is K Street's Project?

BYLINE: By THOMAS FRANK. 
Thomas Frank is the author, most recently, of ''What's the Matter with Kansas? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America.'' He is a guest columnist during August.

 BODY:
Representative Bob Ney, the Ohio Republican who did such generous favors for the casino clients of Jack Abramoff, announced his retirement from Congress on Aug. 7; the next morning The Washington Post reported that he had acted under pressure from his fellow Ohioan John Boehner, who is said to have told Ney that, if he stood for re-election and lost, he ''could not expect a lucrative career on K Street.'' 
 This is one of those remarkable moments when the rhetoric falls away and the mysteries of conservative government are briefly revealed: K Street, synonymous with the corporate lobbying industry, will not abide a man whose reputation imperils the Republican majority, even though he has earned that reputation in the service of K Street's leading personality. Irredeemably tainted by his work for K Street (pronounces K Street, via the trusty Boehner), Bob Ney is now ineligible for public office. The corporate lobbying industry demands that the voters of southeastern Ohio submit a different Republican to Washington. 
Besides, there are Ney's children to think of, as Boehner helpfully pointed out. They are of college age now, and college, as we all know, is damnably expensive. If Ney wants his descendants to remain on the right side of the nation's growing class divide, he must have K Street's money. So the word comes down from the industry: The time has passed for ''freedom fries'' and sushi at Jack Abramoff's restaurant. Bob Ney must fall on his sword, doing K Street's bidding in political death as he did in life.
 It has been many years since I was first shocked by a news item about Washington lobbyists, a story about some K Street hit man offing a proposed regulation, or a notice about some corporate grandee contributing to candidates from both parties, thus ensuring his ''access'' regardless of who won. But like many of the degrading things that shocked me once -- bowl games named for corporations, cleavage-themed chain restaurants -- those provocations now seem petty and even innocent. 
 Because with K Street the insults to democracy just keep mounting: the mass exodus to the pharmaceutical lobby of the people who wrote the prescription drug benefit, for example. Or the increasing integration of lobbyists into campaigning and lawmaking, as Thomas Edsall reported last winter. Or the well-known emblems of the rot: Bob Ney's golf weekend in Scotland, Rick Santorum's Tuesday morning lobbyist parleys, the price list that Duke Cunningham drew up for the convenience of his lobbyist friends. 
 Why does this pay-for-policy spectacle not bother us more? Perhaps because it's so easy to tell ourselves, well, both parties do it. Besides, K Street is sprawling and confusing, with squadrons of lawyers representing every industry's diverging interests and demands, many of these innocent and some of them even healthful. 
 But K Street is not neutral. From all its complex machinations emerges a discernible political project best described by Joseph Goulden in ''The Superlawers'' back in 1972, when the lobbying business was so many acorns beside today's forest of towering oaks. The ''Washington lawyers,'' Goulden wrote, had over the years ''directed a counterrevolution unique in world economic history. Their mission was not to destroy the New Deal, and its successor reform acts, but to conquer them, and to leave their structures intact so they could be transformed into instruments for the amassing of monopolistic corporate power.'' (Goulden, by the way, is no radical: he is a former director at the very conservative press watchdog Accuracy in Media.)
 K Street's bright young men fill the top posts at federal agencies; K Street's money keeps wages low and prescription drug costs high; K Street's ''superlawyers'' fight to make our retirement insecure; K Street's deregulation gurus turn our electric utilities into the plaything of Wall Street. What K Street wants from government is often the opposite of what the public wants. And yet what K Street wants, far too frequently it gets -- if not by the good offices of Bob Ney, then by the timely disappearance of the now useless Bob Ney. 
 Whether we are Republicans or Democrats, we are all aware of how much more power corporations hold over everyday life than they used to. ''Those who own the country should govern the country,'' John Jay used to say, and thanks in large part to K Street they do.

HEADLINE: On Making Enrollment In a 401(k) Automatic

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It is human nature to procrastinate. It is also human nature to decide by not deciding. Both behaviors have conspired to leave many Americans with paltry sums in their company retirement accounts. 
 Employers and the financial services industry that manages the 401(k) plans for them have joined in the conspiracy. ''We made it too complicated and paralyzed the participants with too many choices,'' said James D. McCool, executive vice president for corporate and retirement services at Charles Schwab & Company.
The problem starts the moment a new employee is handed a pile of documents on company policies, health insurance options and, oh, yes, the 401(k) plan. (Employees probably won't find anything about a pension. Those are rare these days and if their company does offer one, the workers should not count on it.) The bewildered employee is usually told to decide whether to join the 401(k), and then decide what percentage of each paycheck should be put into the plan and which funds the money should go into and in what percentages. 
 ''What about automatic enrollment?'' a new hire might ask. ''Can you give some advice on the funds?'' The typical response has been no. Corporate lawyers contend giving advice isn't legal. They might as well say: ''You are on your own. Good luck.''
 For many workers, all of it goes into a bottom drawer to be decided later.
 The Pension Protection Act, signed this week by President Bush, gives companies no more room for excuses. They will be allowed to stick their employees into a 401(k) and, in many circumstances, offer them some financial advice. But it isn't clear that the law will set off a wave of more savings unless employees take a bit of initiative. 
 The law allows companies to enroll employees in a 401(k) plan automatically unless they choose to opt out. Auto enrollment uses the human tendency toward procrastination, inertia or avoidance to the employee's advantage. 
 ''They have to make the choice that they don't want to save,'' said Jeffrey R. Carney, president of Fidelity Retirement Services, the nation's largest provider of 401(k) plans. 
 Study after study show auto enrollment leads to higher rates of participation. A 2004 report by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group of companies that manage 401(k) and IRA plans, found the rate jumped to 92 percent from 66 percent.
 It would seem to be a rather obvious conclusion, but one that was nevertheless resisted for the last 20 years. Fidelity, which manages about a quarter of all corporate retirement programs, estimates that of its 12,000 plans, only 195, about 1.6 percent, offer automatic enrollment.
 Some companies feared that state laws guarding the garnishment of wages would prevent them from putting employees into a plan automatically. Common sense would suggest that employees who felt that their wages were being garnished could always opt out of the plan, but when lawyers give advice, sometimes common sense is forgotten. 
 So it should come as little surprise that 1 in 5 Americans nearing retirement don't have a retirement fund. Those who do, do not have much. Fidelity recommends that a person have enough savings to draw an annual stream of income equal to 85 percent of the salary they made while working. (If your house will be paid off and you are living rent- and mortgage-free in retirement, you may be able to get by on less -- unless you get very sick, which happens when you are old.) That means that for someone making $50,000, which is near the median wage in the United States, savings of at least $600,000 would be needed if that person thinks he will live to 90.
 Another way to think about it, said specialists at Schwab, is that you'll need a portfolio approximately 25 times as large as your first-year withdrawal, which is twice as scary.
 But the average account balance for people in their 50's, those people with less than 15 years to plan for retirement, is a mere $129,000. That's enough to get them comfortably to age 77 if they count on Social Security. Were they able to contribute the maximum amount of $15,000 to their 401(k) from age 50 to age 65, they should make it through retirement just fine. But that is not going to happen. A person over 50 can contribute more to catch up for not contributing when they were young -- when the power of tax-free compounding gives contributions a bigger boost -- but the money still has to come from somewhere. 
 ''No company would let you procrastinate on health insurance,'' said David Laibson, a Harvard University economics professor. A student of behavioral economics, he has found companies could get higher 401(k) enrollments by applying a simple approach to retirement. He suggests that new employees be given a sheet of paper with the question: ''Do you want to enroll in the plan? Yes or no. You have 30 days to decide.''
 He calls this an ''active decision'' that leads to smarter choices of higher-yielding plans. 
 In some plans sold by the Principal Financial Group, employees get an ''Easy Enrollment'' card that offers a stark choice of three boxes: one for a 6 percent deduction, one for 3 percent to 5 percent and one for declining, said Monica Kirgan, vice president for retirement and investor services. 
 Automatic enrollment has other benefits as well. People tend to stay in the plan and they defer a larger percentage of their income into it. 
 Here is the worrisome part. The Pension Protection Act, all 900 pages of it, is supposed to encourage companies to adopt these plans, but the companies selling the plans don't expect a surge of businesses requesting them. ''A dramatic change? No,'' Mr. Carney said. But he expects that companies will gradually adopt the plans. All the while, the clock is ticking.
 What is beginning to change, Mr. McCool said, is that companies are now asking, ''What are the things we can do to help our employees get to where they need to be for retirement?'' They are beginning to see that they have a responsibility that employees do not end up destitute at age 70. 
 Clearly companies need encouragement. ''They should ask, Why are we not doing this?'' Mr. McCool said. Indeed, companies need not wait until 2008 to institute auto enrollment, automatic savings increases and defaulting a new participant into a fund other than a low-yield money market fund. Companies can do it right now. ''The government is green-lighting this,'' Mr. McCool said. 
 Companies have to do more than just enroll employees automatically. The second step is setting up plans so that the employee who is confused makes the right choice on where to put the 401(k) savings. The default plan on many plans is a money market fund, which has such low rates of return that an employee will never accumulate enough for retirement if the money remains there.
 The trend is to make the default one of the so-called life-cycle or target funds. Based on how much time you have left to retirement, these funds adjust the basket of investments, as well as the risk and return. A young person can afford higher risk and an older person would want to preserve capital. About 40 percent of plans offer such funds already, though few offer them as the default.
 Meanwhile, employees should sign up for a 401(k) plan if they haven't already done so. They should contribute as much as they can, but at least as much to snatch the matching contributions that an employer may offer. Anything less and they are leaving their money in their employer's pocket. 
 In most cases, put the money in a stock fund, not a money market fund. Stocks will rise and fall, but overthe long run, which is the time horizon of a retirement fund, stocks return much more than money left moldering in a money market fund that barely keeps up with inflation.
 Finally, employees can agitate. For once, they have two allies against the corporate lawyers who caution for moderation that could leave most people impoverished: the new law and a bunch of hungry financial services companies that want to offer them their services.
 Mr. McCool said the motto of the financial services industry ought to be one that encourages the automatic enrollment: ''Just Don't Say No.''

 BODY:
WHEN the curtain of the Auditorium Theater in Rochester rose on ''Hairspray'' one November night almost three years ago, expectations were understandably high. It was the fifth stop on the musical's national tour, which had begun just a couple of months after the show won eight Tony Awards. Variety had predicted that the tour would ''undoubtedly march from sellout to sellout this season.'' 
 Anyone present for the first performances, however, would have seen some reason for doubt. There were empty seats that first week, and the second week was even more disappointing. Only $520,000 worth of tickets were sold, out of a possible gross of more than $1 million. ''I should have done just one week,'' said Albert Nocciolino, the president of NAC Entertainment, which books shows for the Auditorium.
 From Rochester, ''Hairspray'' moved west, through Cincinnati, St. Louis and on to California, and it certainly had its share of sellouts. Over the next three years, before its final performance this summer in Portland, Ore., it proved a moderately successful road show. But it never lived up to expectations. 
 Perhaps because it has a diffuse narrative or perhaps because it isn't such a spectacle, the show could not find much of an audience beyond serious theatergoers, as it very much had been able to do on Broadway. Rather than turning into another ''Cats,'' ''Les Miserables'' or ''Lion King,'' ''Hairspray'' instead became the prime exhibit in the theater business's recent struggles to find hits for the heartland. 
 ''The road, in my view,'' said Thomas Viertel, one of ''Hairspray's'' producers, ''is intrinsically broken at this point.''
 By almost any definition, Broadway has been enjoying a very good run for the last few years, if not for the last couple of decades. Attendance has been rising despite ever increasing prices, so that overall ticket revenue -- even after being adjusted for inflation -- has more than doubled in the last 15 years. But the road, which by some measures brings in as much revenue as Broadway, is far more of a boom-and-bust business. It booms when Broadway feeds it appealing, palatable shows like ''The Lion King'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and suffers when Broadway's musicals are edgier or simply weaker. So while New York delivers reliable audiences, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Denver and the dozens of other stops on the road go a long way toward determining the health, or lack thereof, of the nation's theater business. 
 According to Variety, national tours of the bigger shows -- typically those that can afford performers who belong to Actors' Equity -- sold $532 million worth of tickets in the 2005-6 season. That was down by nearly a third from $790 million only two seasons earlier, after adjusting for inflation. A decade ago, when the British mega-musicals from the 1980's were still on tour, the road brought in the equivalent of almost $1 billion. 
 Variety's numbers exaggerate the problem because they exclude many of the less expensive shows that have become more common in recent years. Still, theater executives acknowledge that the road isn't what it was once. 
 ''It's a big decline,'' said John Breglio, a prominent theater lawyer and one of the producers of the revival of ''A Chorus Line,'' which recently opened in San Francisco. ''And unfortunately it builds on itself.'' 
 Less popular shows leave fewer people inspired to buy annual subscriptions. Fewer subscriptions, in turn, mean less of a built-in audience for future shows, which makes it harder for them to succeed. ''It's a vicious cycle,'' Mr. Breglio said.
 In others ways, though, the struggles of the road stem directly from its past successes. The 1980's mega-musicals -- ''Cats,'' followed by ''Les Miserables'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera'' -- proved that a touring show could achieve the scale and style of Broadway. On the strength of the enormous audiences they attracted, some cities, like Tampa, Fla., built new theaters, and others, like Providence, R.I., refurbished grand old houses to support spectacles like ''Phantom.''
 By lifting the quality of its road shows, Broadway also raised their cost and the audiences' expectations. And when the show coming through town is ''Little Shop of Horrors'' rather than an internationally acclaimed hit, fewer people are willing to pay $150 for a pair of tickets, especially when they can instead watch a rented movie on their flat-screen television. 
 ''There are no inexpensive shows anymore,'' said Scott Zeiger, a producer who previously ran the division of Clear Channel Communications that promoted touring shows. ''Ticket buyers are now forced to make choices. They can't necessarily afford to see every single show in a year.''
 Nobody is suggesting that the road will cease to be a crucial part of the theater business. It has long given producers a way to recoup some of their Broadway losses, and if anything, its importance is probably underappreciated. Many of today's biggest producers -- David Stone of ''Wicked,'' Fran and Barry Weissler of ''Chicago,'' Kevin McCollum and Jeffrey Seller of ''Avenue Q'' and ''Rent'' -- got their starts working on traveling shows. The League of American Theaters and Producers, a trade group that has made a push in recent years to compile more comprehensive estimates of the road business than it once did, says that total ticket sales exceeded $900 million last season, or $50 million more than on Broadway. 
 The hope in theater is that the road is merely at the end of a down cycle caused by shows that were not ideally suited to national audiences. ''The last two years have been rough because we just didn't have very strong titles coming out of New York,'' said Mike Isaacson, vice president of the Fox Theater in St. Louis, the largest in the country after Radio City Music Hall. 
 The next few years look brighter. ''Wicked,'' which in addition to its New York production has a standing show in Chicago and a touring show that brings in more than $1 million every week, will soon add a fourth. Two other seemingly road-friendly shows, ''Jersey Boys'' and ''The Color Purple,'' will begin touring this season as well.
 The other possibility is less comforting. Mr. Viertel, the ''Hairspray'' producer, who has also worked on ''The Producers,'' ''Smokey Joe's Cafe'' and ''Little Shop of Horrors'' during his 20 years in theater, argues that the economics of the road no longer support the business in its current form. That is why he uses the word ''broken'' to describe the model. ''But it's been broken in the past,'' he said, ''so I don't think death knells are in order.''
 THE middle decades of the 20th century are rightly considered a golden age of American theater, when ''Oklahoma!,'' ''My Fair Lady'' and ''Hello, Dolly!'' were major hits, both on Broadway and in theaters across the country. In his office Mr. McCollum keeps a program from a 1944 production of ''Othello'' at the Hanna Theater in Cleveland starring Paul Robeson, an actor of a caliber not usually found on the road today.
 But in the late 1960's and into the 70's, as the downtown neighborhoods home to many theaters struggled, the road business crashed. ''In the 1970's,the road was dead, and I mean dead,'' Mr. Breglio said. The show that started the comeback was ''A Chorus Line.'' 
 With a tremendous demand for tickets, it sent out two companies simultaneously, and they stayed in large markets for weeks at a time. ''And then 'Annie' came along,'' he added. ''And as we got into the 80's, we got into the mega British musicals -- 'Cats,' 'Phantom,' 'Les Miz.' All of these were shows that didn't require stars. The road just exploded.''
 The first ''Les Miserables'' touring company began in Boston in late 1987 and later moved to Chicago, said Alan Wasser, the general manager who ran the tour. A second spent 15 months in Los Angeles and then 13 months in San Francisco. A third spent at least a week in smaller markets -- El Paso; Eugene, Ore; Waterbury, Conn; and, appropriately, Peoria, Ill. -- that had previously supported only a few nights of performances.
 That third tour lasted 16 years, playing its final show less than a month ago in St. Louis. 
 Even in places where the show would spend only a week, Cameron Mackintosh, the producer, demanded a production that met Broadway's standards. To satisfy him, the touring company re-engineered the set so it could be taken apart and reassembled much more quickly. A stage deck that came in pieces on Broadway was instead built to snap together like a set of Legos. Lighting instruments arrived prefocused. 
 Still, ''Les Miserables'' ended up looking like community theater compared with Mr. Mackintosh's next hit, ''The Phantom of the Opera.'' ''Les Miserables'' needed eight trucks on the road. ''Phantom'' traveled with more than 20, in addition to 10 others that began setting up before the cast arrived to minimize the amount of time that the road show was dark. 
 By all accounts it remains the most successful road show of all. ''Nothing has ever been like 'Phantom,' '' Mr. Stone, the ''Wicked'' producer, said. ''Not 'Lion King,' not 'Wicked,' not anything. 'Phantom' was truly an anomaly.''
 In addition to all the tickets they sold for their own performances, the hits of that era had large enough coattails to make successes of other shows playing at the same theaters. Mr. Isaacson of the Fox Theater in St. Louis calls it ''the Cameron effect,'' after Mr. Mackintosh. In the 1993-94 season the road sold $940 million worth of tickets in today's dollars, up from $394 million just a decade earlier, according to Variety's estimates.
 The business model changed too. Presenters wanted to make sure they had a full roster of shows, since they had sold many of the tickets in advance. So they began guaranteeing a weekly profit to producers, covering costs and then some, lest any show fold after a couple of bad months and leave subscribers further down the itinerary with tickets to a quiet theater. But the local presenters did just fine regardless.
 And then the run of hits ended. Subscriptions began to decline, forcing theaters to rely more on single-show buyers. Tired revivals and even some Broadway hits like ''Hairspray'' no longer played to full houses. 
 ''Going into a season knowing you are essentially covered is a thing of the past,'' Mr. Isaacson said. ''The risk factor is very real.'' 
 Mr. Viertel said that producers faced a similar plight because higher costs for everything from gasoline to health insurance could eliminate the profit supposedly built into weekly guarantees. Stagehands and actors, particularly those in Actors' Equity, now find themselves in a leaner job market. 
 This new reality has made it more important for producers to understand the differences between playing New York and playing anywhere else. The biggest may simply be that road shows usually are not in town long enough to build word of mouth. So marketing and name recognition, like the kind that comes with a classic musical or well-known songs, matter more. 
 But there is also a difference between the audiences, even if the efforts to describe it have a whiff of cliche. In New York, theatergoers -- including some who are just visiting for a weekend from Rochester -- are often excited to see something new and willing to be shocked just a little, producers and presenters say. A show of conceptual daring can succeed absent a compelling plot. 
 On the road the story matters more, spectacles play better, and the cultural boundaries are stricter. What might pass for normal on a movie screen can feel different when it is happening live. ''The Full Monty'' may have struggled because people assumed, incorrectly, that the show had full-frontal nudity. ''Hairspray'' revolves around a man playing a woman, while ''The Producers'' is heavy on jokes about Jews, Nazis and homosexuality. 
 ''When you have a 'Producers' or a 'Hairspray,' even though it's a very successful show, it's not a family show,'' said Mr. Nocciolino, the Rochester presenter, who also books theaters in Buffalo, Syracuse and a few other Northeastern cities. ''It has appeal to the traditional theatergoer, but it doesn't have as broad an appeal'' as the 1980's hits did.
 ''It's not complicated,'' he added. ''Family shows play very well on the road.''
 Mr. McCollum, one of ''Avenue Q's'' producers, noted that some local presenters who had seen the show in New York wanted it toned down for the road. This skittishness, he said, was one reason ''Avenue Q'' eschewed a national tour and instead put up a production at the Wynn Las Vegas, where Steve Wynn, the casino's owner, wanted the Broadway version, complete with copulating puppets. (Mr. Wynn's theater had just 1,200 seats, closer in size to ''Avenue Q's'' Broadway home than to many of the mammoth theaters of the road, which was a factor too.) 
 The show wasn't a hit in Las Vegas, however, and will start a national tour next year, with somewhat lower expectations than those for ''Jersey Boys,'' the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. 
 If the optimists are right, the new crop of road shows, led by ''Wicked,'' will start a comeback. 
 ''I think people are overreacting,'' Mr. Nocciolino said. ''The road is in great shape.''
 The other possibility is that the business will fragment, as so many other entertainment industries have. Blockbusters will get the ''Phantom'' treatment, with producers spending the money on a decent imitation of a Broadway show and big audiences turning out for it. Moderate hits will have smaller tours that pay unionized actors less than their usual rates, a system created by a labor contract signed in 2004. Productions with inherently lower costs, like ''Stomp,'' may also become more common on the road. So could plays: next month, ''Doubt'' will become one of the rare nonmusical productions to tour, and the cast will include its Broadway star, Cherry Jones.
 For people who work in theater, there are abundant downsides to a scaled-down road business. But for theater lovers the alternative might be worse. If Broadway made recreating the 1980's its top priority, it would produce an even narrower slice of theater than it already does, safe shows designed to appeal to the widest possible audience. And the movie and television industries are already doing a fine job producing that kind of entertainment.

HEADLINE: Terror-Proof, Except for All the Vulnerabilities

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
FIVE years after 9/11, how terror-proof is the economy? The discovery this month of a plot to blow up American airplanes has sent airlines scrambling, but the rest of the economy has appeared to take it in stride. Some of the vulnerabilities exposed by the 9/11 attacks still exist, however.
 Those blows had two major effects on the economy. First, they took a temporary chunk out of spending by consumers and businesses, though this was later offset, at least in part, by a surge of patriotic buying. Next, the geopolitical repercussions, like the uncertainty leading up to the war in Iraq, kept the economy on tenterhooks for many months. Is the economy better protected, or at least more resilient, now? It's hard to measure this empirically, largely because the possibilities for an attack are so varied. Even the size of the American security industry is tough to estimate, though it has probably grown to about $70 billion now from less than $50 billion in 2001, according to Brian W. Ruttenbur, a senior research analyst at Morgan Keegan. 
Of course, much of that security has nothing to do with protecting the economy's wheelhouse -- its big industries, its infrastructure and its financial system -- and experts say the nation still lacks a clear, well-publicized policy to guide the private sector's priorities for protection against terror. So, what works, and what needs improvement?
 Infrastructure is a natural place to start, since it's the framework upon which the entire economy rests: the transportation network, energy producers, the electricity grid and other utilities like the water supply. And in some ways, the infrastructure was well prepared to deal with short-term problems in 2001.
 ''After Sept. 11, in New York City, infrastructure throughout the affected area demonstrated a sort of flexibility,'' said Rae Zimmerman, a professor of planning and public administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. ''There was a tremendous ability, for example, to tap a national network of cell towers for communications and generators to tap electrical power. Also, they were able to run distribution lines to connect electricity transformers outside of the affected area, by running over 30 miles of cabling.''
 But this flexibility doesn't extend to the national level, which could be a problem in the event of coordinated attacks or wide-ranging sabotage. Professor Zimmerman, who also directs the university's Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems, said that some parts of the infrastructure were highly interdependent. For example, in research she conducted on the August 2003 blackout with Carlos E. Restrepo, a colleague at N.Y.U., she found that water systems in Cleveland and Detroit took at least twice as long to recover as the power grid itself.
 The geographical concentration of infrastructure may also increase the risk of an attack with far-reaching implications. ''Over half of the petroleum refineries are located in just four states,'' Professor Zimmerman said. ''About half of the electric power plants are only in 11 states.''
 Despite the importance and apparent vulnerability of the infrastructure, a clear policy for managing its security has not yet emerged. ''The government really needs to step up to the plate and provide guidance on what minimum preparedness standards are, and they really haven't done that,'' said David Heyman, director of the homeland security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a research group in Washington.
 He noted that 80 percent of infrastructural installations like power plants, switching stations and dams were privately owned, and suggested that market forces might not be enough to compel their owners to choose the right level of protection -- even if, for example, public companies had to report their efforts to improve security to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Even with a national plan in place that prioritizes and mandates security improvements, other questions remain. ''If the goal is to harden the infrastructure by putting in more guns, guards and gates, who pays the dime for that?'' Mr. Heyman asked. ''Does the private sector just incur the cost and pass it on to consumers, or does the public sector provide some support?''
 He also criticized what he described as limited communication between the federal government and the private sector. ''If you talk to local governments, they'll tell you that the information-sharing mechanism is not working,'' he said. ''It's even more so with the private sector, as the private sector requires some clearances -- there's a question about classified information.''
 Outside the infrastructure providers, different industries are reacting at different speeds. Jeremy M. Kroll, managing director in the New York office of Kroll Inc., a risk consulting firm, says the chemicals industry is one that, in his view, has been lagging.
 ''They realize their products can be used in evil ways, either to create weapons of mass destruction or to bring down the functionality of a city,'' Mr. Kroll said. ''They understand the implications, but we haven't seen major improvements vis-a-vis manufacturing chemicals as relates to security. Universities are doing a better job of hardening their laboratories, for example.'' The chemical industry, however, has spent $3 billion enhancing the security of its facilities and distribution since 9/11, according to Jack N. Gerard, president and chief executive of the American Chemistry Council, which represents about 85 percent of domestic chemical production. 
 ''We require our members to assess their risks and responsibilities, develop and implement security plans, and verify those plans through independent auditors,'' Mr. Gerard said. ''These requirements go well beyond the requirements in the law.''
 Among companies that are doing the most, Mr. Kroll said, are the financial giants, which combine investment and commercial banking services. ''The major financial institutions have really led the way in terms of true measures being taken to protect themselves,'' he said. ''They have the largest amount of cooperation from different parts of the government to do so. These folks are the most aware of global exposure and risk.''
 The financial industry, he added, has achieved the highest level of cooperation between businesses, sharing information and best practices. ''We've helped them, but we've also seen them help themselves the most,'' he said. ''It's elevated beyond just director of security. It has truly elevated into the boardroom.''
 On-site security at major sites, including infrastructure installations, is also changing. ''There is a tremendous rise in the use of sensor systems,'' Professor Zimmerman said, but she warned that those systems, which may monitor anything from radioactivity to computer hacking, require ''an awful lot of vigilance.'' Vigilance also extends to employees, Mr. Kroll said, citing a ''very big increase in background checking.'' Businesses have also become more open to people working from home or in remote locations, he said.
 There is plenty of room for improvement, of course. Professor Zimmerman said she hoped that infrastructure companies would reduce their geographical concentration and decentralize the generation of electric power. Mr. Heyman said partnerships between industry and the federal government had to improve, and that the Bush administration needed to re-emphasize security of computer networks.
 Yet prevention, especially among for-profit companies, can be a hard sell. ''There will always be the human tendency to go to the doctor when you get sick,'' Mr. Kroll said. ''You don't seek preventive medicine.''

HEADLINE: The School- Lunch Test

BYLINE: By Lisa Belkin. 
Lisa Belkin, a contributing writer for the magazine, wrote about Meredith Vieira in last week's issue.

 BODY:
It was not yet 11 a.m. at the Partin Settlement Elementary School in Kissimmee, Fla., on a sunny day last October. But lunch service necessarily begins early when there are 838 children to feed, and the meal was already well under way. Danielle Hollar walked calmly amid the lunchroom chaos, holding a large, raw, uncut sweet potato in one hand and a tray filled with tiny cups of pureed sweet potatoes in the other. That Hollar does not get frazzled even among hundreds of jabbering children is one of the talents she brings to her job. That she is tall and blond and slim, and many of the students seem to have school-kid crushes on her, is another.
''This is a sweet potato,'' she said, as she stopped at each table and gave each child a puree sample. ''It has a lot of vitamin A and C and B6. Have you ever seen one of these?'' Most of the children had not. ''It's like a regular potato, but it's orange inside,'' she said, which got their attention. ''It has a lot more vitamins than a white potato.'' 
 Angelina wanted to know why there were no marshmallows on top. Angel put down his lemon pie, tried the sweet potatoes and announced he preferred the pie. Mateo, however, was making a meal of what his classmates eyed so suspiciously. Collecting the cups of everyone around him, he ate a dozen of the tablespoon-size portions before a teacher cut him off.
 ''It's sweet, which is why it's called a sweet potato, but it's also good for you,'' Hollar said, as she moved from table to table, sounding one exclamation point short of a sales pitch. Eager as she was to get the children to taste what she offered, though, she pointedly refused to compare this vegetable to candy.
 ''I don't like sweet potatoes,'' said Jessica, who is in the second grade.
 ''Have you ever tried one?'' Hollar asked.
 ''No,'' Jessica said, making it clear she would stick with her Lunchables nachos and her Capri Sun drink, which she took out of her Mickey Mouse lunchbox.
 Hollar and her sweet potatoes were wandering the lunchroom courtesy of the Agatston Research Foundation, founded in 2004 by Dr. Arthur Agatston, creator of the South Beach Diet. Having tackled the eating habits of obese adults, Agatston has turned his attention to children. A cardiologist who considers himself a scientist and who just happened to become a wealthy minicelebrity, Agatston is using the cafeterias of the Osceola County School District as a clinical laboratory. There are 19 elementary schools in the district, and the Agatston Foundation started by taking control of the menus at 4 of them, all within Kissimmee. They are testing whether a plan he calls HOPS -- Healthier Options for Public Schoolchildren -- can measurably affect children's health.
 ''The success of the book gave me a bully pulpit and an opportunity to change the way Americans eat,'' Agatston told me not long ago. ''One of the obvious places to start is with children. And that means schools.''
 By any health measure, today's children are in crisis. Seventeen percent of American children are overweight, and increasing numbers of children are developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes, which, until a few years ago, was a condition seen almost only in adults. The obesity rate of adolescents has tripled since 1980 and shows no sign of slowing down. Today's children have the dubious honor of belonging to the first cohort in history that may have a lower life expectancy than their parents. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has predicted that 30 to 40 percent of today's children will have diabetes in their lifetimes if current trends continue.
 The only good news is that as these stark statistics have piled up, so have the resources being spent to improve school food. Throw a dart at a map and you will find a school district scrambling to fill its students with things that are low fat and high fiber.
 In rural Arkansas, a program known as HOPE (Healthy Options for People through Extension) seeks to make nutrition a part of the math, science and reading curriculums. At the Promise Academy in Harlem, all meals served in the cafeteria are cooked from scratch, and the menu (heavily subsidized by private donations) now includes dishes like turkey lasagna with a side of fresh zucchini. In Santa Monica, Calif., there is a salad bar at every school in the district, with produce brought in from the local farmer's market. At Grady High School, outside Atlanta, the student body president, a vegetarian, persuaded the company that runs the cafeteria to provide tofu stir fry, veggie burgers and hummus. In Irvington, N.Y., a group of committed parents established No Junk Food Week last March, where all unhealthy food was removed from the cafeteria and replaced with offerings from a local chef called Sushi Mike and donations from a nearby Trader Joe's. At the Hatch Elementary School in Half Moon Bay, Calif., children learn songs like ''Dirt Made My Lunch'' and then taste fruits and vegetables they have grown in their own garden.
 School lunch (and actually, breakfast, because schools that provide free and reduced-cost lunches must also provide breakfast) is now a most popular cause. Any number of groups, from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Kaiser Permanente (they both underwrite many of the above programs) to the William J. Clinton Foundation (it brokered an agreement among soft-drink manufacturers to stop selling soda in elementary and middle schools) have gotten in on the act.
 But there is one big shadow over all this healthy enthusiasm: no one can prove that it works. For all the menus being defatted, salad bars made organic and vending machines being banned, no one can prove that changes in school lunches will make our children lose weight. True, studies show that students who exercise more and have healthier diets learn better and fidget less, and that alone would be a worthwhile goal. But if the main reason for overhauling the cafeteria is to reverse the epidemic of obesity and the lifelong health problems that result, then shouldn't we be able to prove we are doing what we set out to do?
 The smattering of controlled prevention studies in the scientific literature have decidedly mixed findings. ''There just isn't definitive proof,'' says Benjamin Caballero, the principal investigator on the largest study, of 1,704 students over three years in the 1990's, which showed no change in the body-mass index of those whose schools had spent $20 million changing their menus, exercise programs and nutritional education. A second study, of more than 5,000 students undertaken at about the same time, came to similar conclusions. ''There are a few smaller studies with more promising results,'' Caballero went on to say, ''but right now we can't scientifically say that all the things that should work -- by that I mean improving diet, classroom nutrition education, physical activity, parental involvement -- actually do work.'' 
 And yet districts keep trying. Until recently, most were spurred by determined parents or energetic administrators, but now they have a Congressional incentive, too. This coming school year is the first when schools receiving federal lunch subsidies will have to create a wellness plan -- a detailed strategy for how nutrition will be provided and taught. In addition, the actual nutrition requirements set by the government for school meals are expected to become more rigorous this coming spring, on the heels of the revised ''food pyramid.''
 Agatston's HOPS program is but one example of the scramble to create systems that are replicable and economical enough to meet these demands and to prove, while doing so, that they have a measurable effect on children's health. As such, the year I spent observing the successes and the setbacks of this particular experiment is a window into why it is so hard to do something that seems so straightforward and simple -- feed school children better food.
 In taking on this challenge, the Agatston team weighed and measured thousands of children at the start of the last school year, then weighed and measured them again in June. In the months in between, they wrestled with finicky eaters, reluctant administrators, hostile parents and uncooperative suppliers. So there was a lot riding on Hollar every time she presented a tray of sweet potatoes, or broccoli served with dabs of reduced-fat ranch dressing, or tiny cups of salsa. Would this bring schools closer to a solution? Or was it just another false start?
 The reason that children are currently too fat is, in part, because they used to be too thin. During World War II, potential enlistees were regularly turned away because they were undernourished, and after the war the director of the Selective Service System declared malnutrition to be a national emergency. One result was the National School Lunch Act, signed by President Harry S. Truman in 1946, guaranteeing a hot lunch for every schoolchild who could not afford one.
 Another result was also a complex web of regulations and restrictions, overseen by the United States Department of Agriculture. These rules have morphed and grown over the decades, adding free and reduced-cost breakfast during the Lyndon Johnson years; being pared back during the Reagan Administration, which, memorably, was lampooned for proposing that ketchup be declared a vegetable; and stressing nutrition under the Clinton Administration, which set a limit on fat at 30 percent of calories in a weekly menu (though, rules or no, the national average has never fallen below 34 percent for lunches).
 Tweaks aside, the twofold effects of the School Lunch Act are much the same now as 60 years ago. First, the act put the government in the school-food-supply business, buying surplus product from farmers and sending it along to the schools. Twenty percent of the foods served in school cafeterias today are Agriculture Department commodities, which include everything the federal government buys a lot of and needs to pass along, from flour and sugar to fruits and vegetables. While the quality has improved somewhat in recent years, terms like farm-fresh and organic rarely apply. At the same time, the act put schools in the restaurant business, requiring that their lunchrooms manage to at least break even, reimbursing them between 23 cents and $2.40 a meal. It is a system in which pennies are necessarily looked at as closely as sodium content, perhaps even more.
 Agatston knew next to nothing about the arcane intricacies of the system two years ago, other than that he wanted to do something about school lunch. As it happened, a lot of his cardiac patients worked as teachers, and for years he had heard about classroomwide sugar highs after lunch and children who seem to expand from year to year. He hired Hollar, whose background was not in nutrition or school food systems -- she has a Ph.D. in public administration and policy -- and teamed her with Marie Almon, a registered dietician who had worked with him for 20 years and created nearly all of the recipes for the original South Beach Diet book. She also had no experience in schools.
 ''Looking back, we were unprepared for the complexities,'' Almon said this summer, reflecting on the prior two years. ''But maybe that turned out to be best, because I might have been overwhelmed if I had known.''
 In the spring of 2004, Almon, Hollar and Agatston set out to find a school district that would welcome their experiment. They wanted one with a relatively poor population, where a good portion of the children receive free or reduced-cost lunches (and breakfasts), where the food provided at school served the purpose originally intended under the law -- to be the most nutritious meals a child had all day. And they wanted a place where the parents were less likely to have the economic or organizational clout to make change happen on their own.
 The Osceola County School District met many of these requirements. The school-age population in the four chosen elementary schools -- the first stage of the program would include only kindergarten through sixth grade on the theory that like language, teaching nutrition to younger children would have a higher ''stick'' rate -- is 42.6 percent Hispanic, 41.3 percent white but not Hispanic and the rest divided among other ethnic groups. At these four schools -- Partin Settlement Elementary, Mill Creek Elementary, Kissimmee Charter Academy and P.M. Wells Charter Academy -- many students are from homeless families. Fifty-five percent qualify for free or reduced-cost meals. ''We have kids who go shopping in the gas station across from the homeless shelter or who live in the Howard Johnson's,'' says Eileen Smith, Partin Settlement's principal. ''They are not going to get anything fresh.''
 The Agatston group presented its proposal to the leadership of the Osceola district during the summer of 2004. The plan included changing the food served in the cafeteria; creating small gardens at each school to allow children to get their hands dirty; providing teachers with guides for incorporating nutrition lessons into Florida's existing curriculum -- inserting them into math class or social studies, for instance -- so that the schools would stay on track in terms of their teaching schedule; and providing special programs, whether food tastings or creative assemblies, to reinforce the message.
 Jean Palmore, the director of food services in Osceola, was at that meeting and was impressed by what she heard. ''It sounded like it was workable; it sounded simple,'' Palmore says. She liked the fact that two other Kissimmee elementary schools would be set aside as control schools, so that there would be a way to compare her standard menu, the one that would remain in effect at all the other schools in the district, with the HOPS revisions. She was particularly pleased that the foundation would reimburse the district for any costs over what was already budgeted for food. And she added a requirement -- that HOPS also reimburse Osceola if the ''participation rate'' of students decreased to the point that the cafeterias could not break even. In other words, if the students refused the healthier food, Palmore would still meet her $19.5 million budget.
 A contract was signed in July 2004. School opened in August. Instead of spending the first year learning and planning -- which, in retrospect, might have been a good idea -- the team jumped in and ran right into the realities of school nutrition.
 For instance, nearly all the food for the coming school year had been ordered months earlier. Commodities, which can be had free from the government, must be requested as early as March, and those orders, once approved, cannot be changed. (Which does not mean, however, that the government cannot change its mind about what it sends, just that schools cannot change their requests. The summer before Hollar and Almon arrived, for example, a year's supply of pureed prunes simply showed up at the Osceola warehouse. Federal law says that commodities must be used -- they cannot be sold or thrown out or even given away -- and Palmore's staff spent a few months experimenting with baking recipes that used prunes in place of butter or oil.)
 In turn, all noncommodity orders, both to huge companies like U.S. Foodservice and Sysco and to smaller regional producers, had been finalized the previous May. A year of menus based on those orders had already been set by Palmore. And because Osceola is part of a 24-county consortium of school districts, which join together to negotiate better prices, there was even less flexibility than there might otherwise have been.
 All this would have to be undone, worked around or tweaked by the Agatston team. It declared that the first year -- August 2004 through June 2005 -- would be a trial year to see whether healthier food could actually be identified and served. The first step was to ban white bread and Tater Tots, replacing them with whole-wheat bread and sweet-potato fries. Other favorites, like turkey with gravy or pork with gravy, went too. There was ''almost a mutiny,'' Almon says, when she took away Lucky Charms and Fruit Loops at breakfast, replacing them with Total and Raisin Bran.
 At first the children responded as Palmore predicted they would -- they threw out their school-supplied food and started to bring lunch from home. For a brief time, the participation rate went down by 50 percent, but it did not stay there long enough to activate the reimbursement clause Palmore put in the contract.
 Over the course of the rest of the trial year, Almon and Hollar kept replacing and limiting things. No more ketchup. Lower-fat hot dogs. Unbreaded chicken patties. Some of these changes were made possible through shuffling -- changing those orders that could be changed at the last minute and moving cans and boxes of nonreturnable food around. ''Since the HOPS schools weren't allowed the Tater Tots, we sent them to the other schools, who were more than happy to trade them for their commodity cans of sweet potatoes,'' says Palmore, who admits to a personal dislike of sweet potatoes.
 Some changes were made by spending Agatston foundation money. During the first year, the supplemental costs paid by Agatston were about $2,500 a month, and they reflected facts like these: a white hamburger bun costs 7 cents, while a whole-wheat hamburger bun costs 11 cents; pizza with a white refined-flour crust costs 31 cents a serving, while pizza with a whole-wheat crust costs 35 cents; a white sandwich wrap costs 23 cents, while a whole-wheat sandwich wrap costs 26 cents; breaded chicken strips are a mere 18 cents a serving, while grilled chicken strips are a whopping 65 cents.
 In addition to shuffling and spending, there was compromising. Those sweet-potato fries that replaced the Tater Tots? They were commercially cut and frozen, then baked in school ovens, rather than cut fresh from actual potatoes, a step the kitchen staff was simply not set up to do. And the sweet-potato puree that Hollar handed out in the lunchroom? The vanilla was artificial, because ''that's what was stocked on the shelves,'' Almon says. And liquid margarine -- made with soybean oil -- and some sugar were used, because, Almon says, ''if they don't eat it, what have we accomplished?'' 
 In the end, there were also changes that simply weren't made, particularly during that first year. ''We started out not adhering to the dictate of the HOPS programs to the letter,'' Palmore says. The most striking (and contentious) example of this compromise was cheese.
 Almon modified existing recipes with low-fat cheese. Palmore and her school kitchen managers were adamant that they could not get a low-fat version from any of their usual suppliers. Almon kept insisting and eventually was told that in fact a low-fat product had been found and was being used, though at added cost -- the lower-fat version costs 5.6 cents a slice while the higher-fat one is 1.6 cents. But Hollar paid an unannounced visit to the kitchens one day in spring 2005 and found that at least on that occasion the old cheese product -- something Almon calls ''full fat'' and Palmore calls ''whole milk'' -- was being used instead.
 An assumption is something you don't realize you've made until someone else states a conflicting one. The HOPS vision of a healthy school lunch is based on an assumption that became clearer as the trial year gave way to the full program. Specifically, it is a vision based on the system as it exists, with large vendors supplying packaged items that are essentially assembled and reheated (rather than created or cooked).
 Listening to Almon talk about evolving food products at the yearly School Nutrition Association meeting in Los Angeles this year makes that clear: ''The difference between what was available two years ago and what is available this year is a world of difference,'' she says. ''Everybody is making cookies with whole grains. Pretzels with whole grains. The breakfast burritos, the tortillas, everything is whole grain. Even the French toast.'' She and Hollar were particularly pleased that Smuckers, which has long made something called Uncrustables -- premade peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches with the crust already removed -- now markets a version with transfat-free peanut butter (though Almon wishes it came on whole-wheat bread).
 This comfort with premade food products is a legacy of the South Beach Diet, which, though full of recipes that start from scratch, is also not shy about steering dieters to Paul Newman's Own Lighten Up Italian salad dressing or Kraft's entire line of South Beach branded snacks. ''Things can be nutritious and come from a package,'' Almon says. ''It depends what's in the package, not the fact that there is a package.''
 Part of the decision to rely on such foods is simply logistical. School lunchrooms are no longer set up to actually cook but rather to reheat -- hence the Kissimmee staff's inability to slice sweet potatoes by hand.
 Just as big a reason for this reliance on packaged foods, however, is what Palmore calls ''the acceptance question.'' In other words, what are children willing to eat? It is no coincidence that school cafeteria menus (and the children's menus at restaurants, for that matter) are virtually identical. Pasta. Chicken nuggets. Pizza. Hamburger. French fries. The task of tackling those expectations can feel overwhelming at best.
 ''Children are so conditioned to these items -- the hamburgers, the cheeseburgers, the pizza,'' Almon says. ''To make a healthier version of familiar things makes sense.''
 It does not make sense to everyone, however. Across the country, in Berkeley, the chef Ann Cooper questions the idea of making healthier versions of flawed foods. In her book ''Lunch Lessons: Changing the Way We Feed Our Children,'' she asks whether healthy food should simply mirror existing unhealthy patterns and concludes: ''We just don't need an organic Twinkie. We don't!''
 Cooper, who spent years impressively overhauling the menu at the select Ross School in East Hampton, N.Y., began trying to do the same thing at the 16 schools in the Berkeley public school district starting last October. Her six-figure salary is being paid by the Chez Panisse Foundation, which also finances, in Berkeley, Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School's Edible Schoolyard kitchen garden, a creation of Alice Waters, who all but started the organic food movement in the United States 30 years ago.
 It is a common assumption that the existence of programs like the Edible Schoolyard means that Berkeley students already eat well, but when Cooper arrived last fall, the district's menu looked like menus everywhere with their fried and fatty foods. One item that Cooper makes particularly merciless fun of is the Uncrustables sandwich -- the same one that caught Almon's eye. She thawed one and kept it on display on a desk where, because of its preservatives, ''it looked exactly the same months later,'' she said while giving a tour of a high-school lunchroom.
 In the time since she came aboard, a salad bar has been added to every school, with ingredients that include strawberries, organic chicken or turkey, sunflower seeds, fresh avocado and other eclectic in-season items in addition to the usual lettuce, tomato and cucumber. Ninety-five percent of the food was processed when she arrived, she says, and now 90 percent is fresh and cooked from scratch. And those foods are not what one would expect on a school menu, including choices like chicken cacciatore, organic sushi and organic chicken raised on a nearby farm. The foods she does not make on the premises, foods like fresh tamales and muffins and vegetable calzones, are brought in from small local businesses.
 Even here, however, the ''acceptance question'' arises. When Cooper first removed nachos from the middle-school menu, the percentage of students buying lunch in the cafeteria dropped significantly. Cooper quickly restored the nachos, using transfat-free chips and Cheddar cheese -- from an area cheesemaker, not an industrial processor -- the equivalent, she concedes, of an organic Twinkie. And she did not even try to change the pizza her first year. ''I just can't take everything away,'' she says. ''Or they will walk out.
 ''Change is never easy. And if it's hard for us, imagine how hard it would be in Oklahoma or Omaha.''
 Or Osceola. The Agatston team is fully aware that its goals are less ambitious than those in Berkeley, but that is an inevitable difference between the two districts, Hollar says. Whereas 55 percent of Osceola's students receive free or reduced-cost lunches, only 41 percent of Berkeley students do. And while Osceola charges $1.50 to those who pay full price at the elementary school, Berkeley charges $2.50. And then there is another, immeasurable but distinct difference -- the parents. Children are not the only ones who bring expectations to food, and Almon says, ''I just think there is a different culture around eating healthy in California than there is here, and we have to account for that.''
 In fact, she and Hollar have come to believe that the greatest resistance to nutritional change comes not from the children but from the grown-ups, starting with the very administrators who invited HOPS in. Palmore, for instance, was ambivalent from the start about much of the suggested change. She told a CBS News reporter, on the air, that she would prefer the whole-wheat rolls if they had gravy. She made a notable ''yuck'' face in one conversation she and I had about sweet potatoes, and she expected rebellion or worse if they were served to the students. ''I was surprised that they were eating the sweet-potato fries,'' she said a few months after they appeared in place of Tater Tots on the menu. ''That is not a child-friendly food. I was surprised they ate the brown bread.'' And she made that same face again.
 Many among the rest of the staff (and among the general population, one might add) also seem to have complex relationships with food. To walk through any of the HOPS schools is to be struck by the fact that there are few adult role models when it comes to good nutrition and exercise. Several teachers approached Almon during the year and asked her if she would lead a group that wanted to start on the South Beach Diet. But while many attended the first meeting, far fewer made it to the second or any of the monthly meetings after that.
 Nor are staff members the only ones with food issues. Some parents wondered why their children were being put on the South Beach Diet. (''It's not a diet,'' Agatston says of HOPS. ''It's just healthy food.'') Others expressed concern that the new way of eating would be liked too much by their children. After the schoolwide assembly to introduce the full program last September, one frantic parent called to report that her child was refusing to eat anything in the house that was not healthy. ''I can't afford to throw everything away,'' the mother said. ''Please tell her to eat.''
 And even parents who say they enthusiastically endorse better food in schools often play the role of saboteurs. One January afternoon, two girls, both in the fourth grade, sat outside at Kissimmee Charter, each having a McDonald's hamburger, French fries and a shake. Inside, the rest of the students were eating turkey burgers on whole-wheat buns. The girls had to dine in the garden because junk food is banned from the school. Sitting with them while they ate was the person who supplied the lunch -- the mother of one of the girls.
 ''This is a treat,'' she said. Her daughter had made honor roll, and this was the reward. ''I don't see why they should have to be out here away from everyone,'' she continued. ''What's the harm in a treat now and then?''
 Schools have internal cultures, and the ratio of enthusiasm to resistance varied from one to another. In some, the teachers used the materials and nutrition books Hollar sent; in others, they remained in boxes. In some, children actually stood up to move and stretch in the middle of a lesson; in others, the punishment for being noisy during gym class was sitting absolutely still on the floor. At Partin Settlement, there was usually a dish of candy for sale for some fund-raiser or another on the counter in the school office. At Kissimmee Charter, parents still sold Chick-fil-A biscuits (with gravy) in the parking lot every Wednesday to raise money for the Parent Teacher Organization. And once each marking period, honor-roll students are still given a coupon for a free hamburger, soda and small fries at McDonald's -- which is where the fourth grader's mother got the idea of bringing in that lunch in the first place.
 JoAnn Kandrac, who was the Kissimmee Charter principal during the last school year, is conflicted about the mixed messages. After all, she was the one who exiled fast food to the garden where the two girls were eating. But she has found tidy ways of rationalizing both. ''You have to pick your battles,'' she told me last winter. The biscuits ''make quite a bit of money for the P.T.O., and they aren't selling them to the children as much as to other parents who don't have time for breakfast.''
 As for the coupons, she says, sounding a lot like Chef Cooper defending pizza's place on the menu: ''I can't pull everything away from the children. McDonald's treats have been a tradition here forever. It's naive to think children don't know about treats at a fast-food restaurant. Modern times call for modern methods. This is educating our children that they can make smart choices at places like McDonald's.''
 On a balmy day in January, the cafeteria was filled at 8:45 a.m. On the stage in front of the room, Michelle Lombardo, as energetic as any of the kindergartners in the front rows, was telling a story about characters known as the Organwise Guys, with names like Sir Rebrum and Hardy Heart. Lombardo, an independent consultant whose appearances are frequently financed by a grant from the Kellogg foundation, takes this act on the road throughout the country and was spending two days in Kissimmee. Soon she had the children chanting, ''Low fat, high fiber, lots of water, exercise,'' accompanied by moves that looked a lot like the Macarena. The floor was shaking so much that the LCD projector wobbled.
 ''This is a free radical,'' she continued, clicking a drawing of an obvious bad guy onto the screen. ''When you put a lot of fruits and vegetables in your body, they gang up on the bad guy and kick him out.'' Then she introduced Peri Stolic, a smiling, animated bit of intestine. ''She likes to be big and fluffy and filled with fruits and vegetables,'' she said, ''because she's like a tube of toothpaste, and when she's fluffy, it's easier to squeeze the garbage out.''
 During the trial year, it became clear that new food cannot simply appear on the lunch tray. Children must be taught about nutrition outside the lunchroom if they are to eat what is offered inside. That is why Lombardo and her Organwise characters began making regular visits to the HOPS schools and why Hollar circulated among tables introducing the Food of the Month.
 In September it was broccoli. In October, sweet potatoes and apples. November, corn and cranberries. December meant tomatoes, and Almon asked the kitchen managers to order salsa, not realizing it was already part of the commodities stockpile. The managers, in turn, thought Almon's request meant she did not approve of the fructose in the salsa that was already on hand and scrambled to purchase a different salsa. Almon, when she finally realized the confusion and read the labels, felt the commodity salsa would do, because fructose was the fifth ingredient, not one of the first four. But then she tasted the stuff, decided the commodity salsa was far too spicy for children and asked that it be cut with commodity canned tomatoes. 
 Small glitches and refinements continued into spring. The team and the district were still squabbling, for instance over the price of cheese, and Agatston was still paying the difference between the higher-fat version that the school would have purchased and the lower-fat version that the HOPS menu required. They were paying for other items, too (whole-wheat versions of standard refined-wheat products, for instance), but the cheese was particularly expensive and one of the primary reasons the HOPS reimbursement had jumped to $3,700 a month (from $2,500 during the trial year). Hollar had researched a method, known as ''processing,'' that she felt could reduce the costs of cheese. The term is somewhat misleading, because it is not the cheese that is being processed. It is the bookkeeping. The school gives its credit for its allotted amount of whole-milk cheese to a producer, in this case Land O'Lakes, which in turn ships the low-fat kind to Osceola. But a change of this magnitude requires approval, which by March Hollar had still not been able to get.
 Also in the spring, Hollar decided not to send new materials to many of the teachers who had received the original educational packets -- things like curriculum suggestions, posters for the students to color. Too many were never used, she learned, and when she sent a questionnaire to the staff asking why, she was told that ''they did not have time, did not want to take on additional teaching requirements, needed to focus on insuring that their kids passed the mandated state tests,'' she says.
 There was also the complication that state regulators at the Florida Education Department had questions about the program. A parent complained to that department that a child was being put on the South Beach Diet at school, leading to an audit of the school menus. The breakfast being served at the HOPS-intervention schools (and interestingly, at the control schools) was found to be under the state's requirement of 554 calories. ''It is almost impossible to get that many calories into a meal without too much fat and sugar,'' Almon says. ''The regs need to change, not the food.'' The issue is still under discussion.
 Despite the mixed results, the HOPS team is hopeful that real progress has been made and that the biggest fight -- to make it a given that school lunch should be healthy -- has been won. This is an increasingly common theme in conversations with healthy-lunch advocates throughout the country, who compare changing views of school lunch to public opinion on smoking. The same act has taken on different social meanings over the past few decades as the context around the act changes.
 Cooper, too, is cautiously optimistic. ''I think we are starting to see a movement,'' she says. ''We're on the cusp of something.'' The spate of obesity studies plus the diabetes data plus the new Congressional wellness plan requirements just might mean that a healthy school lunch will finally become the norm.
 Lombardo ended her January program by asking the children to recite a pledge. ''I do solemnly swear,'' they repeated, ''to be healthier, to eat low fat, to eat high fiber, to drink lots of water and get lots of exercise.''
 Hollar added, under her breath, ''And to stop bringing Lunchables to school.''
 For a solid week last May, children lined up in the lobby of the Partin Settlement Elementary School, as they did at all the HOPS schools, waiting their turn to be weighed and measured. The youngest children stepped onto the scale happily and shared the number they saw with their classmates. The older children already knew that the number was loaded. They took off their shoes and their jewelry and excess clothing. They told their friends to stand away.
 As they went from station to station, a tape measure was wrapped around their waists, they had their blood pressures taken, they were asked whether they played outside the day before or played video games after school, whether they brought their lunches or bought them.
 Despite years of lunchroom changes at schools throughout the country, only now have advocates realized that they need to buckle down and get the facts. It just may not be enough to say, as Alice Waters does: ''This is something right as rain. These kids like this; they are engaged in this. Why can't every child have this? Anybody who sees it, gets it.''
 It is not even enough to prove, as at the Ross School, that changing the menus means children eat better lunches. (Cooper's menu doubled the consumption of fruits and vegetables compared with both the national average and control groups. And 80 percent of the parents changed the way they shopped, cooked or ate, thanks to the input from their children.)
 What is needed -- to persuade donors and school boards and government entities that better food is worth the cost -- is hard proof that improving the lunchroom actually improves children's health. ''We have to measure, to document what we're doing and evaluate its results,'' says Carina Wong, executive director of the Chez Panisse Foundation, which, with financing from the Rodale Institute, is embarking on a three-year study of the health of children in the Berkeley programs. The Center for Ecoliteracy, together with the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, is studying them too, pricking their fingers and measuring their blood-sugar levels.
 Agatston understands both the need for and the risk of measurement. There is always the chance that the results will not confirm what practitioners are certain is true. After all, studies have so far failed to make a definitive link. ''We don't have these children 24 hours a day,'' says Caballero, who did some of the studies. ''They go home, they go out with friends, they are off all summer and everything about the world -- fast food, video games, television ads, everything -- conspires to undo even the best things that happen in schools.''
 Similarly, the data from the first year of HOPS was inconclusive. The program did reduce the fat served in the intervention schools by 20 percent, reduced saturated fat by 26 percent and increased fiber twofold. But after that first year, there was no sign that the ''overweight'' rate among the children had fallen.
 Those results did not keep the Agatston team from proceeding with a second year of HOPS or from expanding the program at the start of the school year that began in Florida last week. HOPS is still in place in Kissimmee -- but this year it is being run and paid for by the school district directly. Almon and Hollar are merely advisers. The cheese will be ''processed'' through the commodities program and Land O'Lakes. Two more schools will adopt the HOPS menu. Palmore has increased the price of lunch -- to $1.75 from $1.50 in the elementary schools -- and expects to cut some corners. Last year's whole-wheat chicken nuggets, she says, were, at 41 cents a serving, simply too expensive, so the schools will instead serve a compromise like grilled chicken patties (about 34 cents). The Agatston team is also bringing HOPS to 9,000 more students in the Miami-Dade County School District and intends to expand beyond Florida next year.
 Just this month, Hollar received an analysis of the data from the past school year that hints that HOPS is really working. The overweight rate in the HOPS schools in fact declined during the 2005-6 school year: specifically, 23 of the 486 children who had been characterized as overweight when school began were characterized as merely ''at risk'' or ''normal'' when school ended. In the control schools, by contrast, there was no decline and three children actually gained enough weight that they were added to the overweight category.
 Hollar describes these results as ''cautiously exciting'' and warns that the sample size is small and that a true trend cannot be determined for at least five years. Agatston, in turn, says that even if the results had been otherwise, that would not have been a reason to abandon the program.
 ''If the data don't show what we want to see,'' he says, ''we aren't going to throw up our hands and say, 'Let them eat what they want.' All that will mean is that we aren't doing this as well as we can, so we will have to find a way to do it better.''

HEADLINE: Beyond the Buzz, Red Hook Remembers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
AT midday on the Thursday before last, 57-year-old Richard Edward Hill put on his Panama hat, picked up his hand-carved walking stick, left his trailer home in the southwest Florida town of Punta Gorda and began the journey back to his roots. Climbing gingerly aboard a Cubana bus, he settled down for the 22-hour ride to Manhattan, a trip that would be sweetened by the little Spanish cookies that are served to passengers, and the movies played throughout the night. 
 That same Thursday, 3,000 miles away in Sacramento, Danny Williams reminded his boss at Verizon that he had to take the next day off; at 11:30 that night, he boarded JetBlue's red-eye to Kennedy International Airport.
And at 5 a.m. the next day, Al Barnard and his 20-year-old daughter, Courtney, packed pillows, blankets and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies in his silver Saturn sedan and headed north from Virginia Beach, Va., for the 360-mile trip to New York. 
 Like homing pigeons, they and about 2,000 other current and former residents of Red Hook Houses gathered in Brooklyn last weekend for Old Timers Day, a beloved and sometimes bittersweet rite of summer for people who grew up in the project, the largest in the borough. 
 No one knows exactly how many of the city's 344 public housing projects hold Old Timers Days. They are seldom listed on events calendars, are rarely announced by anything more formal than phone calls and word of mouth, and are neither subsidized nor endorsed by the New York City Housing Authority. Still, in the world of the projects, Old Timers Days are bona fide holidays, and dozens take place around the city. 
 Gowanus Houses in Brooklyn holds its Old Timers Day on the second Saturday in August. Harlem River Houses in Manhattan holds Old Timers Days whenever enough money can be scraped together for food and permits. 
 An Old Timers Day that was started in 1963 by residents of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and draws heavily from local housing projects has mushroomed into Old Timers Week, held at the end of July and attended by thousands. Pelham Parkway Houses in the Bronx held its first Old Timers Day last month. 
 In Red Hook, where Old Timers Day has been held for two decades, the event, on the second Sunday in August, is a moment for warmth and nostalgia. But it is also a reminder of a grim past and a complicated future.
 Red Hook has been celebrated as one of the city's newest hip neighborhoods, increasingly attractive to both artists and luxury developers. A bakery on Van Brunt Street sells three kinds of homemade granola, a specialty liquor store offers green-tea vodka and $425 magnums of vintage Champagne, and Fairway supermarket established a 52,000-square-foot beachhead in the neighborhood in May. 
 Yet for all the breathless anointing of Red Hook as the next big thing, it is still, largely, the province of the projects. According to the 2000 census, they are home to 70 percent of the neighborhood's approximately 10,000 people, and despite the arrival of more affluent residents, local real estate agents say those numbers have not changed significantly in recent years. The median annual income in the Red Hook Houses is among the lowest in the city. Only within the past decade have the using and selling of drugs abated somewhat.
 For both those who have stayed and those long gone, Old Timers Day represents a moment to savor. ''I don't care what happens all year long, I'm going to be there,'' said Mr. Barnard, who has attended nearly every Old Timers Day for 15 years. ''Red Hook is home.''

'Versailles for the Millions'
 Red Hook Houses was built in 1938, just a year after the passage of the United States Housing Act of 1937, legislation designed not only to provide housing for the poor, but also to spur the economy as the country began to recover from the Depression. The site, a congested but bustling maritime community cradled by the Erie Basin, Buttermilk Channel and Gowanus Bay, was one of the country's busiest shipping centers.
 A total of 161 houses, which were home to more than 300 families, were demolished, to be replaced by 27 six-story brown brick buildings containing 2,545 apartments. In 1955, three more residential buildings, with 346 apartments, were added. 
 On Feb. 27, 1939, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia laid the cornerstone for the new development; inside were copies of the United States Housing Act, contracts for the project, half a dozen photographs showing how the site originally looked, a copy of The New York Times of that day, and a brand-new penny, presumably for luck. 
 One of the few moments to mar the ceremonial pomp occurred when Delancey Smith, a 71-year-old bricklayer whose home had been razed to make room for the project, approached the mayor and announced: ''The hell I wanted to move. This house was handed down to me by my mother. They clubbed me into selling it.'' 
 The elderly bricklayer was not alone in objecting to aspects of the new development. In a 1940 article in The New Yorker titled ''Versailles for the Millions,'' Lewis Mumford criticized what he regarded as the ''Leningrad formalism'' of Red Hook Houses and dismissed the buildings as ''barracklike'' and ''hygienically undesirable.'' 
 ''What is wrong with this design,'' Mumford wrote, ''is its unnecessary monotony.'' 
 Still, the mostly three- and four-room apartments were praised for possessing modern conveniences like electric refrigerators, central heating and gas ranges. And at perhaps $5 or $6 per room per month, the rent was lower than the rent in private housing in the city. Making the development even more attractive was Red Hook Pool, a giant project of Robert Moses that sat just across the street. 
 Not surprisingly, applications for the new apartments poured in, at a rate of 1,200 a week. 

'Crazy Corner,' 'Junkie Paradise'
 No one is sure when Red Hook's first Old Timers Day took place, but most residents say it was around 1984, when a group of young men -- the original tenants' children who used to hang out together at a local community center -- wanted to do something nice for the neighborhood. 
 So they decided to have a party. They raised money by holding a dance at a nearby tennis club. They bought huge quantities of hot dogs, hamburgers and soda, and sawed a metal trash can in half to make a grill. The event was held in a small park on Lorraine Street, in the project's southeast corner. A neighborhood guy named Humza played music out of his van and sold mix tapes he had made. Everyone danced and played basketball. About 100 people came. 
 Today, Old Timers Day, which is held in Coffey Park, a leafy, eight-acre site with winding paths and weathered benches just west of Red Hook Houses, is not much different from the way it was 20 years ago, just bigger. This year, people came not only from the projects but from as far away as Georgia, Kansas and California. The first of them trickled into the park shortly before noon to set up folding tables spread with roast pork, collard greens, and macaroni and cheese topped with breadcrumbs. 
 People pored over yellowing photographs, referring to sections of the projects with old nicknames that still stick today: Peyton Place, Poor Block, Junkie Paradise, Crazy Corner, Flagpole, Slide Time. Despite the rough sound of some of those names, the old-timers recalled the Red Hook Houses of their youth as an idyllic small town, where doors were left unlocked and neighbors looked out for one another. 
 Cheerful clans paraded about by the dozen, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren were proudly introduced. The smell of hot dogs and grilled chicken hovered around smoky barbecues. The basketball courts and playground on the park's south side were packed.
 Leslie Gibbs, a sturdy 50-year-old with a neatly clipped mustache who was memorable to old-timers as D. J. Leslie G. of a local group called the Disco Enforcers, played soul and disco classics over a booming sound system. A dozen couples danced in a hustle contest on a roped-off circle of asphalt. 
 Perched on a bench was Rachel McNair, a silver-haired 85-year-old who had taught Sunday school at nearby Red Hook Gospel Tabernacle for nearly half a century. Like many of the party's older guests, she was something of a celebrity; three generations of project residents approached her with pecks on the cheek and greetings of ''Hello, Sister McNair.''
 Kenneth Berry, 57, strutted through the park like a football star striding down the corridors of high school, slapping hands and smiling at the girls. Mr. Berry, who moved to Red Hook Houses with his family when he was an infant, has a shiny bald head, wire-rim glasses and a little of the pudginess that earned him his childhood nickname, Porky. This particular Old Timers Day was especially poignant for him; it was only the second one he had attended in 20 years. 
 As a boy, Mr. Berry and his friends got into considerable mischief, raiding a local lumberyard for wood to build tree houses and proving their manhood by diving off the docks. As teenagers, they smoked marijuana and drank Wild Irish Rose. When he was 17, the mischief turned into something much more; Mr. Berry tried heroin, and the next 38 years of his life were swept away by the drug. 
 During those years, Mr. Berry often ran into old friends from the projects, and they tried to coax him into making an appearance at Old Timers Day. ''Everybody saw me and said, 'You got to be there,' '' he recalled. ''But it's kind of a shame to see everybody else doing all right, and they see you're not doing all right.''
 Two years ago Mr. Berry entered a residential rehabilitation program. He now lives in a group home in East New York, Brooklyn, and attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings several times a week. ''I crept back into Old Timers Day last year for the first time,'' he said. 
 He chuckled over some of the reactions he heard at the event this year. ''They say, 'You still alive?' One girl told me, 'Damn, I thought you were doing 25 to life.' I say: 'No, it ain't like that, honey. I'm still hanging around.' ''
 Taking a sip of brandy and orange soda from a Styrofoam cup, he gazed affectionately over the crowd in Coffey Park. ''I've never felt this sense of community anywhere else,'' he said. ''I come here and friends say: 'Listen, man, we don't care what you're doing. We still love you.' Out here, it's genuine.''

Moochie's Tale
 There is a sense at Old Timers Day that the happiest are those who made it out -- those who show up for an afternoon to reminisce about the good old days, then head back to stable jobs, healthy families and pretty homes elsewhere. 
 Then there are those like Moochie, who declined to give his last name. Along with his mother, he moved to the projects in 1983, when he was 8, and ever since, he has lived there off and on. 
 In his eyes, the projects are not so much a well of nostalgia but a rough and sometimes scary terrain. ''See those knuckleheads?'' he said during a lull in the festivities, eyeing two teenage boys wearing black baseball caps atop shoulder-length dreadlocks. ''They're Bloods.''
 Moochie, 30, who is shaped like a small boulder, got involved in the drug trade when he was 9. His father, a heroin addict, died of AIDS in jail; a drug dealer on his block became something of a surrogate father.
 In the late 1980's and early 90's, when Moochie was in his teens, Red Hook Houses was a notorious hub of the crack trade. Almost nightly, shootouts forced people in apartments to jump to the floor to dodge stray gunfire. A 1988 article about the projects in Life magazine noted that vials of crack were sold out of an ice cream truck and neighborhood candy stores peddled drug paraphernalia. Red Hook's reputation for drug-fueled violence was solidified in 1992 by the killing Patrick Daly, the revered principal of a local elementary school, who was caught in a crossfire between rival drug gangs. 
 Moochie worked as part of a team of six who earned $2,500 a day selling crack on their block. But his hustling days came to a messy end, and between 1994 and 2003, he served six years in prison for drug-related offenses.
 He last left prison three years ago, and he insists that his drug-dealing days are behind him. But the marks on his body -- a stabbing scar on his right thigh, scars from a pitchfork stuck in his right forearm, a bullet scar on his left ankle, and a faint white line where a knife went through his cheek and tore out a tooth -- paint a grim map of his involvement in crack's heyday. 
 Lumbering through the crowd at Old Timers Day, he seems to see few people he knows. ''A lot of my generation, they're in prison or they died,'' he said ruefully. ''Hassan. Curt. Bo. Buff. Devon. Monique. Chickenface. I lost a good 12 or 13 people.''
 In that, he is hardly alone. In front of the D. J.'s table were propped up three collages of programs from memorial services for project residents who died in recent years. Some succumbed to old age or accidents, but many to drugs and violence. 

A 'Vibrant Neighborhood'
 By some barometers, life in Red Hook Houses is better than it was 10 or 15 years ago. From 1995 to 2005, the number of murders fell 75 percent, robberies were down 62 percent and reported assaults dropped 45 percent. In May, a major police sweep led to the indictment of 143 people in a $250 million drug conspiracy, culminating an 18-month investigation into a highly organized operation that the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, said pervaded the projects and netted $50 million annually.
 At the same time, most people living in the projects still struggle mightily. According to the latest census figures, the median annual income is just over $10,000 a year, and one in three adults is unemployed. And although project residents survived decades of drugs and violence, they are not sure they will survive the arrival of chic. 
 ''The city kicked us to the curb,'' said Mr. Berry, the 57-year-old. ''Now they say we got a 'vibrant neighborhood.' I mean, it's a good thing that the neighborhood is coming up, but you got people here who've been through it all. What are you going to do, just shuttle them to the Bronx?''
 By then it was late, and even those who crowded the park as midnight approached, silhouettes in the dark, laughing and dancing, were ready to call it a day. Near the D. J., a circle of middle-aged men passed around a hand-held microphone and rapped in the clever, goofy style of early hip-hop. ''Where my Red Hook crew at?'' one man shouted out to the crowd. A forest of arms waved in the air.

HEADLINE: Disputed Plan In Brooklyn

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Atlantic Yards Project'' (editorial, Aug. 6):
 I live in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, an area that stands to be greatly affected by Forest City Ratner's development plans. I am surrounded by past Ratner projects: the soulless MetroTech, a business district held afloat by renting to many of the city's municipalities, and the Atlantic Mall, which was apparently designed in such a way as to prevent people from congregating.
My neighborhood, and those surrounding it, is filled with unique stores, restaurants and interesting and diverse people. I love the opportunity to see the sky above the rooftops and to walk down streets that are not crowded with people. 
 From what I can see, this area has been developing beautifully on its own. To turn such a massive development project over to the hands of one organization, especially one with the track record of Forest City Ratner, would most surely be a mistake.

Peter LaBrusciano

To the Editor:
 Your editorial ''The Atlantic Yards Project'' does not mention the findings of the state's recently released environmental impact statement, described elsewhere in the same issue (''Cities Grow Up, Some See Sprawl,'' Week in Review, Aug. 6): ''According to the state study, however, the project would also create significant traffic and parking problems, require an extra school's worth of classrooms, and cast shadows over nearby residential neighborhoods.'' 
 Those of us who live nearby recognize the devastating impact this project would have on quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods, unless it is scaled back dramatically.

Cynthia Steele

To the Editor:
 Only part of the Atlantic Yards area is ''underdeveloped,'' namely the air rights over the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Vanderbilt Yards. Like SoHo, TriBeCa and Dumbo, much of the acreage sought by Forest City Ratner has experienced incremental revitalization in recent years -- until stalled by the developer's plan. 
 Increased density and low- and moderate-income housing are desperately needed -- the 8.3-acre railyard would be a good site for that. However, density has limits. Even with the 15 percent cut you recommend, the proposed development far exceeds the capacity of the area's social, environmental and physical infrastructure. The resulting community would be by far the densest in the country, and would be unlivable. 
 Of the 2,200 hundred units of affordable housing, only 900 would be low-income housing; 900 other ''affordable'' units would rent for $2,000 or more per month and take 10 years to complete. The subsidies for the housing would be better distributed to developers who could deliver the housing faster, in more livable and sustainable communities. 
 To say that the area constitutes ''blight'' since it is publicly controlled is specious. If it remains unchallenged, no community in the state is safe from the arbitrary actions of a private developer with ties to government.

To the Editor:
 Brooklyn has prospered because of its intimate neighborhoods, its historic character and local development. That is the sort of growth that works long term; big boondoggle projects like Atlantic Yards will only kill the thing that made this borough so attractive in the first place. 
 You are correct that local residents are not happy about this. The astonishing thing is you don't seem to care.

HEADLINE: College-Town Real Estate: The Next Big Niche?

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
FROM now through Labor Day, thousands of college students will be settling into off-campus apartments across the country as they haul in their PC's and stereos, their boxes of DVD's, clothing and sports paraphernalia, for the fall semester. 
 For some unhappy neighbors, this may conjure up images of ceaseless parties and beer cans galore. But some investors see something more propitious: a steady stream of revenue, for starters, and growth potential for years to come.
''The student housing market is a good niche opportunity today,'' said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Rosen Consulting Group, a real estate and economics research company in Berkeley, Calif. ''The demographics are excellent, and the demand is great.''
 College enrollments have been on the rise as the baby boomers' children -- sometimes known as the ''echo boom'' generation -- come of age. This group, born from 1982 to 1995, is about 80 million strong. Yet the supply of on-campus housing is becoming increasingly limited. 
 At some state universities, like the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, fewer than 10 percent of the students live on campus, according to Michael H. Zaransky, author of the new book ''Profit by Investing in Student Housing'' (Kaplan Publishing). At Boise State University in Idaho, the ratio of beds to enrolled students was just 4.6 percent, according to data he collected two years ago.
 ''Most resident dorms are aged, but universities, particularly the public universities, are under severe financial pressure and simply do not have the money to meet the demand by building more dorms,'' Mr. Zaransky said. 
 Seeing an opportunity to meet widening demand, Mr. Zaransky's own real estate firm, Prime Property Investors in Northbrook, Ill., has been shifting its focus to off-campus student housing in the last couple of years, with the purchase or development of apartments and town houses near the University of Illinois, Purdue University, Loyola University of Chicago and Florida State University. The firm rents out 700 beds in all, he says. 
 ''We try to buy as close as possible to the schools -- within walking distance,'' he said. ''Those are the apartments that tend to get rented first and get higher rental increases.'' 
 Right now, with the school year about to commence, all of its units are spoken for. ''I'm not aware of any other sector in the residential housing business where you can count on 100 percent occupancy,'' he said. 
 Of course, there are few other segments where the turnover can approach 100 percent. While roughly a third of the student tenants typically renew their leases before they expire by early to mid-August, property owners must work hard earlier in the year to rent the remaining units.
 They also have only a narrow window of time to replace furnishings and to do all the repair work, cleaning and painting that is often required after everyone moves out. 
 ''It is much more management intensive'' than traditional housing, said Ralph L. Block, a real estate portfolio manager at the Phocas Financial Corporation, who is looking into investing in student housing for his company. He called the sector ''risky in one sense and not as risky in another.'' 
 ''The risk comes with the fact that the turnover period is very short; if you make some bad estimates and you don't get your apartments filled at the right time, you'll have a vacancy rate lasting the entire year, because it's hard to convert them to alternative uses,'' Mr. Block explained. ''But the steadiness of demand and still fairly limited supply argues for less risk.'' 
 (Unlike traditional apartments, which are leased by the unit, student housing projects are often leased by the bed, and, increasingly, the leases are guaranteed by a parent.)
 Student housing has already proved profitable for many investors. The capitalization rates -- meaning the initial yields -- can often exceed those on conventional multifamily homes, industry experts say.
 ''We averaged, on the projects sold in the last year, around 6.4 percent, compared with a 5.1 percent cap rate for traditional multifamily,'' said Ryan S. Reid, first vice president and national director of student housing at CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate brokerage firm.
 But as student housing becomes more widely accepted by investors -- and more expensive to buy -- the gap is expected to narrow. Markets where land is in short supply -- like New York, Boston, Chicago and parts of Florida and California -- are already considered hot markets, according to Mr. Reid. Austin, Tex., is another favored spot. 
 The bulk of the estimated $160 billion student housing market remains controlled by independent companies and investment groups that operate mostly regionally. Institutional and individual investors can participate in some deals, usually for a minimum investment of $50,000 to $150,000.
 Some tenants-in-common programs, or T.I.C.'s, nascent products that offer fractional ownership of properties, also invest in student housing. 
 Wall Street has been slower to catch on. ''The capital markets weren't quite sure how to look at this product type,'' Mr. Reid said. ''They still had what we could call more of the 'Animal House' view of what student housing was.'' 
 But in the last couple of years, three real estate investment trusts specializing in student housing have emerged -- GMH Communities Trust, American Campus Communities and Education Realty Trust -- making the sector more accessible to passive investors with less money to invest. (Equity Residential also has some student housing properties in its portfolio.) 
 Although the three student-housing REIT's are still finding their bearings, at least two of them, American Campus Communities and Education Realty Trust, have managed healthy returns. This year through July, American Campus Communities had a total return (price appreciation and dividend) of 10.07 percent while Education Realty returned 28.76 percent, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. By comparison, the total return for all equity REIT's during that period was 16.12 percent, the association said.
 But GMH Communities, which also builds and operates military housing, had a negative yield of 16.04 percent for the first seven months of this year, according to the association. The company recently disclosed that it has had to borrow heavily in order to pay dividends. 
 Mr. Block of Phocas Financial said he likes Education Realty, in which he invests himself. The company has focused mostly on smaller schools in less-urban areas but plans to expand into bigger cities. Its portfolio includes 36,637 beds at 59 college communities in 21 states.
 The company was developing private off-campus housing long before it was public. 
 ''Our first project was in 1964 in Chapel Hill, N.C.,'' the home of the University of North Carolina, ''and we are still there,'' said Paul O. Bower, the chief executive. ''We've served the children of the original tenants, and soon the grandchildren.'' 
 Some of Education Realty's units include luxury amenities like swimming pools, while others are more like dormitories, Mr. Bower said. 
 At this time of year, the occupancy level for all of them starts at 100 percent. ''We lose a percentage point or two throughout the year,'' he said, adding that the most labor-intensive part of the operation is managing the units. ''Eighty percent of the overhead expenses is for management,'' he said. 
 Mr. Zaransky of Prime Property Investors suggests that intrepid investors who want to go it alone -- by buying condominiums or town houses and renting them out -- hire professional managers to oversee the properties. Management fees are typically 5 to 8 percent of the rent collected, he said.
 Monthly rents vary by region. In the Southeast, for instance, they can range from $450 to nearly $800 a bed, according to Tom E. Lewis Jr., a managing partner at Flagstone Holdings in Miami, which specializes in acquiring and developing student housing in that region. 
 And with demand for private student housing expected to remain strong for the next several years, industry experts say, investors can almost bank on steady rent increases regardless of economic conditions or the interest rate climate. The same can't be said about conventional apartments.
 ''The success of these investments is tied to college enrollment, not to external economic factors like job creation,'' Mr. Zaransky said. ''In fact, one can argue that in bad economic times, people will want to pur-sue better credentials and go back to school.''

HEADLINE: Looking for the Will Beyond the Battlefield

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT'S been a bitter month or so.
 Mighty Israel, the redeemer of faith in what free men and women can do with arid desert if they are motivated, redeemer of faith that maybe there is a place for the Jews as a sovereign people and technological superpower, has been fought to a standstill by Hezbollah.
Can it possibly be that Hezbollah is better motivated, better led, better dug in and better armed than the Israeli army, which is supposed to be the best army, pound for pound, in the world? Can it be that Israel, which used to beat whole armies of countries like Egypt and Syria, has been humbled by a few thousand very well-motivated and well-armed men firing from between apartment buildings?
 Or could it be that what's different this time is the trumpet and, specifically, its uncertain sound? Israel geared up for a huge offensive, then called it off, then huffed and puffed, then called it off again, then said, ''Watch out, this time we're really going to blow your house down,'' and then called it off again. 
 Now, Israel's very survival is on the line, and it is a tiny state, about the size of New Jersey. If Israel cannot get it together to fight a serious war against a group, Hezbollah, that the State Department identifies as a terrorist organization, who will?
 So, Israel, which was supposed to be the shining light of how peace is won, is not shining as bright -- despite President Bush's extreme support for a good long time.
 Terrorists are still hatching plots against the air traffic system of the West, and this time bigger and worse than before. Obviously, Al Qaeda is far from dead. We have much to fear from it still. The fact that the suspects were almost all home-grown Britons makes the situation that much more frightening and unpredictable. How long will it be until American-born terrorists strike against American targets? We are a big country and we have a lot of unhappy people. How long until they organize themselves to kill? Not long, I am afraid. 
 While we're at it, yes, it's miraculous and wonderful that the plot was foiled, if it was. But now the whole Western world will be seriously inconvenienced in its travel for years, maybe decades. Isn't this already a victory for our enemies? Isn't this already a blow against world business? Might it be enough to push our already slowed growth into a recession?
 But the worst is what is to come: I got a jolting hint of this when I read the obituary for John L. Weinberg, who ran Goldman Sachs from 1976 to 1990. Mr. Weinberg was 81 when he died this month in Greenwich, Conn., after a lifetime of major achievement. I had the pleasure of dealing with him when he and I were a lot younger and I was in law school, also studying finance, at Yale. 
 My dear old father was a friend of his father, the venerable Sidney J. Weinberg, who ran Goldman Sachs from 1930 to 1969. My dad wangled a job interview for me with John Weinberg, an unprepossessing figure but obviously a smart guy. After some talk, he offered me a job. I would start by spending two years sitting at a desk until late at night going over spreadsheets. ''Really?'' I asked. That did not seem to be so glamorous. ''Yes, really,'' he said. ''That's how we all start.''
 I turned it down and became a poverty lawyer instead. But what I did not know about John Weinberg was that even though he was rich and well connected, as a young man he joined the Marines to fight the Japanese in the Pacific, then fought again in Korea. That was America's ruling class then. The scions of the rich went off to fight. 
 My longtime pal and idol, Peter M. Flanigan -- a former high honcho of Dillon, Read; a high aide to my ex-boss, Richard M. Nixon; and heir to a large brewing fortune -- was once a naval aviator. My father left a comfortable job in Washington to join the Navy. The father of my pal Phil DeMuth left a successful career to be an Army Air Corps pilot, flying death-defying missions over Burma. Congressmen resigned to serve. Senators resigned to serve. Professional athletes resigned to serve in the uniform.
 Now, who's fighting for us in the fight of our lives? Brave, idealistic Southerners. Hispanics from New Mexico. Rural men and women from upstate New York. Small-town boys and girls from the Midwest. Do the children of the powers on Wall Street resign to go off and fight? Fight for the system that made them rich? Fight for the way of life that made them princes? Surely, you jest.
 And that's the essence. The other side considers it a privilege to fight and die for its beliefs. Those on the other side cannot wait to line up to blow themselves up for their vision of heaven. On our side, it's: ''Let the other poor sap do it. I've got to make money.'' How can we fight this fight with the brightest and best educated rushing off and working night and day to do private equity deals and derivatives trading? How can we fight this fight with the ruling class absent by its own sweet leave?
 I keep thinking, again, that if Israel, with its back to the sea, cannot muster the will to fight in a big way, then the fat, faraway U.S.A. will never be able to do it. I keep saying this and it terrifies me. 
 We're in a war with people who want to kill us all and wreck our civilization. They're taking it very seriously. We, on the other hand, are worrying about leveraged buyouts and special dividends and how much junk debt the newly formed private entity can support before we sell it to the ultimate sucker, the public shareholder. 
 We're worrying whether Hollywood will forgive Mel Gibson and what the next move is for big homes in East Hampton. We're rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. The terrorists are the iceberg.
 WHAT stands between us and the iceberg are the miraculously brave men and women of the armed forces. They're heroes and saints as far as I'm concerned. But can they do it without the rest of us? Can they do it while we're all working on our tans and trying to have our taxes lowered again? How can we leave them out there all alone to die for us when we treat the war to save civilization as something we can just wish away? 
 If we don't win this war against the terrorists, there's not going to be business as usual ever again. If the terrorists get to their goal, there's not going to be a stock exchange or hedge funds or Bain Capital or the Carlyle Group or even Goldman Sachs. If the terrorists get their way -- and so far, they're getting their way -- there's not going to be business, period.
 Everyone with the really big money at stake is -- again -- bidding for the best deck chairs as the iceberg looms, not so far, any longer, under the surface, and very large and very cold and very solid.

HEADLINE: 1978: Meringue Torte

BYLINE: By Amanda Hesser

 BODY:
Meringue has long been a byproduct of other desserts, an economical way to use up leftover egg whites. Lemon meringue pie is probably the thrifty baker's loftiest achievement, while meringue cookies and macaroons are the kinds of things that tend to be made out of guilt more often than ambition.
A more inspired dessert can be found in this meringue torte -- an almond-scented meringue cake piled with whipped cream -- from the 1970's. The dessert is reminiscent of Pavlova, a large, free-form meringue topped with berries that was supposedly created in Australia in the 20's to celebrate a visit by the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. Over the years, New Zealand, ever the underdog, has argued that Pavlova was its invention. With luck, the contenders may be able to come to a truce sometime this century.
 In the meantime, if you've never had Pavlova, you should. (In Manhattan, Balthazar has kept it on the menu for years.) Better yet, try this meringue torte, which differs from Pavlova only in that it's baked in a tube pan and comes out more like a cake. Or as Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey, writers for The New York Times who published this recipe in 1978, described it, ''When the meringue comes from the oven, it looks like a disaster.'' 
 And it does, something like a saggy, toasted marshmallow in the shape of a tire. But all of this can be tidied up with whipped cream and a boozy raspberry sauce. It's far from a serious dessert. The great part of the recipe is all the time it spends in the oven. The night before serving, you plop the meringue into the tube pan, slip it into a 425-degree oven and turn off the heat. Then you promise yourself not to peek until morning, at which point it's done, earning its full name: Forget-It Meringue Torte.
 When I gave the recipe to Pichet Ong, the former pastry chef at Spice Market, who is opening a dessert restaurant, P*Ong, in New York this fall, he declared it too sweet. It is sweet, but no more so than a marshmallow. Then he created his own dessert, using the meringue as a launching pad.
 ''With meringue,'' he said, ''you don't need sugar in anything else.'' Ong whipped egg whites with a small amount of confectioners' sugar and powdered kaffir lime leaves (made by drying them in the microwave, then mashing them through a sieve). He opted for small, loose piles of meringue and used a spoon to form a well at the center, as you would for mashed potatoes, and baked them using the same method as the torte. Into the well he spooned a tart lime custard (which he also makes in the microwave -- he likes the microwave) and a papaya salad seasoned with Thai chilies and crunchy flakes of Maldon sea salt. ''The sweetness is not a problem when your palate is pulled in different directions,'' he added.
 The meringue cushions all of the strong flavors, and the leftover egg yolks are used in the custard. Home economists, you may sleep soundly. 

1978: Forget-It Meringue Torte
 This recipe is from Molly Chappellet, an owner of Chappellet Vineyards. It appeared in a New York Times article by Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey.
 Butter
 1 1/2 cups egg whites (9 to 11 eggs)
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
 3 cups plus 1 tablespoon sugar
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
 1 cup heavy cream
 3 -10-ounce packages frozen raspberries, defrosted, or fresh raspberries
 2 tablespoons kirsch or framboise liqueur.
 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Butter an angel-food-cake pan. In a mixer on medium speed, beat the egg whites until frothy. Add the cream of tartar. With the mixer on high speed, gradually add 2 1/2 cups of sugar. Add the vanilla and almond extracts, and beat to stiff, glossy peaks.
 2. Spoon the meringue into the pan. Level the top. Place in the oven, and turn off the heat. Do not open the door until the oven is cool, 4 hours or overnight.
 3. Push up the removable bottom of the pan. Cut away the top crust; reserve the crust and the crumbs. Unmold the cake onto a plate. Just before serving, whip the cream with 1 tablespoon sugar, then ice the cake with it. Chop the reserved crust to make crumbs, then sprinkle them around the sides and top of the cake, pressing gently.
 4. In a bowl, combine the raspberries, remaining 1/2 cup sugar and kirsch. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Serve the cake sliced with the sauce spooned on the side. Serves 12.

2006: Kaffir Lime Meringue Cakes With Lime-Scented Papaya
 By Pichet Ong of P*Ong, which will open in New York this fall.
 4 fresh kaffir lime leaves or the finely grated zest of 1 lime
 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
 4 large eggs, separated
 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar
 1 cup sugar
 * teaspoon vanilla extract
 1/2 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice
 1/2 cup heavy cream
 1/2 teaspoon salt
 2 tablespoons butter
 1 1/2 cups finely diced ( 1/4 inch) papaya
 1 teaspoon lime zest
 1/4 teaspoon minced Thai chili
 Maldon sea salt.
 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
 2. Place the kaffir lime leaves or lime zest in a bowl, and microwave for 30 seconds. Repeat until the leaves are curled and brittle or the zest is dry and crumbly. Finely chop the leaves, if using. Set aside a large pinch of chopped leaves or zest, then sift the remaining leaves or zest with the confectioners' sugar, pushing them through the sifter.
 3. In a mixer, whisk the egg whites on medium speed until they form soft peaks. Add the cream of tartar, then gradually add 1/2 cup of the sugar and continue whisking until the peaks are firm and glossy. By hand, fold in 1/4 teaspoon of the vanilla and the confectioners'-sugar mixture.
 4. Drop 6 grapefruit-size dollops of meringue onto the baking sheet. Create a well in the center of each mound. Press the remaining kaffir lime leaves (or lime zest) through a sifter to dust the meringue tops. Put the baking sheet in the oven, close the door and turn off the heat. Leave for 4 hours.
 5. In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, whisk together 1/2 cup lime juice, 1/2 cup sugar, cream, egg yolks, salt and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat, and whisk in the butter. Cover and cool.
 6. Just before serving, mix the papaya, remaining lime juice, 1 teaspoon lime zest and chili. Place a meringue on each of 6 plates. Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons custard into the well of each meringue, and top with papaya. Sprinkle with a pinch of Maldon sea salt. Serves 6. 
 NOTE: Kaffir lime leaves are available at importfood.com.

Sauce Update: The original recipe calls for kirsch, sugar and frozen raspberries. Nowadays, feel free to use fresh ones.
Finishing Touch: Bits of the torte's crust are sliced off, chopped and sprinkled on top of the whipped cream. No waste!
Serving Pieces: Slice it like cake: oval plate, $3.50, at www.crateandbarrel.com

 Technique: This torte is similar to Pavlova, a free-form pile of meringue, except that it's baked in a tube pan, so it rises up like angel-food cake. Tip: This dessert is best made on a dry day. Humidity will turn it into a sticky, droopy mess. (Photographs by Tom Schierlitz for The New York Times. food stylist: Brian Preston-Campbell. Jars avocado lily-pad plate, $26, at Bloomingdale's.)

HEADLINE: Can't Stand the Heat? Then Rent the Kitchen

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE overpowering smell of vanilla in her home led Priscilla Maddox to her current business -- and passion. 
 In 2000, Ms. Maddox was 16 years into retirement, after 36 years of employment in New York City hospitals and at a nursing home, when she decided to try turning her cookie-making skills into a business. For two weeks, she supplied batch after batch of her homemade goodies to a restaurant and to the nursing home where she had worked as an administrator.
But the strong vanilla smell that soon permeated her Brooklyn home from her baking ''was making me ill,'' she recalled recently, and she thought of renting another space in which to make her cookies. But that inspired still another thought: If she needed such a space, then others starting small food-production businesses, or even well into operating them, might also need one. 
 Thus was born Kitchen for Hire, a shared-use commercial kitchen that Ms. Maddox and two other women opened in 2000 in a former restaurant in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn. They used $60,000 from their savings to buy the 10-burner stove and the refrigerators, freezers and other equipment that the restaurant had used.
 Ms. Maddox, who demurred when asked her age, and one of her partners, Joan Reid, 65, who retired in 1998 as an executive secretary at the nursing home where Ms. Maddox had worked, run Kitchen for Hire. The third partner, Rayda Marquez, who is still employed as an administrator at the nursing home, is not involved in the kitchen's daily operation.
 Among those renting time at the kitchen to turn out their food are a caterer; a two-year-old, two-person company that produces sauces; and individuals starting to produce and market baked goods and handmade fresh dog food. 
 According to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, which regulates shared-use commercial kitchens, only a dozen of them exist in the state, mostly outside New York City.
 Ms. Maddox has never made any cookies at Kitchen for Hire; she gave up her commercial baking aspirations, she said, because she and Ms. Reid had to concentrate on running the kitchen, which is at 766 Washington Avenue in Brooklyn. And that has been a challenge. 
 ''This year looks like the first year we'll break even,'' Ms. Reid said. Revenue last year was about $25,000 while costs, including rent, utilities and insurance, totaled $35,000, she said. But both women said they had been able to handle the red ink so far, given their pension and Social Security incomes -- and, in Ms. Reid's case, a husband's support. Ms. Maddox is a widow.
 Moreover, they said, they prize the nonmonetary compensation. ''We're in the business of helping entrepreneurs,'' Ms. Maddox said. She spoke of the community value of providing a workplace for those who are producing or seeking to produce food for the marketplace but who, for legal or practical reasons, cannot make their products at home, and whose volume is too small to afford their own professional kitchens.
 Federal, state and local laws and regulations governing food safety, zoning and building safety make it illegal in the United States to use home kitchens to produce most kinds of food for sale. There are varying exemptions in many states for foods considered nonhazardous. 
 In New York, cookies and certain other baked goods, for example, may be produced in home kitchens, but the production of most other food requires a ''full-scale food processing facility subject to licensing and inspection,'' said Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture and Markets.
 The shared-use kitchens are also an alternative for businesses whose volumes are too small to interest co-packers, companies that manufacture the recipes of other companies, said Bob Weybright, a program leader with the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Dutchess County, who has worked with operators of shared-use commercial kitchens. 
 And such kitchens are an alternative as well for small-scale producers who find that they cannot rely on another approach, renting time in catering company kitchens, he said. When the busy catering seasons arrive, those kitchens are less available to outsiders, he said.
 Ms. Maddox, meanwhile, has another reason for continuing Kitchen for Hire. ''What would I do at home?'' she said. ''Waste away?''

WITH a collection of handsome public buildings, a poetic Sept. 11 memorial and charming if underused low-rise stores fanning out along the streets above the newly refurbished ferry terminal, the Staten Island town of St. George can remind a visitor of some of the most livable cities in the country. 
 Squint hard and you can see San Francisco in the restored Victorian houses dotting the hills, the Baltimore waterfront in a collection of mid-19th-century brick-and-granite warehouses, even Boston in the renovated loft apartments with their sweeping views of the harbor.
Alas, St. George is none of those places. But a Brooklyn developer aspires to turn the community into the next stop for people being priced out of places like Fort Greene, Brooklyn, or parts of Queens, and long since priced out of Manhattan. 
 Beginning in September, the developer, Leib Puretz, is to begin sales of the first of what he hopes will be 750 luxury condominium units in St. George. Most of the buildings are to have doormen and attended parking facilities, and all are within easy walking distance of the Staten Island Ferry terminal. 
 Mr. Puretz said he has invested $60 million so far to buy six parcels in St. George and is involved in the construction or renovation of the first two buildings. 
 The first, called the Pointe, at 155 Bay Street, where sales are beginning next month, is a five-story, 58-unit building. Condos in the second building, 101 units in a nine-story converted cocoa warehouse at 130 Bay Street Landing, are to go on the market early next year. This would be the fifth structure in the gated Bay Street Landing complex.
 Mr. Puretz is also planning three other waterfront residential structures; two are awaiting approval by the New York City Department of Buildings, and a planned 18-story building that would be built as 100 residential condos if a proposed zoning change takes effect. In addition, Mr. Puretz plans an upscale restaurant and 18 residential units in a former Fishs Eddy dishware shop, as well as a condominium office block and a supermarket in a former lumberyard. 
 Mr. Puretz, a real estate investor who owned and managed a number of apartment buildings in the metropolitan area before turning to development, has formed a partnership with Casandra Properties, real estate brokers in Staten Island. Casandra was the broker involved in selling some of the parcels being developed in St. George, and it will sell the completed units. 
 Mr. Puretz has also bid on the contract for the site of the proposed National Lighthouse Museum adjacent to the ferry terminal. That project, estimated to cost $70 million, is to include restoring buildings around a waterfront public plaza and turning them into a museum, adding restaurants, cafes and retail as well as 250 residential units on what was once a Coast Guard base. Mr. Puretz's bid for the museum is one of three under review by the city's Economic Development Corporation, said Joseph Carroll, district manager of Community Board 1 in Staten Island.
 At the helm of what could be the biggest wave of development in St. George since the beginning of the 20th century, Mr. Puretz said the new housing would be stylish in order to compete for buyers with Brooklyn neighborhoods like Greenpoint and Bedford-Stuyvesant. 
 If nothing else, the prices will be hard to beat. Mr. Puretz said he is paying less than $100 per square foot to develop the residential properties and will sell the units for $400 to $650 a square foot. Sales prices of about $1,000 a square foot are common in Manhattan. 
 ''Families can't afford $1.1 million for a one-bedroom, and this is a very affordable alternative, 20 minutes from Manhattan,'' Mr. Puretz said. 
 According to James Prendamano, a broker with Casandra Properties, the 1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath units in the Pointe will sell for about $500,000 when they go on the market in the next six to eight weeks.
 Penthouse apartments at 130 Bay Street Landing will have two to four bedrooms and start at $1 million for the two-bedroom, two-bath unit. 
 Measuring only 0.25 square miles in size, and with a population of about 8,000 (according to the 2000 census), St. George is the borough's most urban neighborhood. The housing stock is a mix of Victorian homes, low-rise rental apartments, a Mitchell-Lama complex, a smattering of co-ops and condos and a growing number of loft-style conversions. 
 Buildings vary in height, but some residents object to the height of some of the new construction, at 19 stories, as out of character with the neighborhood. 
 ''People who live along those streets have invested in the neighborhood because it is was low-scale,'' said David Goldfarb, a lawyer and 33-year resident of St. George, who is also president of the New York City Historic Districts Council. ''Every place doesn't have to look like Miami Beach.'' 
 Theo Dorian, president of the St. George Civic Association, notes that any new construction blocking views flies in the face of landmark designation and hillside protection, which give the neighborhood its appeal.
 ''I wouldn't consider it fair to take over those views for people who don't live here yet, at the expense of people who built this neighborhood and created the climate that is so attractive to builders of luxury apartments,'' he said. 
 Like Mr. Dorian, current residents in what is also the borough's most ethnically mixed area and whose median income is about $68,000 (according to the 2000 census), did say that an influx of residents would give a shot in the arm to the extensive but perpetually struggling retail and commercial scene. 
 The Art Deco St. George Theater has been restored and reopened, and there is a weekly Greenmarket held in the municipal parking lot, but the two- or three- or four-story buildings with street level retail along Victory Boulevard, Bay Street, Hyatt Street, Stuyvesant Place and Richmond Terrace are far from upscale. Among restaurants serving Polish, Sri Lankan, Middle Eastern and Moroccan fare, shops include things like an adult video store, travel agencies, food shops catering to the vast immigrant population, hair salons and storefront churches. 
 As one resident put it, ''the stores only serve the people who live above them.'' 
 They also serve clients of the multiple social services agencies that dominate the street scene in St. George, headquarters for the borough's courts, municipal services and police borough command. They include a shelter for battered women, the Department of Probation, day centers for the mentally ill and services for H.I.V. or AIDS patients, among others.
 Residents hope to block a 59-bed facility for mentally ill former prisoners being proposed by the Sisters of Charity religious order. Social service agencies have always been part of the landscape in St. George, but according to Mr. Dorian, numbers are now out of proportion with other Staten Island neighborhoods. 
 ''It's the lack of balance,'' he said, ''with so much of everything in my backyard.''
 The number of such facilities could be less of a factor as they are eclipsed by other changes in St. George. They include a new courthouse scheduled to open in early 2011, the departure of the 120th police precinct, a $179 million refurbishment of the ferry terminal ramps, the as-yet-unscheduled opening of the National Lighthouse Museum and a $1.5 million refurbishment of Tompkinsville Park.
 There is also a new waterfront park, and the Richmond County Bank Ballpark, home of the Staten Island Yankees, is expected to be given new life when the New York Yankees assume ownership later this year.

HEADLINE: 'Green' Housing Isn't Just for the Rich

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I was pleased to see your article on green buildings (''It's Getting Easier to Be Green,'' Aug. 13) mention Full Spectrum's efforts in affordable home ownership in Harlem. But the emphasis on $1 million condos and $5,000-a-month rental apartments perpetuates the misperception that green design is only available to luxury developments like the Solaire. 
Nonprofit developers of affordable rentals are reducing fuel usage by up to 40 percent in new buildings with a modest upfront investment (as low as 2 percent of construction costs). These upgrades reduce costs for low-income residents, who arguably are most in need of relief from rising utility prices. We intend to demonstrate that if we can build green, anyone can.

HEADLINE: A Big Team Effort In Preserving Forest Glen 

 BODY:
I was very pleased to see the article highlighting the preservation of the historic National Park Seminary at Forest Glen, Md. (''Preserving History and a 'Fantasy Feeling,' '' Aug. 6). Rescued from the brink of the Army's demolition by neglect, it's now being reclaimed as a historic treasure. 
 This success would have been impossible without the Alexander Company, a leader in the adaptive reuse of historic buildings, and EYA architects, experts in compatible infill development.
Federal and state tax credits for historic rehabilitation provided strong economic incentives for preservation. Thanks also to Montgomery County, which stepped in at a critical juncture to assume title and, some thought, considerable risk after transfer out of federal ownership.
 The preservation of Forest Glen is a miraculous outcome that seemed practically unattainable 10 or 15 years ago.
 This success is a credit to the vision and perseverance of a strong coalition of local, state and national preservation allies, including Save Our Seminary and the National Trust, who spent five years in court together against the Army to protect the district, as well as the Maryland Historical Trust, the Montgomery County Historic Preservation Commission, Preservation Maryland, and Montgomery Preservation Inc., who were all involved through years of negotiation and advocacy.

HEADLINE: What Really Moves Interest Rates

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MANY homeowners breathed a sigh of relief when the Federal Reserve Board held its benchmark interest rate steady during its meeting on Aug. 8. But what many homeowners and prospective buyers do not know is that the Fed's actions have little, if any, direct impact on traditional long-term mortgages.
 ''For loans like the 30-year fixed mortgage, what really matters is what lenders think is going on with inflation, since that can reduce the value of the loans they're making,'' said Gus Faucher, an analyst with Moody's Economy.com, an economic consultancy in West Chester, Pa. 
The Fed will, of course, consider inflation when it sets the so-called federal funds rate, the overnight interest rate it charges banks. The overnight rate is closely tied to the prime interest rate that banks charge their best customers.
 But because the prime affects short-term loans like car loans, credit cards and many adjustable-rate mortgages, Mr. Faucher and other economists and analysts said that anyone who wants to understand fluctuations in long-term mortgage rates should instead look to other economic statistics.
 The 10-year Treasury note is among the most widely watched indicators of long-term interest rate trends, but investors will often look at the so-called ''swap rates'' that banks charge each other when trading long-term and short-term loans.
 A glance at historical movements in the federal funds rate along with the yields on 10-year Treasury notes and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate helps to show how little connection exists between the federal funds rate and long-term mortgages.
 The federal funds rate bottomed out in 2003 at 1 percent, while 30-year fixed-rate mortgages also hit a low of just under 5 percent in June of that year.
 Since that time, though, the federal funds rate has climbed 4.25 percentage points, while long-term mortgage rates have risen about 1.5 percentage points. 
 Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, by contrast, have risen by 1.76 percentage points in the same span.
 Of course, many recent home buyers can take solace in the Fed's reluctance to raise its overnight lending rates for banks. 
 That is because many more buyers have chosen variable-rate mortgages in the last five years to keep pace with rising housing costs, industry executives and analysts said. As many homeowners have learned this year, these loans can grow considerably more expensive when short-term rates rise.
 According to Moody's Investors Service, 19 percent of all mortgages originated in 2003 were ARM's. In 2004, the figure reached 34 percent, then settled at 31 percent last year. Since many ARM's are adjusted after the first three years, this was the year when interest rates on the 2003 loans started to rise.
 Based partly on rising rates for those loans, the nation's household expense for mortgage interest is expected to rise by nearly 18 percent this year, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis.
 Some economists believe the Fed may have had that statistic in mind when it refrained from lifting rates again, since further increases in interest expenses could stall consumer spending and, by extension, the economy.
 ''This will be one of the steepest year-over-year jumps in household interest expense since 1981,'' said John Lonski, the chief economist of Moody's Investors Service. ''It's worth noting that that was part and parcel of a relatively severe recession, which has to be on the minds of the Fed policy makers.''

HEADLINE: Red, White and Old School

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
IN a rare alignment of the stars -- and the bars -- my test drive of the new Shelby GT500 took place over the Fourth of July. Parading along the streets of Brooklyn, Ford's retro muscle car became part of the celebration, a two-ton American flag with white racing stripes. 
 Children pointed and teenagers urged me to light the fuse of this glaring red rocket. As I obliged, painting the scene with black rubber, it was enough to bring a tear to the eye of a laid-off autoworker. 
As every Mustang fanatic knows, the Shelby is a 500-horsepower homage to the Shelby GT's of the 1960's, an era when gasoline flowed like nickel drafts and, believe it or not, Japanese cars were clearly inferior to Detroit's -- and a whole lot less cool. 
 So you can almost forgive Ford (and General Motors and Chrysler) for wanting to time-warp back to that era. Which they have, reviving often slavish imitations of their greatest hits. Ford acts at times like an aging high school jock, finding it easier to rehash the glory days than to focus on the future. 
 Now there's no doubt that the muscle-car revival has put some style and swagger back in the American car, and it has hatched some of the better new models on the market, including the Chrysler 300 and the Mustang GT on which the Shelby coupe and convertible are based. 
 But even this car's target audience of boomers and blue collars may be a bit disappointed in this super 'Stang, which costs roughly $44,000, or $51,000 for the convertible. The Shelby goes fast and sounds appropriately menacing, but it doesn't feel as explosive as its lofty horsepower rating suggests. 
 In contrast to the Mustang GT's 4.6-liter V-8 -- with an aluminum block, three valves per cylinder and 300 horsepower -- the Shelby gets a supercharged 5.4-liter V-8 with an extra valve in each cylinder. The GT500 will hustle from 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds, its V-8 rumble overlaid with the whine of a supercharger. Second gear peaks above 80 m.p.h., and third around 110, with six speeds managed through a stiff-feeling manual shifter. Huge Brembo brakes with four-piston front calipers help rein in the wide-striped beast.
 On smooth highways, the Shelby feels something like a Nascar stocker escaped from the track. It rides well enough and goes exactly where you point it. Its sticky 18-inch tires deliver gobs of grip. Yet with 57 percent of its weight up front, the car is prone to understeer. Mute steering doesn't communicate the car's intentions, especially at the higher speeds where you'd like some reassurance. 
 And if the Shelby loves creamy pavement, it has less taste for the chunky kind, on which the stiff suspension and low-profile tires transmit serious harshness into the cabin. On rough city streets, the Shelby is harder on your glutes than a Marine Corps Pilates instructor, and its tires chase after every hump and crack in the road. After a weeklong test, a persistent rattle had settled in near the right front wheel. 
 In evolutionary terms, the Mustang's solid-axle rear suspension is still dragging its knuckles on the ground. Despite Ford's persistent claims to the contrary, the antique setup cannot match an independent suspension in ride and handling, though it does hold down costs.
 The best sports cars dance over bumps; the Shelby hammers them into submission. 
 Inside, the GT500 makes half-hearted gestures to upgrade the Mustang's nostalgic cabin, including optional (and tacky-looking) red seat inserts and a hissing cobra on the steering wheel. Driving position and comfort make a huge leap from the last-generation Mustang, but that car's basic structure dated to the late 1970's. Plastics are poorly matched and lackadaisically fitted and have a greasy Brylcreem sheen. 
 The retro attitude extends to the mileage, and the Shelby proved to be one of the thirstiest cars I've tested, at 12.5 m.p.g. over all. In one admittedly hard-charging 70-mile stretch, the Shelby returned just 10 m.p.g. -- or well over $1 for every three miles of travel. 
 After filling up, a mere 150-mile jaunt drained the tank nearly to ''E,'' at which point my Visa card began to self-destruct. Babied on the highway, the Shelby hung around 19 m.p.g.; yet a Corvette Z06, with 505 horsepower, can manage 26 m.p.g.
 The Shelby's poor mileage wins it one distinction: a $1,300 guzzler tax. Of course, muscle car lovers will say that fuel economy is beside the point. And come January, the 325-horse Shelby GT-H -- the H stands for Hertz, and the car is currently for rent in major cities -- will offer buyers the Shelby mystique with better mileage at a lower price.
 The bottom line is this: the GT500 is an asphalt assassin, and if squeamish types don't approve of its methods, they'll be forced to admit that it gets the bloody job done. As with Mustangs past, this version will put a beat-down on many pricier speed machines. 
 If administering those beatings is your goal -- or you can't afford to collect the six-figure original -- the Shelby's throwback act will hold some appeal. But buyers whose heads aren't permanently wedged under the hood of the 1960's will expect more poise and polish for their 44 grand (plus the likelihood of a stiff dealer markup).
 Ford has made much of how modern, safe and comfortable the new model is, compared with its predecessors. But how could it not be, considering its 40-year advantage? Finally, though, it comes across as less of a sequel and more of a rerun. 

INSIDE TRACK: The Cobra earns its stripes, but not everyone will salute.

HEADLINE: For Fans of Old Microcars, It's a Small World After All

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
THE timely arrival of fuel-sipping small cars like the Honda Fit, the Nissan Versa and the Toyota Yaris may finally answer the question of whether Americans are ready to downsize their aspirations in automobiles. 
 Should gas prices continue to rise, drivers may be willing to consider vehicles smaller yet -- even tiny urban runabouts like the stylish Smart ForTwo, which DaimlerChrysler recently announced would go on sale in the United States in 2008.
Showroom success is far from certain for this new generation of petro-misers, though. America's previous flirtations with the microcar -- a class loosely defined by collectors as cars less than 10 feet long with engines smaller than 1,000 cc -- have all ended on sad notes. 
 Microcars in America go back at least as far as the 1930 American Austin (later sold as the American Bantam), a 1,200-pound 750 cc version of the British Austin built under license in Butler, Pa. 
 Though blessed with scale-model cuteness -- the Depression-era roadster looked like a dodge-'em car that somehow escaped from Coney Island -- the public was able to resist its charms. Aside from providing a sight gag for movies -- usually with a very tall driver at the wheel -- Bantams failed to catch on and the company did not produce automobiles after World War II. 
 Powel Crosley Jr., an appliance maker from Cincinnati, produced a full line of thrifty, innovative small cars from 1939 to 1952, but again, consumers were unimpressed. The microcar gained wide acceptance only in Europe, where a combination of congested cities, high gas prices and scarce raw materials created an urgent need for cheap transportation. Not surprisingly, Germany and Italy produced some of the most popular microcars. 
 With no demand for their military products after 1945, German aircraft factories turned to civilian products. In a plant that had built the world's first jet-fighters, Messerschmitt started making the KR 200, a bug-eyed three-wheel microcar. It was relatively popular with Germans who could not afford larger cars but wanted something more than a scooter or a motorcycle. 
 Rather than swing-open doors, passengers entered the Messerschmitt KR 200 after flipping open the clear canopy -- just like the feared Messerschmitt fighters. It even had an aircraft-style steering wheel. But the KR 200 could manage only about 50 miles an hour from its 9.7-horsepower engine. Gas mileage, however, was impressive -- between 50 and 80 miles a gallon, depending on driving conditions. Messerschmitts are generally considered to be among the best engineered and most collectible microcars; they have an active following and a ready availability of parts. 
 One of the oddest microcar stories is that of the Isetta, a 7.5-foot egg-shaped car with a single front-hinged door and a 247 cc 13 horsepower motorcycle engine. Conceived by an Italian refrigerator maker -- continuing the peculiar tradition established by Crosley of appliance companies entering the microcar market -- the Isetta was sold in Italy under the Iso name. 
 Sensing a market for the car in a still-rebuilding Germany, BMW, then near bankruptcy, licensed the rights to build the car; it made more than 100,000 before moving on to larger cars. 
 Today, BMW has a sense of humor about the Isetta, though it is doubtful an Isetta will show up in advertising the way a vintage 2002tii has in the past, or that ad copy will proclaim: ''BMW-- from Isetta to iDrive in just 50 short years.'' 
 Isettas and Messerschmitts may be cheeky oddities in the United States -- they are often called ''bubble cars'' -- but there is considerably less affection for them in Germany. Unlike the atomic-age optimism that a boldly finned '57 Chevy evokes for Americans, an Isetta reminds older Germans mostly of the hardships endured before the West German economic miracle took hold.
 Microcars have often found favor with collectors who have a sense of the absurd -- and humble enough to embrace cars with minuscule engines, tiny tires and quirky styling. Isettas have sold for $12,00 to $20,000 at collector auctions and on eBay Motors; one notable Messerschmitt brought $25,000 at a British auction last year. 
 Because of their crowd-pleasing ability, microcars are now welcome at some exclusive vintage car shows. The Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in Florida added a separate microcar class this year; it was won by a 1950 Reyonnah, a tiny French car that resembles a cross between a small speedboat and a praying mantis, owned by Bruce Weiner, a prolific microcar collector. 
 Their attractiveness has prompted many car museums to add microcars to their collections. The Lane Motor Museum in Nashville has a large collection that includes lesser-known brands like the Peel and the Scootacar. The curator, Susan Lane, co-founder with her husband, Jeff Lane, enjoys introducing microcars to visitors. ''You can explain the history and why these cars developed in gloomy postwar Europe and you'll get blank looks and questions like, 'Yeah, but can it drive on the road?' '' she said. 
 Mr. Weiner's collection of microcars must surely be among the largest in the world. Mr. Weiner, who houses the cars in a museum in Madison, Ga., expressed his belief that devoted microcar collectors were the true iconoclasts and oddballs of the hobby. ''Microcars were the sole domain of low-budget, blue-collar types with a sense of humor,'' he said, noting that these collectors do not need a big bank account or a three-car garage to have several microcars. 
 Mark Hyman, a classic car dealer in St. Louis, has sold many examples of the breed. He explains the psyche of the microcar buyer this way: ''The guy who buys a microcar is looking for something different -- pound for pound, a microcar is the greatest bargain in crowd-attracting fun in the collector-car universe,'' he said. 
 But safety may be an issue: although Mr. Hyman walked away unscathed, he has experienced a triple rollover in a Messerschmitt KR 200. The accident happened while backing the car up a driveway at less than 15 miles an hour -- in front of horrified guests at his wife's birthday party.

HEADLINE: Swiping At Industry From Atop The Stump

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
BUSINESS bashing by politicians in America has a long history, including rhetoric far more inflammatory than the denunciations being directed at Wal-Mart this year by some Democrats, who sometimes sound as if they are running against the company instead of another politician. 
 Wal-Mart is under attack for paying too little, providing benefits that are too small and even exploiting illegal immigrants. Laws have been written with Wal-Mart in mind, and more are being proposed.
The company may not appreciate the honor, but its place in the political debate reflects its revolutionary effect on the American economy. 
 Put simply, the big winners as the economy changes have often been scary to many, particularly those with a stake in the old economic order being torn asunder. 
 ''Twice as many Americans shop at Wal-Mart over the course of a year than voted in the last presidential election,'' said H. Lee Scott Jr., the company's chief executive, in a speech to the National Governors Association in February.
 Wal-Mart's success reflects its ability to charge less for a wide range of goods. That arguably has reduced inflation and made the economy more efficient. It has introduced innovations in managing inventory and shipping goods.
 But Wal-Mart's success brought pain to others. 
 The company has been blamed for destroying downtowns as shoppers desert local merchants for the big-box store. 
 Local newspapers lost some of their best advertisers. That may not influence news coverage, said Alex Jones, the director of the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard, but ''I don't think you will see many editorials blasting the government for taking on Wal-Mart.''
 The company's ability to negotiate good deals from suppliers, some of which probably would go out of business if Wal-Mart walked away, has also created anxiety and resentment, both among the suppliers and among merchants who complain that Wal-Mart gets better deals.
 It has infuriated unions by opposing the organization of its employees -- even to the point of closing a Canadian store whose workers voted for a union. (It said the closing was not related to the vote.) In some locations, unions have been forced to agree to reductions in wages and benefits at retailers that must lower costs in order to compete with the giant. 
 Opponents say some Wal-Mart employees are paid wages that still allow them to qualify for Medicaid health insurance, calling that, in effect, a government subsidy for a company that is forcing down pay for workers at other companies. 
 But the fact that Wal-Mart has more shoppers than any politician has voters shows that many of those workers -- and many people higher on the income scale -- find its prices irresistible. That group no doubt includes some of the company's critics.
 Previous business targets of politicians have similarly been both popular and reviled. The railroads enabled much of America to prosper, but to many people in the late 19th century they were viewed as villains. 
 They upset old economic relationships by making it possible to ship goods over much longer distances, thus introducing competition for local businesses and farms. At the same time, any given area was likely to be served by just one railroad, giving it monopoly pricing power over the farmers, whose produce became worthless if it could not be shipped to distant markets.
 The railroads were lumped together in the public consciousness, but the Pennsylvania, as a major road linking New York to the Midwest, came in for much of the criticism.
 The railroads in turn made possible giant industrial companies, and led to new fears of monopolies, culminating in the passage of antitrust acts, and their sometimes vigorous enforcement by President Theodore Roosevelt, who coined the term ''malefactors of great wealth'' and ran against them.
 ''There is not,'' he thundered, ''in the world a more ignoble character than the mere money-getting American, insensible to every duty, regardless of every principle, bent only on amassing a fortune, and putting his fortune only to the basest uses -- whether these uses be to speculate in stocks and wreck railroads himself, or to allow his son to lead a life of foolish and expensive idleness and gross debauchery, or to purchase some scoundrel of high social position, foreign or native, for his daughter.''
 By the time of the Great Depression, the Wall Street colossus, embodied by J. P. Morgan, became embroiled in the political arena. Franklin D. Roosevelt inveighed against the ''economic royalists'' and blamed ''the ruthless manipulation of professional gamblers in the stock markets and in the corporate system.'' In his 1933 inaugural address, he celebrated that ''the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization.''
 The results of all those political agitations were government reforms, although they often had limited effect. The Interstate Commerce Commission was created to regulate the railroads, but that was not the force that eventually knocked the industry from its powerful perch. It was competition, brought about by trucks and their tax-provided highways and airlines and their tax-supported airports.
 John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil was broken up in 1911, but owning stakes in a lot of companies left Rockefeller even wealthier than he was. (Some of the companies have since been recombined, the most notable being the merger of Exxon, the former Standard Oil of New Jersey, with Mobil, the former Standard Oil of New York.)
 The Wall Street outrages that angered Franklin Roosevelt brought a wave of legislation, including the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, an institution that has not prevented the securities industry from being very profitable.
 There have been other cases where industries came under intense political attack, like the oil companies in the 1970's and early 1980's, when the phrase ''obscene profits'' was coined but little was done to rein in the industry.
 Wal-Mart has been on the defensive in some legislative chambers. Maryland adopted legislation intended to force the company to spend more on health insurance, but that was struck down by a federal judge. Chicago passed legislation to force the company to raise its wages.
 Wal-Mart is among the most successful companies in the world, but last week it reported a decline in quarterly profits for the first time in a decade, partly because of problems with its international business and partly because competitors are getting better. Its stock price rose 1,100 percent in the 1990's, but it is down by a third in the current decade. 
 Despite opponents' success in Chicago, it seems unlikely that governments will force Wal-Mart to greatly increase its health insurance benefits. Any such effort would most likely affect many other businesses, some of which would be in no position to afford it.
 But it is conceivable that some of Wal-Mart's harshest critics could find it an ally in changing the way health care is paid for in the United States, particularly if more companies come to agree with what Mr. Scott told the National Governors Association after he defended the health care benefits his company did offer.
 ''The soaring cost of health care in America cannot be sustained over the long term by any business that offers health benefits to its employees.,'' he said. ''And every day that we do not work together to solve this challenge is a day that our country becomes less competitive in the global economy.'' 
 Much of what he went on to say dealt with efforts to control costs and make the health care systemmore efficient, something few would oppose. But it is unusual for a business leader to call on government to do more in health, while many who attack Wal-Mart now have long advocated a greater government role in paying for health care. 
 Politics, as someone once said, can make strange bedfellows.

HEADLINE: The Journey From Welfare to Work

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 According to Douglas J. Besharov (''End Welfare Lite as We Know It,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 15), the federal government's recent introduction of tougher work requirements is just what states needed to ''address the deeper needs of welfare families.''
I wonder which ''deeper needs'' he's addressing. My own welfare journey ended when I was able to connect to the medical and housing services I needed and begin the hard work of education, getting my G.E.D. and then a college degree. 
 Study after study shows that education is crucial for attaining economic security. Eighty-eight percent of women receiving welfare who graduate from college move permanently out of poverty. Yet these regulations curtail educational opportunities for many receiving welfare by piling on make-work demands without letting states count the long hours spent studying and going to school toward the work required to receive benefits. 
 Far from addressing needs, the new policy inhibits the ability of people receiving welfare to leave poverty for good. 

Maureen Lane

The writer is a fellow at the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy and co-director of the Welfare Rights Initiative at Hunter College, CUNY.

To the Editor:
 Douglas J. Besharov claims that welfare reform has caused only ''small pockets of additional hardship.'' That glosses over the reality that over the last five years, the number of Americans below the meager federal poverty line and the number suffering from food insecurity have both increased by millions.
 Most of this increased misery is due to structural problems in the economy, yet the suffering is exacerbated when people who fall through the cracks can no longer rely on a robust safety net that expands when hardship increases.
 To his credit, Mr. Besharov does admit that a central problem is that many people who leave welfare for work don't earn enough to support their families. But instead of calling for increased wage supports, job training and other help for such workers, he derides the very limited nutritional and other support that some who leave welfare continue to obtain from government as ''welfare lite.''
 The lesson is, even when conservatives like Mr. Besharov are forced to admit that low-income Americans are now working more but earning less, their only response is to propose steps that would further reduce their standard of living. That's social policy lite.

To the Editor:
 While we agree with Douglas J. Besharov's analysis of the economic factors that drove the welfare cash assistance decline, as well as his concern for the economic well-being of low-wage workers, we strongly disagree with his characterization of working families that receive federally financed nutrition and health insurance as remaining ''on welfare.'' 
 Higher-wage jobs come with an array of employment benefits -- health insurance, pensions, child care, paid sick leave, transportation subsidies -- both through tax policy and from employers. Low-wage jobs, currently one-third of our labor market, rarely come with such benefits. 
 It is striking the extent to which the federal benefits available to people in low-wage jobs parallel the benefits available to those in higher-wage jobs through their employers and the tax system. Until low-wage jobs provide the same employment benefits as higher-wage jobs, we should insist that our government address this failure of our economy.

The writers work at the Center for Community Change in Washington. They served as advisers on welfare policy to Senator Paul Wellstone and President Bill Clinton, respectively.

To the Editor:
 While Douglas J. Besharov admits that $16,000 a year (the average wage of mothers who left welfare for full-time employment) is ''not a lot of money,'' he nevertheless laments that these same beneficiaries of welfare reform continue to receive ''welfare lite'' through the remaining social welfare programs.
 Well, here's a thought: how about raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour so that those working full time can free themselves of their ''dependency'' on government aid? That's not very likely to happen in today's political environment, but the fact remains that wage levels at the lower end of the economic spectrum do not provide the means of self-sufficiency.
 ''Welfare lite'' programs are all that stand between the low-wage worker and economic disaster. 

Joseph J. McGovern
Seattle, Aug. 15, 2006

To the Editor:
 Douglas J. Besharov is correct that better government policies are necessary to enable more who leave welfare to sustain full-time employment. His focus on more vigilant enforcement of tougher work requirements is misplaced.
 Slow job growth and the prospects of contractionary Federal Reserve policies to stem inflation are the main obstacles facing those leaving welfare, not their lack of proper behavioral traits or basic skills.

Robert Cherry
Brooklyn, Aug. 15, 2006

The writer is a professor of economics at Brooklyn College.

To the Editor:
 Douglas J. Besharov begrudges impoverished mothers and their infants $1,800 in nutritional support from the federal Women, Infants and Children program. Meanwhile, the American taxpayers are spending more than $1 billion per week on the Iraq war. Our nation's conservative ''thinkers'' desperately need to develop some sense of perspective.

HEADLINE: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
Next door to a hair-braiding salon, and a couple of doors down from the Hasidic kosher market, is a beat-up storefront and metal grill topped with a plastic sign that reads ''Light of God Ministries.'' Inside is a Nigerian Pentecostal Church run by Remi Ortiz, a kind-eyed woman dressed in brightly patterned cloth and tribal headwear. She is a Nigerian prophetess, and this is her house of prayer in Far Rockaway, Queens.
 Ms. Ortiz is just one of dozens of everyday people whose stories are featured in ''Crossing the Boulevard: Strangers, Neighbors, Aliens in a New America,'' the dense, unconventional little show at the Neuberger Museum of Art. It is more a multimedia display than art, combining images, sound, objects and slices of personal testimony to document the lives of new immigrants to this country. The project was carried out by the documentary team of Warren Lehrer and Judith Sloan. 
Most of the subjects live in Queens, but their stories resonate far beyond the borders of this multicultural New York borough. What often gets lost in the national debate on immigration is the human dimension, an understanding of the lives of those people who give up everything to come here. This exhibition lets them tell their stories. 
 The exhibition consists of 26 narratives divided into 5 groups, each reflecting a shared experience among the more than 70 featured subjects. Some of the people came to the United States as political refugees, others came for economic reasons. Then there are displays of groups of immigrants from different parts of the world who have wound up living in the same building or street, or in one case playing at a table tennis club in Jackson Heights, Queens. This section is called ''Unlikely Bedfellows.''
 To prepare for the project, Mr. Lehrer and Ms. Sloan conducted workshops in libraries, high schools and community centers across Queens. They buttressed this with photographic portraits and interviews with people in bodegas, places of worship, community restaurants, cultural centers and public housing projects. Then they began to edit the material, selecting a final group of interviewees who, they felt, encapsulated the experience of a wider cultural group or generation.
 From the documentary perspective, the exhibition is a powerful social record. We see the subjects' faces in the photographs, hear their voices in recorded interviews, and enter into their lives through the display of cherished mementos they have carried from home to home. There are also maps and other contextual information about them and their native countries. 
 All of this is well researched and presented, with the exception of the portraits. They are routine, with the subjects often photographed against a white background with casual attention paid to clothing or facial expression. A desire not to glamorize these people is perfectly understandable, but surely photographing them at work or in their home, surrounded by elements of their lives, would have been more revealing. 
 In spite of this, the extraordinary stories of the subjects shine through. Making your way through the show, you meet people like Yeshey Pelzom, a college-educated refugee from Bhutan who was persecuted after she married a man from a minority ethnic and religious group. Then there is Eugene Hutz, a Ukrainian-born songwriter and bandleader who loved American rock music so much he decided to move here. He went first to Vermont, where he started his own fusion rock band.
 The show focuses on individuals who arrived in the United States after the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act put an end to immigration policies that favored Europeans. For this reason, the bulk of the subjects are from Africa, Russia, Asia and South America. Most were poor and came here with little beyond a few prized possessions and a head full of memories. The accompanying exhibition book records vividly and accurately their hopes and dreams for a new life in this country. 
 One such captivating story is that of Malika Kalontarova, from Tajikistan, a republic of the former Soviet Union. She didn't want to be a hairdresser like her sisters, so she would perform for the customers instead of cutting their hair. Her father became so fed up with her loafing that he let her pursue her dreams, and she traveled around the world performing traditional dances. She now lives in Queens and runs a dance studio. 
 Ms. Kalontarova is typical of the immigrants profiled here -- smart, ambitious and talented people who chose to leave their country in the hope of making a better life for their children. She has two sons, one of whom also wants to be a dancer. His name is Arthur, and in the exhibition book he recalls with obvious sorrow how his birth country slid into civil war after the breakup of the Soviet Union. ''War over there was very big war. Very bad war.''
 The exhibition also includes a mobile story booth, which enables visitors to enter and record their own stories of migration, or those of parents and grandparents. There is a digital camera inside the booth, so that you can add your image to the archive. Once the images and stories have been uploaded onto the Web, they become part of an online archive of immigration stories attached to the exhibition as it continues from place to place around the country.
 The Northeast is home to many new immigrants, making this fertile terrain for collecting their stories. This type of exhibition may be of particular interest to them, if only out of solidarity with those who have already stood up and told their stories. It takes courage to bare your soul this way, to make yourself a living work of art.

HEADLINE: Cracking The Shells

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation.

 BODY:
Fifty years ago, Grace Metalious touched a cultural nerve. She published ''Peyton Place,'' about the scandals, betrayals and lusts that lurk beneath the placid surface of a New England small town. ''Peyton Place'' became the best-selling novel in American history up to that time. It inspired a movie, a TV show and, as Leonard Cassuto notes in The Chronicle of Higher Education, the modern soap opera as we know it. 
 When critics write about ''Peyton Place'' today, they tend to see it as a premonition of the glorious achievements of the 1960's. Some describe it as an early revolt against the repressive bourgeois order of 1950's suburbia. But ''Peyton Place'' was set in a rural town without radio, TV or much consumerism -- with farms and outhouses instead of split-levels. This was the sort of supposedly quaint rural community people in the 1950's were trying to get out of in order to flee to the suburbs. 
 Others see ''Peyton Place'' as a precursor to feminism and the baby boomers' invention of the female orgasm, which apparently took place at Woodstock. It's true that much of the action in the novel is initiated by strong women. But Metalious treats their strength and sexuality as obvious features of human society, and clearly rejects the notion that to be a woman is to be a member of a cause or the sisterhood collective. 
 In truth, the first striking fact about the book is that in its pages the personal is not political. After the class consciousness of the 1930's, and the national solidarity of the 1940's, Americans in the 1950's were inclined to define problems in moral and psychological terms, not as the products of economic or political forces.
 And a big anxiety of the age was the fear of conformity. This was expressed in books about other-directed personalities, lonely crowds and Organization Men, not to mention all those movies in which James Dean, Gary Cooper or Gregory Peck bravely stood apart from the mob.
 Tasting affluence, worried about the power of advertising, troubled by pervasive racism, Americans fixated on the power of social pressure, and the way individual autonomy could be inhibited by the judgments of the crowd.
 This is what ''Peyton Place'' is about. It's about the fear of being talked about in a small town, and how people act and lie to themselves in order to avoid being the subject of gossip.
 One woman leads a life of frigid respectability because she's afraid that if she loosens up people will discover she is not a widow; the father of her daughter was in fact a married man with whom she was having an affair. Another character fakes war medals to hide his battle fatigue.
 ''Peyton Place'' is what George Orwell called a good bad book because it doesn't just instruct readers to discover their authentic selves so they can be free to be you and me. That bit of naivete wouldn't become popular until the 1970's, a more innocent decade than the 1950's. Metalious reminds readers that some people's authentic selves are truly rotten. The most authentic character in the book rapes his stepdaughter.
 Metalious's core message is not that everybody can be good, but that everybody should engage in the high-risk search for unpleasant truths. She has her favorite character define two kinds of people: ''Those who manufactured and maintained tedious, expensive shells, and those who did not. Those who did, lived in constant terror lest the shells of their own making crack open to display the weakness that was underneath, and those who did not were either crushed or toughened.''
 This message obviously hit home in the 1950's. The biggest change between then and now is that the whole tradition of moral and cultural commentary, so prevalent then, has been swallowed up by politics. Today, it's hard to find writers who define social problems as matters of intellectual rigor -- at least since Christopher Lasch and Allan Bloom died. Now we have our moral arguments by proxy, by debating who is more hateful, Bush or Clinton, or whether Terri Schiavo should live or die. 
 In today's debates the battle lines are more clearly drawn, and since people are organized into factions, there's actually more conformity and complacency than even in the 1950's.
 That's why there remains something bracing and clear-eyed about Grace Metalious, who only wrote soap operas -- and lived them. The success of ''Peyton Place'' busted up her ambitious life and she drank herself to death at age 39.

HEADLINE: Stuck in Traffic? Try Some New Thinking

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Trying to Get There From Here'' (editorial, Aug. 6):
Connecticut has serious traffic management problems that are crippling the economic and cultural vitality of the state. 
 There are many pragmatic ideas available that offer immediate solutions at far less cost than simply adding trains. Expensive mass transit projects help, but they will not resolve the problems. Better measures include new digitally synchronized lights, clear signage, better sight lines, sensible highway on and off ramps, and ''smart'' traffic systems that gauge real-time traffic loads.
 Connecticut remains in the Dark Ages on traffic management. The problems could be alleviated through inter-city cooperation and effective regional planning and execution. Towns are unable to do this on their own. We need courage and strong leadership from the governor, our Congressional representatives and state legislators.

Mark Mersky
Wilton

To the Editor:
 You're right: ''Continuing to rely upon old ways of thinking is an invitation to economic stagnation and commuter frustration.'' I offer some suggestions to solve Connecticut's transportation problems.
 Use parts of the existing Metro-North/Amtrak land for trucks and rail cargo to encourage interdependence and get trucks off Interstate 95. 
 Construct a new overhead light-rail system following I-95 from Boston to New York. Add spurs or bus routes to serve other areas. Build parking lots under I-95 and stations above the highway where there is plenty of space. Adopt the very best light-rail technology to ensure speed, safety and economics.
 Putting commuter trains over I-95 would bring them closer to the users, who now drive to train stations over congested back roads. Light-rail ridership would likely increase as car commuters saw rail cars flying past as they sat in traffic.

HEADLINE: City Gets a Sobering Look At Possible Pension Trouble

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Every year since 1999, New York City has reported that it has all the money it needs to pay for the pensions that have been promised to city workers.
 With the retirement plans said to be financially sound, state politicians have happily showered city employees with generous pension enhancements -- annual cost-of-living increases, holiday bonus payments, early retirement with full benefits -- that are the envy of private-sector workers, whose pension benefits have eroded.
 But a close inspection of city pension records shows that the funds committed to the plans may fall well short of the city's promises to hundreds of thousands of current and retired workers. They look fully funded chiefly because the city has been using an unusual pension calculation that does not comply with accepted government accounting rules. Even the city's chief actuary, who helps produce the annual reports, says the official numbers are ''meaningless'' when it comes to showing the plans' financial health.
 The chief actuary, Robert C. North, has prepared a little-noticed set of alternative calculations showing that the gap in the pension funds could be as wide as $49 billion. That is nearly the size of the city's entire annual budget and the equivalent of the city's publicly disclosed outstanding debt. 
 The existence of a big gap between the city's future obligations and the resources committed to meet them does not mean the pension funds are about to run out of money. But it does mean that New York City is promising its current employees future benefits it might not be able to provide without big tax increases or major budget cuts. When such a reckoning might occur, if at all, is hard to predict.
 Pensions are now one of the city's fastest-growing expenses. In recent years the city's required contributions to its pension funds have more than quadrupled, to $4.7 billion this year from $1.1 billion in 2001. 
 Two years from now, the city expects to spend one out of ten dollars in its budget on pension contributions.
 Senior city officials vehemently dispute the suggestion that their pension funds are weaker than the official numbers claim and point out they are contributing more money to them every year. But a number of outside experts said the city's accounting method was flawed because it provides a misleading portrait of the plans' real condition.
 In New York, public workers' pensions are guaranteed by the State Constitution, so once they are granted, they cannot be reduced, even if they cost more than expected.
 Many economists say government pension accounting routinely understates the cost of benefits promised to state and local workers, because the rules allow the plans to take credit for investment gains not yet achieved. But there is no agreement on whether the rules should be changed and if so, what the new method should be.
 Mr. North said he believed that if there were a uniform standard among cities, the health of New York's plan would be about average.
 Mr. North, the city's chief actuary since 1990, is well regarded in his field and has been a visible participant in the debate over whether actuarial methods have themselves contributed to the weakness of both public and private-sector pension funds. He said that he decided to recalculate the city's five pension funds because the official numbers were so uninformative. 
 ''You're getting no new information,'' he said, even as the value of investments in the funds change.
 He said he came up with the $49 billion gap by using a very conservative method, based on the use of risk-free investments, not stocks, similar to the way life insurance companies calculate the premiums for products that are comparable to pensions. 
 Mr. North acknowledged that other governments did not use this method and other analysts might call for a less stringent approach, which would make the shortfall look smaller. But aside from that broader debate over how to credit investment gains, experts who looked at the city's official pension reports also said the reassuring numbers shown there were incorrect. 
 ''It makes me shudder,'' said Penny Wardlow, a government accounting specialist who served as a consultant to the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, an independent body of experts, when it drafted its pension rules in 1994.
 She said New York City's unusual way of reporting its pension values did not comply with the rules, because it artificially pegged each plan's shortfall at zero, or close to it. This could easily mislead public officials into thinking the pension funds are healthier than they really are, she said.
 New York City adopted the new method with the best of intentions in 1999, during a robust economy, as a tool to encourage officials to put enough money aside to pay for future pensions, even at times when it might appear that the fund had a surplus. 
 But no other large city or state plan uses this method, which is not among the six that accounting rule-makers have authorized for municipalities to rely on when reporting the status of their pension funds. And it has failed at its goal: for the last five years, lawmakers have repeatedly postponed committing the full amount of money necessary to keep up with the rise in benefits.

Differing Views
 Senior New York City officials bristled at the suggestion that their annual reports were flawed and strongly disagreed with any suggestion that the pension plans might be under-funded. 
 ''The city's pension funds are 99.6 percent funded by acceptable methods for evaluating and disclosing pension fund assets and liabilities,'' said Martha Stark, the New York City finance commissioner. ''While there are other methods for determining funded status that are being discussed, those methods are academic at this time.''
 Ms. Stark said that she was sure of the pension funds' health because the city was contributing responsibly to them every year, and because she was confident that the investments in the funds would meet their targets of 8 percent average annual returns over the long haul. Many other public plans have investments targets in this range.
 She said that there were many ways to measure the health of the pension funds, and that while one method may show a large hidden shortfall, another would show that at least one of the plans had a slight surplus. She contended that no one method was better than another for all purposes.
 Asked why the pension funds appeared to be fully funded back in 1999, when they were swollen with gains from the stock market boom, and still appear to be almost fully funded now -- after losing billions of dollars in the stock market and granting billions of dollars worth of new benefits -- she said that the numbers were ''smoothed'' to avoid short-term fluctuations. She also noted that the city had been increasing its annual contributions in recent years.
 The independent governmental accounting board, which sets standards for state and local jurisdictions across the country, is not allowed to comment publicly on New York City's financial statements.
 ''But I can tell you that our standard is very clear on this issue,'' said Gerard Carney, a spokesman for the board, ''and we fully expect it to be followed accurately. Moreover, history has shown that bad things can happen when accounting standards are not accurately followed.''
 Unlike the accounting board for companies, however, the governmental accounting board has no enforcement agency backing it up. A company that breaks an accounting rule may hear from the Securities and Exchange Commission; a government will not. The rules board relies on each local government's outside auditor to police violations.
 New York City's outside auditors defended its unusual accounting approach. 
 Robert Rooney, an audit director at Deloitte & Touche who worked on New York City's audit, said he was not permitted to discuss the details of New York City's financial reports because of confidentiality rules. But in general, he said, it was possible to modify accounting standards without violating them. 
 When Deloitte's auditors see such a modification in a city's financial report, he said, they discuss it with the city's officials to make sure they understand it. If the modification is not material or misleading, he said, then the city can use it and still get a clean audit. 
 New York City's comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who has ultimate responsibility for the city's financial statements, said through his spokeswoman that he believed New York was compliant with the accounting rules. He also said that pension calculations were ''the subject of much debate.'' 
 ''We will continue to work with the boards of our pension funds and the actuary to assess the funded status of the plans, while ensuring that we remain in compliance with mandated standards,'' Mr. Thompson said.
 Although the city pays the bills for its workers' pensions, all increases in public employees' pensions must be enacted by the State Legislature and approved by Governor George E. Pataki. And the reports by New York City that it has sound pension plans have been cited again and again in Albany in the last few years, as lawmakers have granted billions of dollars worth of new benefits, often over the city's objections. 
 These new benefits were doled out on the understanding that the nation's seventh-largest pension system, counting both public and private plans, posed no threat to future generations of New Yorkers who must foot the bill.

Stuck With the Bill
 On their face, New York City's pensions do not look particularly extravagant. As an example, a teacher retiring at age 55, after 30 years of service, could expect to receive a pension of about $51,000 a year today. The New York City police, who are compensated extra for the risks they face on the job, can retire after 20 years, at any age, with pensions of about $53,000 a year.
 But compared with that of other workers -- particularly in the private sector, where large companies have been freezing their pension plans and offering workers leaner benefits -- the pensions are already relatively generous and becoming more so.
 In recent years, for example, city retirees were given annual cost-of-living increases in their pensions, a benefit virtually unheard of in the private sector. And the pension fund contributions that many workers had been required to make in the past were eliminated. 
 The state also added more jobs -- most recently auto mechanics -- to its list of ''physically taxing'' positions that entitle employees to retirement at age 50, or after they have served 25 years on the job, with full benefits.
 In addition to the pensions, New York City has promised to pay for its retirees' health care. The total cost of those obligations has not been tallied or reported yet, but Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has estimated it at about $50 billion in today's dollars. (New York and other cities are adding up such obligations in response to a new accounting requirement.)
 So, with the health care and the potential pension shortfall, New York City could have as much as $100 billion in long-term obligations that it has never formally reported.
 Mr. Bloomberg did not comment for this article, but in the past he has repeatedly expressed concern about Albany's habit of unilaterally enacting new benefits that the city must pay for. ''The question is, can the city residents pay for it?'' he asked last week after the state promised more benefits to city employees, including some workers suffering health problems from 9/11.
 While the city would like to do more for its workers, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''if we pay for this, that will be some library that won't be able to stay open an extra day. It'll be some firehouse that we won't be able to keep open. It'll be some other project that everybody in this city wants. It'll be the level of taxation, which is going to have to go up. Somebody's got to pay for all of these things.'' 
 New York City is not the only place where pension obligations may be far larger than reported. But comparisons are difficult. State and local government pension plans do not have to report their numbers according to any single actuarial methodology, as company plans do.
 Government pension plans also have much greater latitude to fiddle with such critical assumptions as how long they expect their workers to live after retirement. And because they are not monitored by a federal guarantor or outside investors, they have not received the kind of scrutiny corporations have. 
 The magnitude of the potential discrepancy in New York City alone, which has often been held out as an exemplar in funding its pensions, suggests how poorly understood the looming public pension debt may be nationwide. New York State's pension fund uses another reporting method, but it also tends to make the plan look fully funded at all times. 
 Uncertainty about the city's pension numbers has attracted the New York State Insurance Department's attention, which has regulatory authority over public pension plans. The department has been auditing the city's pension plans and asking pointed questions about their financial health. 
 City officials who have been interviewed by the state regulators said they seemed interested in Mr. North's alternative method and asked whether the other public plans in New York State should be using it as well. A spokesman for the insurance department declined to discuss the audits.
 Mr. North said New York City took on its unusual calculation for the purpose of determining the city's annual pension contribution, not as a financial status report. 
 But it does not show the volatility of the city's pension fund investments or the long-term soundness of the plans. Some of the other six approved models do, to some degree. 
 Other actuaries confirmed that the method was sound when used to speed up the financing of pensions. But they agreed with Mr. North that it gives a misleading picture of whether a plan is healthy or not.

Lost in the Fine Print
 In 2003, when the pension funds were under severe financial strain -- and their annual reports were still showing perfect health -- Mr. North decided to start providing his alternative numbers.
 He said he had wanted to publish them prominently, in the front of the plans' annual reports, but the city's outside auditors stopped him, because the accounting board had not approved the method he wanted to use. So the numbers ended up in the fine print, where few have noticed them.
 Instead of basing his calculations on the investment returns the pension fund might earn in the future, Mr. North used very conservative investment returns -- the type of returns now being paid by risk-free investments, such as Treasury bonds. He said he thought this was appropriate because the benefits are themselves risk-free, being guaranteed by the state constitution.
 More analysts are beginning to question the rule that allows governments to base their pension values on anticipated investment returns. Doing so risks seriously understating the pensions' costs, they say.
 ''This is a really, really serious problem,'' said Andrew L. Turner, a former managing director at the Frank Russell Company, a pension consulting concern in Tacoma, Wash. ''The taxpayers think they're paying a lot less than what they're ultimately going to pay.''
 But other specialists say Mr. North's risk-free method is inappropriate for governments. Ms. Stark, the city's finance commissioner, said it resembled the way corporations measure their pension plans in special circumstances, like a bankruptcy or during a merger. She said there was no reason to measure the city's pensions that way, because it was not going to go bankrupt. 
 The debate may sound arcane, but officials bring great passion to it because the amounts of money at stake are vast, and no one wants to make a mistake. Mr. Turner resigned from Frank Russell last year because of his growing conviction that the industry was habitually understating pension costs. He is now dean of the business school at Pacific Lutheran University.
 ''We're doing this as a public trust,'' he said, ''and yet the weird way we're doing it is, we're going to end up breaching everybody's trust.''
 The new benefits New York City has added since 1999 have been politically popular. But they have also been very expensive. Even though they look modest on an individual basis, their cost adds up quickly because they have to be paid to many people who will be retired for many years.
 The cost-of-living adjustment increased individual pensions by no more than $540 in the first year, for example. But it increased the city's total pension obligations by an estimated $8.4 billion. 
 Even though the city's contributions have risen greatly, New York has not been putting in the full amount necessary to keep up with the cost of the new benefits. 
 In 2000, when the cost-of-living adjustment was enacted, the Giuliani administration successfully lobbied Albany for permission to phase in the cost over five years. Then, in 2002, when the city was reeling from the stock market decline and the Sept. 11 attack, the Bloomberg administration won permission to stretch out the payment schedule even more, to 10 years. That saved the city more than $200 million at a time when it was raising taxes, closing firehouses, and laying off workers to balance its budget. 
 This year, with its finances improving, New York City has persuaded the State Legislature to pass a bill eliminating the 10-year phase-in. That means the city will once again be keeping up with the contribution schedule that Mr. North has devised. But New York will still have to pay extra to catch up for the contributions it delayed.
 Meanwhile, in Albany, representatives of the city's labor unions are acting as if nothing has happened -- and on paper, nothing did. There, the pension funds still look fully funded. Just this year, the Legislature passed dozens of bills to sweeten pensions for subway cashiers, school lunch helpers, crossing guards, locksmiths and others.
 Governor Pataki vetoed most of the bills. But last week he signed one into law, over the city's objection, that the city claims will cost $5 million to $10 million a year.

This is the second article in a series examining actions of state and local governments that have left taxpayers with large unpaid bills for public employee pensions. The series focuses on ways in which pension funds have been shortchanged by government officials even as they have sought to enhance benefits for groups of politically influential workers.

HEADLINE: The Rise of Shrinking-Vacation Syndrome

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Aug. 19 

 BODY:
In August, when much of the world is hard at work trying to do nothing, Jeff Hopkins and his wife, Denise, usually take a week to chase fish in Olympic National Park -- a ferry ride and two tanks of gas from here with a boat in tow. But this year, their summer vacation is dead, a victim of $3-a-gallon gas and job uncertainty. 
 ''This is our vacation,'' said Mr. Hopkins, loading up his drift boat for an evening of fishing in the city just after getting off work at the Boeing plant, where he has been employed for 15 years. 
 Even before toothpaste could clog an airport security line and a full tank of gas was considered an indulgence, Americans had begun to sour on the traditional summer vacation. But this summer, a number of surveys show that American workers, who already take fewer vacations than people in nearly all industrial nations, have pruned back their leisure days even more. 
 The Conference Board, a private research group, found that at the start of the summer, 40 percent of consumers had no plans to take a vacation over the next six months -- the lowest percentage recorded by the group in 28 years. A survey by the Gallup Organization in May based on telephone interviews with a national sample of 1,003 adults found that 43 percent of respondents had no summer vacation plans.
 About 25 percent of American workers in the private sector do not get any paid vacation time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. Another 33 percent will take only a seven-day vacation, including a weekend.
 ''The idea of somebody going away for two weeks is really becoming a thing of the past,'' said Mike Pina, a spokesman for AAA, which has nearly 50 million members in North America. ''It's kind of sad, really, that people can't seem to leave their jobs anymore.''
 Shrinking-vacation syndrome has gotten so bad that at least one major American company, the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, has taken to shutting down its entire national operation twice a year to ensure that people stop working -- for about 10 days over Christmas, and 5 days or so around the Fourth of July. 
 ''We aren't doing this to push people out the door,'' said Barbara Kraft, a partner at the firm in the human resources office. ''But we wanted to create an environment where people could walk away and not worry about missing a meeting, a conference call or 300 e-mails.''
 The company tracks vacation time so that when employees fall behind, they are reminded through an electronic nag that they should be getting out of the office more. And posters evoking lazy days away from work were put up in the New York offices. Hint. Hint.
 The heightened pace of American life, aided by ever-chattering electronic pocket companions, gets much of the blame for the inability of many people to take extended periods of forced sloth.
 ''I thought I would take at least five days off and go somewhere, but I couldn't find the time,'' said Tina Yang, who teaches first grade at Fruit Ridge Elementary School in Sacramento. She has the summers off, but her days are filled with catch-up work, conferences and projects, she said.
 ''I realize I just go to work and then home, work and then home -- it's no way to live,'' Ms. Yang said. 
 The Travel Industry Association, the largest trade group representing the industry, found that the average American expects his or her longest summer trip to last only six nights. And it takes three days just to begin to unwind, experts say. 
 Company leaders at PricewaterhouseCoopers said they started their nationwide shutdown because people were not getting their batteries recharged. Now that the entire work force of about 29,000 takes a vacation, company officials say they are seeing positive results. 
 ''It has taught our people what it is like to have unencumbered time,'' Ms. Kraft said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the decline of the traditional summer vacation misstated a finding by the Conference Board, a private research group, on Americans' vacation plans. At the start of the summer, the board found that 60 percent of consumers -- not 40 percent -- had no plans to take a vacation over the next six months. Forty percent planned to take a vacation, the lowest percentage in 28 years.

HEADLINE: In Rural Oregon, These Are the Times That Try Working People's Hopes

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: OAKRIDGE, Ore. 

 BODY:
For a few decades, this little town on the western slope of the Cascades hopped with blue-collar prosperity, its residents cutting fat Douglas fir trees and processing them at two local mills. 
 Into the 1980's, people joked that poverty meant you didn't have an RV or a boat. A high school degree was not necessary to earn a living through logging or mill work, with wages roughly equal to $20 or $30 an hour in today's terms.
But by 1990 the last mill had closed, a result of shifting markets and a dwindling supply of logs because of depletion and tighter environmental rules. Oakridge was wrenched through the rural version of deindustrialization, sending its population of 4,000 reeling in ways that are still playing out.
 Residents now live with lowered expectations, and a share of them have felt the sharp pinch of rural poverty. The town is an acute example of a national trend, the widening gap in pay between workers in urban areas and those in rural locales, where much of any job growth has been in low-end retailing and services. 
 Most parents here, said Shelley Miller, who heads the family resource center at the public schools, are ''juggling paycheck to paycheck.'' 
 Ms. Miller included herself. She makes $20,000 a year, and when she and her 16-year-old daughter make the hourlong drive to Eugene, she said, ''It's a treat.'' They go to Subway for dinner, then to Wal-Mart to shop at far lower prices than they could at Oakridge's single supermarket.
 Expressed in 2005 dollars, the average pay for a full-time worker in rural Oregon fell to $27,600 in 2005 from $34,200 in 1976. Over the same period, average pay in urban counties in Oregon climbed to $37,800, putting the rural-urban gap at $10,200 and rising, according to the Oregon Employment Department.
 About 700 Oakridge residents, from a population of about 4,500 in Oakridge and the surrounding area, visit a charity food pantry each month to pick up boxes of groceries worth $100 apiece. Two-thirds of public school students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, meaning their families are near the poverty line or below it. About 260 of the town's 1,200 housing units are single-width trailers.
 ''Every fall we discover that a few families have lost it over the summer and are camping out in the woods,'' Ms. Miller said. ''So we help them find some kind of housing in town.'' 
 Above the fog line and below the snow line, with herds of elk in the surrounding hills, the town offers a peaceful beauty, and residents say it is a perfect place to live, except for the lack of jobs. 
 Today, a latte-serving cafe caters to mountain bikers and travelers on their way to a ski slope or parts farther west. A few new fast-food outlets are interspersed with graying motels and empty storefronts. Former workers fondly recall how the town's 10 bars were mobbed every payday; now, a few old-timers gather in one of three tired bars and a dingy Moose Lodge, needing little prompting to carp about the Forest Service and environmentalists. 
 Oakridge has struggled to find a new economic base. On the edge of town, where the old Pope and Talbot mill burned down in 1991, an industrial park was created, but it is covered largely with weeds. 
 The town has authorized water and sewer services for up to 200 prime home sites in the hills above, and it hopes to attract retirees and commuters from the Eugene area, said Don Hampton, a City Council member. 
 Along with a growing trade in outdoor recreation, becoming a distant bedroom and retirement community may be the town's best hope, bringing tax revenue and service jobs, though it is not clear how much opportunity this will offer ambitious young people. 
 ''There's no substitute for having a payroll,'' said Dan Rehwalt, 77, who worked for decades as a machinist with lumber mills and the railroad.
 When the logging and mill jobs dried up, many of the more enterprising families left. Some fathers commuted for nine months at a time to log in Alaska. Others found jobs an hour or two away in Eugene and other towns, but almost always at lower wages.
 Karen Kephart, 63, who has five great-grandchildren, was one of the first women to work alongside men at the giant Pope and Talbot mill. When she was laid off in 1989, she was running a saw for $13 an hour, equal to $21 in 2005 dollars. Her husband tried other mill work in the region, then retired. To make ends meet, Mrs. Kephart turned to caring for the elderly in Eugene, sometimes for $7 an hour. 
 ''We had to use our savings to live on,'' Mrs. Kephart said in the trailer park that she and her husband moved into after selling their house on the hill, and where they get by on Social Security and modest pensions. ''It changed our retirement considerably.'' 
 Their daughter Tami Parrish, 44, the second oldest of five children, remembers having ''to scrimp and save everything we had'' after the mills closed. 
 Ms. Parrish and her two sisters live in the same trailer park as their parents. She too has worked as a caregiver in Eugene, in a home for Alzheimer's patients. She grossed $1,900 a month, but she recently had surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome and is not working. 
 Crowding into her trailer are her husband, an unemployed cook; her 22-year-old daughter, who just started a waitress job making Oregon's $7.50 minimum wage, and tips; and the daughter's baby boy, who receives medical care under a federal medical program for poor infants. 
 The two Kephart sons have fared better: one, after leaving the mills, was hired as a railroad conductor, rose to engineer and lives ''uptown'' in Oakridge with his wife and five children. The other works in a fiberglass plant in North Carolina and helps out with money sometimes, Mrs. Kephart said. 
 Dazzle Deal, 26, with tattooed arms and a pink pony tail, has three children, ages 7, 5 and 3. She is part of a more recent influx of poor people who moved to Oakridge because it seemed a safe place to raise kids on little money. 
 Ms. Deal moved from Las Vegas four years ago, paying $3,000 for a dilapidated trailer in the park where the Kepharts live and fixing it up as best she could. 
 For nine months she worked at a charity in Eugene, hitchhiking 55 miles each way because she had no car. Then the charity closed. More recently, she has occasionally found work cleaning motel rooms and braiding hair. 
 ''If I worked at McDonald's or Dairy Queen, it would almost cost me more to pay someone to care for the kids,'' she said. She gets $400 worth of food stamps and is on Medicaid; her main challenge is coming up with $205 each month for lot rental in the trailer park. 
 A swing set outside her trailer attracts other children from the trailer park, and on a recent warm day she took a group of them to wade in the nearby river.
 One family, the Hyltons, live in an RV in the forest and describe themselves as transients, after returning to Oregon from a spell in the Southeast. But it is not clear how and when they might move on.
 Robert Hylton, 42, was living hand to mouth on a river bank with his wife, Shella, 30, and their daughters, ages 1 and 2. Strain showed on the face of Mrs. Hylton as she washed clothes in a tub. 
 The family catches trout to eat three times a week. Mr. Hylton drives, or bikes when there is no gas money, into Oakridge for food baskets and the occasional construction job.
 ''We're trying,'' he said, ''to figure out what to do next.''

HEADLINE: In Huge Merger Of 2 Utilities, 'Quiet Agency' Is in Spotlight

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 18 

 BODY:
In New Jersey, you cannot go anywhere at home without bumping into something that is regulated by a relatively obscure agency called the Board of Public Utilities.
 The five-member board is supposed to make sure your electric, water and natural gas rates are fair, for example, and it monitors the reliability of your telephone service.
But these days, the board has a more visible role. It is on the cusp of making one of the more significant decisions in its 95-year history: whether to approve a $17 billion merger of Exelon, a Chicago-based company, and Public Service Enterprise Group, the parent company of P.S.E.& G., creating the nation's largest utility. 
 The merger, first proposed in late 2004, has been approved by regulators in New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, as well as by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the federal Department of Justice. 
 That leaves the New Jersey board as the only remaining hurdle. 
 On Thursday, the board's staff responded with a counterproposal that was welcomed by investors but criticized by consumer groups. Neither Exelon nor Public Service offered an immediate comment. Whether the counterproposal is accepted or modified, the board's commissioners still must act, and that could be weeks away.
 As a result, the attention of Wall Street, consumer groups and New Jersey's governor, Jon S. Corzine, has turned to a group unaccustomed to the spotlight: the Board of Public Utilities itself.
 ''There needs to be serious analysis of the financial terms and conditions for the ratepayers in this state,'' Mr. Corzine said at a news conference shortly before the counterproposal was offered. 
 ''And I don't think it needs to be done on a crash-course basis,'' he continued, ''just because the board of directors of one of the companies decides that Friday on some day in August is the day that they want a decision.'' That was a reference to an ultimatum the companies issued earlier in the month.
 Among the board's considerations are whether the huge new company would end up raising rates and whether it would eventually shrink its work force in New Jersey. 
 And with the price of energy rising, the 3.8 million customers of P.S.E.&G., which has played a major role in the state's business and cultural scene, stand to be affected.
 Until recently, little attention had been paid to the Newark-based state agency, which has long been regarded as influential but has also occasionally been tarred by scandal and accusations of political patronage. 
 ''It was always a quiet agency that had a lot to do with our lives, even though most people are probably like, 'The B.P.U.? Who are those folks?' '' said Victor De Luca, a board member of New Jersey Citizen Action, who has worked on utility issues for years.
 Gov. Woodrow Wilson created the board in 1911, primarily to oversee railroads and other utilities, and since then it has sent two of its presidents on to the governor's office: Brendan T. Byrne and Christie Whitman. 
 Louisiana is the only other state in which a member of its utility commission has made that leap, with Huey Long and the current governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, according to Robert L. Schain, president of Regulatory Research Associates, an independent energy research company in Jersey City.
 Nevertheless, for many years, the New Jersey board was viewed as a sinecure for well-connected politicians nearing the end of their careers and looking for a prestigious full-time job to boost their salaries -- now $141,000 a year for the president, and $125,000 for commissioners -- and qualify for a higher pension. 
 Moreover, the board was often criticized for being too cozy with the utility companies it regulated.
 The current commissioners, too, have deep political roots. 
 The president, Jeanne M. Fox, is a former top official with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, and the wife of Steve DeMicco, a Democratic strategist who managed Mr. Corzine's campaign last year and is now managing that of Senator Robert Menendez.
 The other Democrats on the board are Frederick F. Butler, a former executive director of the Assembly Democrats, and Joseph L. Fiordaliso, a deputy chief of staff under Gov. Richard J. Codey.
 The Republicans include Connie O. Hughes, who served as the chief of management and policy for Donald DiFrancesco when he was the acting governor, and Christine V. Bator, a commissioner of the state's Highway Authority under Mrs. Whitman.
 This summer, Republican legislators demanded that the board be investigated for its handling of two bank accounts, with a total balance of about $80 million, that the legislators say were established without permission from the state's Treasury Department. 
 Yet the board has also been praised, with environmentalists -- often the bane of such government agencies -- saying it has promoted energy conservation and clean energy initiatives, said Jeff Tittel, the New Jersey executive director of the Sierra Club.
 In the matter of the merger, Exelon officials and many analysts on Wall Street say the combined utility would operate more efficiently than P.S.E.&G. does, especially in generation of nuclear power. Exelon currently runs 10 nuclear power plants in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois. 
 According to a pamphlet published in May by the two companies, as a result of the merger, rates will go down by 5 percent -- ''a savings in wholesale electric consumer costs of $397 million to $1.3 billion over the course of 10 years.'' 
 In an interview last month with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mr. Corzine said that he supported the merger, mainly because of concerns about a company like P.S.E.&G. -- with a ''weak balance sheet'' -- controlling nuclear power plants. 
 Underscoring his interest, he has assigned Gary D. Rose, the director of the governor's Office of Economic Growth, to participate in the proceedings. 
 Yet Mr. Corzine was quick to acknowledge in the interview, ''I'm out of sync with my administration on this one,'' and he noted that the public advocate, Ronald K. Chen, whom he appointed, has been a consistent critic of the merger.
 To those opposed to the merger, which would create a company with 28,000 employees and approximately $79 billion in assets, the arrangement would suffocate competition and lead to a monthly electricity rate increase of about $45. 
 Critics also have expressed the fear that Exelon would eventually press to cut costs, leading to potential safety problems.
 On Aug. 2, the two companies made what they called their ''last and best offer'' and gave the board 48 hours to say yes or no. 
 But the board's commissioners refused to act based on what critics said was a classic corporate bluff.
 ''To me, this is not bargaining in good faith,'' Mr. Fiordaliso said on Aug. 4 at a special meeting of the board. ''This commissioner will not tolerate this type of behavior.''
 Then on Thursday, board staff responded: the new company should offer New Jersey ratepayers a total of $820 million in credits, or $200 million more than the companies' most recent offer; and the companies should be required to sell eight fossil-fuel plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, or two more than the Justice Department had recommended.
 One manager of a hedge fund who has followed the negotiations said that investors were ''reacting positively,'' because it appeared that the two sides were close, and because it appeared that Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, had helped to break the logjam on Thursday by defending the board's scrutiny but also urging it to ''bring this to conclusion.'' 
 Public Service's stock closed at 71.31 on Friday, up from 67.99 a week before, and Exelon 59.85, up from 57.91.
 But Suzanne Leta of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group said the board was giving away too much. 
 ''It's very disappointing to see the board backtrack on the past two years of really quality work,'' Ms. Leta said. ''It's really important and urgent that the governor's office and the B.P.U. commissioners stick to the facts of this case.''


CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Aug. 20 about the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, which is deciding whether to approve a merger that would create the country's largest utility, attributed a distinction to New Jersey erroneously. It is not in fact the only state besides Louisiana in which a member of the state utility commission has gone on to the governor's office. (At least four other states -- Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama and New Hampshire -- have elected governors who previously served on state utility boards.)

HEADLINE: An Army of Some 

BYLINE: By Michael R. Gordon. 
Michael R. Gordon is chief military correspondent for The New York Times and co-author of ''Cobra II,'' a history of the invasion and occupation of Iraq.

 BODY:
The rules posted on the wall of the Marine base in Barwana concisely summed up the American predicament in Iraq: Be polite, be professional, have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
Barwana was a way station for a joint Iraqi and American convoy as it traveled to a stretch of hard-packed sand overlooking the Euphrates in the Haditha triad, one of the more challenging areas in Anbar, the most dangerous province in Iraq. The convoy's goal was to inspect a company of Iraqi soldiers who had been involved in an American-directed operation to round up insurgents. With Iraq engulfed in bloody turmoil, any prospect of establishing a modicum of order depends heavily on the new Iraqi Army and the small cadre of Americans that is training it. The rules at Barwana hinted at one rationale. For all of the U.S. military's fighting skills, the Iraqi troops are better able to differentiate among the welter of tribes, self-styled militias, religious groupings, myriad insurgent organizations and militant jihadists who populate Iraq. But there are other important rationales as well. With American forces stretched perilously thin, the development of Iraq's armed forces is the best hope for putting more boots on the ground. Fielding an Iraqi military -- along with the parallel effort to build up the Iraqi police -- is also the closest thing the Bush administration has to an exit strategy. 
 Before arriving in Iraq earlier this summer, I got the basic facts from Pentagon briefings. There is, American officials said, to be a 10-division Iraqi force. The effort to raise and train the troops, they stated, is 85 percent complete. Statistics like these convey a sense of measurable progress in a region that otherwise appears to be a caldron of violence. ''The hope of the Americans, the hope of the troops, is that the Iraqis will continue to take over responsibility for the security in their country -- and that over time we'll be able to draw down our forces as conditions permit,'' Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said earlier this month.
 What I saw in more than three weeks in Anbar Province was not reassuring. Dogged efforts were being undercut by a dysfunctional Iraqi bureaucracy in Baghdad. The American advisers were able and extremely dedicated, and the Iraqi troops under their tutelage were making strides toward becoming an independent fighting element. But Iraq's Ministry of Defense has been slow to issue promotions for the new soldiers and to distribute proper pay. A goodly number of the Iraqi soldiers have voted with their feet and gone AWOL -- or left to join the Iraqi police, so they could live close to home.
 In the Haditha triad, Col. Jebbar Abass, a beefy man with a drooping mustache, commanded an Iraqi battalion that started out with about 700 soldiers in the fall of 2005. It was now down to about 400 troops. Since almost a third of his battalion is on leave at any one time, that means that Colonel Abass can field about 270 soldiers on any given day, a useful supplement to the Marine forces in and around Haditha but hardly enough to enable the Americans to draw back.
 Lt. Col. Norman Cooling, commander of the Third Battalion, Third Marine Regiment, which has responsibility for the Haditha area, says that the Iraqi Army has been making important strides in terms of tactical proficiency. ''The problems that have made that the most challenging are problems with leave, pay -- those things that relate to Iraqi government decision-making and execution,'' he told me. ''Because of that the Iraqi Army throughout Al Anbar has attrited.'' Figures provided by American military commanders show that the two Iraqi divisions in Anbar Province are about 5,000 short of their authorized strength, while some 660 soldiers are currently AWOL.
 The Americans have some genuine Iraqi partners in one of Iraq's most hostile regions, and Marine commanders believe that Iraqi troop levels in Anbar have finally bottomed out and may be slowly starting to improve. But what kind of exit strategy is this when Iraqi soldiers in some of Iraq's most contested areas have been leaving faster than the Americans?
 Anbar is a vast region in western Iraq that borders on Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The Sunni-dominated area has been a base of operations for Iraqi insurgents and serves as a transit route for foreign fighters who have come to Iraq to wage jihad against the Americans. According to American statistics, there are more attacks in Anbar on a per capita basis than in any other part of Iraq.
 For all this, Anbar has long been what the military calls an ''economy of force'' operation, which is a polite way of saying that troop requirements elsewhere in Iraq have led American commanders to employ fewer forces in the province than the situation warrants. As a consequence, counterinsurgency operations have taken on the quality of a whack-a-mole arcade game. Every time the Americans have massed force to put out one fire, they have created a vacuum elsewhere that the insurgents have rushed to fill. When the Marines gathered forces to clear Falluja in 2004, they drew troops from the Haditha area, where the insurgents promptly moved in and executed the defenseless local police near the town's soccer field. The Marines returned in strength to Haditha and established several forward bases, including the one at Barwana, but then many of the troops were sent to the far west when commanders decided to clear Al Qaim, near the Syrian border. And the insurgents filtered back to Haditha.
 This lethal game would be more manageable if the insurgency were weakening. Instead, it is stronger than ever. In July, 2,625 I.E.D.'s (improvised explosive devices) were found throughout Iraq, almost double the January number and the highest monthly total to date. (Of these, 1,666 exploded, while 959 were discovered before they detonated.) And by now the entire nation is caught in a vicious circle: terrorist attacks have encouraged the development of Shiite militias, which have carried out assaults against Sunnis, who have in turn provided support for insurgents. The Marines have enough combat power in Anbar to operate where they please but not enough to stop the insurgents from intimidating the population, Marine commanders say.
 Some of the Marine officers I talked with were frank about the need for more American troops. Lt. Col. Ronald Gridley, executive officer with Regimental Combat Team 7, which has responsibility for a major swath of the province, told me during a visit to the unit's headquarters at Al Asad that the regiment has recommended that additional troops be allocated to its section of Anbar. A battalion or two, he said, would help a great deal. ''What we recommend and what we get is going to be two different things,'' Colonel Gridley said. ''In our perfect world, we could use some more infantrymen to be able to patrol the streets and partner with the Iraqi Army.''
 In fact, with concern rising about the sectarian strife in Baghdad, American military commanders are diverting military police officers that had been earmarked for duty in Anbar to the Iraqi capital. An American unit equipped with Stryker armored vehicles has also been shifted to Baghdad. These moves reflect conscious decisions to assume more risk in Anbar -- a province already overflowing with danger -- to try to prevent Baghdad from sliding into civil war.
 Nor are significant numbers of non-American coalition troops available for duty in Anbar. The only international forces I saw there were a small contingent from Azerbaijan manning checkpoints at the massive Haditha dam, where Colonel Cooling's battalion is headquartered, and a collection of extremely diligent Ugandans, who were hired as contractors and were pulling guard duty inside the wire at Camp Falluja.
 That leaves the Iraqi Army, called the I.A. by American troops. To strengthen the coalition's control over Anbar and improve the effort to train the Iraqi military there, the number of Iraqi troops and American forces in the province each need to be increased, Colonel Gridley said. ''From my perspective, if we had full battalions right now of Iraqi Army, we couldn't give them a good-quality partnership,'' he said. ''The security piece of this is the I.A.''
 Officially, the Bush administration's strategy is: Clear, hold and build. But with limited American forces to do any clearing, the war in western Iraq looks much more like hang on and hand over. Hang on against an insurgency that seems to be laying roadside bombs as quickly as they are discovered, and hand over to an Iraqi military that is still a work in progress.
 The project to field a new Iraqi Army was greatly hampered by clumsy political engineering in the months following Saddam Hussein's fall. From the start, American generals realized that they lacked the troop strength to seal the borders and control a country the size of California. They counted heavily on the cooperation of anti-Hussein Iraqi troops to carry out the task. The plan to enlist the support of Iraqi troops to control the country was approved in March 2003 by President Bush himself.
 But the Iraqi Army went AWOL when faced with the rapid American push to Baghdad, and the Bush administration had to make a decision. Senior American military commanders wanted to stick with the basic plan and recall Iraqi troops to duty. Lt. Gen. David McKiernan, the top American general in Iraq at the time, and the C.I.A. station chief in Baghdad began to work toward this end by meeting with current and former Iraqi generals. Those efforts were stopped, however, when L. Paul Bremer III, the senior civilian official in Iraq, issued a decree abolishing the Iraqi Army, a move that was essentially an extension of the Bush administration's de-Baathification campaign. Bremer gave his order after consulting with Rumsfeld, but neither Condoleezza Rice, then Bush's national security adviser, nor Secretary of State Colin Powell was informed in advance.
 Once the Iraqi military had been abolished, a new and very methodical effort to rebuild the armed forces from the ground up was begun. Three Iraqi divisions were to be trained and equipped over two years, an extraordinarily slow pace for a nation that was in chaos. (The new force was to be called the New Iraqi Corps, until American officials learned that N.I.C. sounded like a vulgar profanity in Arabic.) Meanwhile, the security situation got only worse. Most of the Iraqi officers I talked with in Iraq thought that Bremer's decision to disband the military was a mystifying blunder. After the strength of the insurgency became apparent to Washington, the effort to rebuild the Iraqi Army and police was pursued with a new urgency. Today, an American-run organization -- the Multinational Security Transition Command -- is led by Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey. The training effort that was once something of an afterthought is now the Bush administration's final card.
 The new army is fundamentally unlike the Hussein-era force in one important respect. Lt. Col. Owen Lovejoy, an earnest marine with a Florida drawl who led Haditha's Military Transition Team (as the American advisers are known), observed that the I.A. is ''the most volunteer army in the world.'' Not only does it depend entirely on volunteers, but there is also no penalty for going AWOL or dropping out to find another line of work. 
 Colonel Abass is himself a volunteer. To an American eye, he seems a most unlikely soldier. Portly, he greets visitors in his office dressed in camouflage as a television in the corner flickers with Egyptian talk shows or soap operas. The marines need to remind him to wear his body armor, if only as an example to his men. The father of five children, Abass has two wives and is looking for a third. Now 43, he has fought in the Iran-Iraq war, joined in the invasion of Kuwait and fought the marsh Arabs in the south when they rose up against the old regime. Trained as an artilleryman, he is an old-school officer. Although he has spent his life in the army, he does not want his sons to join. Drawing a finger across his neck, he insisted that no photos of his face be taken. The insurgents, he feared, might track him down during a leave and kill him.
 Colonel Lovejoy saw potential in Abass, who commands the Second Battalion of the Second Brigade of the Seventh Iraqi Division. He was open to instruction, especially when it was not presented as a diktat but as a helpful suggestion, often over a long lunch of rice and beans in his office. Abass seemed to care about his soldiers, and he was prepared to serve in Anbar.
 Before Lovejoy and his 12-man training team arrived in February, Abass had a tense relationship with the Marines. The previous Marine team had not been specially selected for this politically delicate mission. Abass says he felt that the old team did not respect his authority, while the Americans thought the battalion would have been better off headed by Major Nouri, the seemingly more approachable executive officer. (Many Iraqi officers are reluctant to be identified, and only his first name was provided.) But several of Lovejoy's marines caught Nouri stuffing dinars in his pockets that had been intended for the jundi, as Iraqi soldiers are called. Nouri was fired from the battalion.
 To improve the Iraqi battalion, each of its companies was assigned to live and work with Marine companies in the Haditha triad. The Iraqis were taught to conduct their own convoys, carry out their patrols and drive Humvees. To ensure that their pay (about $330 a month) is not skimmed by corrupt officers, a Marine captain delivers the money to each company and watches as the soldiers sign receipts indicating that they received the proper amount.
 The American military has a four-tier system for rating the Iraqi military. Level 4 designates a newly formed unit. Level 3 means that the Iraqi unit is capable of participating in counterinsurgency operations if an American unit is in charge. Level 2 indicates that the Iraqis can assume their own battle space and conduct their own operations with the support of an American team of military advisers. Level 1 signifies that they can operate without U.S. support. The Iraqi battalion at Haditha was somewhere between Level 3 and Level 4 when Colonel Lovejoy took over and is now hovering between Level 2 and Level 3. But even at its best, the Iraqi military faces severe constraints. It has no helicopter-assault capability, indeed no air force to speak of. It mostly relies on the Americans for medical care and reconnaissance. And it has had no tradition of entrusting its sergeants and other noncommissioned officers with important responsibilities.
 In the evenings at Haditha, I would sometimes wander over to visit the Iraqi camp. The jundi prayed in a plain wooden mosque. Many of them came from Basra, Nasiriya and the Shiite neighborhoods of Baghdad, reflecting the largely Shiite composition of the military. The line from Iraqi officers is that the differences between Sunni and Shiite are not important in the new national army. But for many of the Shiite jundi, Anbar is a hardship post -- a Wild West region, hostile and far from home.
 Jawad, one of the more valued soldiers and a favorite of the marines, led me to one of the barracks, a humble structure with rows of double-decker metal cots where several jundi complained that they were still receiving training pay even though they had been in the army for months. None of these jundi would allow their names to be used, saying they feared retaliation by Iraq's Ministry of Defense.
 The jundi also complained vociferously that their officers punish them too harshly and cannot be trusted. Colonel Lovejoy has told the jundi that punishment and discipline are matters for the Iraqi military to decide. It was clear, however, that many of the Iraqi soldiers believe that the mere presence of the Americans is a check against corruption and abuses. At one point, Jawad erupted, saying that he would leave the Iraqi Army when the Americans leave Iraq. Colonel Abass, in turn, dismisses the soldiers' complaints with the high-handedness that typifies the Iraqi officer corps; the jundi, he says, are simply lazy and require a firm hand.
 The real test of the Iraqi Army, however, is the life-and-death struggle outside the wire. One scorching July morning, Abass and Lovejoy set out on a joint patrol along a two-lane highway between the towns of Baghdadi and Haqlaniya. The day ended with an Iraqi Humvee being turned into a crumpled and burning piece of metal, three wounded Iraqi soldiers and one ''fallen angel,'' as the Iraqis call their dead. In their enthusiasm, the Iraqis had zoomed up a hillside without first inspecting for I.E.D.'s. Nobody wanted to repeat those mistakes. 
 Before we set out for Barwana the next day, Abass lectured his soldiers about the importance of checking for I.E.D.'s. The drive to the town, however, demonstrated that there was yet room for improvement. To the frustration of the marines, the Iraqis failed to inspect a particularly dangerous section of road. Then they parked their vehicles so close to the bridge they did inspect that they might have been blown up if the span had been rigged with explosives. When we reached the Barwana base, Lovejoy gave Abass a stern talking-to about what the Iraqis had done wrong. Lovejoy then tried to borrow a metal detector so the Iraqi soldiers could better search for explosives on the dirt roads ahead. Technically, the Marines say, the metal detectors are to be provided by the supply chain overseen by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, but the Iraqi logistics system is broken. The marines in Barwana didn't have a spare metal detector. So the Iraqis simply had to do without one.
 A week later the insurgents struck hard. In a coordinated assault, every Marine base in the Haditha triad was attacked by small-arms fire. A 122-millimeter Chinese rocket soared across the Euphrates and exploded 75 yards from Abass's office. Some of the fiercest fighting was at a combat outpost in Baghdadi, which has the only police force in the Haditha triad. Colonel Lovejoy and others present later described to me how a suicide driver in a fuel truck rigged with explosives bore down on the outpost, which was guarded by a squad of Iraqi troops and the marines with whom they were partnered. Cpl. Jeff Globis fired at the driver four times, killing him. But the truck rumbled on. As it crashed through the concrete barrier protecting the outpost, Globis screamed for everybody to run to the back of the structure. The explosion engulfed the outpost in a fireball.
 Sgt. Peter Penree caught on fire and rolled in the dirt to put out the flames. With communications knocked out, he raced to nearby homes and asked to borrow cars to evacuate the wounded. Using their Motorola radios, Iraqi soldiers summoned the Marine Quick Reaction Force. Lieutenant Omar a young Iraqi officer, was trapped under the rubble, his leg crushed by a block of cement.
 In all, 12 Iraqi soldiers and 3 marines were wounded, and an Iraqi interpreter was badly burned. Lieutenant Omar lost his leg below the knee. He was replaced by Lieutenant Qusay, a well-regarded officer who recently worked six months without pay. Colonel Cooling concluded that the attacks were a response to the Marine efforts to recruit a new police force for the rest of the Haditha triad. It was also another example of whack-a-mole. With American troops fighting to reclaim Ramadi, in the eastern part of Anbar, the insurgents seemed to be shifting some of their operations to Haditha. Some of the Iraqis I talked to had an almost fatalistic view on how long such fighting could go on. One Iraqi officer who asked not to be identified said he thought the military struggle for Iraq might go on for 25 years.
 Before leaving Anbar, I stopped at Camp Falluja to see Col. Tom Greenwood and find out whether the pay problems Abass's battalion had experienced were unusual. Colonel Greenwood had been a military aide on the staff of the National Security Council leading up to the war, then commanded a Marine Expeditionary Unit in Baghdad. Now he was finishing a six-month tour as the senior Marine officer responsible for training the Iraqi Army and police in Anbar. It had been a tough day. An American military advisory team near Habbaniya had been blown up by an I.E.D. One marine was dead, two others were seriously wounded and the early reports were that they would lose their legs.
 Greenwood explained that the pay issues in Haditha were quite common. In the Anbar region, about 550 Iraqi soldiers received no pay for June, while another 2,200 were receiving less pay than they were entitled to by rank. During one of his many trips to Baghdad to wrestle with the Iraqi bureaucracy, Greenwood was told that 19 men who were owed back pay had mysteriously vanished from the rolls of trained soldiers -- and the only way they could get back on the payroll was to go through boot camp all over again.
 Logistics was another of Greenwood's worries. American commanders in Baghdad had pushed the Iraqis to take over responsibility for their own logistics, but that led to cases in which Iraqi soldiers had received spoiled meat and rotten vegetables.
 ''What is the priority,'' Greenwood asked aloud, ''teaching Iraqi civilians how to efficiently execute host-nation contracts on behalf of their new government? Or training and supporting the Iraqi Army in their daily fight against insurgents? In a perfect world, you strive to do both. In the imperfect world of Al Anbar, you frequently have to pick one or the other. And if you want to win, you better pick the latter.''
 Each month, Iraqi soldiers are granted about a week's leave to deliver their pay to their families, who may live hundreds of miles away, a tradition that reflects the lack of an effective banking system in Iraq. With all the dangers, hardships and problems in receiving pay, the soldiers do not always come back. Factoring in the generous leaves, the day-to-day strength of the Seventh Iraqi Division, Abass's parent unit and the newest division in the army, is about 35 percent of its authorized strength. The First Iraqi Division, which has the responsibility for parts of Falluja and is deployed near Habbaniya, is at about 50 percent strength.
 When I raised some of these issues in a telephone interview with General Dempsey, who oversees the training effort for all of Iraq, he insisted that the problems had to be put in perspective. The two divisions in Anbar, he said, were deployed in one of the harshest regions and were in the worst shape, though the Fifth Iraqi Division in the difficult Diyala region was also ''challenged'' in terms of troop strength. Most Iraqi divisions, he said, had 85 to 90 percent of the troops they were authorized. When leaves were taken into account, that meant they were at 65 to 70 percent strength. The pay problems at Iraq's Ministry of Defense, he said, were being addressed. They reflected the lack of an automated system but also stemmed from the need to guard against corruption and ensure that Iraqi units in the field did not obtain more pay than they were entitled to by putting phantom soldiers on the rolls.
 The Iraqi government, he insisted, was eager to enlist recruits and would now allow soldiers to sign up for a two-year tour in which at least one year was spent in their home provinces -- a big concern for Sunnis, who are reluctant to serve outside Anbar. As for logistics, he said, it is important that the Iraqis demonstrate that they are in control of their own military by assuming responsibility for sustaining and paying their own soldiers, though measures to ease the strain, like allowing commanders to buy some provisions locally, are under consideration. ''A national reconciliation will encourage young men of all groups to step forward and serve their country,'' Dempsey said. ''This is a shared effort and a shared responsibility and not simply a matter of making logistics and pay better.''
 The day after I visited Colonel Greenwood, I went to a dilapidated soap factory in Falluja where another Marine advisory team was working with an Iraqi battalion. The plant was in the industrial part of town and very austere. Some weight-lifting equipment was stored in a warehouse whose floor was dappled with jagged pools of sunlight. Bullet rounds and mortars had ripped holes in the roof, allowing the burning sun to pour through like some sort of reverse planetarium.
 American commanders consider Falluja to be a success story. After the Marines cleared the city in a violent battle in 2004, seven checkpoints were established to control access to the city, making Falluja Iraq's largest gated community. The city is now bustling with traffic. Crowds of Iraqis fleeing the fighting in Ramadi line up to apply for identification cards so they can stay in Falluja.
 For all that, militants have managed to slip back into the city. The night I arrived, a roadside bomb killed one Iraqi soldier and wounded another during a shift change at an observation post. The Marine advisory team at the soap factory was commanded by Maj. David E. Richardson, a Marine artillery officer who put aside his plans to attend medical school as the 1991 gulf war approached and joined the Marines. He volunteered for this assignment in Iraq and was advising the battalion headed by Col. Abed-el-Mujeed Nasser, a 41-year-old officer who fought in the Iran-Iraq war, participated in the invasion of Kuwait during Saddam Hussein's era, looks older than his years and presides over the battalion with an air of complete authority.
 By reputation, Colonel Mujeed is said to be a decisive and experienced officer, which is all to the good, as his forces are approaching a critical phase. The Iraqi Army is scheduled to assume the entire responsibility for securing Falluja this fall, though a Marine unit will be poised to rush in if there is major trouble. The Iraqi colonel said he needed more troops to carry out the mission but expressed no apprehension about doing so. 
 ''I think they will take it over, struggle with it a bit and then grow into it,'' Major Richardson said. ''That is the best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is they take it over, heavy, heavy violence breaks out and essentially the people don't have any confidence in the army. I don't see that happening because there are some pretty strong battalion commanders, Mujeed being one of them.'' The Iraqi troops ''are brave soldiers,'' Richardson added. ''They can operate. They can shoot. They can communicate, but they can't sustain themselves. That is the next level. From pay to Humvee tires, they've got to be able to sustain themselves.''
 One of Mujeed's bravest performances may have come that day at the soap factory, when Iraq's new defense minister, Abdul Qader Mohammed Jassim; its new interior minister, Jawad al-Bolani; and Gen. George Casey, the senior American commander, arrived for a visit. Pointing to the list of 70 casualties his battalion suffered in an earlier fight for Ramadi, the Iraqi colonel recounted the familiar litany of problems -- the failure to pay soldiers according to their new ranks, the difficulty in getting the Ministry of Defense to approve promotions, the higher pay provided to the local police -- and in this case the failure to provide any salaries at all to 34 recruits who graduated from boot camp in April. Because of combat losses and a dearth of recruits, the battalion had less than half of the 759 troops it was authorized.
 The Iraqi defense minister insisted that he was only now learning of such problems and promised to take corrective action. Later, I asked Mujeed if he thought anything would come of his appeal. ''Sure, he is going to work on it, but he won't get results soon,'' he said. ''It is going to take a while.''

HEADLINE: Slower Growth With Low Inflation Spurs Stocks

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The overall stock market rose every day last week, while a surge in Microsoft shares on Friday propelled the Nasdaq composite index to its best weekly gain in more than three years. 
 A series of government and private reports suggested that economic growth was slowing and that inflation was moderating -- contributing to a bullish mood in the stock market. Government reports on Wednesday indicated that July consumer prices rose at their slowest pace in five months, while homebuilding declined. And on Friday, the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer confidence dropped more than expected.
The Nasdaq jumped on Friday after Microsoft said it had completed only a small fraction of a $20 billion stock buyback last week -- leaving lots of cash for future purchases. Microsoft's shares rose 5.6 percent last week.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 293.44 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 11,381.47. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 35.56 points, or 2.8 percent, to close at 1,302.30. The Nasdaq composite index rose 106.24 points, or 5.2 percent, to close at 2,163.95. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 4.84 percent, from 4.97 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: What Are the Lieberman Foes For?

BYLINE: By Matt Bai. 
Matt Bai, a contributing writer who covers national politics for the magazine, is working on a book about Democratic Party politics.

 BODY:
A few days before Joe Lieberman, who was very nearly vice president of the United States, was effectively vanquished from his party by Ned Lamont, an affable cable executive who once played a minor role in governing the town of Greenwich, Conn., I happened to talk with Jeffrey Bell. A political consultant who is as cordial a man as you will find in Washington, Bell isn't as famous as some of his fellow Republicans, but he owns a storied place in the history of the conservative movement. A young aide to Ronald Reagan during his 1976 insurgency, Bell went on to challenge a sitting Republican senator, Clifford Case of New Jersey, in 1978. He stunned the political world by winning that race. And though he lost handily to the basketball legend Bill Bradley in the general election, just two years later Reagan ascended to the White House. 
If anyone was in a position, then, to assess the significance of the Connecticut rebellion, it was Bell, whose small but noteworthy victory over his party's confused establishment presaged a historic political realignment. ''It's tempting for us to underrate Dailykos and Moveon.org,'' Bell told me, referring to the Web pioneers who launched Lamont's improbable campaign. ''It's easy for us to say these guys are nuts. But the truth is, they're on the rise, and I think they're very impressive.''
There are, in fact, some compelling parallels between this moment in Democratic politics and the one that saw the ideological cleansing of the Republican ranks three decades ago. In ''Reagan's Revolution,'' an inside account of Reagan's failed 1976 campaign, Craig Shirley notes that aides to President Gerald Ford warned that they were ''in real danger of being outorganized by a small number of highly motivated right-wing nuts.'' Those so-called nuts, meanwhile, waged war on the then widely held belief that ''if they were to succeed, Republicans had to be 'pragmatic,' they had to 'broaden the base' and they had to 'compromise.' Otherwise, they would always be in the minority.'' The very same things might be written now, substituting the words ''left'' and ''Democratic'' for ''right'' and ''Republican.'' And like those bygone Republican leaders, establishment Democrats exhibit a surprisingly shallow understanding of the uprising that now threatens to engulf them. 
 In the aftermath of the primary, Democrats settled on the idea that Lieberman fell because of his support for the Iraq war. This was technically true, in the same way that a 95-year-old man might technically be said to die from pneumonia; there were, to say the least, underlying causes. The war was a galvanizing issue, but Lieberman's loss was just the first major victory for a larger grass-roots movement. While that movement is identified with young, online activists, it is populated largely by exasperated and ideologically disappointed baby boomers. These are the liberals who quietly seethed as Bill Clinton worked with Republicans to reform welfare and pass free-trade agreements. After the ''stolen'' election of 2000 and the subsequent loss of House and Senate seats in 2004, these Democrats felt duped. If triangulation wasn't a winning strategy, they asked, why were they ever asked to tolerate it in the first place? The Web gave them a place to share their frustrations, and Howard Dean gave them an icon.
 Iraq has energized these older lapsed liberals; for a generation that got into politics marching against Vietnam, an antiwar movement is comfortable space. But it was the yearning for a more confrontational brand of opposition on all fronts, for something resembling the black-and-white moral choices of the 1960's, that more broadly animated Lamont's insurgency. Connecticut's primary showdown (which now appears to be headed for a sequel in November) marked an emphatic repudiation not just of the war but also of Clinton's ''third way'' governing philosophy -- a philosophy not unlike the Republican ethos of ''compromise'' and ''pragmatism'' that so infuriated Reagan conservatives.
 If history were to repeat itself, this outpouring of new liberal passion would portend trouble for the party's establishment candidates in 2008 (especially one possible candidate whose last name happens to be Clinton). But there is at least one crucial difference between insurgents of the 1970's and today. When Bell ran for the Senate in 1978, he was so obsessed with his plan to slash taxes that he went to the extraordinary length of bringing in Arthur Laffer, the renowned conservative economist, to draw his famous Laffer Curve at a news conference in Trenton. By contrast, Lamont's signature proposal as a primary candidate -- and the only one anyone cared to hear, really -- seemed to be the hard-to-dispute notion that he is not, in fact, Joe Lieberman. He offered platitudes about universal health care and good jobs and about bringing the troops home but nothing that might define him as anything other than what he is: an acceptable alternative.
 Leaders of the Netroots, as the Internet activists have been named, will tell you that big ideas are way overrated in American politics -- that you first have to master the business of getting elected before you can worry about how to govern. (Most powerful Democrats in Washington now believe this too.) But even with legions of outraged conservatives at his back, Reagan would not have taken over his party in 1980 -- let alone the White House -- had he not articulated an affirmative and bold argument against his party's status quo, vowing to devolve the federal government and roll back detente with the Soviets. Passion and fury started the revolution, but it took a leader with larger vision to finish the job.

 How good a job is your party doing at standing up for its traditional positions?

HEADLINE: Keep Pakistan on Our Side

BYLINE: By Richard L. Armitage and Kara L. Bue. 
Richard L. Armitage, deputy secretary of state from 2001 to 2005, and Kara L. Bue, a deputy assistant secretary of state from 2003 to 2005, are international business consultants.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
IN the wake of the foiled terror plot in London involving British Muslims with Pakistani connections, all eyes are again on Pakistan as the breeding ground for terrorists. While the arrests may serve as proof to some that the country cannot be relied on as an ally in our fight against Islamic extremism, we would argue that the recent events should harden our resolve to support it. 
 On Sept. 12, 2001, the United States gave Pakistan a stark choice -- be with us or against us. Understanding the dangers and opportunities of this choice, President Pervez Musharraf chose to stand with America, and since then he has taken tremendous steps to fight Islamic extremists and move Pakistan toward enlightened moderation. 
Pakistan has worked closely with the United States, sharing intelligence and capturing and handing over many terrorists, including top Al Qaeda leaders. It has sent more than 70,000 troops to the Afghan border and conducted successful operations to flush out foreign fighters. Hundreds of Pakistani troops have been killed in these efforts, and thousands injured. 
 Perhaps more important, General Musharraf has shown that he understands the seriousness of dealing with the root causes of extremism, making real efforts to improve economic and educational opportunities. He solved the country's crippling debt crisis and loosened regulations on businesses, paving the way for an economic growth rate rivaling India's. With mixed success, he has worked to free the judiciary from religious control and to loosen the grip of Islamic extremists on madrassas, the prevalent religious academies. 
 Yes, much remains to be accomplished, particularly in terms of democratization. Pakistan must increase efforts toward a lasting peace with India and eliminate the home-grown jihadists who threaten that peace. And, given the exposure of the arms bazaar run by its top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, it must prove itself a reliable partner on technology transfer and nuclear nonproliferation. 
 However, Americans must applaud the counterterrorism steps that have been made so far, which have been taken at great personal risk to General Musharraf, who has faced several assassination attempts.
 As Pakistan has pursued change, so too has the United States in its policy toward the country. In the past, our consideration of Pakistan was tied to that of India, and vice versa. We talked of ''India-Pakistan'' as a sort of two-headed entity. To its credit, the Bush administration has managed to de-hyphenate the relationship. We now attempt to deal with each country on its own terms, for our own reasons. 
 But we feel we are seeing a slide in our efforts with Pakistan. There appears to be far less immediacy than warranted. We are not overlooking the tremendous economic and military support the United States has provided, including the decision this summer to sell 36 F-16 fighter aircraft to its air force. Our concerns rest with what we see as growing frustration over the pace and difficulties of reforms. 
 It is critical that Pakistan not be shortchanged in our engagement in the region. While India is clearly important to us for its strategic and economic promise, the success of Pakistan holds the key to stability in the region and perhaps throughout the Muslim world. Were Pakistan to fail, there would be no hope for Afghanistan, a dimmed future for India and an increased threat of Islamist terrorism globally. 
 As the Sept. 11 Commission correctly pointed out: ''If Musharraf stands for enlightened moderation in a fight for his life and for the life of his country, the United States should be willing to make hard choices too, and make the difficult long-term commitment to the future of Pakistan.'' 
 We believe General Musharraf continues to stand for these principles and deserves our attention and support, no matter how frustrated we become at the pace of political change and the failure to eliminate Taliban fighters on the Afghan border. It was such short-term thinking that almost led to the derailment of the F-16 deal in Congress. 
 Instead of threats, we should increase our senior-level interaction with Pakistan across the board, involving cabinet secretaries beyond those representing the State and Defense Departments and placing a new emphasis on trade issues. 
 We can also take more immediate steps on the ground. For one thing, we could focus our aid on the development of roads, hospitals and electricity plants in rural areas. America's assistance after last year's devastating earthquake was vital; but instead of simply waiting for another one to happen, our military and humanitarian groups could begin programs to help Pakistani officials respond to future disasters on their own. 
 Education is another obvious but underfinanced example. We should persuade the Pakistani government to focus less on the idea of building flagship universities and more on providing basic and vocational education for the masses. We need to sponsor large-scale teacher training programs and help build elementary schools in communities where none exist. 
 With Pakistan's help, Britain and the United States were able to prevent a tragedy last week. We must ensure that such help is always available, and hope that it eventually becomes unnecessary through Pakistan's efforts.

HEADLINE: World Conflicts And the Price of Oil

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman's analysis of the effect of oil prices on Middle Eastern politics (''War on Daddy's Dime,'' column, Aug. 18) is right on the money. Iranian taxpayers are just suckers to subsidize their Middle Eastern client states and political proxies Hamas and Hezbollah. 
This brings up the sore point for the taxpayer in the United States, which has for many years now been running trade and fiscal deficits with the rest of the world, but continues to operate as if it were a center of world financial and economic resources. 
 How much more of a sucker does it make us, to subsidize the government of Iraq, with blood and treasure we can ill afford, in order to protect the Saudis from a 16-year-old attack by Saddam Hussein on Kuwait, at our expense?

Ben Burrows
Elkins Park, Pa., Aug. 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman is right to be obsessed with the price of oil. We should all be so obsessed. 
 Reducing our dependency on and subsequent cost of this product is a triple win: For foreign policy wonks, it lessens the influence and importance to us of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria, all areas that are either unstable, or hostile to America. 
 Environmentalists pick up a chit in the global warming game, while the average consumer need not take out a bank loan to fill up his or her tank.
 If this country can build an atomic bomb from scratch in less than four years, and put a man on the moon in less than 10, then surely a national effort to Mr. Friedman's end is not an impossible task. 
 Where, one wonders, is the will of the people to demand that this get done?

Jack Kay
Framingham, Mass., Aug. 18, 2006

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes correctly that our president says we're ''addicted to oil'' but won't do anything about it. 
 President Bush once said, ''You're either with us or against us in the fight against terror.'' 
 Should we now be telling him, ''If you don't to do something about the high oil prices, then you are against us in the fight against terror''?

HEADLINE: The Truth Puts You In Jail

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The problem with the way the United States government dealt with Abdallah Higazy had nothing to do with the fact that he was investigated as a possible participant in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
 He was caught in a set of circumstances that was highly suspicious, to say the least. It would have been criminal not to have investigated him.
On the morning of the attack, Mr. Higazy, the son of a former Egyptian diplomat, was in his room on the 51st floor of the Millenium Hilton Hotel, which was across the street from the twin towers. He fled the hotel, along with all the other guests, after the attack. But a Hilton security guard said he found an aviation radio, which could be used to communicate with airborne pilots, in the safe in Mr. Higazy's room. 
 When Mr. Higazy returned to the hotel three months later to pick up his belongings, he was arrested by the F.B.I. as a material witness and thrown into solitary confinement. Federal investigators were understandably suspicious, but they had no evidence at all that Mr. Higazy was involved in the terror attack.
 And that's where the government went wrong. In the United States, a free and open society committed to the rule of law, you are not supposed to lock people up -- deprive them of their liberty -- on mere suspicion.
 The government could not link Mr. Higazy to the attack, and yet there he was, trembling in a jail cell, with no reasonable chance of proving that he was innocent.
 This was cruel. It was unusual. And it was a blatant abuse of the material witness statute. People arrested as material witnesses are supposed to be just that -- witnesses -- not criminal suspects. (The witnesses are taken into custody when there is some doubt as to whether their testimony can otherwise be secured.)
 When a person is actually arrested for a crime, the government has certain important obligations, including the obligation to provide a prompt arraignment and to demonstrate that there is probable cause that the suspect had committed the offense.
 Mr. Higazy was held as a material witness while investigators searched for something to pin on him.
 Court records show that eventually Mr. Higazy was coerced into saying that the radio was his by an F.B.I. agent who knew that if he didn't elicit some kind of admission from the suspect, a judge would most likely set him free. Mr. Higazy said the agent made threats regarding his relatives back in Cairo, saying they would be put at the mercy of Egyptian security, which has a reputation for engaging in torture.
 Mr. Higazy's admission was not truthful, but that didn't matter. The feds were happy to finally be able to accuse him of a crime. They charged him with lying to federal agents when he said the radio wasn't his.
 The case against Mr. Higazy fell completely apart when a pilot, an American, walked serendipitously into the Millenium Hilton, looking for the aviation radio he had left behind on Sept. 11. (It also turned out that the security guard had lied.) Mr. Higazy's original story, which he had clung to as long as he felt he could, had been truthful. He was set free.
 It's scary to think about what might have happened to Mr. Higazy if the pilot hadn't shown up to claim his radio. 
 What the government ignored in Mr. Higazy's case and in so many other cases linked to the so-called war on terror, is that when it comes to throwing people in jail, a hunch is not enough. As Jonathan Abady, a lawyer for Mr. Higazy, said:
 ''The criminal justice system recognizes that before you deprive somebody of liberty in any significant way, you have to have some quantum of proof that they committed a crime, and the government didn't have it in this case. What they had was a suspicion.''
 Once we had voodoo economics. Now, in the age of terror, we have voodoo law enforcement. Mr. Higazy's case is far from the most egregious. People have disappeared. People have been sent off to foreign lands to be tortured. People have been condemned to secret dungeons run by the C.I.A. People have been put away at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with no hope of being allowed to prove their innocence.
 For five years now Americans have been chasing ghosts and shadows, and demanding that they confess to terrorizing us. Who's terrorizing whom here?
 We need to ask ourselves: Do we want a just society? Or are we willing to trade that revolutionary idea for a repressive government that gives us nothing more than the illusion of safety?
