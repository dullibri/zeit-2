HEADLINE: From Russia to London, for Stock Listing

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
London will be home to what may be one of the largest initial public offerings ever later this year, when the Russian oil giant Rosneft makes its Western debut on the London Stock Exchange. The Russian government hopes the offering will raise as much as $18 billion, roughly the proceeds of the biggest initial public offering to date, the 1998 debut of NTT DoCoMo.
 The listing of Rosneft, expected in June, is one of the most visible rewards yet for London's financial markets, which have embraced the Russian and central Asian companies buoyed by the boom in energy and commodities. Even amid concerns about the Kremlin's influence on companies and markets, London bankers have been scrambling to increase their ties with Russian companies.
 The Rosneft deal will be led by four banks: ABN Amro, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, J. P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, according to executives involved in the negotiations. Total bankers' fees for listing the company could be more than $200 million. 
 Rosneft is not the only Russian and central Asian company expected to list in London this year. The London Stock Exchange is poised to grab most of the nearly 100 planned listings from Russia in 2006, surpassing the New York Stock Exchange. Listings for companies from Russia, Kazakhstan and China already have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the world's biggest banks in London. 
 But the rash of new money is prompting concerns that London owes its competitive advantage in part to listing requirements that are less stringent than those in the United States. 
 State-controlled Rosneft, in particular, has been a lightning rod for criticism, after the company bought the biggest asset of Yukos at a depressed price last year, as part of the government's attempt to consolidate natural resources and seize power from Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the founder of Yukos. After the London offering, the state will retain control of Rosneft, raising concerns about corporate governance. 
 ''The only shareholder rights observed in Russia are the right of the state -- and would you trust that?'' said Geoffrey Wood, a professor of economics at Cass Business School in London. Recent events like Gazprom's temporary suspension of gas delivery to Ukraine are indicative of the unpredictability of these companies, he said. And even if banks and investors have performed proper due diligence, and have prospectuses that lay out minority shareholder rights, ''there is no safeguard against the rules being changed,'' Professor Wood added. 
 Deloitte & Touche valued Rosneft at $48 billion in November, up from a $26 million estimate by Morgan Stanley earlier last year. The increase in valuation raised some eyebrows.
 "We believe that the Kremlin is fairly desperate to raise a large sum at the Rosneft I.P.O.," analysts from Rye, Man & Gor Securities in Moscow wrote in November. To be sure, investors who buy the Russian and central Asian stocks already listed in London consider them high risk.
 ''We shouldn't forget that in the end, these are risky assets, and everyone should see that,'' said Tom Kirchmaier, a corporate governance expert with the London School of Economics. ''Corporate governance is not about de-risking equity, it is about regulating the market to see what is going on.''
 In 2005, emerging market companies raised more than $13 billion in London, according to Dealogic. They accounted for some of the stock exchange's biggest listings. In New York, primary and secondary listings of emerging market companies raised $15.4 billion in 2005, but the New York Stock Exchange stands to lag London this year. 
 The New York exchange noted that many of the companies listing in London did not meet its listing standards. ''We can't compete for them, though we do wish them well,'' said Noreen M. Culhane, an executive vice president of the exchange.
 Besides Rosneft, the Kazakhstan state oil concern KazMunaiGaz and the Russian steel company EvrazHolding also are expected to have sizable initial offerings this year. It is not just energy and commodities companies: consumer products businesses are joining the rush as well. 
 ''One of the frustrations of international investors in Russia is that 80 percent of the market cap of the Russian stock exchange is energy and natural resource stocks,'' said Paul Raphael, head of Credit Suisse First Boston's European equity capital markets group. ''People are desperate to put money to work in Russia that gives them exposure to higher Russian growth, and to the Russian consumer.'' 
 Many advisers cite United States regulation as the reason that London is getting the edge over New York. 
 ''There is a perception that it is easier to do an I.P.O. in London, without compromising on standards of quality and investor protection,'' said Simon F. T. Cox, a partner with the law firm Norton Rose in London. 
 Worries about shareholder litigation in the United States and London's role as a welcoming second home for Russians also are cited as reasons for the attraction of a listing on the London markets. The city already hums with Russian money -- wealthy Russians have bought up some of its most expensive real estate and its leading soccer team, and its high-end boutiques are now staffed with Russian-speaking employees.
 In addition, the London exchange has engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign to attract companies in Asia, Russia and Eastern Europe. The exchange has employees from 14 countries who speak 17 languages, said Tracey Pierce, head of company services at the London exchange and the executive responsible for attracting foreign listings. Although Russia may represent the biggest entrants this year, the London Stock Exchange has hardly limited itself to that region. 
 ''We're seeing wider opportunities across Asia, in South Korea in particular,'' she said.
 Most of the foreign companies listing in London, including Rosneft, plan to trade global depository receipts, roughly the equivalent of American depository receipts. Yet while A.D.R.'s require a company to adhere to United States accounting standards, companies with G.D.R.'s in London can use their local accounting standards, and do not need to file quarterly statements. (Rosneft, however, already files according to United States accounting standards.)
 ''The G.D.R.'s are basically cowboyland -- you can get away with whatever you want,'' said one London-based banker who has worked on a number of emerging market issues in the last 12 months and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared for his job. 
 Investors contend that they do not make a big distinction between foreign companies listed in the United States and those listed in London. ''We're extremely comfortable with the London listings,'' said Allan Conway, head of global emerging market equities at Schroders in London. ''We have no problem with a G.D.R. rather than an A.D.R.,'' he said, adding ''from a quality-of-investment point of view, there is no distinction between the two.''

HEADLINE: Stanley H. Biber, 82, Surgeon Among First to Do Sex Changes 

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Stanley H. Biber, a small-town Colorado doctor who for decades was internationally renowned as the dean of sex-change surgery, died on Monday at a hospital in Pueblo. He was 82 and lived in Hoehne, Colo.
 The cause was complications of pneumonia, said his secretary, Marie Pacino.
A former Army surgeon, Dr. Biber (pronounced BYE-ber) was among the first doctors in the United States to perform sex changes and for years was one of only a handful to offer them. He became one of the country's most prolific providers of the operation, which, it was estimated, he performed more than 4,000 times beginning in 1969.
 By now, about 30,000 Americans have undergone sex-change surgery, according to the International Foundation for Gender Education, an advocacy group in Waltham, Mass. 
 During the 1970's, 80's and early 90's, Trinidad, Colo., where Dr. Biber practiced, was an unlikely mecca for men and women who sought to change their sex. Featured frequently on television and in newspapers, the doctor's work earned the town (current population 9,078) a reputation as ''the sex-change capital of the world.''
 If some local residents bristled at the title, many others embraced Dr. Biber and his work. Few disputed its quality. Some expressed pride in the service he performed. And no one doubted the economic benefit to Trinidad, which was a down-at-the-heels former coal-mining town when the doctor moved there in the mid-1950's.
 ''It's a boon to business here,'' Dr. Biber told The New York Times in 1998. ''They come with families, they stay in the hotels, they eat in the restaurants, they buy at the florists.''
 Once a rabbinical student, Dr. Biber took to the Old West ethic of Trinidad, near the New Mexico border in southern Colorado. He favored blue jeans, silver belt buckles and pickup trucks. He owned a ranch, was once a county commissioner and to the end of his life rode in cattle drives.
 Throughout his career, he continued his work as a general practitioner, performing tonsillectomies, delivering babies and setting bones, sometimes reading X-rays at his kitchen table when patients called on him at night.
 Stanley Harold Biber was born on May 4, 1923, in Des Moines. After graduating from high school at 16, he enrolled in a yeshiva in Chicago, intending to become a rabbi. He interrupted his studies to work for the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, during World War II. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Iowa, where he earned a medical degree in 1948.
 After a residency in the Panama Canal Zone, Dr. Biber joined the Army, where he was the chief surgeon of a MASH unit in the Korean War. He finished his service at what is now Fort Carson, in Colorado, and in 1954 took a job at a United Mine Workers clinic in Trinidad. He planned to stay a year or two.
 For the next 15 years, Dr. Biber had a typical small-town practice, working at Trinidad's only hospital, Mount San Rafael. In 1969, a friend went to his office. She was a social worker who admired Dr. Biber's skill in repairing the harelips of children she had referred to him. She asked if he would perform an operation on her.
 ''Well, of course,'' Dr. Biber replied. ''What do you want done?''
 ''I'm a transsexual,'' she said.
 ''What's that?'' Dr. Biber asked her. He learned that his friend was a man living as a woman.
 Not even two decades had passed since a G.I. from the Bronx named George Jorgensen became Christine Jorgensen in Denmark, in 1952. Few surgeons in the United States had ever seen a sex-change operation, much less performed one. But Dr. Biber was young and sure of his surgical prowess. In Korea, he had once performed 37 operations in a row before passing out from exhaustion.
 Working from a set of hand-drawn diagrams he obtained from the Johns Hopkins University hospital, he performed the operation. 
 ''It looked like hell,'' he told The Rocky Mountain News in 2004. ''It was terrible. But it functioned, and she was very happy with it because it functioned.''
 Word got around, and soon other transsexuals went to Trinidad. Dr. Biber obliged, but quietly at first, unsure of the reaction by Mount San Rafael. He stored the charts of his sex-change patients in the hospital safe.
 Eventually realizing that he needed the hospital's support, and the town's as well, Dr. Biber gave a series of lectures to local leaders on what is now called gender dysphoria, the feeling that one is trapped in a body of the wrong sex. Though he was sometimes a target of demonstrations by conservative groups over the years, he won over enough people in Trinidad that his work became an accepted part of life there.
 Most of Dr. Biber's patients were men seeking to become women, though he also performed female-to-male sex changes. His patients came from all over the world and from all walks of life. There were three brothers who became three sisters. There were an 84-year-old train engineer, a 250-pound linebacker and an American Indian medicine man, all of whom emerged as women.
 ''Movie stars, judges, mayors -- everything,'' Dr. Biber told Denver Westword, an alternative weekly newspaper, in 1998. ''I had everything except a president of the United States.''
 By the mid-1990's, an increasing number of surgeons in the United States and abroad were providing sex-change operations. In 2003, after his age made malpractice insurance prohibitive, Dr. Biber stopped performing surgery altogether. He maintained a small general practice until his death, taking care, as he told an interviewer, of ''friends who won't sue me.''
 Dr. Biber was divorced several times. He is survived by his wife, Mary Lee, whom he married in February; seven children, Prabhu Nam Kaur Khalsa of San Leandro, Calif.; Robert John, of Lee's Summit, Mo.; Patricia Philyaw, also of Lee's Summit; Debbie Ramsey of Denton, Tex.; David, of Colorado Springs; John, of Trinidad; and Terri Biber of Overland Park, Kan.; seven stepchildren; and 22 grandchildren.
 In the years after his friend sat in his office, Dr. Biber refined sex-change surgery into something of which he was proud, training younger surgeons in the technique. His practice has been taken over by a protegee, Dr. Marci Bowers, who herself made the transition from male to female several years ago.
 "We turn out a real good product,'' Dr. Biber told The Rocky Mountain News in 2004. ''I have one former patient, a man who became a woman and is now married to a gynecologist. Her husband doesn't know.''

HEADLINE: Oil Price Soars Again, and the Market Gives Signs of a Lasting Trend 

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
OIL is on the move again, but that fact is only starting to attract the kind of attention that greeted the move last summer, when the nearby futures price briefly traded over $70 a barrel on concern about the impact of Hurricane Katrina. 
 But this move may be more important, even though the price now is just $68.35, below the summer peak, because it reflects a market that is becoming more worried about the future. 
 The first chart to the right shows the nearby crude oil future, as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It shows the nearby future at all times, with the February contract being the earliest contract available now.
 The next chart paints a different picture. It shows the market forecast for oil prices in December 2007. And that price, currently $69.05, is above where it was last summer and is higher than the current spot price.
 The difference in the behavior stimulated by the summer run-up in prices, and the results of the current one, may yet be significant. That was widely viewed as a temporary event of uncertain duration -- the hurricane recovery -- added to a demand shock that had come from China's growing use of petroleum. Congress passed an energy bill with help for oil companies but little to encourage conservation.
 One reason for the current rise may also be transitory -- fear of what is going to happen in Iran if it does not curtail its nuclear program. The United States and European powers may be headed for punitive measures, and Iran might respond with a withdrawal of oil supply. That the impact is being felt in prices more than a year off shows that there is no confidence the problem will be solved anytime soon.
 ''First the cash market went up, reflecting the reality of a very tight supply-demand situation,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''Then the futures went up, making the case this was an enduring change in energy prices.''
 Now the stock market has come to believe the issue will remain with us for a long time. The third chart shows the Philadelphia index of oil service company stocks -- companies that will benefit if more wells are drilled in more challenging environments -- and it shows that such stocks have been great performers.
 From the end of 2003 through the closing high in spot oil prices on Aug. 30 of last year, the nearby crude oil price more than doubled, climbing 115 percent, while the index of oil service stocks was up 77 percent. That kind of move is hardly worthy of complaint, but the shares were not doing as well as the commodity.
 Since then, the spot crude price is down 2 percent, but the index of oil service stocks has added another 23 percent.
 ''Now you should expect facts on the ground to change as energy production and conservation come to the fore,'' Mr. Barbera said.
 It stands to reason that oil companies will be willing to invest more money in looking for oil, including projects that a year ago might have been deemed uneconomical. And as high prices persist, that should spur efforts to cut energy use by companies and consumers alike.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Wants Companies to Tell All on Executive Pay 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
STOCKS retreated after a steaming start to the year as economic statistics and corporate profit forecasts raised doubts about the economy. But there was plenty of good news, at least for stockholders, especially those who owned shares in Guidant or VNU.

PAY TRANSPARENCY -- With the pay of corporate leaders soaring again -- the average chief executive of a major corporation received $11.8 million last year, or 431 times what the average worker in the United States makes -- the Securities and Exchange Commission voted unanimously to overhaul how companies disclose what they are paying their top managers.
The proposed rules would require public companies to provide a figure for total compensation, including significant perks, stock options and retirement benefits for the chief executive, the chief financial officer and three other top-paid officers, as well as all board members. 
 They also would require companies to disclose the total compensation for as many as three nonexecutive employees who are paid more than the top executives. This could include highly paid television personalities, successful stock or bond traders, or even star athletes.
 The commission said it hoped that fuller disclosure of the total compensation companies give their top managers -- including things like generous defined-benefit pensions protected from bankruptcies, personal use of company cars and jets, and even things like tickets to sports events and fresh flowers at the homes of executives -- would lead corporate boards to rein in packages to avoid public embarrassment or shareholder revolts.
 Professors and others who have studied executive pay were skeptical that additional disclosure would slow the rise of pay to senior executives, and they noted that the new rules would not give a greater voice to shareholders in setting pay packages, as some institutional investors had requested.
 S.E.C. officials said the commission would vote to adopt the new rules in a few months, after details were sorted out. The rules are expected to be in force for the 2007 proxy season.

TUG OF WAR -- A seven-week battle for control of the Guidant Corporation dragged on, with one bidder, the medical devices maker Boston Scientific, enlisting the aid of Abbott Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company, to offer $27 billion for Guidant. That topped a $25 billion offer from Johnson & Johnson.
 At stake is Guidant's business of making implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, devices that would complement the businesses of Boston Scientific or Johnson & Johnson that make stents, devices that prop open clogged arteries. Guidant's devices are so profitable that both bidders are willing to assume the product-recall risks plaguing Guidant.
 Guidant has scheduled a shareholder meeting to vote on a takeover on Jan. 31 at its headquarters in Indianapolis.

PREDATOR OR PREY -- A Who's Who of leading private equity firms offered up to $8.9 billion to buy VNU, the Dutch publishing and market-research company that owns the A. C. Nielsen ratings service, Nielsen Media Research and trade publications, including Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter.
 The bidders -- AlpInvest Partners, the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Permira and Thomas H. Lee Partners -- made their bid after VNU failed in its effort to buy IMS Health, a health care market researcher. The collapse of that deal led to the resignation of its chief executive and exposed VNU as a takeover candidate itself.
 Analysts said more takeovers by private-equity firms were likely soon because they had accumulated billions of dollars in capital from rich people and institutional investors like pension funds looking for better returns than they can get in the stock market.

WHO'S IN FIRST? -- Airlines may still be struggling with high fuel costs, low fares and too many seats to sell, but the two companies that sell the airplanes they fly are doing extraordinarily well. Airbus and Boeing both posted sales records in 2005, the companies said this week.
 Airbus said a burst of orders in December pushed its net orders to 1,055 aircraft last year, nudging past Boeing, which booked 1,002 orders. But Boeing sold more wide-body aircraft -- particularly its long-range fuel-efficient 777 Dreamliner -- which cost more and are usually more profitable, so it had the larger share of the market by value.
 Boeing is scheduled to announce its full-year profits on Feb. 1. The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, which owns 80 percent of Airbus, is scheduled to release its profit figure in March.

800-POUND GORILLA -- Google, which already dominates advertising on the Internet, the fastest-growing market for advertising, agreed to spend as much as $1.24 billion to buy dMarc Broadcasting, in a move that will let Google expand into selling advertising on radio stations.
 Owners of the privately held dMarc, which makes software that marketers use to send advertisements directly to local radio stations, agreed to accept $102 million in cash upfront. They may also qualify for additional payments totaling as much as $1.14 billion over the next three years if the company meets certain performance targets.
 After starting with conventional over-the-air radio, Google plans to extend the system to other forms, including satellite systems and Internet Webcasts. All of these digital formats have potential to reach more tightly focused groups of prospective customers than radio stations do now.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Send Stocks Tumbling

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday in their steepest slide in nearly three years, after crude oil surged past $68 a barrel and several corporate giants reported disappointing earnings. 
 Stocks fell early in the day after Citigroup and General Electric reported quarterly results that fell short of expectations or failed to exceed them. The selling continued after crude oil prices advanced to a four-month high as the standoff over Iran's nuclear program and threats to Nigeria's main oil region raised fears of shortages in supplies.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.96 percent yesterday, erasing its gains for the year. It was the sharpest one-day decline since May 2003. Of the 30 stocks that make up the average, 29 fell -- McDonald's was the lone gainer -- led by Citigroup, which fell 4.7 percent.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.83 percent -- its worst day since September 2003 -- while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.35 percent, the worst since August 2004. 
 Even the highflying shares of Google fell 8.5 percent yesterday, their biggest decline ever, after the company said it would fight federal prosecutors' demands for records on Internet users' search queries.
 For investors, who just two weeks ago were celebrating the Dow's climb above 11,000, there has been a marked shift in mood. The earlier optimism, fed by expectations that profit growth would remain strong as the Federal Reserve put the brakes on interest rate increases, has eroded in recent days. 
 Market leaders like Intel and Yahoo have missed their earnings targets, and the rise in oil prices has revived concerns that higher energy costs could hold down economic growth.
 At the beginning of the year, ''people were more focused on the pluses,'' said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors, a money management firm. ''And all of a sudden we were reminded of some of the minuses today.''
 Crude oil futures rose 1.52 percent yesterday, settling at $68.35 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil has gained 12 percent since Jan. 3, when the Iranian government said it would resume a nuclear research program suspended for 16 months.
 As the standoff between Iran and Western nations drags on, the concern among oil experts is that a diplomatic or military confrontation with a major Middle East oil producer will curb oil supplies at a time when all other producers are pumping at their maximum capacity.
 Unlike 2003, when Saudi Arabia and Kuwait increased their output to make up for the loss in production from Iraq after the American-led invasion, there is now little untapped production capacity left to make up for any loss of Iran's exports, which average 2.4 million barrels a day.
 ''It's a very powerful bull market right now,'' said Thomas Bentz, an oil analyst with BNP Paribas in New York. ''The real concern is whether OPEC can make up for any interruptions in supplies. The problem is that we've lost our security cushion. A potential loss in Iranian oil would be impossible to replace and could send oil to $100.''
 In a sign of how it might use its influential position on oil markets for political ends, Iran indicated yesterday that it would seek an agreement from OPEC to cut the group's production by one million barrels a day starting in April, ostensibly to make up for a slowdown in demand in the second quarter. But analysts said the request was unlikely to be approved by other OPEC members at a time of rising uncertainty over supplies and continuing high prices. 
 Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, told CNBC yesterday that he expected that OPEC would continue to supply the market adequately. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are scheduled to meet in Vienna on Jan. 31 to consider their policy for the first half of the year. 
 Adding to these concerns, violence in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's main oil-producing region, has escalated in recent weeks after attacks by armed militants on major pipelines and oil platforms, forcing oil companies to cut production and evacuate some workers. 
 Royal Dutch Shell has cut its output by 221,000 barrels a day, or nearly 10 percent of Nigeria's total production of 2.4 million barrels, after four oil workers were kidnapped on Jan. 11. Nigeria accounts for 3 percent of global oil production.
 ''Such is the momentum and rigidity in views surrounding the Iranian issue, and such is the intensity of the attacks in Nigeria that we would have to say that we believe the supply threats are credible in both cases,'' Barclays Capital analysts said in a note to investors yesterday. 
 The analysts raised their price forecast for 2006 by $7 a barrel, to $68 a barrel to reflect ''the sensitivity of the oil market to the situation in Iran, the strength of the global economy and demand for oil.'' 
 Oil touched a high of $70.85 a barrel in August when Hurricane Katrina battered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm shut the nation's top oil producing region and briefly led to gasoline lines in some places.
 The worries about oil supplies and the disappointing earnings news have got stock investors jittery, said William Gerlach, a senior portfolio manager at Gartmore Global Investments.
 ''You add all those things together and it creates some uncertainty in a market that has done well for the last couple of weeks,'' he said.
 For the week, the Dow lost 2.67 percent, the S.& P. 500 was down 2.03 percent and the Nasdaq declined 2.99 percent. The Russell 2000 index closed the week down 0.54 percent.
 Yesterday, investors chose to focus on disappointing statements by a few big names. Shares of General Electric fell $1.31, or 3.8 percent -- its biggest one-day drop since March 2003. 
 Citigroup fell $2.25, or 4.7 percent, to $45.69. Shares of other financial companies fell yesterday, including J. P. Morgan Chase, American Express and Goldman Sachs.
 The latest disappointment in technology was Motorola, whose quarterly sales fell short of forecasts. Its shares fell $1.87, or 7.7 percent, to $22.48. 
 Despite those prominent misses, most of the companies that have reported earnings so far, about a fifth of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have either matched or exceeded Wall Street's expectations, according to John Butters, an analyst with Thomson Financial.
 ''When you have some of the big names lower numbers, it sets the mood for everyone,'' he said.

HEADLINE: With a Little Estate Planning, Your House Can Stay in the Family

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN

 BODY:
CAUTION: Reading this article may provoke self-inflicted slaps to the head and utterances of ''Why didn't I do this five years ago?''
 In 1999, Farhad Aghdami, a trust lawyer in Richmond, Va., suggested to Jim and Yolonda Roberts that they put their home in a Qualified Personal Residence Trust to shelter it from looming estate taxes.
Piedmont Lodge, the Robertses' white clapboard house with six portico columns sitting on 53 acres near Keswick, Va., was worth about $1.6 million back then. The trust lets them give the property to their four children for about a third of what it was valued at in 1999. The couple, now 75 years old, can live in the home for the 10-year term of the trust. When the trust expires in three years, the house belongs to the children. 
 Here's where you slap yourself. The home is probably worth close to $4 million now. All of that appreciation was removed from the Roberts estate. ''We are very happy with how it worked out,'' said Mr. Roberts, a retired Exxon executive. ''We love the house and wanted to keep it in the family.'' 
 You keep hearing how your home is your primary financial asset. As home prices have climbed sharply in most areas of the country, many older Americans are finding themselves living in an asset worth $1 million or more. Some also own vacation homes that have increased in value. 
 Add that real estate to stocks, bonds, life insurance and other property and suddenly people who thought they were just average folks could expect to have those assets subject to estate taxes after they die. Congress has set the exemption from estate tax at $2 million, but as Carrie C. Simchuk, a trust and estates lawyer at Perkins & Coie in Seattle, said, ''It doesn't take all that long to get to $2 million.'' 
 That's what makes the QPRT, pronounced ''cue-pert'' by the experts skilled in setting up these tax-reducing vehicles, so attractive these days. During the Clinton administration, Congress made noises about limiting the trusts, but in recent years no legislator has crusaded for their abolition.
 Certainly a lot of people have put aside worrying about estate taxes. After all, Internal Revenue Service statistics show that the federal estate tax was paid by only 1.17 percent of estates of those who died in 2002, the last year with published figures. That could be because few people amass appreciable estates or because so many who did accumulate wealth had hired excellent tax planners. Either way you look at it, it might seem even more irrelevant because Congress has raised the exemption to $3.5 million in 2009 and then removed the estate tax entirely in 2010. 
 The rub, of course, is that the tax relief expires in 2011, which would bring the tax back and scale back the exemption to $1 million if Congress does not act. What Congress will do about estate taxes over the next couple of years is anyone's guess, but tax planners say it is foolhardy for anyone with $2 million in assets to do nothing and hope for the best.
 ''The worst thing you can do is let it paralyze you into inaction,'' said Jim Ellis, a managing director and estate planner at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. 
 The QPRT works best for those people who expect to live another decade or so. The longer the term of the trust, the more beneficial the gift is to the children. A $1 million home in a three-year trust saves about $147,000, according to calculations by Mr. Aghdami, but one stretching 18 years saves almost $850,000. 
 Here's the big catch: The QPRT helps you sidestep the taxman, but you have to outrun death to get the benefit. If the parent dies before the trust expires, the children have to pay the estate tax on what the value of the house was when the parent died. 
 Consider the QPRT a gamble, but a reasonable one. It has to be set up wisely by a tax lawyer who consults actuarial tables after a frank talk with the client about his or her health and family medical history. But should the heirs lose when a parent dies early, said Mr. Aghdami, the tax lawyer with the firm of Williams Mullen, ''they are no worse than if the parent had not set up the trust.'' 
 QPRT make the most sense when interest rates are high. The higher the interest rate, the greater the discount, which, in turn, increases the tax savings. When a home is put into the trust its value is not the current value of the house, but what is called the ''present value'' of the future gift -- a deep discount. For instance, a $1 million home in a 12-year trust is valued at $370,460. The same house in an 18-year trust would be valued as a gift at only $185,400. (Don't worry. This is about the only complicated concept in setting up a QPRT, and fortunately the ''present value'' is determined by Internal Revenue Service formulas.) 
 The government sets those values reasoning that the heirs are not getting the value of the house right then. The money they would have received is worth less in the future, hence the discount. (It's the same concept that makes the cash value option of a lottery ticket's winnings less than the annual payout option.) 
 Of course, that ignores the possibility that the house increases in value. The QPRT makes a lot of sense, as the Robertses can happily attest, when real estate is expected to appreciate. ''Even if it appreciates modestly, you are ahead of the game,'' Mr. Ellis said. In the event that prices drop, a house would have to depreciate a lot -- say by half -- before the trust makes no economic sense. That's unlikely to happen.
 The ideal time for a QPRT, tax planners said, is after one parent dies. The widow or widower inherits the shared property at its stepped-up value, that is, not what the couple paid for it back in their day, but what its current value is. Then it is placed in the trust. 
 Getting the step-up is advantageous because it removes one of the few pitfalls of the QPRT. Normally with QPRT, the heirs get the property at the ''cost basis,'' the price the parents paid for the property. Should the heirs sell it, they may have considerable capital gains. But estate planners point out that because the capital gains tax is only 15 percent and the estate tax is 46 percent, the QPRT, even with a cost-basis property, is still a good deal. 
 If the parent outlives the trust, the parent can continue to live in the house by paying the children fair-market rent. Turning their progeny into their landlords may be disconcerting for some parents. If they can foresee conflicts, maybe it's time to start spending so the last check written bounces or, alternatively, stick the greedy ingrates with the estate tax.
 For everyone else who has what might be described as a loving and trusting relationship with their offspring, the rent-back feature is but one more tax benefit. ''It's all good. They are continuing to transfer wealth downstream,'' Ms. Simchuk said. 
 Dick Kinyon, senior counsel at Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco, suggests another twist. After the QPRT expires, the house is owned by a grantor trust and rent is paid to that trust, so there is no income tax for the children to pay on the rent. 
 The QPRT is most popular as a vehicle to protect a treasured family vacation home. Often, no one in the family wants to sell it, so there is little concern about a capital gains tax. Paying rent for a vacation home is less of an emotional issue. ''The fact that you rent it is a way to pass wealth onto the kids,'' Mr. Kinyon said. 
 A good estate and trusts lawyer will be brimming with ways to make these simple trusts even better by making them more complicated. If a parent wants to hedge against dying before a trust expires, a lawyer can ladder the trusts byputting a third of a home in a 3-year trust, a third in a 7-year trust, and the final third in a 10-year trust.
 Splitting the home into several trusts has another virtue. Split ownership is deemed to reduce the value of the property, sometimes by as much as 30 percent. ''People would have to have a certain tolerance for complexity,'' said Ms. Simchuk, the Seattle lawyer. 
 But over all, she said, ''this is a no-brainer for estate planning; it's free money.''

A Trust With Pros and Cons
 With homes appreciating in value, many older people may have to worry about their heirs facing estate taxes. The solution could be transferring the home to their children via a Qualified Personal Residence Trust. Following are a few pros and cons:

Pros
 It removes the appreciated value of a house from a parent's estate for significant estate tax savings. 
 Parent continues to live in the house during the term of the trust.
 Residences and vacation homes qualify, and a person can protect two homes, sometimes a third. 
 Paying rent to children is yet another way to transfer wealth to them.

Cons
 The cost basis of the house remains the same as it was for the parents, which means higher capital gains tax when it is sold. 
 I
 f the parent dies before the term of the trust ends, the children inherit the house at its current value. 
 Children become their parents' landlord when the trust expires, and children could evict the parents or raise the rent. 
 Setting up such a trust is complicated; you'll need a lawyer.

HEADLINE: The Cufflinks That Went To China

BYLINE: By JOSEPH NOCERA

 BODY:
LAST June, my brother-in-law, Frank E. Williams, took his first trip to Asia. Along with a sales executive who worked for him at Visa Jewelry, Frank traveled to Hong Kong, which is where all the mainland Chinese costume jewelry manufacturers have their showrooms. Frank wanted to see if there was any way he could save his small costume jewelry business in Rhode Island.
 Frank recently turned 70, but he's one of those people who is happiest when he's busy; as his wife, my sister Rosemary, wrote in an e-mail message to our family, ''forced retirement is probably the only way Frank would consider it.'' He's been in the costume jewelry business since 1957, starting as an apprentice on the shop floor and rising over time to become a salesman, merchandiser and designer. He bought his own company in 1978, and named it Visa. 
Although Visa never got bigger than 50 employees and $2.5 million in revenue, it has been profitable for most of the time Frank has owned it. The last five or six years, though, have been rough. ''If we broke even,'' my sister recalled recently, ''we considered ourselves lucky.'' By 2005, the business was steadily losing money. Frank and Rosemary drew down the company's line of credit, and then began using their own credit to keep it going. ''Customers weren't buying, and if they were buying, they were pushing us hard to lower our price,'' my sister said. And there wasn't much doubt about why this was happening. Globalization was taking its toll, as Chinese manufacturers have pretty much taken over the costume jewelry industry. 
 What Frank saw in Hong Kong only drove home the obvious. ''Ten years ago,'' he said, ''Chinese imports were terrible. But in every showroom we visited, we saw a quality product.'' Frank has long specialized in men's jewelry, particularly studs and cufflinks for tuxedos. ''My average pair of cufflinks, taking into account overhead and a 10 percent profit, costs $6.50,'' he said. ''I could get the same pair of cufflinks from China for $2 and change.'' Peter Jernquist, the Visa executive who made the trip with Frank, said, ''There was nothing we could make in the U.S. that couldn't be made far less expensively in China.''
 After returning to Rhode Island, Frank thought he might try to become a distributor of Chinese costume jewelry. But that required additional capital, and he and Rosemary were worried they might be throwing good money after bad. Besides, becoming an importer would still mean letting go most of the company's employees, and a large part of the reason Frank wanted to stay in business was to preserve their jobs. 
 In August, after a long weekend of soul-searching, Frank and Rosemary succumbed to the inevitable, and decided to shut Visa. And Rhode Island lost one of its last remaining costume jewelry manufacturers.
 WHEN I was growing up in Providence, the city was known as the Costume Jewelry Capital of the nation. There were literally hundreds of jewelry factories, not just in Providence, but across the state. Many were tiny, but some had as many as 500 or 600 employees; at its peak, costume jewelry provided jobs for 40,000 to 50,000 people, and many more in satellite industries. In high school, having a summer job in a jewelry factory was practically a rite of passage.
 ''We thought it would be there forever,'' recalled Jack Reed, Rhode Island's Democratic senator. But the industry peaked sometime around 1978, and today, according to Rich Youmans of the Manufacturing Jewelers and Suppliers of America, there probably aren't more than 500 costume jewelry jobs left in the state. What jewelry-making still exists in Rhode Island resides in the higher-margin precious metals.
 High-end jewelry is different from the costume business, though, not least because it is not as cost-sensitive. Costume is fundamentally about two things: design and price. Which is to say, it is exactly the kind of American industry globalization destroys. Over the years, Frank worked hard to control costs, but there was no way he could even come close to Chinese labor costs. As everyone knows, cheap labor is one of China's competitive advantages in the global marketplace.
 As for his design skills, which Frank always thought of as his competitive advantage, globalization rendered them less and less useful. Customers would buy some of his new pieces, and then send them to China to have the designs reproduced. ''Three or four months later,'' Mr. Jernquist said, ''you'd see the same design on a Chinese Web site.'' Senator Reed told me that he tried to help with intellectual property issues, but conceded that it was hard to rouse much interest. ''The loss to the industry is huge, but to the federal government, this is pretty small stuff,'' he said. 
 Indeed, the main reason Frank's company lasted as long as it did was that he made the shrewd decision to stick with men's jewelry, which is a niche business compared with women's jewelry. China wiped out the much larger women's costume jewelry industry first, before turning its attention to the men's side of the business. ''Frank did everything right,'' said Peter M. DiCristofaro, who runs the Providence Jewelry Museum. ''The times were against him.''
 The American economy will not rise or fall on the fate of the costume jewelry business, of course, but it does make you think about the real-world consequences of globalization. There is no question that when Americans can buy cufflinks for $2 instead of $6.50, it's a net plus for consumers. Nor is there any question that globalization is profoundly good for the people of China and India and other emerging economies.
 But does it matter that, in the process, as Senator Reed put it, ''a great source of wages and employment'' is being lost? Frank and Rosemary certainly think so; my sister told me that she worried about whether there would be any manufacturing left in this country if the government didn't step in. ''There have to be some industries in this country that use nonskilled labor,'' said Frank. 
 Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., the president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a leading critic of globalization, worries that the government lacks ''a sense of urgency'' as not only manufacturing jobs but service jobs move overseas. 
 ''The theory has long been that we are going to make up in service jobs what we lose in manufacturing,'' he told me. ''If you look at our own trade figures, you'll see a small and declining surplus in services.'' 
 Most mainstream economists, though, believe that globalization is not something we should fear, even if it does eliminate low-wage industries like costume jewelry. ''People panicked when consumer electronics moved elsewhere,'' said Diana Farrell, the director of the McKinsey Global Institute. But, she said, that move not only gave consumers lower-priced goods, it also spurred innovation here and led, eventually, to better-paying, higher-value jobs. ''The process of globalization,'' she added, ''is wealth-creating for the economy.''
 But she conceded that there were people, and industries, that were inevitably going be left behind. The trick was not to protect the jobs, but to protect the people -- by stressing education and retraining, ''delinking health care from employers,'' and, in general, helping people make the transition from a declining industry to a growing one. No matter how you feel about globalization, you'd have to have a heart of stone to disagree with this sentiment. Which is also, I think, the most discouraging part of this story.
 In the months since Visa went out of business, Frank and Rosemary have worked hard to find new jobs for their workers. They've scoured the help-wanted ads and talked to anybody they could think of who might have a job to offer. They haven't had much luck. My sister told me of one woman who found a job; the wages were lower ''but at least she has health care now.'' Most of the other employees, however, remain out of work.
 For a while, she thought she had found a great way to help them: the Department of Labor's Trade Adjustment Assistance program. In a meeting with the program's Rhode Island representative, she got more and more excited as she heard about the benefits. They included not only job search workshops, but cash to pay for faraway job interviews, tax credits to help cover health insurance premiums, money for school, up to two and a half years of unemployment benefits to someone who was in the process of learning a new skill, and more. 
 Then she came to the line on the application that asked which country's imports were responsible for failure of the business. The Labor Department's agent tried to steer her answer. ''If you mark down China,'' he told her, ''it disqualifies you.''
 She couldn't believe it. Neither could I. But I looked it up on the Labor Department's Web site, and sure enough, it was true. The assistance was available only to workers who could show that they'd been laid off ''as a result of a shift in production to a country that is party to a free trade agreement with the United States'' -- like Nafta. In other words, if you've lost your job because of imports from, say, Canada, you can get the benefits. But if Chinese imports are the culprit, you're out of luck.
 Thanks for nothing.

HEADLINE: Regents Impose Limit on Colleges That Seek Profit

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The New York State Board of Regents has imposed a moratorium on new commercial colleges in the state, in the face of explosive growth in their enrollments and increasing reports of problems. 
 The freeze comes as state education officials, the governor and lawmakers are all examining ways to tighten regulations or financing of this fast-growing sector of higher education, which is consuming more than $100 million in state aid.
 This week, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed that the state withhold financial aid from college students who had not graduated from high school; many of them attend profit-making schools. 
 ''This is a cottage industry that needs to be better regulated, and more attention must be paid to it,'' said Merryl H. Tisch, one of two regents who asked for a deeper examination of the colleges and their oversight. ''The buck stops with us. There have been too many incidents that have come before us not to do something.'' 
 New York is not alone in trying to clamp down. Commercial schools, which often advertise heavily, promising quick career training to poorly educated students, are booming around the country. Increasingly, they are also drawing the attention of federal and state law enforcement officials.
 Corinthian Colleges Inc. disclosed in November that the attorney general in Florida was investigating sales practices at some of its campuses there. Decker College in Kentucky, where William F. Weld, a candidate for governor in New York, was chief executive, went bankrupt in the fall after federal agents raided the campus and the federal government cut off its student aid.
 California recently charged the Brooks Institute of Photography with misleading recruitment practices and made correcting the problems a condition of keeping its license.
 Brooks is contesting the action. ''This whole case is a misguided attempt by an agency that is itself under siege by the California Legislature to justify its existence,'' said Jeff E. Scott, a lawyer representing Brooks, referring to a review of the agency handling the case, the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education. 
 Robyn C. Smith, a deputy attorney general in California, said commercial schools were ''a current focus'' for her office. She said the number of cases it reviewed in the past year had risen.
 ''There are a lot of problems,'' she said.
 New York has also been investigating five commercial colleges and has taken actions against several. 
 ''It is probably very good that the Regents are doing what they are doing,'' said David W. Breneman, the dean of the education school at the University of Virginia and an expert on profit-making higher education. ''In my experience in this arena, the New York Regents are probably the toughest group the proprietaries face in any state.''
 The State Education Department recently ordered the Interboro Institute, based in New York City, to halve the number of new students it enrolls in the coming year. The department acted after finding that the commercial college, one of the fastest-growing in the state, was cheating in certifying student eligibility for aid and was not providing enough academic support for its students.
 The department is also trying to close Taylor Business Institute, also in New York City, saying it has made ''unsatisfactory movement'' to improve academic quality. Donald Kinsella, an Albany lawyer representing Taylor, said it had filed an appeal. 
 Just this week, the New York State comptroller's office released an audit showing that nearly a fifth of the students it had scrutinized at the ASA Institute of Business and Computer Technology in New York City were accepted solely on the basis of their own notarized statements that they had graduated from high schools in other countries but had difficulties getting their records. The auditors found that some of the students who claimed to be high school graduates were not.
 Alex Shchegol, ASA's president, said his school stopped using affidavits after receiving the audit results. ''We are trying very hard to help people to change their lives,'' he said. ''We cannot accept students who will not benefit from instruction.''
 The comptroller's office, which directed the school to repay more than $500,000 in state aid, called on the Education Department to re-evaluate the use of affidavits.
 There are 41 commercial degree-granting colleges in New York and about 400 commercial career schools that do not grant degrees. Many charge tuition of about $9,000, the amount that can be covered by federal and state financial aid grants.
 The flow of public money to such schools is one reason they are drawing scrutiny. A recurring question is whether some schools are enrolling students who have little hope of graduating simply to capture the financial aid. In New York, their students drew $136 million in state tuition assistance grants in 2003-4 -- 17 percent of those grants -- even though they accounted for about 7 percent of the undergraduates.
 State officials said the moratorium on approving new colleges, enacted last week, could last months and lead to tougher regulations, even though New York is already widely considered one of the toughest regulators in the nation. Officials said that six schools have applications pending that would be frozen by the moratorium, but declined to name them. The University of Phoenix, the industry giant, has been trying for years to enter New York.
 Saul B. Cohen, a regent, said he would press to stiffen the regulations on a number of fronts. He wants the schools to raise admissions requirements and use outside testing companies to conduct the testing used for financial aid eligibility. He said he also wanted the state to impose penalties more severe than ''an admonition'' for school practices like changing students' test answers to make them eligible for financial aid.
 ''We should have some type of process to penalize schools that commit egregious sins,'' he said. And he called for forcing commercial schools to seek certification from other accrediting bodies, like the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, rather than from the Regents themselves. ''Our process is not as thorough and tough as Middle States accreditation,'' he said, noting that the best commercial schools have outside accreditation now.
 A critical issue, he said, is that the Education Department does not have the staff and money to carry out the kind of expanded oversight he seeks. 
 The department started trying to monitor the commercial colleges more closely about three years ago, and watches for signals like rapid expansion to flag potential problems. Last summer, it uncovered deceptions at Interboro when it sent undercover agents to the school, a technique it said it planned to use at other schools as well. 
 Johanna Duncan-Poitier, deputy education commissioner for higher education and the professions in New York, said the department had encouraged the review of regulatory practices because the market was evolving. She said it would ''probably be May'' before the department made recommendations to the Regents, the 16-member panel elected by the State Legislature to oversee all education in New York. 
 The department faces pressure not only from the Regents, but from state lawmakers. 
 Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, a Long Island Republican and chairman of the Senate's Higher Education Committee, and Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat, say tougher oversight is necessary. ''Whenever there is a lot of cash on the table, there will be people in the marketplace who will try and take advantage of the system for their own economic benefit,'' Senator LaValle said. 
 Mr. Brodsky, who sponsored legislation to regulate nondegree commercial schools more tightly in the early 1990's, said he was alarmed by the problems emerging now. ''We need to recognize that the bad old days are coming back and not fall asleep at the switch'' he said. 
 Another push this week came from Mr. Pataki, with his proposal to withhold financial aid from college students who had not graduated from high school. Students would become eligible for state aid only after earning 24 college credits. The schools would be expected to provide financial aid themselves until the students became eligible. Then they would be repaid.
 Not everyone is certain that commercial higher education needs broad fixing. Assemblyman Ron Canestrari, a Democrat from the Albany area who is chairman of the Assembly's Higher Education Committee, cautioned against criticizing the commercial schools wholesale.
 ''If there are some problems,'' he said, ''we should not leap to the conclusion that there are problems throughout the sector, because I don't believe there are.''
 Some commercial school leaders said that they welcomed the closer look at their institutions, but that it should not stop with the for-profit sector.
 Bruce Leftwich, vice president for government relations at the Career College Association, an industry trade group based in Washington, said his group believed that if there are any institutions ''defrauding the system, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.''
 But, he said, ''there is fraud and abuse in all sectors of higher education.'' He added, ''If states are looking at proprietary schools and colleges, they should also be looking at all institutions.''

HEADLINE: With Threat of Sanctions, Iran Protects Some Assets

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI and ANDREW E. KRAMER; Nazila Fathi reported from Tehran for this article, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Iran is transferring its assets out of European banks as the possibility of economic sanctions over its nuclear program looms, according to the governor of the nation's Central Bank.
 The governor, Ebrahim Sheibani, acknowledged that Iran had begun moving its foreign currency from European banks, the ISNA news agency reported Friday. Even so, Mr. Sheibani did not disclose how much of the nation's assets were being moved, nor did he name the countries that would receive them.
''We transfer the foreign exchange to wherever we deem it fit,'' he told ISNA, after reporters asked him whether Iran was transferring money to countries in Southeast Asia. ''We have already begun transferring and we are currently doing that,'' he added. 
 The standoff between Iran and the West stems from widespread concerns, particularly in Europe and the United States, that Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons. Iran insists that it is pursuing a nuclear program strictly for peaceful energy purposes. 
 Despite the threat of sanctions, the American and the Europeans said this week that they were not pressing for them against Iran now. Instead, the diplomats said, they were pursuing a more limited effort to debate the issue at the Security Council, then send it back to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitor, in the hope of getting Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities. 
 The strategy comes as a response to Russian and Chinese resistance to pressing for sanctions at this stage, despite their concern that Iran has violated its pledge to suspend its enrichment of uranium. The Russians and Chinese say Iran might retaliate by breaking off talks over its nuclear program and forcing international inspectors to leave the country. 
 Indeed, Russia's top nuclear power official, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, said Friday that Iran was warming to an offer by Moscow to defuse the crisis by allowing it to enrich uranium on Russian territory. The proposal is intended as a guarantee that Iran will not refine weapons-grade uranium. 
 The proposal is ''extremely interesting'' for the Iranians, Mr. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister appointed as director of Russia's Atomic Energy Agency last fall, said at a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, according to the Interfax news agency. ''We are fully prepared, up to the point where production units are ready,'' he said. 
 On Wednesday, Iran's ambassador to Russia, Gholamreza Ansari, also told the Echo of Moscow radio station that the Russian offer was ''still on the table.'' According to a Russian translation, Mr. Ansari said: ''Russia has made a suggestion to us. We need time to review it.'' 
 Still, sanctions do not appear to be off the table, either. The Bush administration has said for two years that its ultimate goal is to bring Iran before the Security Council for potential censure or sanctions. But it has proceeded cautiously, deferring to European calls for diplomacy.
 After meeting with Javier Solana, the chief European Union envoy, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday that ''it is now important for the I.A.E.A. board of governors to act so that Iran knows that the international community will not tolerate its continued acting with impunity against the interests of the international community.'' Iran's assets were frozen in the United States after the 1979 Islamic revolution, when militant students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and took its diplomats hostage.

HEADLINE: Heeding Pakistani Protest, U.N. Blocks Talk by Rape Victim

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Mukhtar Mai, the Pakistani woman whose defiant response to being gang-raped by order of a tribal court brought her worldwide attention, was denied a chance to speak at the United Nations on Friday after Pakistan protested that it was the same day the country's prime minister was visiting.
 Ms. Mai had long been scheduled to make an appearance called ''An Interview With Mukhtar Mai: The Bravest Woman on Earth'' in the United Nations television studios, sponsored by the office for nongovernmental organizations, the Virtue Foundation and the Asian-American Network Against Abuse of Human Rights. 
 But on Thursday night the organizers were informed that the program would have to be postponed because of Pakistan's objections.
 Ms. Mai is leaving New York on Saturday so the effect was to cancel her appearance.
 Asked at a news conference why Pakistan had taken the action, the prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, said: ''I have no idea. You have informed me and so have some other people as I was walking in. I don't know how the place functions.''
 The Pakistani Mission did not return calls seeking comment.
 In 2002, a village council sentenced Ms. Mai to be gang-raped for the supposed misconduct of her brother. Pakistani women in such circumstances often commit suicide, but Ms. Mai instead successfully challenged her rapists in court. She gave the compensation money she received to schools in her remote district.
 On a previous visit to New York in November, Ms. Mai, also known as Mukhtaran Bibi, was hailed in a video tribute by Laura Bush at a Lincoln Center banquet as a person who ''proves that one woman really can change the world.''
 Mr. Aziz is scheduled to see President Bush in Washington next week.
 This was not the first time that Pakistan's government had interfered in Ms. Mai's travels. President Pervez Musharraf blocked her from taking a trip to the United States in June and then relented last fall when Glamour magazine honored her as its ''Woman of the Year.''
 Asked why the United Nations bowed to the Pakistani protest, Shashi Tharoor, the under secretary general for communications, said he could not comment on this specific case. But, he said: ''As a general principle, indeed there are written instructions guiding the holding of any event on United Nations premises in which we are obliged to take into account views formally expressed by member states. This is a building and an organization that belongs to the member states.''
 Recounting the 11th-hour nature of the decision, Joseph Salim, the executive director of the Virtue Foundation, a New York-based human rights charity, said, ''Yesterday, as we were going about a walk-through, getting our ID badges, they suddenly told us that because this event was considered by the Pakistan government as embarrassing to them, they were going to block it.''
 An e-mail message from Meena Sur of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at 7:49 p.m. on Thursday informed the organizers that the event had to be postponed until sometime after Jan. 24.
 Neither she nor Michele Fedoroff, the deputy head of the section, who had conveyed the same message in a telephone call, responded to messages seeking explanation.
 In an interview, Ms. Mai said: ''I feel disappointed. I was not going to say anything bad about Pakistan. I was just going to talk about my work and what people are doing.''

HEADLINE: Election Results in Iraq

 BODY:
There were no big surprises in the official Iraqi election results announced yesterday, but there were some encouraging trends, including significantly expanded parliamentary representation for the discontented Sunni Arab minority. But real power will remain, as before, with the Shiite fundamentalist and Kurdish nationalist parties, a fair reflection of the demographic reality that Shiites and Kurds together account for almost 80 percent of the Iraqi population. Majorities rule in democratic elections, but they rule successfully only if they reach out to minorities and respond generously to their legitimate concerns. 
 Iraq has now consolidated a crude electoral democracy. But it remains a democracy that is glaringly deficient in women's rights, minority rights, physical security and economic opportunity. Many of those deficiencies can and should now be addressed.
It is not yet clear how far the leading Shiite and Kurdish parties intend to go in this direction, and especially whether they will live up to their earlier promises to open up the severely flawed constitution to far-reaching changes. Those changes can be agreed upon and ratified only with their full support.
 With the combined strength of the leading Shiite and Kurdish blocs only a few votes shy of a decisive two-thirds majority in the new Parliament, these two groupings may have the raw numbers to shut out the main Sunni groups. They shouldn't. Such a narrow course would prolong the insurgency and divert the newly elected Parliament from the constructive opportunities of nation-building to the grim challenges of civil war.
 The first step should be repairing the constitution by affirming the political and fiscal primacy of the central government; guaranteeing all women the right to resolve family and property disputes in civil courts, even if their husbands, parents or in-laws would prefer to have them settled by religious courts; and narrowing the restrictions against former Baath Party members to those top officials guilty of serious offenses. 
 The offending provisions of the current constitution were insisted on by the same Shiite fundamentalist and Kurdish nationalist parties that will dominate the new Parliament. The Bush administration has rightly been pressing them for months to repair the damage. But Iraq's most powerful Shiite politician, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, recently seemed to rule out some of the most badly needed changes.
 Now that the votes have been counted, Iraqi politicians should not repeat last year's costly delay in forming a cabinet. Their extended dickering demoralized voters and weakened the government that eventually emerged. They should move swiftly toward forming the national unity government that Mr. Hakim and other political leaders now say they want.
 That government should be sufficiently broad-based to include representative Sunni parties, as well as some of the small parties that tried to appeal across religious and community lines. 
 Conducting successful democratic elections in a country that has known mainly dictatorship is a substantial advance. Moving ahead to create a functioning, inclusive democracy would be a far more consequential achievement.

For antiques collectors roaming from booth to booth yesterday at the Seventh Regiment Armory, things seemed much the same as in previous years. Collectors cast a critical eye on silver teapots and Aubusson carpets; connoisseurs lingered in the lavish period rooms. 
 But for dozens of dealers and show organizers across the country and abroad, the cavernous Park Avenue space was the focus of growing anxiety. An announcement on Tuesday that the armory will be transformed into an institution for the visual and performing arts raises the prospect that many entrepreneurs will lose a crucial sales point for their wares.
''It's something I definitely count on,'' said Valerie Carberry, who owns a gallery in Chicago and exhibits at two armory art fairs a year. ''If I can't return to New York as an exhibitor, it would have a significant impact on my business.''
 The Seventh Regiment Armory Conservancy, which runs the building, said that only a third of its programming would be devoted to arts, antiques and craft fairs in the future. But it said the major ones would survive -- like the current fair, the Winter Antiques Show, running through Jan. 29, and the Modernism show, held each November. 
 ''This will continue to be the world center for art and antique shows,'' said Wade F. B. Thompson, a co-chairman of the conservancy. 
 Rebecca Robertson, who will become chief executive of the future arts institution in March, said its mission had still to be determined. The goal is ''getting the right mix that supports our programming vision,'' she said in a telephone interview from Lincoln Center, where she is the outgoing executive director of the center's ambitious redevelopment project. 
 Sanford Smith, who produces several art shows at the armory -- including Modernism, Works on Paper, the Antiquarian Book Fair and Art 20 -- said that forfeiting the space to a resident arts institution would hurt city revenues, not to mention his own. ''It's a major economic engine in New York City,'' he said. ''There are no alternatives in the city if the armory shuts out these shows.''
 Existing alternatives include the Manhattan piers and the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. But exhibitors say these places are no match for the armory, which takes up a full square block between 66th and 67th Streets and between Park and Lexington Avenues. Its Drill Hall, site of the art fairs, measures 55,000 square feet.
 ''The armory is fantastic,'' said Barry Friedman, a gallery owner. ''It's the nicest venue New York has for antique fairs or art fairs.'' He said the Javits Center was unattractive to many dealers and collectors, in part because of its location on the far West Side. 
 ''It's the kiss of death all the way out there,'' he said. ''It's great for refrigerators or cars, but not for art.''
 The armory's location in the heart of the Upper East Side, home to the old and new rich, is a real advantage, dealers say. ''Within a 10-block radius of that building, there is probably more money than anywhere else,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Because of the location, people come back a second or third time, and that's when they do their buying.''
 Mr. Smith said the six shows that he helped to organize included more than 600 exhibitors from around the world, many of whom could earn 30 to 40 percent of their annual income from just one armory event. 
 Then there are the workers who pull the shows together and the ancillary businesses that benefit, like caterers and florists, he said. ''Carpenters, electricians, exposition workers and Teamsters all earn a living'' from armory shows, Mr. Smith said. ''It would eliminate a couple thousand jobs.'' 
 Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the building's landlord, said that the new and old art functions were not mutually exclusive and that exhibitors should fight to keep their slots. ''I would recommend they negotiate with the conservancy and try to make a deal,'' he said. ''All we're trying to do is to help this building survive and be renovated. It's highly underused.'' 
 The development corporation acts on behalf of the state, which owns the armory and recently negotiated a 99-year lease with the conservancy. 
 Tom Congalton, an antiquarian bookseller in New Jersey who exhibits at the armory's New York Book Fair, said: ''My reaction is dismay. Do we need another cultural institution when there are so few venues for exhibitions of this sort?''
 But Ms. Robertson said there was ''no flexible open floor space'' for the visual and performing arts in the city. ''That's what we're going to offer that's different from everywhere else,'' she said. 
 Cristyne L. Nicholas, the president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau, said that she knew of no economic analysis of what the armory generates in terms of tourism or tax revenue, but that a reduced roster of shows need not have an adverse impact. 
 ''I'm always concerned when there is the potential of losing exhibit space in New York City because it's so valuable,'' she said. ''But if it can be a cultural institution that can operate year round and draw visitors and residents to the armory and at the same time showcase art shows, it is a win-win.''
 The armory has long been talked about as a potential visual or performing arts site. The New York Philharmonic considered it as a summer home and, more recently, as a place to temporarily relocate during the planned renovation of Avery Fisher Hall. As long ago as 2000, Ms. Robertson -- a member of the conservancy board -- discussed creating a large performance space in the round for dance and theater. 
 That year, Harvey Lichtenstein, chairman of the BAM Local Development Corporation, which is creating a cultural district centered around the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, wrote in support of the idea in a letter to the conservancy. ''At a time when artists are searching for unconventional spaces and initiating large-scale mixed media projects,'' he said, ''the armory would fill a huge void in the city.''
 Ms. Robertson said at the time that the Whitney Museum of American Art would also play a role in the restored armory. Jan Rothschild, a spokeswoman for the Whitney, said this week, ''We've been talking with them.''
 A renovation of the 1879 armory is expected to start in the spring of 2009 and be completed by the fall of 2010, Ms. Robertson said, at an estimated cost of $100 million to $200 million.
 In the short term, Ms. Robertson said, the conservancy would do some basic refurbishing, like cleaning the building and landscaping, as the search for an architect to reconceptualize Drill Hall begins. The building -- 180,000 square feet over all -- is a designated landmark, featuring 16 reception rooms by architects including Louis Comfort Tiffany and Stanford White.
 But the building has fallen into disrepair. Mr. Congalton said some of his buyers ''leave in disgust because they don't like the bathrooms.'' 
 And when meetings take place in the Tiffany Room, he added, people try to keep them brief so they can leave ''before the ceiling falls in.''

HEADLINE: Governor's Tax-Credit Plan Finds Unexpected Support

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to give some parents a $500 tax credit that could be used to pay for private or parochial school tuition is drawing some unexpected support in the Democratic-led State Assembly.
 The backing is coming from some legislators from New York City who say that they are tired of waiting for Mr. Pataki to increase aid to schools and say that they see the tax-credit plan as a way to help parents frustrated with the quality of their children's education.
''Of course, the priority is fixing the schools for the working poor and middle-income parents,'' said Karim Camara, a freshman assemblyman from Brooklyn who is the executive pastor at First Baptist Church of Crown Heights. ''That doesn't mean that we turn our back on the problems in the public schools or that we ignore the needs of parents with children in private and independent schools. We need to give parents options.'' 
 Some Democrats denounce the proposal, which has come under fierce attack from teachers unions, as a stealth voucher system that would encourage parents to remove their children from public schools. And they question why they should authorize a $400 million program that could help private schools while the governor has not spent more money on public education to comply with a court order that found that the state had shortchanged schoolchildren in New York City.
 Since the Republican-controlled State Senate has already embraced the concept of the tax credit plan, all eyes in Albany are on the Assembly. Many of the Assembly's supporters of the tax credit are also backing the governor's proposal to build more charter schools.
 Likewise, many of the most ardent opponents of the tax credit and charter school proposals say the plans would funnel money away from the public schools, which need it most.
 ''This is part of the governor's duck-and-cover approach to education,'' said Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, Democrat of Manhattan. ''Rather than giving money elsewhere, how about providing the resources so that the system can be equitable?''
 The governor's proposal would allow parents who live in a district with at least one failing school to receive a tax credit of up to $500 per child on their personal income tax, if they earn less than $75,000. Parents who earn between $75,000 and $90,000 would receive more modest credits, between $125 and $375.
 Mr. Pataki and his aides have said that they are taking aim at families at the lower end of the economic ladder. Parents in 81 school districts, including all of New York City, would be eligible for the credit.
 Some Democrats in the Assembly have proposed a bill that would give an even larger tax credit -- up to $3,500 -- that could be used for private school tuition. Senator Martin J. Golden, Republican of Brooklyn, is sponsoring a similar bill in the State Senate.
 ''Too often the money goes to the system,'' said Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, the leader of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, who is sponsoring the legislation in the Assembly. ''Seldom does it go to the parents and the children.'' 
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said on Tuesday that he would consider the governor's proposal, adding that he did not consider it a voucher plan. Mr. Silver has not indicated whether he would support Mr. Lopez's bill, which was introduced last year.
 Several groups that represent private and parochial schools are supporting the governor's proposal and are lobbying to increase the proposed tax credit.
 ''For parents who already choose to send their children elsewhere, this gives them the ability to help afford tuition at an independent or religious school,'' said James Cultrara, the New York State Catholic Conference's education director.
 But Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said lawmakers would be making a mistake by giving up precious revenue through the tax credit.
 ''There are some systemic solutions that are really needed, and this money could be spent so much better in the struggling schools,'' she said.
 The issue is so politically divisive that after Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat running for governor, said on Wednesday that the tax credit could raise questions of constitutionality, he then clarified a day later.
 ''I support the idea of education tax credits,'' Mr. Spitzer said in a statement, adding that the state should first comply with the court order.
 Ruben Diaz Jr., Democrat of the Bronx, said he would consider supporting the proposal only if Mr. Pataki agreed to more than triple the amount of money allocated to New York City schools.
 ''It is inconceivable to me that anyone can say this is a way to increase dollars for education,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''Until we start spending money to our schools, we can't afford anything else.''

HEADLINE: At Citigroup, Earnings Rise With a Hitch

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services company, said yesterday that earnings rose 30 percent in the fourth quarter, but that the rise was solely from the sale of its asset management business. 
 Stripping out that one-time gain of $2.1 billion, profits from continuing operations fell 3 percent, to $4.97 billion, or 98 cents a share, in the fourth quarter from a year ago as the bank contended with shifting interest rates and a spike in consumer bankruptcies. Analysts had been expecting the bank to earn a dollar a share in the quarter.
Disappointed by the results, investors pushed Citigroup's shares down more than 4 percent, to $45.69. 
 Citigroup's chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, said increased competition in several of its businesses and a narrowing in the gap between short-term and long-term interest rates in the United States had dampened earnings. He also said a number of one-time charges taken by the bank throughout the year had added up to a ''challenging'' environment in 2005. 
 ''This was a year where there were a lot of boulders running down the hill,'' Mr. Prince said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts. ''Hopefully, we hope not to have a lot of boulders running down the hill next year.''
 Citigroup's consumer-banking group, which includes its retail, lending and credit card operations, was hit particularly hard as profits plunged 23 percent, to $2.4 billion, in the quarter from year-ago levels. A spike in bankruptcy filings ahead of a new law that took effect in October caused Citigroup to take a $300 million pretax charge on United States credit cards. Another charge against revenues this quarter -- this one for $545 million -- related to a change in accounting for card reward programs.
 But some analysts cautioned that another factor affecting earnings in the quarter -- the flat yield curve in interest rates -- could remain in place for some time. 
 ''I don't anticipate the yield curve getting steeper in 2006 and I don't know why they should,'' said Andrew B. Collins, a bank analyst with Piper Jaffray. 
 Citigroup, like other banks, makes a big chunk of its revenue from borrowing money at low short-term rates and lending it to individuals and corporations at higher rates. Last year, as the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates, the gap between short- and long-term interest rates narrowed significantly.
 ''We feel like we had some headwinds this quarter,'' said Citigroup's chief financial officer, Sallie Krawcheck, in a conference call with reporters. ''The rate environment has been one. The bankruptcies have been one. But we feel very good about our underlying businesses and the investments we have been making.''
 Citigroup did have its bright spots. Profits in its corporate and investment banking arm rose 21 percent in the quarter on record levels of merger-advisory fees and strong equity-trading revenue, the bank said. 
 For Mr. Prince, who took over the helm of the bank in October 2003, last year was one of turmoil inside and outside the executive suite. Besides dealing with a public shake-up of his top lieutenants last summer, Mr. Prince has worked feverishly to overhaul the bank's internal controls and regain some credibility among investors and regulators.
 Late last year, Mr. Prince laid out a strategic plan that included broadening the retail banking presence in the United States; moving aggressively into fast-growing international markets, and perhaps even considering a small acquisition. The bank has held off on doing any major deals since March, when the Federal Reserve told it to get its internal controls in order after scandals in European trading markets and Citigroup's private banking operations in Japan.
 Citigroup also said yesterday that it had repurchased about $4.4 billion of its stock, or about 93 million shares, in the fourth quarter. Mr. Prince said, however, that the bank had no plans to continue buybacks at that pace this year.

HEADLINE: Another Rise In Confidence 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Consumer confidence increased for a third month in January as an improving labor market and a mild winter left households with more money to spend. 
 The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to 93.4, from 91.5 in December. The index, which signals changes in consumer spending, increased to 81.5, from 80.2 last month.
 The University of Michigan's current conditions index, which reflects consumers' perceptions of their financial situation and whether it is a good time to buy big-ticket items like cars, rose to 112, from 109.1 last month. 
 ''The biggest supporting factor for this report is a healthy labor market,'' said Ellen Beeson Zentner, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''Two of the main drivers for consumer confidence are the unemployment rate, which has been edging down, and job creation, which has been adequate.'' 
 Richard DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation in Cleveland, said: ''We're seeing a recovery from the hurricane-induced pessimism of last summer. When the hurricanes started in late August and continued through late October, we saw a decline in confidence reflecting lowered economic expectations and the reality of higher energy prices. Those lowered expectations have proven too excessive.''

HEADLINE: Volkswagen Chairman Will Step Down

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
A high-stakes boardroom battle at Volkswagen ended in a truce Friday, as Ferdinand K. Piech, the company's chairman and an heir to the Porsche fortune, agreed to step down next year in return for two Porsche executives gaining seats on the board.
 Mr. Piech, a powerful figure who was once Volkswagen's chief executive, has been accused by shareholders and other board members of a conflict of interest since Porsche, the sports car maker controlled by his family, acquired 18.5 percent of Volkswagen's shares last fall. 
Porsche asserted that its investment entitled it to two seats on the Volkswagen board. Other directors objected, citing Mr. Piech's dual interests and saying that Porsche was trying to amass too much influence over Volkswagen, a company more than 10 times its size and Germany's largest carmaker.
 The dispute laid bare the web of interlocking ties among German companies, at times made all the closer by family holdings. It also raised troubling questions about corporate governance at Volkswagen, a far-flung automotive empire with public and private shareholders that has been rocked by a bribery and corruption scandal.
 Under an agreement reached between Porsche and Volkswagen's other major shareholder, the state of Lower Saxony, Porsche's chief executive, Wendelin Wiedeking, will join the board immediately, and its chief financial officer, Holger P. Harter, will be nominated for a seat in May.
 Mr. Piech, 68, will not stand for reelection when his contract expires in 2007, according to a spokesman for Porsche, Michael Baumann. Mr. Piech's successor will not come from Porsche or from Lower Saxony, Mr. Baumann said; those exclusions are intended to make the chairman a more neutral figure.
 Investors welcomed the agreement, though some still expressed concerns, especially since the Porsche executives would probably be under the sway of Mr. Piech.
 ''I personally felt that one representative would have been adequate,'' said William H. Browne, a managing director at Tweedy, Browne, an investment firm based in New York that manages Volkswagen shares and had campaigned to block the election of the Porsche executives.
 Still, Mr. Browne said, the departure of Mr. Piech would be helpful. ''Mr. Piech had a conflict,'' he said. ''To have him in there, with two other Porsche executives, would have tipped the scales.''
 Mr. Piech, who sealed the agreement in a meeting with Mr. Wiedeking and the prime minister of Lower Saxony, Christian Wulff, did not issue a statement and could not be reached for comment.
 When Porsche acquired the stake in Volkswagen in September, it said it was trying to protect the independence of one of its main partners. Volkswagen assembles much of Porsche's Cayenne sport utility vehicle, and the two companies are collaborating on hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles.
 Volkswagen has struggled in recent years, and it was viewed as a possible takeover target because a German law that shields it from unwanted suitors is in danger of being struck down in a European court.
 But the investment, experts say, was as much about history as economics. Porsche and Volkswagen have been intertwined since before World War II, when Mr. Piech's grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche, designed the Beetle at the behest of Hitler, who was searching for a ''people's car.''
 Ferdinand Porsche's son started the sports car company, which is the foundation of the Porsche and Piech family fortunes. Mr. Piech sits on the board of Porsche, but he made his name at Volkswagen, taking a company that was in deep trouble in 1993 and reviving it with eye-catching new models.
 ''The objective of his life is not just to make money, but to have influence and to follow the heritage of his grandfather,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen.
 Among those who raised doubts about Porsche's investment was Mr. Wulff of Lower Saxony, who also sits on Volkswagen's board. He and other board members commissioned a report on the company's relationship with Porsche from J. P. Morgan, which criticized Mr. Piech and said no major Porsche shareholder or manager should get a board seat.
 A rumored boardroom revolt against Mr. Piech never materialized, however, attesting to his powerful position, particularly with Volkswagen's union workers. In November, Mr. Piech backed a former union official, Horst Neumann, to be Volkswagen's head of personnel, going against the wishes of the current chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder.
 The previous personnel chief resigned after a scandal involving the company's dealings with its worker representatives. 
 Porsche had to come to terms with Lower Saxony, analysts said, since it is the largest shareholder. Porsche also does not want to disrupt a radical overhaul of Volkswagen that is being led by Mr. Pischetsrieder and his chief lieutenant, Wolfgang Bernhard. In a vote of confidence, Volkswagen's board will extend Mr. Pischetsrieder's contract for five years.
 Volkswagen, which has been struggling to cut its labor costs in Germany, said Friday that it would assemble a new model in Portugal, starting in 2008. Volkswagen's board is also creating a committee to oversee the commercial relationship between Porsche and Volkswagen. Both companies have pledged to negotiate deals at arm's length.
 ''The key question now is whether Porsche will accelerate the restructuring program at Volkswagen,'' said Jens Schattner, an auto analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: In Seattle, Seahawks Rise, As Does Skyline, in Vision Of a Hometown Tycoon

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
For years, Paul G. Allen was the invisible billionaire here, a tentative tycoon with a yacht longer than the football field where his Seattle Seahawks will play Sunday.
 But just as the Seahawks have shed years of obscurity in their first shot at the Super Bowl in more than two decades, Mr. Allen's prints appear everywhere as he remakes his hometown into an urban center to match his peripatetic passions.
As an investor, Mr. Allen, who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates, has had a kind of reverse Midas touch, losing billions on ill-fated ventures. But it is a different story in Seattle, which some here are calling Allentown, a nickname that cuts two ways, inciting both hope and fear. Seattle's major institutions are being drawn to Mr. Allen's vision of a city built around compact urban living and a biotech job engine that some city officials suggest could one day rival that of the Boeing Company, which still builds its planes here. 
 At a time when many cities are trying to find their footing in the global economy, Mr. Allen is redesigning whole parts of Seattle with the help of what could amount to almost a billion dollars in public investment. The city, known for airplanes, software and coffee, is moving swiftly into a role as a place whose monied elite promote philanthropy, global health and the life sciences -- gambling on a new economy that some worry may never materialize. 
 ''I'm just trying to do some things that are good for the city and have a positive return on investments,'' Mr. Allen, who will turn 53 on Saturday, said in an interview. 
 And while his portfolio has shrunk by about $10 billion from ventures elsewhere, according to independent analyses of his holdings, Forbes magazine pegs his wealth at $20 billion, and his Seattle properties are surging. 
 ''What's happened so far has exceeded my expectations,'' Mr. Allen said of his fast-moving Seattle developments in biotechnology, real estate, philanthropy, art and sports.
 Critics say Mr. Allen has become a social engineer with cranes and cash. 
 ''The job projections may be vastly overstated because no one really knows how big biotech will be, and we're still not sure how much this is going to cost the city,'' said Peter Steinbrueck, a Seattle City Council member who has known Mr. Allen since grade school.
 But Mr. Steinbrueck added, ''We're getting a very attractive urban neighborhood'' that most cities would jump at the chance to have. What bothers many Seattleites, he said, is the image of a very wealthy man controlling so much of the city.
 Of late, it is hard to avoid the reach of Mr. Allen's empire. The Seahawks' ''12th man flag,'' a tribute to the noise from fans that can upset the rhythm of the 11 opposing players on the field, flies atop the Space Needle. Mr. Allen has owned the team since 1997, and says few things now thrill him more than the chance to slap hands with middle-aged men in Seahawks blue hair and face paint.
 Down below, one of the biggest private urban makeovers in the country is briskly taking shape under Mr. Allen's hand. While his better-known partner in Microsoft wealth, Mr. Gates, is spending his fortune on reshaping the world, particularly global health and poverty, Mr. Allen has focused on his own backyard. 
 His company, Vulcan, is trying to build a biotech hub and housing for 10,000 or more. Nearby, researchers study frozen 56-day-old mice as part of the $100 million Allen Brain Atlas, an effort to go where no neuro-cartographers have gone before.
 And the $240 million museum he set up to honor the hometown hero Jimi Hendrix will take a step into the visual arts this spring, becoming -- for a time -- a showcase for rarely seen paintings by Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh and Picasso, among others. 
 And yet, despite the fact that Mr. Allen's influence has never been greater here, he remains an enigma. In the city where he grew up, Mr. Allen, a librarian's son, is little known, and his appearance on the football field and in the locker room at last week's Seahawks game caused the kind of stir usually reserved for Bigfoot sightings. 
 The mayor, Greg Nickels, has met Mr. Allen only once, said Deputy Mayor Tim Ceis. Stimson Bullitt, whose family has been a driving force in broadcasting, real estate and philanthropy here for nearly a century, said he did not know him. Most politicians, though they receive campaign contributions from Vulcan, say they have never met Mr. Allen.
 ''You hear all these stories from people who go to dinner at his house and they wait for him to arrive and then when he materializes, you don't know what door he came in from,'' said David Brewster, who founded Town Hall, Seattle's idea salon and culture center. ''He is a real interesting eccentric, and this town has always had a high tolerance for that sort of thing.''
 Mr. Allen, who has been in remission for Hodgkin's disease since 1985, has been a part of three big waves: the personal computer, the Internet and private space travel. (Vulcan financed the rocket that launched successfully in 2004, winning the Ansari X Prize.) For a man who owns a submarine and bought Captain Kirk's chair from ''Star Trek,'' it can seem like he is casting about, trying not to miss a bet.
 In the interview, Mr. Allen said he had no specific master plan for the city he was remaking, and he laughed at the idea that he was Carnegie in khakis. If anything, his idea is a back-to-the-future Seattle he remembers as a boy, where people got around the center of town by walking, combined with a New Urbanist setting. 
 In the South Lake Union area just off downtown, he plans to build 10 million square feet -- the rough equivalent of a dozen 50-story towers -- of condos, European-style alley-fronted homes, biotech and medical research facilities, hotels and retail space, with a trolley car connecting it all. The projects are ahead of schedule, with the cluster of condos built around a luxury hotel, Pan Pacific, and a Whole Foods store set to open later this year. 
 The words ''Rethink Urban'' and the eco-friendly phrases of ''sustainability'' and ''authenticity'' and ''urban sanctuaries'' are used in almost every presentation of what Mr. Allen is trying to do with the 60 acres he owns in South Lake Union.
 The South Lake Union plan also includes a retirement home, moderate-income apartments, a big new park, and medical research facilities drawn to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, a non-Vulcan property that moved to the area before Mr. Allen began to build.
 ''The thinking was to really have a place with activity going on all the time,'' said Ada M. Healey, the head of Vulcan real estate.
 Ms. Healey said South Beach in Miami Beach, the pedestrian shopping area in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Pearl District in Portland, Ore., were inspirations. 
 But each of those neighborhoods has been criticized as one-dimensional and empty of children or people from certain income groups. Ms. Healey said the demographic trends and costs of in-city living might be beyond Vulcan's ability to do much to attract families. 
 Mr. Allen said he ''pushed my people'' to come up with a new-century neighborhood, with green building principles and tight density, imagining a community of scientists who were never more than a few minutes stroll from their experiments.
 But the biotech idea, which many cities are pursuing, has been oversold, Councilman Nick Licata said, and ultimately may not be the kind of job producer worthy of substantial public investment. And Mr. Allen's experience in Portland, where he encouraged development around a sport complex he owned, ended in bankruptcy and hard feelings between city officials and Mr. Allen.
 Still, in Seattle, the Seahawks have taken the town by storm. The $430 million stadium where they play, Qwest Field, has been a fan favorite since it opened for football in 2002, after a substantial public investment and about $100 million from Mr. Allen. The owner asked his executives to try to re-create an atmosphere similar to the one Mr. Allen felt while attending University of Washington football games as a boy.
 ''For a sports team owner, you better enjoy this because it doesn't get any better,'' he said. 
 Coming on the heels of a dot-com bust that left Seattle leaders wondering about their next economic engine, the city approved most of what Mr. Allen asked for in the South Lake Union area, and the public investment could total $500 million to $1 billion, with infrastructure changes, city officials said. 
 ''Paul Allen is doing some very good things,'' Mr. Steinbrueck said, ''but it's tainted by the public image people have of him -- this very rich, flamboyant guy who hasn't grown up. He is seen as an enigmatic guy who wants to fulfill his fantasies from childhood.''

HEADLINE: Campaign May Be Down, but Weld Certainly Isn't

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
According to the usual vital signs of political mortality, William F. Weld's candidacy for governor of New York might appear to be on life support right now.
 By his own admission, Mr. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts, has been wounded by a federal investigation of a Kentucky college he once ran. Raising money has been a challenge, in turn, and, while some New York Republican leaders endorsed him early on, others are now iffy or worse. Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former senator, despises Mr. Weld, and he is saying so to anyone who will listen.
And any day now, a prominent Republican billionaire, Tom Golisano, will announce whether he is entering the governor's race; if he does, he is prepared to bury Mr. Weld with a Bloombergian avalanche of campaign commercials, his advisers say.
 Yet Mr. Weld is a singular sort -- a man who has never had a bad day, as Massachusetts politicians said about him. He is pursuing his campaign cheerily in spite of the challenges: drafting a ''Contract With New York,'' akin to Newt Gingrich's Contract With America, and considering creating a new political party based on tax cuts. 
 If Mr. Weld's self-confidence might seem like political spin, it is worth noting that a more objective politician has confidence in him, too: Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat who is running for governor. Within the Spitzer camp, Mr. Weld is seen as the Republican who could cause the attorney general the most problems, according to interviews with a dozen advisers and Democratic allies of Mr. Spitzer.
 ''It's fairly simple: Weld is likable and good with the media, he's smart, and he can debate well and is a former prosecutor,'' said one adviser to Mr. Spitzer, who, like the others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because there is no political gain in openly discussing a Republican candidate's strengths.
 ''Weld is the sort of Republican who does well in New York,'' said another adviser who has spoken to Mr. Spitzer about the Weld candidacy. ''He is a tax-cutter. He sounds very tough on crime. He's pro-hunting, pro-fishing, pro-environment. He is moderate to liberal on abortion and gay rights.
 ''He has aspects of Pataki, Bloomberg, Giuliani,'' the adviser continued, ''and these aspects can play well in the city and the suburbs and Long Island, and maybe parts of upstate.''
 Polls show that few New Yorkers know Mr. Weld at this point, and that Mr. Spitzer would beat him handily if the election were held today. But Mr. Weld says that as Republicans, independents and even Democrats get to know him better, more of them will prefer him to Mr. Spitzer. In the end, he says, voters will care more about his seven-year record in Massachusetts, where he cut taxes 19 times, than about his 10 months as the interim leader of a Kentucky institution, Decker College, which is now bankrupt.
 ''Aside from that issue -- it's been a real headache -- I don't see why I can't persuade anyone that I have the background to do good things here,'' Mr. Weld said at a breakfast with Albany Republicans on Tuesday.
 ''I'm a very happy campaigner,'' he said later in the day. ''It isn't that trouble follows me around -- I follow trouble! This is going to be a very fun race.''
 Enjoying himself and not taking setbacks too seriously, whether in politics or on his beloved squash court, are unusually dominant strands in the Weld DNA, according to Democrats and political observers who know him well. Mr. Weld's loss in the 1996 Senate race in Massachusetts, to John Kerry, was his political low point, but he bounced back the next year by relishing the political combat against a fellow Republican, Jesse Helms, then a senator, over Mr. Weld's nomination by President Clinton to be ambassador to Mexico. (Mr. Weld resigned as governor to pursue the job, but Mr. Helms largely scuttled the nomination.)
 ''Bill Weld loves a tremendous political challenge and should not be underestimated,'' said Cameron Kerry, a close political adviser to his brother, Senator Kerry, and a lawyer in Boston. ''With Weld, there's an intelligence to his political gamesmanship -- he has a great passion for figuring out how to master the game.''
 In New York, to be sure, Mr. Weld is still finding his way.
 At a dinner with 20 black Republicans in Harlem on Martin Luther King's Birthday, Mr. Weld impressed the crowd with his pledge to visit black churches and with his support for softening some New York drug laws, yet he struck some people there as shaky on the details of programs for affordable housing.
 The next day, in Albany, Mr. Weld impressed his Republican breakfast companions, and then two separate groups of business leaders, with his support for tax cuts and a statewide cap on property taxes. He said he was drafting a ''Contract With New York'' with a list of pledges: no new taxes, an indexed limit on state spending, a 2.5 percent cap on property tax increases, cuts in the number of public employees and changes to their pensions, and tort reform, among other items.
 Yet Mr. Weld also drew pointed questions about the problems at Decker College, his early departure as governor of Massachusetts and the threat of Mr. Golisano's money, should he run.
 Mr. Weld replied confidently (and said later that he was sure he could neutralize each issue); if anything, he seemed especially eager to go against Mr. Golisano in the Republican primary in September.
 ''It's an open, Wild West kind of primary -- I'll try to draw him into territory in which he's not that familiar,'' Mr. Weld said. ''I don't think he wins that primary, I think he's said too many nasty things about Republicans over the years.''
 Mr. Golisano, who declined this week to comment on his plans, ran against Gov. George E. Pataki in 1994, 1998 and 2002 and criticized the Republican leader sharply.
 Democrats, for their part, have been gunning for Mr. Weld. since he signaled his intention to run in August; the same day, a Spitzer aide urged reporters to talk to a gay-rights group that was critical of Mr. Weld's position on gay marriage (He supported it in Massachusetts but now opposes it for New York.) In recent weeks, New York Democratic Party officials -- who tend to act in Mr. Spitzer's interests -- have attacked Mr. Weld far more than they have any other Republican, mostly over the Decker College inquiry.
 Mr. Kerry, the senator's brother, said he saw similarities between the Kerry-Weld Senate race and the possible face-off this year between Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Weld.
 ''Bill Weld has always been very bright and charming, but when it came down to the issues that mattered most in 1996, people felt like he didn't really care,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''His lack of seriousness contrasted with John's.
 ''Eliot is a very smart guy and certainly a match for Bill Weld intellectually, and he also brings tremendous seriousness of purposes and engagement to the race, in a real contrast with Weld.''
 Mr. Weld, in an interview, thanked Mr. Kerry for the complimentary parts of his comments, and then asserted he was just as serious as the Democrats -- only differently.
 ''Eliot Spitzer was on Harvard Law Review -- he's obviously not chopped liver, but I would yield to no one on having a sense of purpose or seriousness of purpose,'' Mr. Weld said in an interview. ''The difficulty that some people have is that my purpose is Friedrich Hayek's and not Al Sharpton's.'' (Hayek was an Austrian economist who championed free-market capitalism.)
 Explaining that distinction, Mr. Weld said: ''My political gyroscope tells me it's very important to unleash the energies of everybody in society. And you don't achieve that purpose with a command-and-control, top-down, bureaucratized government. To me, the Reverend Sharpton represents government as the solution of first resort.''
 Mr. Sharpton said in an interview that he had not seen ''anything imaginative come from Mr. Weld, and he's run a flat campaign so far.''
 Still, Mr. Sharpton said he was struck by Mr. Weld's promise to visit black churches regularly this year.
 ''If he goes into the churches,'' Mr. Sharpton said, ''I think it'll be a different kind of campaign, and Bill Weld might prove to be a different kind of Republican.''

HEADLINE: If It Worked for Costa Rica . . .

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
RUNNING a country that has giant-winged bugs, toothy reptiles lurking in soupy water and enough humidity to frizz-out anyone's hair? No problem. You might have a great money-maker on your hands. 
 Eco-tourism -- travel that preserves the environment and promotes the welfare of local people -- continues to gain momentum. Impressed by the success of countries like Costa Rica and Ecuador, which have lured flocks of travelers for mountain treks and jungle safaris, a growing number of regions across the globe are turning to eco-tourism as a strategy for economic growth.
Omar Bongo, the president of Gabon, a developing country in west central Africa, has set aside about 10 percent of the country's landmass for 13 national parks. Green Visions, a tourism and environment protection company, based in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, is pioneering an eco-tourism development plan in Central Europe with ''green adventures'' that promote environmental principles and support local businesses. Even Greece, better known for its pumping night life and archaeological monuments, devotes a section of its national tourism Web site to ''Greek nature'' and eco-tourism. 
 Over the last four years, at least 48 countries, from Puerto Rico to Portugal, have created or started to define a national strategy for eco-tourism development, according to a 2004 eco-tourism report by Mintel International Group, a market-research company based in Britain. 
 Though eco-tourism has long conjured images of biodiversity hot spots in countries like Belize, parts of the United States are starting to embrace the trend too. For example, the Wisconsin Department of Tourism will begin testing a new certification program in March called Travel Green Wisconsin. Designed to encourage hotels and tour operators to reduce their environmental impact, the program is aimed at protecting the natural areas that play a significant role in defining the state as a tourist destination. If successful, the program will be rolled out statewide next year. 
 ''As a country we tend to think of eco-tourism as always over there,'' said John Ivanko, owner of Inn Serendipity, a bed-and-breakfast near Monroe, Wis., that has a solar-powered water-heating system and bathroom floor tiles made from recycled auto windshields. ''It doesn't necessarily have to be that way, especially when you have places like the Grand Canyon. We're just not thinking of it as much as a country.'' 
 For businesses, eco-friendly initiatives not only offer marketing advantages but can help with the bottom line. Hotels can cut costs by doing everything from installing energy-saving light bulbs to asking travelers to reuse their towels. And some 58.5 million U.S. travelers, or 38 percent, would pay more to use travel companies that strive to protect and preserve the environment, according to a study by the Travel Industry Association of America sponsored by National Geographic Traveler. Of those travelers, 61 percent said they would pay 5 to 10 percent more to use such companies. 
 However, selecting among the growing number of eco-friendly choices can be daunting, especially given the ever-broadening category, which now encompasses everything from basic campsites to high-end mountain lodges, lama trekking to motorcycle tours through the jungle. Enter the Sustainable Tourism Certification Network of the Americas -- a partnership of certification programs, environmental groups, government organizations and others, led by the Rainforest Alliance and the International Ecotourism Society -- which aims to promote sustainability and higher environmental and social standards for tourism. In September, the network designed a series of baseline criteria for certification to help generate credibility among members and promote local conservation. This year, the document will be put up for public consultation before being fully ratified. 
 ''Certification is a way for us to avoid green washing,'' the practice of promoting something as eco-tourism while behaving in an environmentally irresponsible way, said Ronald Sanabria, director of sustainable tourism at the Rainforest Alliance. ''Certification for us is a tool to avoid that and to ensure third-party assessments of requirements and really prove the company.''
 Within a few weeks, the Rainforest Alliance plans to introduce an online eco-index, www.eco-index.org/tourism, that will offer travelers a searchable database of hotels and tour operators that have been certified by a program member of the network.

HEADLINE: Rich in History and Natural Splendor

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
For most of the recent past, what many Americans knew about Ethiopia was that it was a country of crushing poverty and a symbol of world hunger. But though that poverty still remains, Ethiopia has begun to find something of an economic lifeline in cultural tourism. Indeed, in a part of the continent not rich in historical remains, the country holds many of sub-Saharan Africa's most astonishing treasures, like the medieval cave churches at Lalibela, and the 1,700-year-old stone obelisks in the northern town of Axum. 
 Ethiopia, which calls itself the Land of the Queen of Sheba, also claims title to the Ark of the Covenant, the box of gold and acacia wood that is believed to have once contained the Ten Commandments. Ethiopian Christians say it is somewhere in the Church of St. Mary of Zion in Axum. (Abercrombie & Kent just started offering a 12-day tour for $3,000 that includes a visit to the church and other stops that trace the roots of Christianity as well as to the village of Falasha, home of the few remaining Ethiopian Jews.)
Although the country can't compete with Kenya or South Africa when it comes to big game, Ethiopia does have more than a dozen national parks, which are regarded to be among the most beautiful in the sub-Saharan region. The terrain ranges from the plateaus of the Simien highlands to the white-water rapids of the largely uninhabited Omo Valley.
 There are no luxury tented camps with teak floors and five-course dinners, but several tour operators are offering fly-in safaris into the Rift Valley, Mago National Park and other remote preserves.
 Visitors can spend the day spotting leopards and bird-watching, before being whisked back to their hotels in Addis Ababa, the bustling capital with its exotic night life, or Gonder, a slower-paced city invariably referred to as Africa's Camelot because of its many castles. DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: An Outpost With an Eye on Development

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AS Buckberg Road climbs sharply up a historic mountainside in Stony Point -- with spectacular views of the Hudson River -- it unveils a storied tapestry of a northern Rockland County town where territorial battles have played a central role on more than one occasion.
 During the Revolutionary War, a battle plotted from one of the highest elevations in town was waged between the British and Continental armies.
Today, 227 years after Gen. George Washington and Brig. Gen. Anthony Wayne masterminded their successful assault against the enemy camped below, another kind of battle is being waged, this time between housing developers and the town's planning board.
 And, Buckberg Road, as the former dirt path was eventually named, has become a different kind of outpost: a new suburban frontier for buyers priced out of housing markets closer to New York City. 
 Thirty-five miles from Midtown Manhattan and a 60-mile-an-hour drive along the Palisades Interstate Parkway to the George Washington Bridge, Buckberg Road and other once-verdant mountainsides in Rockland's northernmost town these days are sprouting 5,000-square-foot homes instead of trees.
 Winding up the steep road, stone walls from previous centuries still mark out lots. Along the ascent, modest cabins and stately Victorians from the late 1800's and early 1900's give way to ranches and splits, built in the 1960's and 70's. Finally, at the peak of the mountain, newly built single-family homes sell for $925,000 and up and claim the choicest perch in town, a view of Tompkins Cove on the river's edge below. 
 The riverfront today is a place much changed since the Continental army fought there, with marinas now dotting the shoreline and chimney stacks of factories smoking across the way.
 Elsewhere in the 28-square-mile town, luxury homes in subdivisions similarly abut forests and open space, having radically altered the landscape in less than a decade.
 This surge in development recently prompted the town's newly elected supervisor, Philip A. Marino, to vow to turn the tide of development. 
 ''We built houses on the sides of mountains where we should never have permitted them, and we're paying for it now,'' Mr. Marino said. ''I want development slowed down.''
 Aware that overdevelopment could obliterate much of Stony Point's charm, Mr. Marino has encouraged planners to measure growth in terms of environmental outcomes, not just tax revenue.

What You'll Find
 Not everyone living in Stony Point is unhappy with the onrush of new housing. For residents like Victor and Helen Diaz, the 5,000-square-foot colonial in Stony Ridge Estates that they bought for $1.2 million last year, provided more house for the money than they could have purchased elsewhere in Rockland or in Westchester County, on the east side of the Hudson.
 Mr. Diaz, a mortgage consultant, said the family moved from a 3,000-square-foot contemporary with three bedrooms in Congers, another Rockland town, to the five-bedroom colonial in Stony Ridge Estates so that his children -- Victoria and Parisrae, 8-year-old twins; Vincent, 5; and Victor, 3 -- would have more room.
 ''The whole Congers area was getting too congested for us,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''We like the open spaces here.''
 When Stony Ridge Estates, one of the highest-priced subdivisions in Stony Point, was first being built five years ago, houses there sold for $750,000 and up, said Aldo Loria, an associate broker for Prudential Rand Realty, which is marketing the homes. Today, the houses start at $1.4 million. Meanwhile, the cost of land has escalated significantly, with typical lots of 0.75 to 1.5 acres in the subdivision now going for $500,000, Mr. Loria said.
 ''Before, a $1 million house in Stony Point was unheard of,'' he said. ''The town used to be considered the outskirts of Rockland County. Now it's fast becoming one of the county's most affluent areas. At the Meadows, a development next to Stony Ridge Estates -- both projects are being build by MBC Contractors, which is based in Stony Point -- prices for new houses start at $3 million.
 Elsewhere in the town, which includes the hamlet of Tomkins Cove, are Point and Jones Point, other luxury developments similarly altering wooded hillsides and former ski sites.
 There are also neighborhoods on side streets along Route 9A at the foot of the mountainside, where strip malls line the main thoroughfare. In contrast to the roadways that climb to higher elevations, many of the side streets near the center of town are lined with modest Capes, ranches, splits and colonials. There are no condominiums or co-ops in Stony Point, and except for one senior housing project, there are no rental apartment houses.

What You'll Pay
 The median sales price of a single-family home in Stony Point, a town of some 14,245 people, was $452,000 last year, up from $429,900 in 2004 and $377,500 in 2003, according to figures from the Rockland County Board of Realtors.
 ''It's been a steady increase,'' Mr. Loria said. ''Stony Point is moving up. It used to be that for $175,000 to $225,000, you could find a two- or three-bedroom Cape or bilevel in good condition. Now if you find anything for $300,000, it probably needs a lot of work. And forget about anything under that.''
 Currently near the top of the market, a newly built, 5,600-square-foot stucco residence with a two-story entrance, six bedrooms and four and a half baths is listed at $1.389 million in Stony Ridge Estates.
 In the middle range, a four-bedroom, three-bath colonial built in 1974 is listed at $689,000. At the lower end for single family homes, a three-bedroom, one-bath colonial that dates back to 1850 is on the market for $399,000.
 Property taxes, which are still relatively low compared with other areas, are expected to soar. Currently, the annual taxes on the colonial selling for $399,000 are $2,475; on the houses selling for $689,000, they are $7,744 a year. 
 But the town is in the process of settling a property tax dispute with the local power company, the Mirant Corporation, which could mean that the town would agree to pay rebates to Mirant or even lower its assessment. If that happens, said Mr. Marino, the supervisor, taxes would have to be raised elsewhere. ''We're not going to sugar-coat it,'' he said. ''It's going to be a bitter pill. The schools have told people to prepare for increases as high as 40 percent.''

What to Do
 Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park, both of which are used for hiking and mountain biking, account for three-quarters of Stony Point's acreage. This time of year, Bear Mountain also offers ice skating and skiing; during the warmer months, places to swim and boat abound. Overnight accommodations are available at the Bear Mountain Inn, which overlooks Hessian Lake, with lakeside lodges offering a more rustic and private atmosphere. 
 Now part of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, the green area was saved in the early 1900's from development by E. H. Harriman, the president of the Union Pacific Railroad, and a group of wealthy businessmen who donated land and large sums of money to preserve the parkland.
 Several years ago, the town bought a section of Letchworth Village, formerly a state-owned residence for the mentally retarded, and turned it into a public golf course. 
 At the town-owned Riverfront Park, residents can fish, look for crabs and play volleyball. At Veterans Park, baseball fields and tennis courts are available. In summer, children can attend a town-sponsored day camp.
 For evening entertainment, restaurants abound in the area. There's also the Penguin Repertory Company, with theater performances beginning in late spring and running through October.

The Schools
 The Haverstraw-Stony Point Central School District offers kindergarten through Grade 5 in five elementary schools and Grades 6 to 8 at three middle schools. All public school students in Grade 9 through 12 attend North Rockland High School. There's also the Roman Catholic Immaculate Conception School for kindergarten through Grade 8.
 In a program called Project Advance, North Rockland High School offers courses in government, economics and statistics in association with Syracuse University. Through the program, students can earn transferable college credits, said Dennis Hand, the principal.
 Students taking the SAT tests last year scored an average of 506 on the verbal and 508 on the math sections. The state averages last year were 497 for verbal and 511 for math.

The Commute
 The Red & Tan Lines provide bus service, which takes about two hours from Stony Point to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, and costs $8.30 each way.
 But many residents prefer to drive straight down the Palisades Parkway to Manhattan via the George Washington Bridge. 

The History
 The earliest known inhabitants, long before the British and Dutch made their way up the Hudson, were Algonquin Indians, among them the Mohegans, the Munsees, Lenni Lenapes, Tappans, Hackensacks and the Sint-Sings. 
 The first European settlers were the Dutch, who settled in Tappan in Rockland County in the 1680's. By the 1770's, the river had become a busy commercial area.

What We Like
 Stony Point's greatest assets are its breathtaking views of the Hudson River from the higher elevations, and the colorful marina district down along the water's edge.

What We'd Change
 For major shopping or the larger chain restaurants, or to see a movie, Stony Point residents have to drive about 15 minutes to New City, the Palisades Center in West Nyack or other locations in Rockland County.

HEADLINE: Enter, Chopping Block Left 

BYLINE: By ARTHUR LUBOW

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
AFTER a tortuous three-year search for a new general manager, the Berlin Philharmonic made an unexpected choice in July. Pamela Rosenberg, 60, will be the first woman and the first American to administer what is arguably the world's most revered orchestra. Even more surprising, Ms. Rosenberg has never worked for a symphony orchestra; her entire professional career has been in opera, culminating in the position of general director of the San Francisco Opera.
 Simon Rattle -- the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, which will give four concerts at Carnegie Hall this week -- says he is not concerned. ''She expressed that worry,'' Sir Simon said. ''We find ourselves not worried. There will be areas that she will have to learn, but she is a very quick learn.'' 
Like a bride of Henry VIII, a new manager (or intendant, as the position is called) at the Berlin Philharmonic has cause for anxiety. The last one, Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, who arrived after a tempestuous two-year tenure at Carnegie Hall, lasted only a year in Berlin. The manager before him, Elmar Weingarten, was mysteriously forced out by Sir Simon's predecessor, Claudio Abbado. And in what remains the most notorious instance of a manager suffering for a chief conductor's sins, Peter Girth took the fall when the orchestra rebelled at Herbert von Karajan's insistence in 1982 that Sabine Meyer be appointed principal clarinetist.
 Governed by its players, the Berlin Philharmonic requires a manager who is neither too ineffectual nor too bossy. ''That's maybe why we are very lucky with a woman,'' said the cellist Jan Diesselhorst, an orchestra board member who served on the search committee. ''From their nature, they have the ability to be strong and weak.''
 In a more judicious assessment of gender advantages, Ms. Rosenberg herself said: ''I feel I'm a mother figure, motivating the company and being an ear. I spend a lot of time listening.''
 Although a native of California, Ms. Rosenberg will be returning to familiar cultural territory: she lived in Germany for three decades. After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley in 1966 as Pamela Henry, she enrolled in a summer program at Bayreuth, where she confirmed her passion for opera direction and found another life-altering love: Wolf Rosenberg, a German composer and critic 30 years her senior. They married and had twin sons.
 As a guide to an intellectually charged European milieu, Wolf Rosenberg excelled. He knew everyone and everything in the advanced musical circles of Germany. Along with a commitment to composition, he had a passionate interest in the human voice, possessing 3,000 78-r.p.m. recordings of early-20th-century opera singers. ''We went through them, and my ear became much more aware,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''He really made me critically able to listen.''
 He also introduced her to the groundbreaking conductor Michael Gielen, who gave her her first important job, at the Frankfurt Opera, in 1980. She advanced to become part of a four-person team running the house and, from there, to positions in Hamburg, Amsterdam and Stuttgart. Wolf Rosenberg died in 1995. Pamela Rosenberg was a co-director of the Stuttgart Opera when she was recruited to the San Francisco Opera, to start in September 2001.
 Once back in California, she realized how European she had become. In Germany, as in much of Europe, the arts receive heavy government subsidies, so an arts administrator needn't worry much about soliciting private donations or even selling tickets. In the United States, Ms. Rosenberg had to think differently.
 ''About 90 percent of your time is devoted to money and 10 percent to art,'' said Christopher Hahn, the artistic director of the Pittsburgh Opera, who previously worked in San Francisco.
 THE timing of Ms. Rosenberg's appointment complicated the challenge. An economic recession, especially acute in technology-driven San Francisco, was already unraveling the opera's fund-raising efforts. Then the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks discouraged potential ticket buyers from venturing out of their living rooms.
 ''The San Francisco Opera had been presented to me as the big golden plum with no financial problems,'' she said. ''It took a while for the realization of how deep this was to sink in.'' 
 The opera board, said its chairman, Franklin P. Johnson Jr., hired Ms. Rosenberg ''so that this company would take its place among the most exciting and innovative opera companies in the world.'' In many ways she succeeded in that mission. Her term was bracketed by two of the most notable American opera productions of the new century: a thrilling presentation of Olivier Messiaen's ''St.-Francois d'Assise,'' in September 2002, which was the first staging of this colossal work in the United States; and the premiere last fall of John Adams's ''Doctor Atomic,'' an opera that, like the woman who commissioned it, combines seriousness with audacity.
 But along with these successes, Ms. Rosenberg's tenure in San Francisco may have demonstrated the limits of the American way of making opera. In Germany, the orchestra players and stagehands are salaried government employees, available to an opera director almost as freely as pigment and canvas to a painter; their American counterparts are unionized hourly employees. Among her expensive innovations, Ms. Rosenberg introduced the European method of ''bauprobe,'' in which a model of the set is constructed for rehearsal purposes on the stage.
 ''That's where I saw my challenge, to get the thorough scenic results that you sometimes see in Europe,'' she said. ''Before, it was superficially slick stuff that was just sort of tossed on.''
 In the American opera world, schadenfreude is a more familiar German word than bauprobe. When the San Francisco Opera foundered financially early in Ms. Rosenberg's tenure, professionals at other companies shrugged. Stories circulated about flagrant disregard for deadlines, as with the designer for ''St.-Francois,'' who kept revising the leper's costume until the staff had to work overtime. Yet it is unlikely that the company could have achieved the new productions that galvanized audiences -- or for that matter, some that didn't -- without a rehearsal process that encouraged experimentation.
 Ms. Rosenberg opted not to renew her five-year contract. ''I decided I didn't want so much of my energy to have to go into what it goes into here,'' she said. ''I was having 16-hour days. For two years solid, I was coping with financial problems.''
 When she stepped down, she didn't know what would follow. She initially rebuffed the Berlin headhunter's overtures, even though being close to her two sons and two grandchildren in Germany enticed her. ''What I didn't want to do is just go in and be this administrative clog, or just a liaison between Simon and the orchestra,'' she said. Musicians in the search committee, and then Sir Simon himself, reassured her. 
 Now in his fourth season in Berlin since arriving from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Sir Simon is gradually settling in. He has programmed more contemporary music, sandwiching it between traditional pieces on a bill. He is still feeling his way into the great Romantic repertory for which the orchestra is renowned. He has not tried to impose thematic coherence on the season's schedule as Ms. Rosenberg did in San Francisco, when she organized series of operas around subjects like the Faust legend or ''Women Outside Society.''
 ''The repertory is still the Birmingham stuff he did,'' said Manuel Brug, the music critic for Die Welt. ''There is nothing you see he really wants to do with them -- there is not a line. That is why people are waiting for an intendant.''
 Sir Simon says that the orchestra needs a manager ''willing to be authoritative within a democratic structure.'' Mr. Ohnesorg, as he had done at Carnegie Hall, craved the limelight. He quickly alienated the musicians with his peremptory decision-making.
 After he was forced out, the orchestra was shell-shocked. ''At the beginning they were so happy that Franz Xaver Ohnesorg left them that they said, 'Perhaps we don't need an intendant,' '' said Barbara Kisseler, the state secretary for culture in the Berlin Senate. ''They came to see this was a big error.''
 Even before she officially starts, on Aug. 1, Ms. Rosenberg is contemplating what she might accomplish in Berlin. Since the orchestra's hall, the Philharmonie, is (like Carnegie Hall) rented out many nights, she wonders if she might create greater coherence by developing ''programming streams'' for the Philharmonic's season and then encouraging visiting orchestras to present complementary bills.
 The Kulturforum neighborhood around the Philharmonie, which was at the edge of West Berlin, is near the heart of the reunited city, but it still feels like a marginal wasteland. Buses ferry suburbanites to the hall, then wait outside to take them home after the concert. ''It's so dead,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''If people could eat before the performance or have a drink, that would make a difference.''
 Like Sir Simon, Ms. Rosenberg is deeply interested in awakening a taste for classical music in young people. Before taking the Berlin job, she was trying to organize a musical kindergarten program throughout Europe and said that the Berlin Philharmonic would be ''an excellent launching pad.'' 
 COMPARED with other German cultural organizations, the Berlin Philharmonic is exceptionally profitable. Slightly less than half of its budget of 31 million euros ($37.6 million) is subsidized by the government. The rest comes from ticket sales and tours ($9.7 million each). In addition, it receives an annual corporate gift of $3.6 million from Deutsche Bank, earmarked for education and a glossy magazine. 
 But even the privileged Berlin Philharmonic sees bleaker days ahead. Although its concerts sell at an enviable 96 percent of capacity, the wait for a subscription, which two decades ago was six years, is now down to two years. Recording contracts, while still munificent by American standards, have been reduced by half over the last 20 years, to seven or eight annual releases. With state budgets contracting, other revenue sources will become more important.
 ''We are all on a learning curve, because we can no longer stick to that old manner of funding,'' said Tessen von Heydebreck, a managing director of Deutsche Bank. He foresees, he added, ''a sharp increase in sponsoring by private persons.''
 Fund-raising, marketing subscriptions, selling tickets: it would an unkind twist, if, by the end of her term in Berlin, Ms. Rosenberg found herself back where she was in San Francisco.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 22, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Page 26 of Arts & Leisure today about Pamela Rosenberg, the new general manager of the Berlin Philharmonic, attributes a precedent to her incorrectly. Although Ms. Rosenberg is the first American-born administrative director, Wolfgang Stresemann was the first American in the post. Mr. Stresemann, who took American citizenship in 1945, held the position from 1959 to 1978 and from 1984 to 1985. The article also refers incorrectly to her professional career. It has not been solely in opera; she worked in theater early on.

HEADLINE: Positively East Fourth Street

 BODY:
The real estate boon and the East Village's rise as a desirable destination notwithstanding, New York City has just sold six buildings on East Fourth Street to a collection of arts groups for the bargain rate of $1 each. Depending on your point of view, the deal was anywhere from six years to more than a century in the making. J. Jennings Moss tells the tale of the bureaucratic tape. 


1882 -- The block gets an early taste of its arts future when the Yiddish play ''The Witch'' is produced at 66-68 East Fourth Street.

1959 -- New York City takes ownership of several buildings on the street, now part of an urban renewal area. Robert Moses' plan to demolish them is successfully opposed by the Cooper Square Committee.

1969 -- La MaMa Experimental Theater Club moves onto the street.

1974 -- La MaMa expands into a city-owned building with a month-to-month lease at below-market rents.

1990 -- Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration proposes 99-year leases to East Fourth Street arts groups, but the idea goes nowhere.

1992 -- New York Theater Workshop moves onto the block and buys its buildings, at 79 and 83 East Fourth Street.

1996 -- Ten nonprofit cultural groups now call the street home, including Downtown Art and the Choices Theater Project.

2000 -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration decides that the city should sell the buildings. The Fourth Arts Block, a new association of 13 nonprofit cultural and community groups, wants the four buildings its members occupy along with two vacant buildings and an empty lot.

A study urges creation of an East Fourth Street Arts District.

2001 -- City and arts group officials begin meeting to discuss sales of the buildings for a nominal fee. New York Theater Workshop joins the talks and eventually buys a city-owned property to use as a costume and set shop.

2003 -- The East Fourth Street Cultural District is born.

2004 -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council approve the sale. The price is $1 a building, but the arts groups have to find renovation money.

2005 -- In June, the Fourth Arts Block releases a benefit CD, including tracks from Moby, Philip Glass and Ani DiFranco, to help raise nearly $6 million.

In October, La MaMa closes on the La MaMa Annex at 66-68 East Fourth Street, site of ''The Witch'' in 1882.

2006 -- Six years after the transaction was first proposed, the Rod Rodgers Dance Company and the Duo Theater are the last to close on the building they share. The city has spent $3.05 million for renovations and pledges an additional $1.05 million.

HEADLINE: Developers Respond To the 'No Vacancy' Sign

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
A MARRIOTT RESIDENCE INN has officially opened in Manhattan, adding 357 guest rooms in a borough that has been depleted of 3,600 rooms since 1999, as many hotels have been converted to residential use. 
 The new Residence Inn, at the Avenue of the Americas and West 39th Street, is an extended-stay hotel, the first of its brand in Manhattan. It is on the leading edge of a wave of hotel development that could add as many as 6,000 rooms, or about 10 percent, to the supply over the next few years.
About 2,000 of those rooms are already under construction or conversion, according to a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm. 
 The remaining 4,000 are in various stages of planning, and it is likely that some will not be completed, said Kirk Reed, a manager in the firm's hospitality and leisure practice. ''Probably some will fall out of the pipeline,'' he said.
 Nevertheless, this year is expected to be the first since 2002 that will show an increase in supply, after occupancy rates and average daily rental rates reached record levels last year. 
 According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the occupancy rate of 86.4 percent in Manhattan in the third quarter of last year exceeded the previous peak of 85.4 percent, set in 2000. The average daily rate of $223.50 was about $12 above the previous peak in the third quarter of 2000. Nationwide, the average rate is below $100 a night.
 In many cases, the planned new projects are quite different from hotels built in Manhattan during earlier periods. Many are limited-service brands, like Holiday Inn Express and Courtyard by Marriott, and most are smaller than the average for a Manhattan hotel, which is 275 rooms. Many of the new developments will be in Lower Manhattan; traditionally, hotels have preferred locations in Midtown.
 But the high prices being paid for residences in Midtown, particularly near Central Park, have forced hotel developers to seek alternate sites where prices are less inflated. ''Hotels are being constructed in places like the Far West Side, Brooklyn and Queens,'' Mr. Reed said.
 Some of the new projects will include residential components as well as hotel rooms, mainly because the economics are more favorable. The Residence Inn, for example, will have 96 condo units on the top 10 floors, in addition to the hotel guest rooms, retail space and a parking garage.
 ''Projects like this are much easier to finance,'' said Harry Gross, chairman and chief executive of G Holdings, which built the Residence Inn and has other Marriott-brand hotels in the city. Selling condo units, besides renting hotel rooms, ''is a much quicker exit strategy because it refunds the equity invested in the project,'' he said.
 Mr. Gross said it took more than five years to put together the deal because of the complex land assembly. The structure is wrapped around a small synagogue and an office building on the Avenue of the Americas.
 The hotel and condos will be operated separately. In some other hotel-residential projects in Manhattan, like the Ritz-Carlton near Battery Park, hotel services are available to the residences. 
 The Residence Inn has its entrance at 1033 Avenue of the Americas, while the condo section, known as Bryant Park Tower, has its own entrance on 39th Street. 
 ''The hotel and the condo have their own heating and cooling systems,'' Mr. Gross said. The condominium units are designed to be ''small and utilitarian''; a typical unit is a 500-square-foot one-bedroom. The apartments are priced at $650,000 to $950,000; the median price for Manhattan condos, Mr. Gross said, is $1.2 million.
 The hotel portion of the project is designed for people on extended assignments in Midtown, possibly at the financial services and media companies in the new office towers near Times Square. The rooms are equipped with a full kitchen along with the usual bedroom and bathroom.
 Like most other hotels, the Residence Inn has room rates that vary by time of year and demand. Currently, a single night costs $275, with discounts for longer stays. 
 The art in the hotel's rooms is mostly of New York scenes. ''We commissioned artwork of things that can be seen from the hotel,'' Mr. Gross said.
 The rooms will be free of something else: tobacco residue. ''Residence Inn is the first Marriott brand to go all nonsmoking,'' he said.
 The typical stay is 7 to 30 days, Mr. Gross said, but five rooms have already been reserved for two-year periods. 
 The building is in the heart of the Garment District, and fashion shows are important business for the hotel. ''We get bookings from the fashion industry, which has two shows a month,'' Mr. Gross said.
 In Manhattan overall, construction of the planned thousands of hotel rooms would mean more competition for the owners and operators of existing properties, said Vijay Dandapani, chairman of the Hotel Association of New York. ''Any addition to supply cuts into business,'' he said, ''and if there is a downturn in 2007, it could be bad.''
 But he says history demonstrates that additional supply is eventually absorbed. ''In 1992, we had 53,000 rooms and that was far too many,'' he said. ''Occupancy fell to 63 percent, which is horrible. But eventually the business recovered.''

Currently, the nightly rate is $275, with discounts for longer stays. (Photographs by Marilynn K. Yee/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: All's Not Quiet on the Military Supply Front

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
A 9-millimeter bullet, erupting from the barrel of a handgun at 1,100 to 1,400 feet per second, can puncture skin, splinter bone and shred internal organs. A 7.62-millimeter rifle slug, flashing along at about 2,750 feet a second, dispatches targets at greater distances and with more accuracy and force than most handgun ammunition. And the human body -- essentially a large, mobile sack of water -- offers little resistance to bullets of any caliber.
 Bulletproof vests, made of Kevlar and other fabrics, are meant to shield vulnerable bodies, giving a veteran cop on the beat or a young soldier on patrol in Baghdad added protection. Most vests, if properly designed, can stop a 9-millimeter handgun bullet. No vest, unless it is supplemented with heavy, brittle ceramic inserts, can stop a high-velocity rifle bullet. Over time, or with repeated exposure to gunfire, all vests degrade and lose their stopping power. Still, well-made vests offer wearers a measure of security in encounters that might otherwise prove fatal. 
When the Iraq war began in early 2003, analysts say, the American military hadn't stocked up on body armor because the White House did not intend to send a large occupational force. The White House game plan called for lightning strikes led by lithe, technologically adept forces that would snare a quick victory. A light deployment of troops and a harmonious occupation were to follow, with the Pentagon anticipating relatively little hand-to-hand or house-to-house fighting. But as the breadth and duration of the Iraqi occupation grew, the war became a series of perilous, unpredictable street fights in Baghdad and other cities, leaving soldiers exposed to sniper fire and close-quarters combat -- and in urgent need of hundreds of thousands of bulletproof vests.
 In the world of military contractors, times like these -- when a sudden, pressing need intersects with a limited number of suppliers -- have all the makings of full-blown financial windfalls. For small vendors, the effect can be even more seismic than it is for their larger brethren, turning anonymous businesses into beehives of production and causing their sales to skyrocket. DHB Industries, based in Westbury, N.Y., whose Point Blank subsidiary in Pompano Beach, Fla., is a leading manufacturer of bulletproof vests, found itself occupying this lucrative turf when the military awarded it hundreds of millions of dollars in body armor contracts in 2003 and 2004.
 With sales of just $340 million last year, DHB is a small fry amid giant military suppliers like Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Halliburton. But DHB offers a case study of the complexities of military contracting -- and of the riches and responsibilities that accompany it. DHB's dealings also offer a peek into the vagaries of internal controls and executive compensation that continue to challenge companies of all stripes, the individuals and institutions that invest in them, and a public that relies on them for goods and services.
 DHB might have remained anonymous if not for a spate of recent events. The quality and adequacy of vests supplied to soldiers in Iraq has come into question over the last year, culminating in a Pentagon study, first reported by The New York Times this month, that said that 80 percent of the Marines who died in Iraq from upper-body wounds might have survived if they had had body armor covering more of their torsos. (It was the military, and not manufacturers, that determined the specifications for the vests DHB supplied the Marines, said DHB.) 
 The Marines and the Army recalled about 23,000 Point Blank vests from the field last year after The Marine Corps Times reported that the Marines acquired the vests despite warnings from Army personnel that the vests had what the newspaper described as ''critical, life-threatening flaws.'' The Marine Corps issued a statement in November saying that there was ''no evidence to suggest that soldiers or Marines have been at risk, or that these vests will not protect against the threat they were designed to defeat.''
 The Marine Corps declined to respond to repeated interview requests for this article. An Army spokesman said in an e-mail message that Army officials would not grant an interview because it ''would be inappropriate, considering DHB and Point Blank Armor business arrangement.'' 
 DHB declined to make any of its executives or directors available for interviews, including David H. Brooks, 51, its founder, namesake, largest shareholder and chief executive. In regulatory filings, DHB said it had delivered more than 850,000 vests to the military since 1998, and a company spokesman, Bruce Rubin, said the vests that the military withdrew were only a small percentage of those it supplied most recently.
 ''A significant amount of anecdotal evidence from the field indicates that DHB's products are doing what they are designed to do -- save lives,'' Mr. Rubin said.
 Mr. Brooks, who, along with his wife and children, cashed in DHB stock worth about $186 million in late 2004, has also courted attention and controversy. In November, Mr. Brooks held a bat mitzvah party for his daughter atop Rockefeller Center in New York, which an article in The Daily News said had cost $10 million. Mr. Rubin characterized the figure as exaggerated. He declined to comment on other elements of the article, which said that Mr. Brooks had used his company's jet to fetch a clutch of rock and hip-hop stars, ranging from Don Henley to 50 Cent, to perform at the celebration; that he changed out of an all-leather, metal-studded suit into a hot-pink suede suit as the party heated up; and that he supplied guests with goody bags stuffed with $1,000 worth of merchandise.
 The $186 million stock sale occurred four months before reports surfaced of possible problems with vests in Iraq, and reduced Mr. Brooks's stake in DHB to 15 percent from 48 percent in 2003. It also preceded DHB's announcement last fall that it would take a $60 million charge to reserve for a potential class-action settlement and replacement costs related to legal disputes surrounding vests the company had sold to police departments nationwide. Those events helped DHB's shares to plunge 76 percent last year, but a lawyer representing Mr. Brooks said that none of his client's stock sales were based on nonpublic information.
 Over the years, DHB has bestowed unusual financial rewards on Mr. Brooks. From 1997 to 2004, he was entitled to lay claim to 10 percent of the company's annual profits as reimbursement for personal and business expenses. During that time, he rang up $2 million in personal charges on DHB's corporate credit cards, according to securities filings. For one year, between 1996 and 1997, he was also entitled to 10 percent of the company's annual profit as a bonus, a right that Mr. Rubin said Mr. Brooks had never exercised. Mr. Brooks' total annual compensation in 2004, the most recent year for which data are available, was about $73.3 million. Of that amount, $69.9 million represented options he exercised as part of his $186 million stock sale that year. DHB itself had profits in 2004 of $49.5 million.
 ''The American economic system rewards those who take great risks with commensurate benefits,'' Mr. Rubin said of Mr. Brooks's stock sales and compensation. ''The compensation Mr. Brooks received is directly attributable to the risk he undertook in aiding the capitalization of DHB and achieving extraordinary results for the company.''
 Mr. Rubin also pointed out that Mr. Brooks lent DHB more than $20 million and personally guaranteed its bank loans during the company's earlier and leaner years -- a time when he could not be assured that he would get his money back or that DHB would turn a profit.
 Nonetheless, the Securities and Exchange Commission is currently investigating aspects of Mr. Brooks' compensation and other corporate transactions, according to the company's securities filings. Mr. Brooks and the company declined to comment on the investigation, as did the S.E.C.
 This is not the first time that regulators have examined Mr. Brooks' activities. In 1992, the S.E.C. fined him heavily and barred him from the brokerage business for five years for improprieties related to an insider trading scandal. That aspect of Mr. Brooks' resume appeared in the company's public filings until the late 1990's, and then disappeared.
 Although DHB adopted a new code of ethics in 2003 that required the company to make ''full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure'' in its public communications, a lawyer representing DHB's management, George S. Canellos, said that the company was legally obligated to notify the public about the 1992 S.E.C. sanctions only for the five years after the agency imposed them. The absence of more recent disclosure, Mr. Canellos said, ''in no way conflicts with the company's code of conduct or any law or regulation.'' 
 In any case, while Mr. Brooks was briefly banished from the securities business, that did not prevent him from assembling a small group of companies and eventually becoming the chief executive of a publicly traded company -- one that now supplies a product, bulletproof vests, that is vital to the safety of American troops overseas.
 THE rapid growth in military spending has fattened the wallets of C.E.O.'s running major defense contractors, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning research group in Washington. The group, which labeled Mr. Brooks a ''body armor profiteer'' in a report it prepared last summer, noted that the average compensation for C.E.O.'s at 34 leading military contractors tripled from 2001 to 2004, to $3.9 million. That meant that C.E.O.'s pay packages were 23 times larger than generals' salaries and 160 times the size of an average soldier's pay.
 The Pentagon awarded more than $230 billion worth of military contracts in the 2004 fiscal year, and how companies of all sizes secured pieces of that pie depended on different combinations of expertise and political access. Government and military oversight of the fitness and capacity of suppliers has historically been plagued with challenges and lapses, and military analysts say that those problems are magnified during times of war. Some of the concerns that have cropped up recently about the adequacy of bulletproof vests, they say, are no surprise.
 ''This is somewhat similar to the lifesaving drug that is rushed into production for fear that people will die if they don't get it,'' said Loren B. Thompson, a military security specialist at the Lexington Institute, a conservative research organization based in Arlington, Va. ''In a time of war there is great pressure to equip troops with body armor and other life-saving equipment as soon as possible.''
 Other analysts say that the sheer volume of money gushing out of the military's contracting faucet, the difficulty of overseeing each and every supplier, and the need to rush armor and weaponry into the field inevitably creates problems.
 ''If you see some of these big companies scarfing down billions of dollars with nothing to show for it, then it's not surprising that problems have emerged at some of the smaller companies,'' said John E. Pike, founder of GlobalSecurity.org, a research firm that specializes in military and intelligence policy. ''At the end of the day, the oversight comes in the testing.''
 In the span of just six months in 2004, the Pentagon awarded DHB three body armor contracts worth about $455 million. DHB's entire revenue the previous year had been only $230 million. DHB, the Marines and the Army would not discuss the process through which DHB had secured its body armor contracts. The military began awarding contracts to the company as early as 1998, three years after DHB paid $2 million to acquire Point Blank out of bankruptcy.
 Neither DHB nor Mr. Brooks appears to be a big political contributor. Mr. Brooks made a $25,000 contribution to a fund-raising arm of the Republican National Committee last June, his only political contribution since 1990, according to campaign finance records maintained by the Center for Responsive Politics; DHB and Point Blank themselves do not appear in those filings at all.
 But DHB has been an active client of three Washington lobbyists -- Grayson Winterling, John C. Tuck, and Michael P. Flanagan -- each of whom lobbied the Defense Department or undisclosed members of Congress on DHB's behalf, according to federal records. None of the three men returned phone calls seeking comment. DHB executives declined to discuss their relationships with the lobbyists; Mr. Rubin, the company's spokesman, said that DHB, ''like many other companies, has engaged lobbying firms to help it understand federal government contracts and to facilitate working relationships.''
 It is unclear whether the Pentagon was aware or concerned about quality-control problems at DHB, and the entire industry it inhabits, in recent years. In 2002, the New York Police Department returned 6,400 Point Blank vests to DHB for replacement after state government tests showed that some of the vests were defective. DHB said it believed that the vests it sold to the police department were ''safe and effective.''
 A confrontation in 2003 with a union representing DHB's employees in Florida led to the workers accusing the company of shoddy quality control. The union also filed a complaint with the S.E.C. asserting that DHB had not publicly disclosed that Mr. Brooks's wife, Terry S. Brooks, controlled the company, Tactical Armor Products, that supplied plates used in DHB's vests. The S.E.C. began its investigation of DHB the next year.
 A few small companies dominate the body armor industry, and military publications have described DHB as the largest supplier of bulletproof vests to the Army. One of its former leading competitors for military vest contracts, Second Chance Body Armor Inc., was forced into bankruptcy in 2004 after state governments and police associations sued it for supplying police officers with what they said were defective vests.
 At the heart of those cases was a material called Zylon, made solely by a Japanese company, Toyobo, and billed by it as having greater tensile strength than Kevlar or steel. But lawsuits filed against Second Chance and other companies that use Zylon, including DHB, contend that Zylon degrades when exposed to heat and moisture.
 The suits, all of which are in the process of being settled, contend that Toyobo notified the companies in the late 1990's of possible problems with Zylon but that the companies, including DHB, kept selling vests made from it. Second Chance documents uncovered in the litigation shed light on how that company weighed its responsibilities as Zylon-related failures began emerging.
 According to a letter sent by Richard C. Davis, the president of Second Chance, to his board in 2002, the company could ''continue operating as though nothing is wrong until one of our customers is killed or wounded,'' which he said was undesirable because once someone died in a Zylon vest, then ''we will be forced to make excuses as to why we didn't recognize and correct the problem.''
 Mr. Davis said Second Chance's other option was to stop making the vests completely and offer upgrades to customers. According to one of the lawsuits filed against it, Second Chance did not notify police officials of the Zylon problems and offer them upgrades until a year after Mr. Davis wrote that letter.
 Second Chance referred all questions about the company to Armor Holdings, another body armor company that bought most of its assets out of bankruptcy. An Armor Holdings spokesman declined to comment on issues involving Second Chance's Zylon-related liabilities, which he said Armor Holdings did not assume when it bought the company's assets.
 The Armor Holdings spokesman said that the company still believed that vests made from Zylon were sound, and Toyobo has stated that it stands by its product. But the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Justice Department that certifies the safety of vests used in law enforcement, said last August that it would no longer approve Zylon vests.
 DHB said that none of the vests it had supplied to the military contain Zylon and that it, too, believes that Zylon-based vests it sold to police officers and other law enforcement officials remain safe. But it is replacing those vests anyhow, it said, in order to comply with the new federal guidelines against Zylon.
 For whatever complications have arisen in Mr. Brooks's industry because of questions about the safety of bulletproof vests, his representatives say that the riches he has reaped are rewards for his prescience about the industry's potential. Mr. Brooks unearthed that opportunity after the S.E.C. barred him from his earlier profession.
 In 1992, according to S.E.C. records, regulators charged Mr. Brooks, who was 37 at the time, and his brother, Jeffrey Brooks, with ''recklessly'' failing to prevent an employee at a brokerage firm they ran from ''engaging in illegal trading activity.'' The commission said that an employee had been buying and selling well-known media stocks using inside information as part of a scheme engineered with a Morgan Stanley analyst. The S.E.C. said that the Brooks brothers and the firm they controlled, Jeffrey Brooks Securities, aided the scheme and that David Brooks copied the insider trades made by his employee, pulling in about $291,000 in illicit profits for himself and the firm.
 Without admitting or denying charges that the commission filed against them in a civil complaint, David and Jeffery Brooks agreed to pay a $405,000 joint penalty. The S.E.C. also banned David Brooks from associating with any brokerage or investment firm for five years. Jeffrey Brooks, who later became one of DHB's early and largest shareholders, declined to respond to a request for an interview.
 David Brooks found a way around this setback by using a publicly traded holding company he controlled, DHB, to buy Point Blank three years later, adding the troubled body armor concern to a small stable of companies that also included an orthopedics products supplier and a maker of sports gear, according to public filings. Today, body armor accounts for 98 percent of DHB's sales.
 From the outset, DHB has struggled with management issues. DHB was sometimes late in filing financial records with regulators; was governed by just five directors (two of whom were Mr. Brooks and another DHB executive) who met irregularly; and has had three outside auditors resign since 2001.
 When one of the auditors, Grant Thornton, resigned in 2003, it notified DHB's board that there were ''deficiencies'' in internal control procedures relating to the preparation of the company's financial statements, according to securities filings. Grant Thornton also expressed reservations about ''understaffing'' in DHB's accounting and finance department. When yet another firm, Weiser LLP, gave up its auditing duties early last year, it told DHB that it was concerned about ''deficiencies'' in the way DHB priced its inventory.
 Not to worry, DHB says. Gary Nadelman, a member of the company's audit committee, said in an e-mail message that DHB ''believes that its internal controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that its financial statements and public disclosures are materially accurate.''
 THE DHB board, which has been expanded to seven members and still includes Mr. Brooks, has granted unusually generous perks to the company's founder. Under a 1996 employment agreement approved by the board's compensation committee, Mr. Brooks was entitled to annual bonuses equal to 10 percent of DHB's profits each year. That was replaced in 1997 by a new plan granting him annual reimbursement for business and personal expenses up to 10 percent of DHB's profits. DHB also reimburses Mr. Brooks for all expenses associated with a residence and office he uses in Florida. The company also reimburses Mr. Brooks' children for a jet they own whenever DHB uses it for business purposes (a bill that amounted to about $860,000 in 2004).
 In the summer of 2004, DHB's compensation committee repealed the portion of Mr. Brooks's employment agreement that entitled him to a 10 percent cut of corporate profits for his business and personal expenses. DHB declined to say what precipitated the change, but at the time Mr. Brooks had rung up about $2 million in personal expenses on DHB credit cards. A spokesman for the company said that Mr. Brooks's debt was offset by money DHB owed him and that the company now considers the personal expenses repaid. Mr. Brooks's wife, Terry, has also had a fruitful relationship with DHB. Her company, Tactical Armor Products, sold $18 million worth of body armor components to DHB in 2004, according to securities filings. Although Tactical Armor is characterized as an outside supplier in DHB's filings, it manufactures some of its products in a Tennessee plant that DHB owns. Tactical Armor paid DHB about $40,000 in rent and bought about $7 million in raw materials from the company in 2004.
 ''These related-party transactions have been publicly disclosed and carefully evaluated by independent directors of the board, who were satisfied that the terms of all transactions were fair to the company,'' said Mr. Rubin, DHB's spokesman.
 The head of DHB's compensation committee, Jerome Krantz, a life insurance underwriter with the Krantz Financial Group, declined to be interviewed. In response to questions about Mr. Brooks's compensation, Mr. Nadelman, who is also a compensation committee member, said in an e-mail message that DHB's board had exercised proper judgment.
 ''The overarching responsibility of the board is to provide oversight and create management incentives for the successful operation of the company and to build long-term shareholder value,'' he wrote. ''The company thinks they have done this very well.''
 On Friday, DHB shares closed at $4.95, down 70 percent from their 52-week high of $16.59. ''We live and work in extremely difficult, often threatening times,'' DHB notes on one of its body armor Web sites. ''We never forget that our customers rely on us to protect their lives.''

HEADLINE: Exporting Expertise, If Not Much Else

BYLINE: By DANIEL ALTMAN

 BODY:
WANT to understand what's really happening in the American economy? Wade into the sea of numbers that pour out of Washington's prolific statistical agencies. They describe some disturbing changes.
 You can look at the economy in two ways: by production, or by people. The two aren't always the same, because the amount of stuff that a given worker can generate in a given industry changes over time. This is clear when you look carefully at the biggest long-term trend in the economy: the decline of manufacturing.
Both of manufacturing's two big categories, durable goods (like cars and cable TV boxes) and nondurable goods (like pastrami and pantyhose), have plunged, but the exact trends have differed. 
 From 1965 to 2005, the percentage of payroll employees devoted to durable goods dropped to 8 percent, from 19 percent; over the same period, the share of the economy they represent shrank by just four percentage points. In other words, workers in these industries became a lot more productive as their numbers dwindled.
 The picture was different for nondurable goods. In that category, the employees' share of the nation's labor force also declined steeply, by nine percentage points, to just 5 percent of the total. But nondurables' share of the economy dropped by even more, by 10 percentage points. If there were productivity gains, they were small enough to be obscured by quality and price changes.
 Most of the losses in nondurable production had already occurred by the early 1990's. That's not too surprising, when you think about it: the nation's agriculture had become about as efficient as it could be, and clothing imports from developing countries like China, Bangladesh and Mauritius were in full swing.
 The story for durable goods is more troubling. Half of the decline in production has been a legacy of the last recession: sales went down, and they have stayed down. 
 The situation is a first, and it has been reflected in the labor market, too. After the four recessions that occurred between 1973 and 1991, payroll employment for the manufacturing of durable goods dropped to about 10 million. But after the 2001 recession, it sank below nine million and hasn't picked up.
 Increases in productivity could account for some of the lost jobs. But in a recent working paper, William D. Nordhaus, a professor of economics at Yale, surmised that productivity improvements in manufacturing had not pulled down employment across the entire sector, because the gains stimulated overall demand by making finished goods cheaper. 
 The explanation may lie instead in the world's emerging economies. They saturated the American market with nondurables in the 1980's and early 90's, using the profits to move onto higher-value, durable items.
 The change in the trend for durable goods was not the only worrisome legacy of the last recession. In the information sector, which had been among the most steadily growing areas of the labor market, growth has completely stalled after taking a dive in 2001 and 2002. The relatively small industries of broadcasting and Internet publishing have started upward again. But in print publishing, telecommunications and Internet services, the trend has been absolutely flat, despite the economy's return to regular growth. 
 Of course, there have been winners, too. The share of the economy devoted to medical care services has grown by eight percentage points in the past four decades, with commensurate changes in employment. But this isn't necessarily great news for the economy. With exceptions like online consultations and robotic surgery, medical care services are not as easy to export as, for example, medical equipment.
 The leisure and recreational industries have also expanded, with the share of employment up by four percentage points. Here, too, exporting is difficult: after all, gambling, artistic performances and restaurant dinners usually take place on site. 
 More promising, management and professional services like law and finance resumed their strong growth after taking a hit in the recession. These areas are the ripest for exporting. Need some business advice? No problem. Want some derivatives structured? Great. First, however, we need to train those consultants and bankers.
 In the past, the United States profitably exported products of all types, from basic textiles to the latest surgical machinery. Now, it seems, the economy is coming to rely more on the highest-value services and sophisticated manufacturing. We are becoming a nation of advisers, fixers, entertainers and high-tech engineers, with a lucrative sideline in treating our own illnesses.
 The change is being forced on us by global competition and our own aptitudes. The first step in dealing with it is to realize what's happening. The second, most likely, is to prepare for more of the same.

HEADLINE: A Closer Walk With Thee

BYLINE: By Sarah M. Broom. 
Sarah M. Broom is on the editorial staff of O magazine.

 BODY:
Before Aug. 29, my Creole mother, Ivory, six siblings and 13 nieces and nephews lived in my hometown, New Orleans. Today I have two brothers left in all of Louisiana. In New York, where I live, I've been homesick down to my gut and susceptible to every feeling of helplessness. So when I heard about a street parade in New Orleans on the Saturday after Thanksgiving -- a parade to give thanks -- I booked a ticket right then. But I was afraid of what I would find, and of what I might not be able to find anymore.
I'm in my rented S.U.V., coming from the airport on Friday afternoon, when I see the first wrecked house. I am less shocked by the car in someone's living room, or by the abundance of tennis shoes and boats on the tops of bent fences, than I am by the absence of people. I notice that the tires are too damn loud. Why am I driving on pebbles? 
 I tour the streets -- Marigny, Roman, Burgundy, Mirabeau -- with John Coltrane. He is chanting, ''A love supreme, a love supreme. . .,'' when I see two people in masks and blue bodysuits cleaning out their homes. They wave, and I return the gesture. The only other movement that day is from a pack of scraggly dogs fighting over a plastic-foam to-go plate. When my car approaches, they don't bother to look up. They're hungry. 
 There's an evening curfew in the city, and with the encouragement of the patrolling National Guard, I head for Saint Rose, La., to my dead grandmother Amelia's house, 24 miles away, where my brother Carl now lives. I have to pass along St. Charles Avenue, where MTV's Real World was filmed and where most of the old-money mansions appear unscathed. I notice that one family is having a tea party on their porch. I feel an abiding sadness at my core. 
 The next day is the parade. I show up alone at 10 a.m. in front of Sweet Lorraine's, the jazz club, to join the crowds, some dressed to the nines in gold suits with shiny mahogany shoes. I spend an hour talking smack: ''Where y'at?'' ''How's your mom and them?'' ''You gone cut up out here or what?'' But soon the band chants, ''Feet can't fail me now.'' And I don't believe they can. The tuba player is in front of me; I clap hard to match his beat. Then, after we have danced wild, the Hot 8 Brass Band plays ''Just a Closer Walk With Thee'': Daily walking close to Thee/Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.
 The trumpet wails its slow, sweet and with-plenty rhythm, just as Jelly Roll Morton once directed. It is a funeral dirge, and on the street we're swaying through there is barely a house standing. My heart is breaking into slivers. I fall off beat because I have to navigate piles of belongings: a moldy shoe, a brightly-dressed Barbie doll, a sewing machine. 
 At 1 p.m. we are three hours into a parade that will leave us at the foot of the Mississippi River. To break up the dancing, and to help the economy, we stop at bars along the parade route. By the time we make it to the river, I have had three rum-and-Cokes, which I drink out of plastic cups. I have also had a bowl of red beans and rice, which someone in a house with electricity has cooked for passers-by. At 3 in the afternoon, for the first time today, we start to feel our tired feet. So we limp. But it is worth it. 
 And I want more. A native has whispered that the Mardi Gras Indians, who dress regal in hand-sewn Indian costumes during Mardi Gras, are practicing their chants the next day. The location is Tchoupitoulas and Napoleon Avenue, at a bar called Tipitina's. The Indians are mostly African-American working people; there's a Big Chief, and young boys in clean sneakers with drums and tambourines play the beat. Imagine 15 sweating men with hard voices standing in a semi-circle, singing bare-bones songs. I think of the Haitian, the Creole, the Spanish, the voodoo, the Italian, in New Orleans history. It's as if I am at Congo Square in 1865, watching Marie Laveau, voodoo priestess, twirl in a spirit dance. 
 Near curfew, one man begins to sing. ''Mighty cooty-fiyo,'' he calls. Tambourines rattle out a snake hiss. And then they chant in unison: ''We are Indians/Indians of the nation/The wild, wild creation/We won't kneel down, not on the ground.''
 As they sing, they change the words: ''We won't kneel down'' becomes ''We won't bow down.'' ''The ground'' becomes ''the dirty ground.''
 I call my brother Michael in Texas and leave a taste of drum music on his voice mail. Outside it is pitch black -- because it's night, but also because the electricity is still out. Out there is an awful quiet. 
 On my flight back to New York, I hum.

THE PRO-GROWTH PROGRESSIVE
 An Economic Strategy for Shared Prosperity.
 By Gene Sperling.
 354 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.95.
IF you were inclined to identify Clintonism with a single person other than the big man himself, that person might well be Gene Sperling -- a top campaign adviser in 1992; a tireless advocate of fiscal discipline during the first term; an inveterate policy wonk throughout all eight years of the administration. So it's little surprise that this book-length vision for a Democratic economic strategy can best be described as Clintonism 2.0. 
 More than anything else, ''The Pro-Growth Progressive'' embodies the neoliberal idea that all problems are solvable if we just set aside ideology and focus on what works. Sperling notes at the outset that resolving trade-related issues requires ''deep, honest exploration that does not easily fit within any right-left, pro-globalization-anti-globalization perspective.'' Later he writes that ''neither progressives nor conservatives have articulated a vision for retirement security'' that guarantees a reasonable nest egg while also helping workers invest in equities. Much of the book employs this third-way tone. Yet while Sperling appears to chide both sides equally, his book functions primarily as a useful reproach to progressives who believe that ideological purity requires rejecting market-friendly means. 
 Democrats have little to lose and everything to gain by embracing the hallmarks of a dynamic economy (like freer trade or widespread stock ownership) and by promoting policies that help individuals help themselves (like replacing welfare with tax credits to encourage the poor to work). The first is a concession to irreversible economic trends, the second a concession to political and budgetary reality. 
 Sperling's ideas are unfailingly sound. He proposes linking economic aid for single men to responsible fatherhood; and starting a universal, government-financed 401(k) program. One of Sperling's more ingenious ideas is to devise a system so that aid for people displaced by foreign trade isn't merely reactive. Today the government doesn't get involved until a textile mill closes. Sperling suggests retraining workers as soon as it's clear their factory isn't viable, so that they have years, not weeks, to prepare for a new career. 
 The problem with all this is that Sperling is fighting the last war. The differences between big-government progressives and pro-growth progressives like himself defined politics during the 1990's. But they've since been swamped by the differences between all Democrats (and even moderate Republicans) on the one hand, and the Bush administration on the other. Sperling takes on a group of liberals he calls the ''Three Bobs'' -- the former labor secretary Robert Reich, the journalist Robert Kuttner and Robert Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future -- who don't worry as much as he does about deficits. But it's safe to say that given the opportunity to reduce the deficit by repealing Bush's tax cuts, every liberal in the country would leap at the chance. 
 Today, what divides most Democrats on economic questions isn't ideological; it's tactical. On one side are those who believe Democrats must devote their energy to blocking what they consider a dangerous, even radical Republican agenda. Those on the other side believe Democrats should engage the White House and hammer out deals agreeable to both sides. Sperling places himself firmly in the second camp. But in the present context, this position comes off as a little quaint. 
 The central assumption behind Sperling's engagement ethos is that both sides will negotiate honestly. Thus, he writes that responsible budgeting involves balancing the desire for goodies like tax cuts and spending with the economic benefits that flow from lower deficits. He concludes that we should all make ''a good-faith effort to strike this balance.'' Certainly, we all should. But by this point in Bush's tenure, it's pretty clear that the White House is not negotiating in good faith. The multiple Bush tax cuts, the prescription drug plan, bankruptcy reform, tort reform, Social Security reform -- all follow the same playbook: embrace the proposals of your corporate donors, then use a combination of procedural tricks and political hardball to ram them through Congress. 
 Bush's 2003 tax cut provides a textbook example. In May of that year, the Republican House passed a package of generally upper-income tax cuts costing about $550 billion over a decade. The Republican-controlled Senate then passed a similar tax cut costing $350 billion, mostly thanks to a few Democrats and Republican moderates who felt pressured to support them because of Bush's popularity in their home states. Finally, the Republicans reconciled the divergent bills using a series of phase-ins and phase-outs that kept the official cost at $350 billion but that everyone in Congress knew would be disregarded. Tom DeLay, then the House majority leader, even boasted to The Times that he was happy to accept the Senate price cap because ''numbers don't mean anything.'' In this context, engagement simply enables the Republicans to take Democrats for a ride. 
 To be fair, Sperling does criticize the excesses of the Bush era. His attack on White House fiscal policy is lucid and devastating. Ditto his dissection of the president's Social Security plan. But these discussions only serve to make his faith in the power of earnest, bipartisan compromise all the more mystifying. ''Where it is clear that a progressive program is fatally flawed,'' Sperling writes, ''progressives should take the lead in calling for eliminating that failed program and instituting an effective one.'' Progressives, he adds, should set aside their ''legitimate fear that any admission of error will be used to undermine the entire policy position.'' But he cites no evidence that this would work, that this administration wouldn't simply take an admission of error as a reason to slash programs even further. On the contrary, almost every time Sperling recounts a hard-earned Clinton administration victory, he concludes by noting that Bush subsequently scaled back the program or eliminated it altogether. 
 Sperling clings throughout to a ''good policy is good politics'' outlook. For example, he says Democrats could pay for his universal 401(k) proposal by partly reinstating the tax on wealthy estates that Republicans have repealed. ''This should not be a hard sell,'' he says. ''In the average state, only those 200 taxpayers with the absolute richest estates would pay somewhat higher taxes than under President Bush's proposal.'' But that raises the question: How could Congress have passed legislation in the first place whose only beneficiaries are each state's wealthiest people? This is the question the Bush administration has forced Democrats to grapple with. 
 Gene Sperling is thoughtful, hard working, well intentioned and wickedly smart. Reading his book gives me pangs of nostalgia for the days when he and his colleagues ran the country. But the same approach that works when you're in power doesn't necessarily work when you're completely shut out of it. Is this really the time for statesmanship? Sadly, Democrats may be better off embracing bare-knuckle politics.

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble on Disappointing Earnings

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market had its biggest losses since 2003 on Friday, resulting in weekly declines that left the Dow Jones industrial average in negative territory for the year to date. Other major market averages remained in the black for 2006, however. 
 The market was depressed by earnings announcements from a series of companies, including G.E., Citigroup, Intel, Yahoo and Apple Computer, that did not meet analysts' expectations. Shares of Google fell more than 14 percent for the week. The company has resisted a Justice Department subpoena for information on Web searches conducted by millions of its customers.
The cost of oil, which has plagued the market on and off for many months, did so again last week. The price of a barrel of crude oil rose in New York to $68.35 a barrel, from $63.92 the previous week.
 For the week, the Dow fell 292.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 10,667.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 26.12 points, or 2 percent, to close at 1,261.49. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 69.34 points, or 3 percent, to close at 2,247.70.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note closed at 4.35 percent, unchanged from the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Is the Fourth Year a Charm for the Bull Market?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
SO far, this bull market appears to be sticking to the traditional script. But investors who have made money in domestic stocks in each of the last three years shouldn't bank on a happy ending just yet.
 Bull markets often follow a predictable pattern. In the first year of a rally, bulls tend to charge out of the gate: the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has posted rip-snorting price gains of 38 percent, on average, in the initial year of bull markets since 1942, according to a recent study by S.& P.
This is typically followed by a more subdued second year, with the S.& P. 500 up around 12 percent, on average. And in the third year, the rally starts to sputter, with average gains of just 3 percent.
 This is close to the way the last three years have unfolded -- with the S.& P. up more than 26 percent in 2003, 9 percent in 2004 and 3 percent last year. 
 So how do stocks perform once bulls like this one enter their fourth year? The short answer is that they tend ''to catch a second wind,'' said Sam Stovall, S.& P.'s chief investment strategist. Over the last 63 years, the S.& P. 500 has soared 14 percent, on average, in the fourth year of a bull market. 
 There are a number of possible explanations for this late-stage surge. For example, investors who lack conviction may see the lackluster gains -- or, in some cases, losses -- generated in the third year of bull markets as a reason to head for the exits. In that way, Mr. Stovall said, third years tend to ''shake off all the loose hands'' just in time for the fourth, leaving the most persistent investors to give the market another boost. 
 Investors may not know what to think this year. While the Dow is down nearly half a percent, the S.& P. 500 is up more than 1 percent, the Nasdaq composite index is up 2 percent and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks is up nearly 5 percent.
 ''That's the good news,'' said James Stack, editor of InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter published in Whitefish, Mont. ''But there's also bad news.'' In four of the last seven fourth years of bull markets, stocks disappointed: in one of those instances, they lost value, and three times they posted only modest single-digit gains. 
 In the overall averages, however, such duds have been masked by three spectacular fourth years in which gains were about 30 percent. The most recent was the fourth year of the bull market that began in August 1982. 
 What type of year is in store for the market now? Mr. Stovall, for one, predicts a somewhat below-average year, with single-digit gains.
 Note that the current bull market started on Oct. 10, 2002, the day after the S.& P. 500 sank to 776.76. So the fourth year technically started on Oct. 10, 2005, not the beginning of 2006. Use the October starting point, and you find that the S.& P. has already surged more than 6 percent. How much farther can this bull run?
 Mr. Stack says that better-than-average fourth years of bull markets have tended to have something in common: ''There was either a recession or a significant market correction in the prior three years,'' he said, ''that helped ease some of the imbalances that develop in an aging bull market.'' 
 As long as they don't set off new bear markets, such midcycle setbacks can help bulls recharge their batteries, he said. But because the current bull market hasn't faced such a correction -- despite geopolitical uncertainties, natural disasters and record energy prices -- big risks remain. 
 This is true of most bull markets: as they age, risks increase for investors. Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors in Philadelphia, warned that market blowups ''are common in the second half of a cycle.'' 
 That would explain why many bulls don't survive through a fourth year. In the last 75 years, the average length of a bull market has been 3.7 years, according to InvesTech Research. The median is even shorter, at 3.2 years.
 How can stock investors reduce risk in the fourth year of this bull market? Here are some ideas:

FOCUS ON HIGH-QUALITY, DIVIDEND-PAYING STOCKS -- Typically, bull markets begin with investors betting on big gains in speculative stocks. But as bulls mature, attention shifts to shares of higher-quality companies.
 A study of bull markets going back to 1900 by Ned Davis Research, an investment research and advisory firm in Venice, Fla., seems to bear this out. An index constructed for the study showed that in the first third of bull markets, stocks that pay dividends tend to trail those that don't pay them. In the middle third, the dividend payers lead slightly, but in the final third, dividend payers, on average, win handily.
 Alan F. Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones, the brokerage firm based in St. Louis, says that ''you should not own investments today that you would not want to own in a recession tomorrow.'' And while ''quality bounces back,'' he said, ''speculative investments fall and sometimes never recover.'' 

DON'T FORGET THE BLUE CHIPS -- It's true that small-capitalization stocks tend to beat large caps in all phases of bull markets. But Ned Davis Research found that the outperformance of small stocks tended to wane in the final stage of a bull market. For instance, small caps have historically beaten large caps by a significant margin in the first third of a rally; by the final stage, that lead shrinks by two-thirds.
 This time around, Mr. Kleintop says he thinks that large caps can wrestle away market leadership from smaller stocks. For starters, small caps have beaten large caps for more than five years. And large caps are cheaper than small caps on a price-to-earnings basis, even though blue-chip earnings grew faster than small-company profits last year.

PLAY A LITTLE DEFENSE -- Two sectors that tend to excel during fourth years of bull markets, Mr. Stovall said, are health care and consumer staples. Neither depends on robust consumer spending in order to prosper.
 Since 1942, the consumer-staples sector has shot up 26 percent, on average, in fourth years, while health care has jumped 31 percent. 
 A third sector that typically does well late in bull markets is technology. But strategists say investors may want to focus on tech stocks trading at lower P/E ratios, in case stocks pull back in the middle of the year. ''The time to swing for the fences is in the first year of a bull market,'' Mr. Stack said. But ''when you get to the fourth years, it's time to settle for singles.''

HEADLINE: It Pays to Have a Smart Child, but It Can Cost, Too

BYLINE: By JULIE BICK

 BODY:
WHEN Reed Molbak was 7 years old and living in Kansas City, Mo., his parents took him to hear a visiting Columbia physics professor lecture about string theory. Reed listened with interest. If space is like fabric, he wondered, can it tear? Even in preschool, he was the one doing the tearing -- through books on how things worked -- and now, at 13, he enjoys theoretical physics. Along the way, his family has spent more than $100,000 on testing, counseling, science experiments and software -- and on enrolling him in a variety of schools and learning programs.
 ''Intellectually gifted'' may have a variety of definitions. But assuming that people scoring in the top 10 percent of intelligence tests meet the criteria, the country has millions of gifted children -- and many opportunities for them, especially if parents are willing to pay the bill.
At the Robinson Center for Young Scholars at the University of Washington, psychologists meet with parents about educational goals and test a child's intelligence for fees of up to $756. Students in 5th through 10th grade who score in the top 3 percent on standardized tests may, for $700, attend a challenging summer course with their intellectual peers. 
 At Stanford, the Education Program for Gifted Youth offers classes via computer; students work at home, communicating with a tutor, for $350 to $700 a course each quarter. Children in these kinds of specialized programs sometimes become excited about learning ''at a level their parents have never seen before,'' said Ray Ravaglia, the program's deputy director. 
 ''They really hit their stride,'' he added.
 Some parents find these programs enriching for smart children who are bored with their usual schoolwork. Other parents may sign them up for the chess club, the debate team or another extracurricular activity at their regular schools, in part to find other parents with whom they can discuss educational and social issues. Or the parents may simply want to find playmates who will understand their child's jokes. 
 Whatever their motivation, parents can find that the cost of the care and feeding of a prodigy, starting with testing, may quickly run into the thousands of dollars.
 Dr. Deborah L. Ruf, author of ''Losing Our Minds: Gifted Children Left Behind,'' found that the first expense for some families of gifted children may be for an assessment to discover what is ''wrong'' with a child who, teachers complain, has been disruptive or not focused in class. ''The parents often find out the child isn't paying attention,'' she said, ''because they already know everything that is being taught.'' 
 The students may take a combination of achievement tests, measuring what they know, and aptitude tests, measuring verbal and numerical ability. The bill for such tests generally goes to the parents. ''There's lots of funding for kids who aren't keeping up in school,'' Dr. Ruf said, ''but if you have a bright child you just get a pat on the head.'' She said she had seen ''families at all economic levels prioritize their budgets to pay for testing, enrichment and learning opportunities.''
 Charles Beckman, director of communications for the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, has noted an uptick in applications to its programs in the last few years, as well as an increase in the number of colleges and for-profit institutions that offer course work for gifted children. 
 ''The No Child Left Behind Act has forced many states to redirect money from gifted education to bringing other kids up to a minimally acceptable skill level,'' he said. ''Cutting the education dollars of tomorrow's leaders, thinkers and doers means more families are looking for ways to have their kids' intellectual needs met outside of school.'' 
 Some 77,000 children in grades 2 through 7 last year paid a $25 to $35 application fee and $29 to $75 to take a test that would qualify them for the Hopkins programs. Ultimately, more than 10,000 of them attended a Hopkins summer course, offered at 23 sites around the country. 
 A typical sleepaway program for a seventh grader costs $2,900 for three weeks, including room and board. Students choose programs that range from genomics to etymology to music theory.
 Eric Viola, a high school freshman in Basking Ridge, N.J., whose family sacrificed other vacation opportunities to finance his Hopkins educational travel program to Montana, said, ''You get to see how stuff actually works instead of reading about it -- like how the physics of water pressure and heat create the geysers at Yellowstone.''
 Some parents also pay air fare, hotel and entry fees to attend conferences (without their children) like the one organized by the California Association for the Gifted. It expects nearly 3,000 at its event in March in Palm Springs; participants will share strategies for gifted education and join a supportive network. 
 Reed's mother, Heidi Molbak, tried home schooling her little string theorist one year, and once enrolled him in language-immersion school to keep him occupied. In fourth grade, he took an online course in expository writing through the Stanford program, which taught concepts typical of a ninth-grade writing course. 
 Reed sent his work electronically to his tutor, who held seminars once a week via headphones and the Internet. ''Distance learning,'' Dr. Ruf said, ''is a great option for kids who are self-motivated and want to go at their own speed.'' Reed has completed his computerized tutoring and now attends a private school.
 Parents of gifted children manage their budgets in different ways. Barbara Poyneer of Renton, Wash., realized that her daughters were gifted when they started playing around with fractions before entering kindergarten. She and her husband chose travel abroad over private school, ''because they could soak up so much,'' she said. Today one daughter, who is 32, holds a B.A. in physics from Johns Hopkins, and the other, 30, a Rhodes scholar who attended Oxford and M.I.T., is earning her Ph.D.
 TO be sure, some in the education field say they believe that private programs for gifted children are unnecessary. Nancy Siegel, head guidance counselor at Millburn High School in Millburn, N.J., advises parents to resist overprogramming children. If a high school does not offer many advanced-placement classes, ''the student can look for a great internship or writing contest or independent project to show their stuff,'' she said. ''There is no need to enroll in expensive programs hoping it will get your child into a top college.''
 Others go so far as to doubt that gifted programs are beneficial for children. ''It's important to give kids normal experiences that are typical for children of that age,'' said Prof. Perry Prestholdt, who taught psychology at Louisiana State University before retiring last month. ''Unique and expensive opportunities can imbue these kids with a false sense of privilege.''
 According to Dr. Ruf, gifted programs may make a child feel advantaged, but they also offer the challenge and competition of the real world, so that youngsters ''realize they aren't always going to be the smartest one in the room.'' 
 And parents of gifted children can find some resources that won't take a big bite out of a retirement plan. American Mensa, a nonprofit organization of adults scoring in the top 2 percent of standardized intelligence tests, is seeking to attract ''Young Mensans.'' If a family lives near an active chapter, a $30 application fee and yearly dues of $52 will provide it with national and local newsletters that list events. 
 Adult Mensans are often eager to help younger ones, said Laura Loos, children's program coordinator for the greater New York chapter, whose members helped to plan free backstage trips to theaters and to a zoo to see how displays are created. 
 ''We want to expand the horizons of gifted children because schools aren't doing it for them anymore,'' she said. ''Our country is going to fall behind because we are ignoring our future scientists, entrepreneurs and leaders.''
 Other free resources include Web sites like HoagiesGifted.org, for the Hoagies' Gifted Education Page; it offers connections to mailing lists, message boards and Web logs as well as other information for parents, educators and children. 
 Whatever resources they use, Ms. Molbak encourages parents to make a serious commitment. ''We try to have as normal a life as possible,'' she said, ''but at the same time, it's important to take charge of your child's education.'' She added that ''if the schools can't challenge your child, you need to figure out how to do it.''

HEADLINE: Behind Every Underachiever, An Overpaid Board?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IF the executive pay proposal floated last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission comes to pass, shareholders may finally be able to fathom just how cleanly their pockets are being picked by me-first managers. And who knows? Maybe more shareholders will do something to try to stop the insanity.
 It is indeed one of life's mysteries why so many institutional stockholders have stayed silent on the subject of outrageous pay, lo these many years. We are talking real money, after all: Lucien A. Bebchuk, professor of law, economics and finance at Harvard Law School and director of its program on corporate governance, said compensation paid to the top five executives at all public companies in the three years ending in 2003 reached 10 percent of those companies' earnings. 
One institutional investor who has been shouting from the rooftops about this shareholder robbery is Daniel J. Steininger, chairman of the Catholic Funds, a mutual fund company in Milwaukee. At dozens of annual shareholder meetings in recent years, he and his team have spoken out against excessive pay. This year they will be back again.
 Rather than attack the recipients, however, Mr. Steininger will focus this year on corporate directors, the people signing off on the giveaways. They are supposed to be working for the shareholders, of course, but in too many cases directors are lapdogs for management, giving them whatever pay they feel entitled to.
 To address this problem, Mr. Steininger has written a shareholder proposal related to how public company directors are compensated and has muscled it onto the proxy statements of seven companies. The proposal requires that shareholders approve director pay each year and that precise details of the compensation paid to directors -- including charitable contributions and other perquisites that involve the use of company assets -- be made public annually.
 The companies whose shareholders will vote on the proposal later this year are Bank of New York, Cendant, Exxon Mobil, Home Depot, Honeywell, Merrill Lynch and SBC Communications, now known as AT&T. 
 ''The theory of our resolution is that if shareholders set the pay for directors, there would be more honesty and integrity,'' Mr. Steininger said. ''Directors themselves would feel more accountable to shareholders, rather than to the C.E.O. and whatever consulting firm he hires to aid and abet the setting of high directors' fees.''
 Too many boards remain stacked with top management's pals, Mr. Steininger said. He cited an academic study from 2002 by Ivan E. Brick, Oded Palmon and John K. Wald at Rutgers Business School in Newark and New Brunswick, which concluded that excessive executive pay was associated with ineffective ''monitoring'' by directors, or ''cronyism.'' The study examined pay at 2,404 businesses from 1992 to 1999. Executive pay has risen steadily since then.
 ''We believe that any board that pays excessive C.E.O. compensation fails in one of its most important duties,'' stated Mr. Steininger's proposal to Cendant shareholders. ''There is evidence that directors who enjoy high director compensation are more likely to pay excessive C.E.O. compensation and that high director pay coupled with high C.E.O. pay correlates with underperformance of the company.'' 
 Mr. Steininger identified the seven companies mostly because they underperformed relative to their peers, he said. But another consideration was a grade of D or F for one or more aspects of each board's performance from the Corporate Library, an independent research firm in Portland, Me. 
 Officials at all seven companies either did not respond to questions about the proposal or declined to comment on it. 
 To be sure, director pay at most companies has not reached the obscene levels of C.E.O. compensation, though board members' pay and benefits can be substantial. Mr. Steininger estimated that each director at Bank of New York, for example, will receive $172,000 this year in cash and company stock. Directors at SBC, he estimated, each took in $189,148 last year in cash, stock units and telecommunications and satellite television equipment and services.
 Even in the mainstream, however, director pay is rising quickly. A study published on Jan. 10 by the Corporate Library noted that individual director pay at more than 2,000 companies jumped 16.5 percent last year, on average. Total board pay at these companies reached $801,000 last year, a 20 percent increase, according to the study. 
 At many companies, it is surprisingly tough to determine exactly what directors receive for their board work, Mr. Steininger said. ''You really have to sift through this -- travel, accident insurance, charities that benefit by their directorships -- there is a whole raft of other things,'' he said. ''It is written in obscure language deliberately. I have a full-time lawyer working on this.''
 Additional companies could have been targets, Mr. Steininger said, but for the fact that he has only six people on his advocacy team. 
 ''Pay without performance has been tracked and studies show an absolute correlation between excessive C.E.O. pay and underperformance,'' Mr. Steininger said. ''Any director should be reading the same things we're reading. It's pretty clear there is a fundamental problem with the way directors do not exercise their fiduciary duties.''
 Company boardrooms remain far too clubby for their shareholders' good. It is unfortunate that in 2006 directors still have to be told who their real bosses are. Perhaps making their pay subject to shareholder approval would awaken some directors to what can only be described as their misplaced loyalties.

HEADLINE: My Father's Abortion War

BYLINE: By Eyal Press. 
Eyal Press is a writer who lives in New York. This article is adapted from his book, ''Absolute Convictions: My Father, a City and the Conflict That Divided America,'' which will be published by Henry Holt in early March.

 BODY:
On Oct. 23, 1998, a Friday evening, at about 6, Barnett Slepian, an obstetric gynecologist from Amherst, N.Y., called my parents' home. He was phoning because, that weekend, as on every third weekend of the month, he was scheduled to cover deliveries for my father. A few hours later, after attending a memorial service commemorating the death of his father, as he stood in his kitchen waiting for a bowl of split-pea soup to heat in the microwave, Dr. Slepian was shot in the back by a sniper hiding in the wooded area behind his home. Within a few hours he was pronounced dead. 
I found out about the murder the next morning, after having breakfast with an old friend from college. I was living in Brooklyn at the time. When I first heard the news, my heart stopped. I had never met Barnett Slepian, but I was well aware of who he was. I knew that he and my father shared something besides covering for each other on certain weekends: both were OB-GYN's who devoted part of their practices to performing abortions, which is why, for more than a decade, they had both been subjected to abrasive treatment -- protests in front of their offices and homes, harassment of their patients, death threats. I had witnessed some of this firsthand while growing up. I'd like to say that standing there in the street trying to make sense of the fact that now someone had made good on one of those threats, the first thing I felt was anguish and sympathy for Slepian's family: his wife, Lynne, who had just lost her husband, and his four sons, who had watched their father bleed to death on the kitchen floor. But my initial reaction was more selfish. What I felt at first was fear -- that the murder might upend my parents' lives; that another shooting might follow in its wake.
 More than seven years have passed since that morning, and viewed one way, everything about the abortion conflict in the intervening period has changed. The mood of futility and desperation that fueled the violence aimed at abortion providers in the mid-90's -- a spate of attacks that left six doctors and clinic workers dead -- appears to have lifted somewhat, which is perhaps one reason the attacks have abated. The number of abortions performed in America has steadily declined. Among right-to-life advocates, the focus of energy has shifted from the doorways of clinics to the corridors of Congress, which in 2003 passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and the Supreme Court, where, with the addition of Samuel A. Alito Jr., two presumably sympathetic new justices will be in place. Abortion remains legal in all 50 states, but on this, the 33rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the prospect of the court's curtailing, possibly even overturning, the decision no longer seems far-fetched. 
 Yet there is one thing about the abortion conflict that has remained stubbornly persistent: its centrality and uniquely polarizing place in American life. ''No other nation obsesses about abortion the way we do,'' the columnist Michael Kinsley noted recently. Not Italy, home to the Vatican; not France, England or Germany. Only in America is a medical procedure that was legalized more than three decades ago at risk of once again being criminalized. Only here have doctors routinely taken to wearing bulletproof vests and hiring armed guards for protection.
 My desire to understand what accounts for this did not begin on the morning I learned that Barnett Slepian had been murdered. It started years earlier, as I watched the abortion conflict engulf and divide my hometown, Buffalo -- the City of Good Neighbors, as its boosters liked to say, yet a place where, as in Wichita, St. Louis and countless other communities strewn across the country, the social fabric was rent as the culture wars caught fire. In 1992, six years before the murder, Buffalo played host to the Spring of Life, a campaign of clinic blockades that brought right-to-life demonstrators from throughout the country to western New York. In the years leading up to this, protests and sit-ins erupted on what seemed to be a daily basis in front of abortion clinics and doctors' offices. The unrest clogged the city's court system, pervaded the headlines and thrust elected officials and ordinary citizens -- some sympathetic to the protesters, others infuriated by them -- onto opposing sides of a battle that many of those in the trenches framed as a war long before real bullets started to fly. My father was one target in that war.
 Like many people, I assumed at first that Buffalo was a flash point because of the generations of Irish, Polish and Italian Catholics who had made the city their home through the years and whose faith taught that abortion at any stage of pregnancy, for whatever reason, is wrong. Yet during the 1970's, when the opposition to abortion indeed came almost exclusively from Catholics -- the Catholic Physicians Guild, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo -- the right-to-life movement wasn't terribly radical. There were few street demonstrations back then. There were no blockades or sit-ins. In the local papers, news about abortion was confined to the back pages of the metro section, overshadowed by what seemed to be a far bigger story in Buffalo at the time: the fate not of the unborn but of the city's manufacturing plants, which had begun fleeing western New York in droves.
 The relative calm can be traced partly to the fact that the revolt against Roe v. Wade took time to build. Few people in Buffalo appreciated at the time that by removing the issue from the legislative process, the Supreme Court would leave millions of Americans feeling that they were denied a say over what they viewed as a life-and-death matter. By short-circuiting a debate that was only beginning (not unlike the issue of gay marriage today), Roe would escalate the very conflict it was designed to quell. Another reason the streets were quiet at first is that the Catholic housewives who led the right-to-life movement in its early phase strained to avoid being too pushy or aggressive, not least because they often found themselves accused of trying to impose their religious beliefs on a diverse society. Right-to-life advocates in these years went out of their way to frame their arguments in the language of science, not Scripture. 
 By the mid-1980's, however, the mood was changing, thanks to a development that would transform the face not only of the right-to-life movement but also of modern conservatism and, in turn, America: the political reawakening of evangelicals. Joining the Catholic housewives, born-again Christians started filtering into the movement. Many were in their early 20's and 30's, young women and (increasingly) men fresh out of Bible colleges, often affiliated with charismatic churches whose growth was by no means confined to the Bible Belt. It was such a church, New Covenant Tabernacle, an Assemblies of God congregation situated in a former Jewish funeral home in Tonawanda, a suburb north of Buffalo, that helped to spearhead the clinic blockades in western New York. Its ministers, twin brothers named Rob and Paul Schenck, were personal friends of Randall Terry, a born-again Christian who in 1986 began organizing sit-ins at an abortion clinic in Binghamton. What was new about people like Terry was not that they had found inspiration in the Gospels but that under the influence of evangelical thinkers like Francis Schaeffer, they began waging war against the tide of secular humanism sweeping the culture, something evangelicals of an earlier generation would have considered a waste of time. Terry soon founded Operation Rescue, an organization that turned civil disobedience into the right-to-life movement's signature expression. It is a tactic the new wave of advocates in Buffalo took up with verve. 
 By the time the rescues began, my father had completed his medical residency, spent a few years working at various gynecological clinics run by the Erie County Department of Health and opened a medical office. It was on the ground floor of a two-story redbrick building that bordered a Mobil gas station, on the corner of Kenmore Avenue and Colvin Boulevard. It wasn't an abortion clinic but a regular OB-GYN practice, and most of his patients came for routine gynecological checkups. Many were women whose babies he delivered. Abortions were performed on certain days. 
 As strange as it may seem, my father arranged things this way without considering the political consequences, much less the possibility that doing so might one day bring protesters to his door. This is partly because there were no protesters back in the 70's, when he was completing his professional training. It is also because he had come to Buffalo from another country, Israel, a nation racked since its founding by turmoil and danger -- which my father grew accustomed to weathering with the steely resolve all Israelis of his generation were expected to display -- but not on account of abortion. Until 1977, abortion was banned under Israeli law. Yet it was an open secret that many doctors performed abortions in their private offices. My father had seen that unplanned pregnancies were a reality. It made sense to him that given its intensely private nature, the decision to have an abortion should be left to the pregnant woman and her doctor, not to a government bureaucrat. 
 A shy man whose command of English was (to put it generously) rudimentary, my father took pride in starting his own office. For several years things went smoothly. His volume of patients grew. He was on his way to building a successful practice. Then one day in fall 1987, a group of demonstrators showed up in the parking lot to conduct a mock funeral. A few months later, more protesters appeared, this time to occupy the entrance and prevent any women from passing through. 
 Like several other places in western New York where abortions were performed, my father's office soon began to resemble a battle zone, replete with cameras, police paddy wagons and throngs of demonstrators. In a law-and-order city like Buffalo, a place where residents didn't generally go around breaking the law to get their points across, many people assumed that the turmoil would quickly die down. This is what my father thought. What everyone underestimated was the depth of the protesters' beliefs, absolute convictions rooted not in the cold logic of abstract reasoning but in something altogether more powerful and, in America, pervasive: spiritual faith. 
 Not long ago, I paid a visit to Grand Island, a suburb across the Niagara River from Buffalo, to meet with Mickey Van de Ven, a right-to-life advocate still active in the movement. She greeted me at the entrance to St. Stephen's Church, a sprawling brick edifice on Baseline Road, where she works part time and attends Mass every Sunday. A shy, soft-spoken woman with brown hair, hazel eyes and a warm, matronly manner, Van de Ven directed me into a small white-walled room, where we sat on a pair of light blue armchairs. Between us were a tray of cookies and a thermos full of coffee, which she politely offered me.
 Back in the 80's, Van de Ven started serving as a ''prayer warrior,'' meaning that she stood outside abortion clinics and prayed the rosary. She didn't participate in rescues, she told me -- blocking doorways and being arrested was not for her -- though she supported the people who did. Later she began sidewalk counseling, trying to dissuade women from carrying through with their abortions, something that did not come easily to her, since, as she told me, ''I'm not very forward.'' Sitting next to her, straining at times to hear what she was saying because her voice was so soft, I found it hard to imagine Van de Ven doing any such thing. Her approach was not to scream ''Don't kill your baby!'' at the women passing by, as some protesters did. She preferred asking, ''Can I offer you some information?'' If the woman nodded, she said, she would hand her literature like the pamphlet she gave me explaining the various stages of fetal development. (''I'm here!'' it began. ''At the moment the nuclei of the father's sperm and mother's egg unite a new and unrepeatable human being comes into the world.'')
 I asked Van de Ven if the method was effective. She pulled out a blue spiral notebook and, smiling, showed me photographs of various ''saves'' -- women who decided to carry their pregnancies to term. There was a pretty brown-haired woman holding a blond-haired girl in pigtails. There was a light-skinned African-American infant. Van de Ven stared at the photographs as if the children were her own.
 Afterward, we drove out to Buffalo Womenservices, a fortresslike brick compound on Main Street equipped with 24-hour surveillance cameras and armed guards. It is the abortion clinic where Dr. Slepian once worked. We walked over to an area near a gas station where Van de Ven normally stands. It was a good distance from the clinic, because demonstrators are now forbidden to cross a 15-foot buffer zone protecting entrances. I asked Van de Ven if her routine changed at all during the winter, when people in Buffalo did their best to avoid spending prolonged amounts of time outside. She shook her head. I asked her if it ever occurred to her to quit. She shook her head again, saying that this is what she felt God had called her to do.
 In her quiet, understated way, Mickey Van de Ven is living proof of the dedication and perseverance that religion can inspire. No one who speaks to her can come away doubting that her opposition to abortion is rooted in a desire not to curtail the rights of women but to save what she views as innocent life. The movement she joined was not the first in recent decades to be propelled by faith. Meeting her reminded me in some ways of the civil rights demonstrators I had read about in the historian David L. Chappell's book ''A Stone of Hope,'' people who often came into the movement straight out of churches and who made no secret of the fact that God inspired them. 
 Yet as the scholar Jessica Stern notes, there are two sides to religion -- ''one that is spiritual and universalist, and the other particularist and sectarian.'' The flip side of the desire to rid the world of evil in accordance with your spiritual beliefs is the impulse among some of those convinced of their righteousness to demonize, and in extreme cases to want to eliminate, anyone who does not subscribe to them, something that, as I saw up close in Buffalo, is not a mind-set unique to Islamic fundamentalists. When the police removed protesters from a clinic in Buffalo one time, a spokeswoman for the local branch of Operation Rescue likened them to Nazi storm troopers. When a group of local religious leaders sympathetic to abortion rights held a meeting on another occasion, a protester assailed them as ''ministers of Satan.'' Driving past my father's office while still in high school, I saw the signs emblazoned with his name. ''Murderer!'' ''Baby-Killer!'' On several Jewish holidays, including Yom Kippur and Hanukkah, a group called Project House Call organized demonstrations in front of doctors' homes, choosing as their targets two local physicians who happened to be Jewish: my father and Slepian. Later, during the Spring of Life, radio ads blared, announcing: ''Some doctors deliver babies. Some doctors kill babies!'' My father and several other physicians were singled out by name. On the corner of Maple and Exeter Roads, a quarter-mile or so from my parents' home, a six-foot red banner reading ''Press Kills Children'' was unfurled. In case anyone missed the banner, leaflets were distributed throughout the neighborhood. 
 In his typically stoic manner, my father never complained, but I know the pressure wore on him, as perhaps it would have on anyone. ''Psychologically, it hurt,'' he admitted when I asked him recently what it was like to pass by the protesters every day. I know, too, that he worried about how the unrest might affect his practice. At the time the protests began, he was dividing his time between his own office and a group practice he had joined on Delaware Avenue, near downtown Buffalo. As far as he knew, all the doctors there supported abortion rights. Some even performed abortions on occasion in the city's hospitals. But they didn't do them at the office on Delaware, for reasons every OB-GYN in America is only too conscious of today. ''Death threats, obstruction and broken windows have taken their toll,'' Time magazine reported in a 1992 article chronicling why, despite surveys showing that a large majority of OB-GYN's advocated abortion rights, fewer and fewer performed abortions. There was another, more mundane reason for this, Time noted: ''Many doctors are inclined to see abortion as routine work that's poorly paid by their standards.'' It was true that -- as the protesters never seemed to tire of pointing out -- my father did perform abortions for a fee. But it was also true that, particularly as the turmoil escalated, including abortion in his practice was something he could easily have avoided if money and the stability of his career had been the sole considerations. At one point, after signing an agreement to purchase a 1,600-square-foot office space in a plaza, he received a call from the owner telling him he couldn't sell him the property, since protesters had warned him that doing so would bring large disturbances with it.
 But my father didn't quit; in fact, he grew only more commited. The reason is that, through years of treating women in his practice, he developed some strong convictions of his own about abortion. In a video of one protest at his office, the demonstrators barged through the doors and occupied a waiting room. They sat on the floor and prayed until the police began removing them.
 At one point a patient entered. ''You O.K.?'' a nurse asked her.
 ''No!'' she exclaimed. ''Outside, they were screaming at me!'' 
 ''Oh, don't worry about that,'' my father said, trying to calm her. 
 ''Don't they realize we have a choice?'' she snapped, unappeased. 
 ''I'm just as mad as you,'' he told her. And he was. Nothing upset my father more than to see patients arrive in such a state. Nothing did more to deepen his resolve. 
 Had the women choosing to have abortions in Buffalo been free-love advocates for whom the procedure seemed a mere matter of convenience, he would not have been so angry. But few of the women he saw fit this stereotype. Some were married and living in the suburbs. Others were single moms juggling multiple jobs and struggling to raise families on their own. Some were white, others black; some well educated, others less so. They looked, in short, like a cross-section of Buffalo: ordinary people making hard choices in a world where opportunities were often constrained and not everything went as planned. It was no secret to my father that for many, the decision to have an abortion was a freighted, difficult one. Some cried afterward; others were deeply shaken. But many also thanked him. Not a small number said they had always been firmly opposed to abortion -- until they found themselves in a situation that had led them to make an appointment to have one. It was precisely because choosing to have an abortion was difficult that my father felt that such women deserved sympathy and support, not scorn.
 ''I respect people who are opposed to abortion,'' he said in an interview with Gene Warner, a reporter from The Buffalo News, in November 1988. ''It's their view, their right. But it's unacceptable to me the way they're trying to impose it on other people.'' 
 Of course, the ''other people'' being imposed on included not only his patients but also himself. He reacted to the pressure the way people who feel themselves being pushed into a corner often do. ''It's probably made me more determined,'' he told The News. ''If I think I'm doing something right and somebody's harassing me for that, it will make me more determined.'' 
 He would respond the same way to Dr. Slepian's murder, by which point, in Buffalo as throughout the country, the crowds of protesters had diminished noticeably. Court fines and internal feuding had taken a toll on Operation Rescue. Congress passed and President Clinton signed the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which made blockading the entrance to a facility where abortions were performed a federal crime, effectively bringing the rescue movement to an end. It didn't occur to me at the time that this new law might precipitate a more ominous phase of the conflict -- leading some frustrated advocates to conclude that violence could achieve what civil disobedience had not. Soon, stories broke of doctors and clinic workers being shot in Florida, Massachusetts and Canada. 
 At least one physician in Buffalo saw what was coming. In August 1994, The Buffalo News published a letter by Barnett Slepian. ''The members of the local nonviolent, pro-life community may continue to picket my home,'' he wrote.
 ''They may continue to scream that I am a murderer and a killer when I enter the clinics at which they 'peacefully' exercise their First Amendment Right of freedom of speech.
 ''They may do all of the above to me and other abortion providers in this community. But please don't feign surprise, dismay and certainly not innocence when a more volatile and less restrained member of the group decides to react to their inflammatory rhetoric by shooting an abortion provider.''
 Four years later, the deed he warned might happen did. I flew home to Buffalo on the Monday after Slepian's murder. When my father came home that night, I gave him a hug at the door. He put his briefcase down and shook his head; he looked pale, tired, somber. We sat down for dinner, during which he poked at his food distractedly, preoccupied by incredulity and grief: at the sudden loss of a colleague, at the thought of what Slepian's children and wife, whom my father told me he went to see the previous day, were going through.
 After dinner we went upstairs. ''Dad, you're not a young man anymore,'' I told him. He nodded. ''You've been through a lot'' -- I paused, trying to think of a subtle way to put it -- ''maybe it's time to leave this part of your practice to some younger doctors.''
 There was silence. He cupped his chin in his hands and sighed. Then, looking over in my direction, with weariness but no hint of acquiescence in his eyes, he started telling me about his upbringing in Israel, how he got used to living in a world full of danger and not allowing it to deter him from doing what he felt was right.
 ''It's wrong, wrong,'' he said.
 ''What's wrong?''
 ''To give in to fanatics, to terrorists.''
 The very next morning, around 10, as I was talking to my mother, the phone rang. She picked it up.
 ''Death threat?'' she said. ''Death threat?. . .Excuse me, you'll have to speak with my son.''
 Her hand shook as she passed me the phone. It was a detective from the Police Department. He was calling to inform us that a newspaper in Hamilton, Ontario, which days earlier received a package containing a photograph of Slepian with an X drawn through his face, had just received an anonymous threat that my father was ''next on the list.''
 The next morning, the story that another doctor had received a death threat was splashed across the front page of The Buffalo News. By week's end, my parents were living under 24-hour protection by federal marshals. Their two-story house in the suburbs was converted into a bunker -- cameras on every corner, the shades drawn, an armed guard out front.
 The wave of violence that erupted in the mid-90's did not succeed in extinguishing the entire supply of abortion providers in America. In western New York, Buffalo Womenservices is still operating. A Planned Parenthood clinic in nearby Niagara Falls has been providing abortion services since Dr. Slepian's death. In many cities, including Buffalo, branches of the group Medical Students for Choice have formed to train young physicians to enter the field. As it has throughout the country, the number of abortions performed in the Buffalo area has declined over the past decade, but the reason owes to a host of other factors (fewer overall pregnancies, wider access to birth control, improved sex education) rather than to violence.
 Even so, the years of unrelenting pressure have created a stigma that has pushed abortion, if not into the back alley, then into an increasingly marginalized corner of the medical world. Back in the 70's, two-thirds of all abortions in western New York were performed in hospitals. Today, hardly any are. Between 1992 and 2000, more than 250 hospitals and 300 private practitioners across the country stopped performing abortions. Many others never started. Not long ago, I spoke to a young OB-GYN, a friend of my family's, who belongs to what is perhaps a silent majority of physicians in the field. He told me that he supported abortion rights and that he felt the decision about abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor. But he didn't perform the procedure himself. He had a family to raise, a growing practice and he had watched with open eyes what happened in Buffalo. 
 My father, for his part, is now nearing the end of his career, aware that fewer and fewer physicians are willing to integrate abortion into their practices; that even as the ranks of demonstrators on the streets have thinned, offices like his are fast becoming a thing of the past. The isolation of abortion from mainstream medicine, the preference of many doctors who believe it should be legal to refer women to specialized clinics rather than to serve as providers themselves, distresses him, which I can understand. On the other hand, I can also understand why many doctors prefer to steer clear of the controversy. I have often wondered whether, if I were in their shoes, I would do the same thing.
 The reverberations of the abortion conflict have reached far beyond the medical community, beyond the halls of Congress and beyond protests like the annual March for Life that, as always on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, will take place in Washington this Monday. On a recent trip home, I passed by some vacant storefronts in downtown Buffalo, then drove along the East Side, through a once-stable Polish neighborhood now filled with boarded-up buildings. How different might the city look, I wondered, if some of the passion that over the years had been poured into the abortion conflict had gone instead toward addressing other problems: blighted neighborhoods ravaged by disinvestment and deindustrialization; a child-poverty rate in 2002 of 38.7 percent, the sixth-highest in the nation. 
 Why abortion doesn't play such a divisive role in countries like France and Italy may have something to do with the fact that, as The Economist pointed out in an article on the 30th anniversary of Roe, these nations didn't legalize the procedure by declaring it a constitutional right. Most European countries did so ''through new legislation and, occasionally, referenda,'' decriminalizing abortion on the grounds of health rather than rights and leaving open the possibility that, should popular opinion back them, right-to-life advocates could reverse the status quo through conventional political channels. 
 Not a few commentators lately, including some who support abortion rights, have suggested that it would not be the worst thing if the availability of abortion were left to state legislatures to decide, which is what will happen if Roe is overturned. Overnight, they note, middle-class women who take their reproductive freedom for granted no longer would. Republicans who tailor their rhetoric to the religious right would have to consider whether, in a country where 70 to 80 percent of people favor keeping abortion legal all or some of the time, they really want to endorse a blanket ban on the procedure. At the same time, Democrats would have to contemplate what, in light of medical advances and popular opinion, reasonable limits on abortion are. (Most European countries have implemented limitations that in America would be deemed unconstitutional because of Roe.) A debate currently framed in absolute terms -- the right to choose versus the rights of the unborn -- may begin to reflect what polls suggest most Americans, including a majority of Buffalonians, believe, which is that abortion should be legal but regulated. 
 It might even become possible for Americans to have a more practical conversation about how to create a society in which fewer unplanned crisis pregnancies happen in the first place. According to Stanley Henshaw, an analyst at the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the one exception to the trend of declining abortion rates in America is women below the poverty level, among whom the numbers have actually increased. Grappling with the reason for this, and how it might be addressed, would force both sides in the abortion debate to wrestle with things they might not like to. Among advocates of reproductive rights, it would mean acknowledging that in an ideal world, having an abortion is something that most women would prefer to avoid, and that the decision to raise a child is often the one that seems most impracticable to those who are disadvantaged. Among opponents of abortion, it would mean dropping the puritanical crusade against over-the-counter contraceptives and for abstinence-only sex education, as well as thinking seriously about whether they should support policies like those tucked into the recent Republican budget, which will leave states with billions of dollars less than what experts estimate they'll need to maintain child care for low-income working families in the years to come. 
 In reality, though, overturning Roe v. Wade will not end the abortion conflict. It will probably transform it from one battle into 50 smaller ones raging across the states. Women who thought they had secured a right several generations ago would have to fight for it again. In the meantime, the least privileged (those who live in remote areas, those who can't afford to travel) would face barriers to access far more restrictive than those in place in many states today. Many people believe that Roe is more likely to be chipped away at over the next several years than overturned. Whether they are right will rest in the hands of a Supreme Court seemingly more skeptical about abortion than any in recent history, one headed by a strongly observant Catholic, John G. Roberts Jr., who was born in Buffalo.

 BODY:
A big-city aquarium after closing hours is an eerie, spectral place. With the lights turned down in the empty viewing galleries, the luminous dioramas of the different fish fairly swell against your senses, rendering you the viewed and startled captive, adrift in your own natural medium, in a literal suspension of disbelief. ''Help yourself,'' Sal Munoz, a night-shift biologist at the Seattle Aquarium, told me one night this past fall, pointing to the huge 12-foot-high glass tank in which the subject of my specially arranged private encounter that evening resided: a 70-pound giant Pacific octopus named Achilles. 
I was first introduced to Achilles earlier that day by Roland Anderson, another scientist at the aquarium, and I was still having trouble with Anderson's description of him as ''a young, pretty male.'' There are, as fellow life forms go, few as deeply alien -- in both substance and appearance -- as the giant Pacific octopus. ''G.P.O.'' adults can weigh more than 100 pounds, and yet all of their throbbing, multi-tentacled mass can pass like water through a drain pipe no bigger in circumference than an apple, just wide enough to accommodate the octopus's cartilaginous beak, its only solid body part. These creatures look, at rest, like cracked leather discards from a handbag factory; in motion, like wind-swept hot-air balloons in severe deflation distress, with no one at home in the balloon's gondola but for a pair of unsettlingly knowing black eyes.
 It was those eyes more than anything that I had asked Anderson for special permission to come back and stare into on my own. Just me and Achilles. With no one else around to make me self-conscious for engaging in a protracted stare-down with an octopus. For reading impossible complexities into his muffled side of the conversation. For tapping my fingers on the glass in hopes of getting Achilles riled. For behaving, in short, in a way that even I, an inveterate lingerer before zoo enclosures and fish tanks, would have considered preposterous had I not heard Anderson's real-life octopus stories earlier that day.
 Anderson told me that he and his staff started naming the G.P.O.'s at the Seattle Aquarium 20 years ago. Not out of cutesy sentimentality. Anderson, a longtime marine biologist and the son of a sea captain, is not given to that sort of thing. It was, he said, because they couldn't help noticing the animals' distinct personalities. G.P.O.'s live about three or four years, and the aquarium typically keeps three on the premises -- two on display and one backup or understudy octopus -- so there have been a good number of G.P.O.'s at the aquarium over the past two decades. Still, Anderson had little trouble recalling them: Emily Dickinson, for example, a particularly shy, retiring female G.P.O. who always hid behind the tank's rock outcroppings, or Leisure Suit Larry, who, Anderson told me, would have been arrested in our world for sexual assault, with his arms always crawling all over passing researchers. And then there was Lucretia McEvil. She repeatedly tore her tank apart at night, scraping up all the rocks at the base, pulling up the water filter, biting through nylon cables, all the parts left floating on the surface when Anderson arrived in the morning.
 One particularly temperamental G.P.O. so disliked having his tank cleaned, he would keep grabbing the cleaning tools, trying to pull them into the tank, his skin going a bright red. Another took to regularly soaking one of the aquarium's female night biologists with the water funnel octopuses normally use to propel themselves, because he didn't like it when she shined her flashlight into his tank. Yet another G.P.O. of the Leisure Suit Larry mold once tried to pull into his tank a BBC videographer who got her hand a bit too close, wrapping his tentacles up and down her arm as fast as she could unravel them. When she finally broke free, the octopus turned a bright red and doused her with repeated jets of water.
 Just across from Achilles that night was another G.P.O. named Mikala, their two tanks connected by an overhead, see-through passageway, the doors to which were closed. Mikala was a recent replacement for Helen, who had just been released back into the sea after a failed attempt by the scientists to mate her with Achilles. Anderson told me that they had left Achilles and Helen together in the same tank for a week, but, he said, ''there wasn't any chemistry.'' In the coming months, they would be trying the same routine with Mikala, to see if anything clicked.
 At one point I decided to absent myself from Achilles' stare and walk around to the far side of his tank to look at Mikala in hers. Standing in the narrow space beneath the overhead passageway, I found her sound asleep, mushed between her tank's outer glass and some craggy rocks. I thought about tapping the glass to see if I could stir her, but decided to leave her be. When I turned around, Achilles was right there behind me, bobbing against the glass, bright red, his black eyes opened wide.
 ''How do we even define what an emotion is in an animal?'' I recalled Roland Anderson asking earlier that day. ''And why do they even have these different temperaments?''
 It was back in 1991 that Anderson and Jennifer Mather, a psychologist from the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, first decided to undertake a joint personality study of 44 smaller red octopuses at the aquarium as a way to begin to codify and systematize what they thought they had been observing. Using three categorizations from a standard human-personality-assessment test -- shy, aggressive and passive -- their data would ultimately show that the animals did consistently clump together under these different categories in response to various stimuli, like touching them with a bristly test-tube brush or dropping a crab into the tank.
 ''The aggressive ones would pounce on the crab,'' Anderson told me. ''The passive ones would wait for the crab to come past and then grab it. The shy animal would wait till overnight when no one was looking, and we'd find this little pile of crab shell in the morning.''
 Anderson and Mather's resulting 1993 paper in the Journal of Comparative Psychology, entitled ''Personalities of Octopuses,'' was not only the first-ever documentation of personality in invertebrates. It was the first time in anyone's memory that the term ''personality'' had been applied to a nonhuman in a major psychology journal.
 Scientists are not typically disposed to wielding a word like ''personality'' when talking about animals. Doing so borders on the scientific heresy of anthropomorphism. And yet for a growing number of researchers from a broad range of disciplines -- psychology, evolutionary biology and ecology, animal behavior and welfare -- it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid that term when trying to describe the variety of behaviors that they are now observing in an equally broad and expanding array of creatures, everything from nonhuman primates to hyenas and numerous species of birds to water striders and stickleback fish and, of course, giant Pacific octopuses.
 In fact, in the years since Anderson and Mather's original paper, a whole new field of research has emerged known simply as ''animal personality.'' Through close and repeated observations of different species in a variety of group settings and circumstances, scientists are finding that our own behavioral traits exist in varying degrees and dimensions among creatures across all the branches of life's tree. Observing our fellow humans, we all recognize the daredevil versus the more cautious, risk-averse type; the aggressive bully as opposed to the meek victim; the sensitive, reactive individual versus the more straight-ahead, proactive sort, fairly oblivious to the various subtle signals of his surroundings. We wouldn't have expected to meet all of them, however, in everything from farm animals and birds to fish and insects and spiders. But more and more now, we are recognizing ourselves and our ways to be recapitulations of the rest of biology. And as scientists track these phenomena, they are also beginning to unravel such core mysteries as the bioevolutionary underpinnings of personality, both animal and human; the dynamic interplay between genes and environment in the expression of various personality traits; and why it is that nature invented such a thing as personality in the first place.
 Animal personality studies are only the most recent manifestation of the inroads that science is now making into what has long been uncharted terrain: the very inscrutability of our fellow creatures that has, from the dawn of human consciousness, both begotten and bound us to our wildest imaginings about them. All sorts of research has been done in recent years revealing various aspects of animal complexity: African gray parrots that can not only count but can also grasp the concept of zero; self-recognition, empathy and the cultural transference of tool use in both chimps and dolphins; individual face-recognition among sheep; courtship songs in mice; laughter in rats. This is no longer merely the stuff of anthropomorphism or isolated anecdote. As Jaak Panksepp, the neuroscientist who first discovered rat laughter, has pointed out: ''Every drug used to treat emotional and psychiatric disorders in humans was first developed and found effective in animals. This kind of research would obviously have no value if animals were incapable of experiencing these emotional states.''
 Now, with the emergence of animal-personality studies, we are gaining an even fuller appreciation not only of the distinctiveness of birds and beasts and their behaviors but also of their deep resemblances to us and our own. Somehow, through the very creatures we have long piggybacked upon to tell stories about ourselves, we are beginning to get at the essence of that one aspect of the self we have long thought to be exclusively and quintessentially ours: the individual personality. The octopuses' garden is proving to be quite deeply and variously shaded indeed.
 Appropriately enough for a newly emerging psychological science, the world's first Animal Personality Institute, or A.P.I., is still more of a proposition than a physical place. Indeed, outside of a newly established Web site with a flashy bright blue logo, A.P.I.'s only visitable locale can be found on the third floor of the psychology-department building at the University of Texas in Austin, in the small, book-crammed office of A.P.I.'s founder, Sam Gosling, a London-born, 37-year-old professor of psychology. ''This here is my collection of animal-personality literature,'' Gosling told me one afternoon in October, pointing to a long row of thick blue binders along the top shelf of his office's bookcase, including animal studies from fields as diverse as agricultural science, anthropology, psychology, veterinary medicine and zoology. ''We're trying to scan them all and make them available, because part of. . . I mean.. . .''
 A tall, gaunt figure whose flowing locks, untucked striped shirt, slightly flared bell bottoms and ankle-high leather boots give him the appearance of a 60's-era British rock star, Gosling is given to switching gears midsentence, his active mind going in a number of directions at once. ''Part of what we're trying to do here,'' he continued, ''is create a field.''
 Gosling, who often refers to himself as ''a bit of a fraud,'' being what he calls ''a personality expert who knows very little about actual animals,'' was a young graduate student in psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, when he first came upon Anderson and Mather's paper on octopus personality. It was not at all an area of research he expected to be poking his nose into, having originally attended Berkeley to pursue a degree in human personality. But in the course of one of his first seminars, he suddenly found his thoughts going in an unlikely direction, what he now refers to as his ''reductio ad absurdum moment.''
 ''It was a basic seminar in human personality,'' he recalled. ''We were considering the question of what is personality. And I thought, O.K., let's try to push it to its limit. To find out what personality is, let's start by taking what's clearly outside that category and discover what's different about that. Let's take animals. They obviously don't have personality. So then I thought, O.K., if animals don't have it, then what is it that makes them not have it, and I couldn't come up with an answer.''
 A standard answer, of course, is that animals do not, as far as we know, reflect upon and argue with their experiences, emotions and behaviors in the way that we humans do. They do not possess, in other words, that dynamic, self-reflective, internal dialogue the very outcome of which is, many scientists say, our personality. Of course, whether or not self-knowledge is truly a defining characteristic of personality is a question scientists disagree on, as they do about much else in the field. Indeed, the whole notion of personality is one that we only began trying to measure and codify in the past century. Personality theory started showing up in the writings of Ivan Pavlov and Sigmund Freud as a somewhat vague, broadly drawn concept. It has only been in the last 60 years or so that the modern science of human personality began to emerge, a system of assessing distinct personality traits that has its roots in World War II, when the U.S. government assigned to the Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of today's C.I.A.) the task of identifying which individuals had the right traits to be spies. A number of different personality-mapping methods and traits-assessment tests have been developed over the years, all of them pivoting around the principle that certain traits can be consistently observed in individuals across time and different situations. The most widely applied test today uses the categories defined by what is known as the Five-Factor Model (F.F.M.): openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Under each of these broad dimension headings are so-called clusters of recognizable traits: an extroverted person, for example, is more sociable, outgoing and assertive; a neurotic one, more anxious, moody and stressed. 
 Gosling, however, was intent on exploring personality at its most rudimentary level -- below the radar, if you will, of human consciousness. Applying some of the very same personality assessments that we use on humans, he wondered whether we could observe in animals essential traits like fearfulness, aggressiveness, affability or calmness, traits that can exist outside of cognition and yet are clearly and repeatedly apparent in varying measures in different individual animals within a given species.
 Does one duck, in other words, behave consistently differently from another duck, over time and across situations? If so, why doesn't that meet the definition of personality as we apply it to ourselves, regardless of the presence or absence of self-awareness? In a sense, Gosling was posing a psychologist's rendition of that old philosophical query about whether the tree that falls in the forest, miles from anyone's ears, still makes a sound. That is, if an animal behaves in distinctly consistent ways but isn't fully cognizant of such behaviors, can the behaviors still be aspects and indications of its personality?
 One way Gosling set about answering that question was to focus on a colony of 34 hyenas being kept on the Berkeley campus by Steve Glickman, a professor of psychology. With Glickman's blessing, Gosling asked four caretakers of the colony to independently fill out questionnaires about each animal, using a modified version of the F.F.M. test. He soon found that the caretakers' assessments had the same level of agreement, or ''convergence,'' as is found in assessments done on humans, with such distinct human dimensions as ''excitability,'' ''sociability,'' ''curiosity'' and ''assertiveness'' being repeatedly observed.
 Gosling then reviewed 19 different previous behavioral studies of nonhuman species through the same F.F.M. framework and found a similar recurrence of those dimensions across a surprisingly broad spectrum of species. Among the traits remarked upon were such things as ''opportunistic, self-serving'' behavior in certain vervet monkeys; ''emotionality'' in rats; ''fear avoidance'' in some guppies and ''extroversion'' in others; and, in Anderson and Mather's 1993 paper, both ''boldness'' and ''avoidance'' in octopuses.
 ''The evolutionary continuity between humans and other animals suggests that some dimensions of personality may be common across a wide range of species,'' Gosling wrote in the resulting paper he published in 1999 in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science. ''Scientists have been reluctant to ascribe personality traits, emotion and cognitions to animals, even though they readily accept that the anatomy and physiology of humans is similar to that of animals. Yet there is nothing in evolutionary theory to suggest that only physical traits are subject to selection pressures.''
 Gosling told me that his seminar adviser thought the whole thing sounded a bit ''goofy'' at first. Some of his fellow students, meanwhile, were irked at him for trying to bring the field of personality to disrepute, as Gosling put it, by studying silly, trivial, frivolous stuff. The major sticking point, of course, was his insistence on using the obviously loaded word ''personality,'' a choice that he admits was purposefully provocative. 
 In some quarters, the term still rankles. ''Personality ratings have been done with chimps where you can see in them intimations of human characteristics,'' says Jack Block, an emeritus professor of personality psychology at Berkeley. ''Now, where you want to take that, I don't know. Even with chimps, it is a big extrapolation from them to us. But personality in fruit flies or octopi? Heck, no. All living organisms do react to pain and seek what they have developed to want in terms of food or mating. But they cannot manifest the complexity of responses that human beings can.''
 John Capitanio, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, who does extensive behavioral studies with rhesus monkeys, is more willing to extrapolate. ''Animal behaviorists or behavioral ecologists are mostly interested in what the animal is presenting them with in terms of behavior,'' he told me recently. ''And yet the behaviors exhibited are not dissimilar from our own, and that's what causes us to infer these personality characteristics. Now do they really exist in animals? I think the answer is yes, they do in some form.''
 In many of his early talks, people would ask Gosling why he didn't use the word ''temperament'' instead of personality. His response was -- and is -- that temperament is always invoked as a purely biological, inherited quality, whereas personality is thought of as a ''higher order phenomenon'' that grows out of the interaction of our inherited temperaments and our experiences. If he used only the word temperament with animals, he would be dismissing the possibility that they may have some of the same personality processes as humans. ''I don't want to rule that out,'' Gosling told me. ''I also think the word personality is as appropriate for animals as it is for us. Of course, we still have to be suspicious. People will also rate the personality of a loaf of bread or a car. A colleague has poked fun at me about that: 'A temperamental car is difficult to start across time and situations. So why isn't that personality?' Well, the fundamental difference, of course, is that with an animal there is an underlying physiology and biology. Saying my car is temperamental is an analogy. And some people will rate dogs not only as friendly or fearful but as philosophical. Now, I do not believe dogs are philosophical, whereas I do believe in their fearfulness. So we have to be careful where to draw the line between what's reality and what's analogy.''
 Dogs, in a way, offer the most obvious proof of the existence of animal personality. They have long been bound to us and bred by us precisely for their very particular physical and temperament traits, and, of course, even among specific breeds there are all kinds of variation in the personalities of individuals. Indeed, animals like dogs and cats point up what often appears to be a paradoxically prodigious ''duh factor'' behind this otherwise cutting-edge science. While scientists may tussle endlessly over the validity of applying the word personality to nonhumans, for people in the everyday world -- especially those who spend any time around animals -- the assertion that they have distinct personalities seems absurdly obvious.
 Not so very long ago, concepts like animal sentience, emotion and personality were not merely the stuff of anecdotes told by farmers and pet owners; they were wholly embraced by the scientific community as well. In the late 19th century, animal emotion and behavior were integral aspects of the newly emerging science of human psychology. Charles Darwin devoted much of his time after the publication of ''The Origin of Species'' to researching ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals,'' published in 1872. Although that era's cross-species conjecturing and comparing was often naive or intuitive, the impulse behind it went on to inform human psychological study well into the 20th century. Beginning with the appearance in 1908 of more sober, scientifically sound works like John Lubbocks's ''On the Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals With Special Reference to the Insects'' or Edward L. Thorndike's ''Animal Intelligence,'' animal studies figured prominently in standard human psychology textbooks well into the 1940's. And then, steadily, the animals began to disappear.
 At one point in his Austin office on the afternoon I met with him, Sam Gosling pulled from his shelves the 1935 edition of ''A Handbook of Social Psychology,'' a standard human psychology textbook of the time, and showed me the table of contents. More than a quarter of the textbook's chapters were devoted to studies of animals and other life forms, titles like ''Population Behavior of Bacteria,'' ''Insect Societies'' or ''The Behavior of Mammalian Herds and Packs.'' There is even a chapter devoted to ''Social Origins and Processes Among Plants.'' But in the 1954 edition of a similar work called ''The Handbook of Social Psychology,'' there is but one chapter devoted to nonhuman research. Titled ''The Social Significance of Animal Studies,'' it is essentially a desperate last plea to social psychologists not to abandon animal studies, arguing at one point that ''social psychology must be dangerously myopic if it restricts itself to human literature.'' The warning clearly went unheeded. The most recent edition of the handbook, from 1998, is devoted entirely to humans.
 The banishment of our fellow beasts from psychological literature can be blamed by and large on that branch of psychology known as behaviorism. The field's major proponents, eminent psychologists like B.F. Skinner, stressed the inherent inscrutability of mental states and perceptions to anyone but the person experiencing them. And even though the behaviorists were themselves major proponents of the use of animals in behavioral research, they sought to rein in subjective verbal descriptions of the animals' mental states, as well as the sorts of experiments that relied on such necessarily vague data. If the human mind was, as Skinner famously referred to it, ''a black box,'' then surely the minds of animals were even further beyond our ken.
 ''The great and enduring contribution of behaviorism,'' Gosling says, ''is that it introduced the scientific method to the study of behavior. They said, 'Let's get rid of the fuzzy, sentimental higher-level descriptions.' And they did. They went to great efforts to record specific behaviors, things like how many times a chimpanzee scratched its head or nose. But it's hard to study higher-order phenomena, things like personality and emotion, in just those ways. In the end, what you're left with is this long catalog of meaningless descriptions. If I need to know whether I can go into that cage or not to clean it, it's not useful to tell me the chimp scratched its nose 50,000 times in the past year. Just tell me, Is it aggressive or not?''
 In their dogged pursuit of hard science and their strict avoidance of what Sam Gosling referred to in his first published paper as the ''specter of anthropomorphism,'' the behaviorists, especially in the eyes of many who currently study animal behavior, greatly limited the field of psychology by ultimately outlawing things like intuition, inference and common sense. Now, however, the pendulum has begun to swing back in that direction, and it is a shift that has been impelled, somewhat surprisingly, by hard science.
 Advances in fields like genetics and molecular and evolutionary biology have lent to the study of psychology something that it really didn't have when behaviorism first came to the fore: a better understanding of the biological and bioevolutionary underpinnings of behavior. No longer is the study of animal behavior rooted in that inherently naive and anthropocentric desire to see ourselves in animals or to project upon them our thoughts and feelings. Animal personality, along with such integral fields as animal behavior, behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology, all pivot now around what might be called deep analogies. The more detailed and specific our knowledge has become of the animals and of the many differences between them and us, the more clearly we can see what is analogous about our respective behaviors.
 Animal personality, in other words, is now redirecting psychology's focus in a direction the behaviorists would most appreciate: away from airy abstractions about personality and down to its very tangible and widely dispersed roots. It might be thought of as a kind of biological Buddhism or muscular mythologizing or armed anthropomorphism: a more disciplined and detailed form of that idle speculating we have all done in front of the head tilt of a dog or the sudden skyward shift of a flock of sea gulls or the comings and goings of ants around their respective mounds.
 ''Now, those there I can almost guarantee you are females,'' Jason Watters, a behavioral ecologist at the University of California, Davis, told me one afternoon this past autumn. He was pointing to a cluster of water striders that had climbed up the side wall of one of the collecting pools in the artificial stream that Watters had erected at the far western edge of the Davis campus for a six-month study that he and his lab director, Andy Sih, recently completed on the role of genetic and environmental factors in the expression of behavior in water striders: those spindly black, surface-flitting wraiths whose indent on their tenuous native terrain is never more than four slightly concave, lunar-module-like landing cups.
 Watters personally reared several thousand water striders for the experiment and would come to know them about as intimately as any human can an insect. He knew each strider's parents and siblings. He photographed and marked each of them with paint-on numbers and then tracked them through more or less every circumstance and experience in their roughly yearlong lives: what and how they ate, their responses to new environments or to simulated predator attacks, their social interactions and mating practices out in the simulated stream.
 ''I haven't gathered all the data yet,'' Watters said, grabbing one of the clustered striders and confirming his suspicion about its sex. ''But what we do know is that these water striders express consistent behavioral types. Like in the presence of a predator some individuals will run and get right out of the water. Others don't seem concerned whatsoever. Just sit there. Others get out and then get back in after a little while. So there's a great deal of variation in what they do. Especially in a mating situation, here in the stream we've found among the males that there is the consistently more aggressive guy -- so that's his type or his personality -- and then there are these very active, hyperaggressive males. They're the ones who are always forcing females to have sex and driving them out of the water and really messing things up for themselves and everybody. We don't know yet if this is really the best way to be or what the point of it is. We're working on that. But I've got to believe there's going to be some circumstances where it's a good idea to be a really mean, brutish type of guy and others where it's not.''
 A similar array of behaviors is now being encountered in other insects. In her current research at Davis, Judy Stamps, a professor of biology and animal behavior, has been looking into how early experience affects habitat selection in drosophila, better known to you and me as the common fruit fly. Stamps escorted me one afternoon to one of the biology department's ''animal rooms,'' where she and her students have been conducting their experiments. The room was the size of a small walk-in closet, barely large enough to contain the 11-foot-long metal table before us.
 To a tiny fruit fly, however, the strange, artificial fruit-bowl habitats of upward twisting wire set at either end of the table are separate universes, the various fruit-shaped planets of which, Stamps has discovered, fruit flies approach and settle in a number of ways, some of which depend on early experience and some on their distinct personalities. Fruit flies born and raised on a plum, for example, will seek out the next plum to settle upon, as will the offspring that they raise there: a ''no place like home'' impulse. But in the course of their research, Stamps and her students have also encountered everything from overly shy, timorous fruit flies to bold trailblazers to downright feisty and ultimately self-defeating bullies.
 ''You don't think of drosophila in that way,'' Stamps told me. ''They can be very territorial, and some of the males are fairly aggressive. They tussle with each other. When we did our free-range fly experiments, we marked them individually. We put little colored paint dots on their thorax. The students loved it. They'd say: 'You know Blue? He's been attacking everyone this morning. He's on Banana A, and everyone else is on Banana B. He's the ruler of Banana A.' Of course, the other thing we've noticed is that individuals that behave like Blue get into trouble because, you see, they end up with nobody to mate with.''
 Another member of Andy Sih's lab, Alison Bell, has done extensive studies of the three-spined stickleback fish, a tiny prehistoric-looking fish with armorlike outer lateral plates and serrated, lancelike spines protruding from the dorsal region. As well as finding the same spectrum of behaviors in sticklebacks -- from extremely bold and bullying sticklebacks to extremely shy and timid ones -- Bell has found groups of sticklebacks that exhibit a similar type of behavior: tribelike populations of bold and aggressive sticklebacks, for example, or of extremely timid ones. Their collective disposition seems to have been shaped by the respective environment in which they were raised -- whether it was predator-free or predator-laden -- and their physical appearance reflects their environment as well: the timid sticklebacks having far heavier armor and longer, more serrated spines.
 The questions that scientists are now beginning to address are why evolution has wielded such a variety of temperaments in animals and why it hasn't weeded out the clearly deleterious ones: the shyness and timidity that deprives some members of a group of food or mates or the overaggression and extreme risk-taking behavior that can often result in both the disruption of the group's overall reproductive success and the aggressors' becoming some other creature's food.
 Roland Anderson sees the diversity of temperaments as a manifestation of that most basic biological imperative of survival, an array of personality traits being kept in play in a given species because of the differing, shifting environmental circumstances that groups may encounter. ''What happens,'' he asked, ''if a big school of herring comes along and eats all the aggressive, fearless males in a group of smaller fish? Well, there will still be some of the more passive or shy ones hiding under that rock that can say: 'Hey, they're all gone now. There's a nice-looking female over there. I think I'll reproduce with her.'''
 Andy Sih, like most of his colleagues at Davis, views personality differences in animals in a Darwinian context. He considers specific behaviors and preferences from an evolutionary perspective and tries to determine how various traits affect the long-term survival of a given species. And in the course of his research on everything from water striders to salamanders, Sih has become fairly obsessed with what he calls ''stupid behaviors,'' ones that don't seem to make any evolutionary sense whatsoever.
 ''You'd expect animals to be doing smart stuff,'' Sih told me one evening over dinner. ''The whole tradition in most of evolutionary ecology has been to emphasize adaptation where organisms do smart things. But I've been making the case for a while that the most interesting behaviors are actually the stupidest.''
 It's typically the males of a given species that seem to figure most prominently in the stupid-behavior department -- the militant, mayhem-causing water striders and sticklebacks, for example, or fierce male Western bluebirds, who spend so much time defending nests or courting females that they completely neglect their own offspring. But perhaps the most glaring instance of dumb-animal doings is to be found in the female North American fishing spider. Studies have shown that a good number of female fishing spiders are from a very early age highly driven and effective hunters. It is a trait that serves them well most of their lives, particularly in lean times, but it wholly backfires during mating season, when these females can't keep themselves from eating prospective suitors.
 ''Now why would anybody, why would any organism do that?'' asked Sih. ''If you look at these female spiders just in the context of mating behavior, you would conclude that they're doing something mighty stupid here. But their behavioral type is very good for them for much of their life growing up in a highly competitive world where food is often scarce. They're so geared up, though, that when mating season comes around, they really mess up. And experiments have shown that even if they're given a reasonable amount of food, they'll still behave this way.''
 These same hyped-up females have also been shown to be the most fearless in the face of predators. In simulated attacks, all fishing spiders retreated underwater. The overaggressive, ravenous females, however, were always the first to pop back up, giving them at once the greatest chance of getting available food and, if the predator was still around, of becoming its meal. Of course, a good proportion of female fishing spiders are able to make the distinction between sex and dinner and between finding and becoming dinner. But for Sih and others, the persistence in certain members of a species of these extreme behaviors and the inability of some to modulate that behavior give rise to a more profound question about the nature of personality types in general and how plastic or not they actually are, whether in animals or humans.
 In animals, it is now becoming evident, there is a certain degree of evolutionary inertia when it comes to their behavior, wherein the very behaviors that accord some members of the group a distinct evolutionary advantage in one set of circumstances can do them in in the next. They are stuck, to some extent, with their distinct ways of being. We humans, on the other hand, tend to think of our personalities as protean, mutable entities that, unlike our physical selves, we can shape to suit shifting circumstances. Sih disagrees. He says he thinks that our behaviors, no matter how complex the human social contexts that help to shape them, are not nearly as pliant as we believe them to be.
 ''Behavioral ecologists actually tend to model animals and humans as both being very flexible, as being capable of changing their behaviors as necessary to do the right things in all situations,'' he said. But in our own day-to-day experience, he said, we recognize that humans don't really behave that way. ''We all know that overly bold person,'' he pointed out. ''We have friends like that. They do things that are just like: Hey, this can get you killed. What are they doing that for? And there are people that are shy, and they're missing out on opportunities they could have had.''
 There is currently a paucity of human studies along these lines, but a recently published human-personality study of 545 people by Daniel Nettle of the University of Newcastle in England shows a strong parallel with some of these recent animal studies. It found that the more extroverted and outgoing people were, the more sex partners they tended to have, an evolutionary edge that was mitigated by the fact that these were the same people who were most likely to end up in the hospital because of stupid risk-taking behaviors.
 Indeed, however elaborate an argument we humans may have with our own biology, we are each of us to some extent locked into a personality type, a consistent way of being without which we would each be, in a sense, unrecognizable to ourselves or others. The oft-heard comment ''Hey, that's not like you'' is a tacit acknowledgment of your recognizably consistent way of being. If, in other words, someone were to be entirely flexible and unpredictable in their behavior, were able to respond with any one of the full palette of behavioral responses in any given circumstance, they would be not only, as Andy Sih put it, ''scary to be around,'' but they would also be someone of whom you could say, they have no personality.
 This set of ideas, Sih told me, suggests new questions that are rarely posed about humans. ''Like why do we even have a personality?'' he asked. ''Why do we have a relatively narrow range of responses as opposed to a full range? Why can't we all be bold when we need to be and cautious and shy when we need to be? Then we'd have no identifiable personality, and that would free us all to become optimal.''
 For Sih, the answer seems to be that our personality is a manifestation of a complex interplay between genetic inheritance and environment and early-life experience. Bold people, for example, are both naturally disposed to boldness and, further, choose to be bold, becoming ever better at it, building from an early age a mountain of abilities and tendencies that become a personality. It might happen, as well, that an inherently shy person is induced by an early-life experience to venture away from his or her natural disposition and cultivate a bold personality. But whether a person ends up building and climbing a shy or a bold mountain, it may become increasingly difficult to come back down and build another one.
 ''It's not impossible,'' Sih said, ''but it's not going to be easy. I'll give you another human example. It's always mystified me why anyone would be a pessimist. It seems to me like optimism has to be the way to go. But, in fact, there is some recent literature that shows that pessimists are good at being pessimists. And that when things go badly, they expected it anyway, and it doesn't hurt them. And so it's this notion that personality types build because of these feedback loops.''
 In human beings, of course, as with other highly social species, the shaping of personality entails a complex web of influences and imperatives. It is not merely about the acquisition of food or mates but involves as well issues of group interaction, cooperation, deception and so on. It is a dynamic that, in an ever more complex series of evolutionary feedback loops, at once impelled the formation of larger and more sophisticated brains and the more nuanced emotional responses to social interaction -- feelings of embarrassment, guilt, empathy, confidence, etc. -- that such a brain allows.
 The attempt to parse that web of entanglements has for decades been a motivation of fields like psychology, psychiatry and sociology. What seems so promising about the field of animal personality is that in the course of allowing us to better understand and more effectively conserve the animals themselves, it is also affording scientists new pathways of understanding ourselves and our behavior, through the kind of experimentation that we are unable to perform on humans.
 ''Do thrill seekers thrive in certain speculative business or military environments?'' Sih asked. ''I don't know. But I can do experiments to look at analogous situations in animals, can take different animals with different personalities and see how they do in different environments -- in a high-predation-risk situation, in a cooperative situation, during a courtship-mating situation. Along similar lines, we can test ideas like, Are animals particularly aggressive when they invade new regions because it is primarily the bold, aggressive individuals that tend to immigrate to new areas? How does the personality of the immigrant pool in humans differ from those who stay behind, and does that difference influence success -- and does this basic view apply to the melting pot of America?''
 Alison Bell has done related experiments with sticklebacks. It has long been clear to researchers that fish that have lived for many generations in the proximity of dangerous predators are less bold and less aggressive than animals that have lived relatively risk-free. What Bell discovered is that those cautious tendencies outlast the presence of risk, even by a generation. When she moved sticklebacks who had always lived in a high-risk environment into a low-risk environment, she found that not only did they retain their cautious tendencies, but so did their offspring. Even fish raised from birth in a low-risk environment behave more fearfully if raised by a particularly vigilant father from a high-risk background.
 ''There's definitely the effect of genetic difference,'' Bell explained, ''but there's also the effect of what is experienced as they grow up. Genotype and environment interactions make it difficult to detect the effects of genes, because you have to take the environment into account. This is annoying to geneticists.'' To scientists like Bell who are studying the interplay of genes and environment, however, it is of profound interest.
 In the coming year, the sequence of the full stickleback genome will have been assembled, which will open doors into all kinds of cross-species research on the relationship between genes and environment. Alison Bell will be looking at such things as risk-taking behavior in sticklebacks -- which may, by extension, give us insight into the behavior of humans. The same genes and hormone receptor systems associated with such behaviors have been conserved across a broad spectrum of species from sticklebacks to rhesus monkeys to us. John Capitanio has already done a number of experiments with rhesus monkeys that look into how the manner of their rearing affects what Capitanio (in a hedge on the loaded P-word) calls an animal's ''biobehavioral organization'' -- and how, in turn, that biobehavioral organization affects everything from gene expression to immune-system function against ailments like simian AIDS. 
 What once seemed the hopelessly subjective pursuit of understanding human behavior and personality is now increasingly being tied down to and girded by the objective moorings of our own and other animals' biology. The very names of newly emergent fields like biological psychiatry, molecular psychiatry and, of course, animal personality reflect this trend. It is not, as Capitanio points out, a reductionistic concept but more of a holistic one, one that allows for an unprecedentedly subtle reading of the integrative influences -- genetic, experiential and environmental -- that shape each individual's personality. 
 Capitanio is currently writing, with Sam Gosling, the first chapter on animal personality to be included in ''The Handbook of Personality,'' a standard reference book of human-personality psychology. This week, he will be in Palm Springs, Calif., presenting a paper on personality in rhesus monkeys as part of an animal-social psychology symposium led by Gosling at the annual meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the first symposium of its kind at a human psychology conference. For Gosling, it is the realization of the very thing he envisioned when he first started pursuing the possibility of personality in animals at Berkeley back in the mid-1990's.
 ''What really got me interested when I started exploring this,'' Gosling told me, ''is I noticed that what the animal researchers were doing in practice was exactly what human researchers were saying would be the perfect study they could do in a perfect world. Like you ask a human personality researcher, they might say what we'd do is take a bunch of individuals, and we'd watch them from conception till death and record all the major events in their lives and know who mated with whom and who had a fight with whom. And if we wanted, we could give them frightening stimuli and so on. And a lot of my job is saying to those in human psychology: 'Hey, you should talk to these other guys. What they're doing is really relevant.' I'm like the middleman.''
 Looking through some of the animal-personality literature in Gosling's office that afternoon, I came upon an intriguing paper titled ''Microscopic Brains,'' published in the March 13, 1964, edition of the journal Science, in the midst of the great animal blackout from psychological literature. Written by a professor of zoology and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania named Vincent Dethier, the paper is at once a study of insect behavior and a remarkably prescient argument for a more intuitive, empathetic and integrative approach to the study of psychology.
 ''The farther removed an animal is from ourselves,'' Dethier writes, ''the less sympathetic we are in ascribing to it those components of behavior that we know in ourselves. There is some fuzzy point of transition in the phylogenetic scale where our empathizing acquires an unsavory aura. Yet there is little justification for this schism. If we subscribe to an idea of a lineal evolution of behavior, there is no reason for failing to search for adumbrations of higher behavior in invertebrates.''
 Dethier concludes on a decidedly haunting note: ''Perhaps,'' he writes, ''these insects are little machines in a deep sleep, but looking at their rigidly armored bodies, their staring eyes and their mute performances, one cannot help at times wondering if there is anyone inside.''
 We will never know, of course, one way or the other. And yet somehow, science, of all things, is rendering the empirical answer to such a question incidental to a more felt and intuitive one. Perched now, like entranced children, along the banks of their respective simulated streams, scientists are staring for hours at the least human of creatures -- everything from bullying fruit flies to ravenous, oversexed water striders and fishing spiders to perilously fearless hordes of armored stickleback fish -- and are beginning to see in them not just their distinct patterns of behavior but also something deeply and distinctly recognizable. Something, well, not altogether inhuman.

NICHOLAS MIRACULOUS
 The Amazing Career of the Redoubtable
 Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler.
 By Michael Rosenthal.
 Illustrated. 528 pp. 
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $35.
IN her book ''Manhattan '45,'' Jan Morris imagined Columbia University's aging president, Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler: ''So solemn, so imposing. It does not surprise us in the least to know that he holds 37 honorary degrees, that he has been decorated by 15 governments, that he is a member of 20 clubs. He has won the Nobel Peace Prize, of course. He has been a confidant of many presidents.'' 
 Butler's widely supposed sagacity prompted The New York Times to call him, on different occasions, ''the incarnation of the international mind'' and ''Prime Minister of the Republic of the Intellect,'' accolades that only add to the perplexity of his new biographer. How, wonders Michael Rosenthal, a professor of the humanities at Columbia, did Butler achieve such ''instant oblivion'' so quickly after his death in 1947? More to the point, a reader of Rosenthal's conscientious biography may end up asking how Butler, an empty robe far more ridiculous than ''miraculous'' (the book's subtitle derives from another of Butler's sobriquets), managed to hoodwink so many otherwise discerning observers for so many decades.
 An Anglophile philosopher with a phony posh accent, Butler was in fact, Rosenthal explains, a ''parvenu from Paterson.'' The Columbia College from which he took a bachelor's degree in 1882 was in those days an East Side institution of rote learning for local boys. Standards were low, and the library ''never remained open for longer than an hour and a half each morning,'' yet Butler felt inspired to serious grade-grubbing and all kinds of extra-curricular eager-beavering. The zealous undergraduate quickly proceeded to a Ph.D. and then a position as ''fellow and assistant'' in the department of philosophy, ethics and psychology. His lectures were often organized to the point of dullness, but Butler pushed himself to the fore with a notion that education itself might be a fit subject for study. He helped found Columbia's Teachers College in 1887 and served for several years as its president.
 During the 1890's, using the press, his personal connections and a rhetorical style as puffed as his own ambitions, Butler succeeded in a campaign to centralize the New York City public schools -- in its day, a reform position that shifted their control from Tammany Democrats to liberal-minded Republicans. Up in Morningside Heights, to which Columbia moved in 1897, Butler sided with those wishing to subordinate the undergraduate college within a first-class research university. In 1902, when this sea change was irretrievably underway, he succeeded the patrician Seth Low as the institution's 12th president.
 Butler began to recruit stars for his faculty, landing John Dewey but failing to get Henry James. In these days before tenure, lesser lights among the professoriate were bossed around by presidential will and whim. To establish all this, Rosenthal must reproduce some tiny tempests in dollhouse teacups, his protagonist hurling paper clips instead of thunderbolts, but each incident contributes to the reader's growing sense that Butler was less a self-made sage than a natural-born blowhard.
 His most creative involvement with the undergraduate college seems to have come in searching for ways to keeps its Jewish enrollment down. He considered having applicants take physicals that would ''find grounds to eliminate socially unappealing Jews smart enough to have passed the entrance examination,'' and throughout the 1930's he funneled Jewish students into an affiliated two-year college in Brooklyn. Its courses were ''taught largely by junior faculty members from Morningside Heights,'' and the dropout rate was enormous. When it closed after 10 years, Butler at last gave up on ''the Hebrew problem.''
 Rosenthal concedes his subject a ''deserved reputation as a dynamic university builder,'' but he also supplies the reader with plenty of presidential neglect and fecklessness. In the face of the university's ''severe undercapitalization,'' Butler was slow to adopt modern fund-raising techniques, and Columbia's successful partnership with Presbyterian Hospital came to pass only when he was removed from the negotiations. However lucrative the deal by which Columbia leased its 11 acres of Midtown property for the construction of Rockefeller Center, the university failed to protect the resulting rental income against inflation.
 From the start of his presidency, Butler sought influence over a much larger domain than the university's campus. He cemented a friendship with Theodore Roosevelt by insisting to readers of The Review of Reviews that the new chief executive was more than the wild-eyed charger up San Juan Hill. The college president later traveled west with Roosevelt and helped persuade him not to go forward with the creation of a national university in Washington. But the two men fell out over the issue of labor unions (Butler was particularly opposed to them for teachers), and after he criticized Roosevelt's plutocrat-pummeling special message to Congress in 1908, Butler felt the president's ''swift and brutal'' rejection, as if he himself were some junior poli-sci professor who'd tried the patience of University Hall.
 Certain that a skilled oligarchy was best suited to run an America he believed to be classless, Butler managed to remain a factor in Republican party politics. Hoping for a presidential nomination in 1920, he tried to sell himself not as an erudite educator but as the C.E.O. of a ''citizen factory.'' Even so, Republican delegates, on the attack against Woodrow Wilson, weren't about to offer the electorate a second college president in a row. Butler's contempt for the next three Republican presidents stimulated a crush on Mussolini, whom he visited on more than one occasion.
 Butler grabbed his own place on the international stage by playing up to Andrew Carnegie, whose Endowment for International Peace he was eventually asked to head. During the 1920's, he banged a loud drum for the Kellogg-Briand pact, which renounced war as a means of settling disputes. Butler saw the pact as ''the most stupendous and most revolutionary change that has ever taken place at any time in the history of the world.'' Less dizzily, Rosenthal chalks it up as a ''personally significant achievement'' for his subject; it did earn Butler, after some heavy campaigning supervised by himself, a trip to Stockholm for the Nobel. For years after, he tried to run the Carnegie Endowment with the same dictatorial fervor he brought to Columbia.
 With each passing decade, Butler continued to deliver a ''stupefying number of speeches . . . before every kind of commercial, political and academic audience.'' In 1933, one talk was direct-mailed to 9,000 individuals and publications. Rosenthal finds his subject in possession of a ''powerful narcissism'' and unencumbered by the ''self-doubt that occasionally assailed lesser souls.'' This particular lack was supplemented by Butler's near-sociopathic ''ability to believe in and even insist upon his own innocence.'' Naysaying jabs from Walter Lippmann, H. L. Mencken and others never made a dent in this ermine-trimmed nullity while he was being chauffeured from one testimonial to another or writing the autobiography whose only revealing phrase may have been its title, ''Across the Busy Years.''
 Busy, busy, busy. Butler was an essentially comic character, as entirely of his time as the gas-filled dirigible or ''The Man Who Came to Dinner.'' As a subject, he's probably better suited to the kind of 50-page takedown Lytton Strachey performed upon his eminent Victorians, and at roughly 10 times the length Rosenthal manages a more than judicious job. A reader suspects that the biographer endured a long, depressing surprise as the vacuity of his subject fully dawned, or dimmed, on him. Rosenthal makes a manful attempt to establish Butler's life as ''remarkable'' and his eclipse as ''unmerited,'' but in the case of this ''ultimate insider,'' it's hard to argue that posterity hasn't gotten things just right.

HEADLINE: An Exodus Driven By Home Prices

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN and JOHN HOLL

 BODY:
FOUR years ago, if you had asked Stephen Joubert where he would be living in 2006, the last place he would probably have said was Florida. 
 Mr. Joubert and his wife and three children were living in a small three-bedroom house in Edison, looking for something bigger and hoping to find a house in the $500,000 to $600,000 range, he said.
As luck would have it, the 37-year-old Internet consultant landed a job that took him to Atlanta, and eventually to Orlando, where he had an epiphany: Florida was not just a bunch of old people any more, and he could buy a big house there for a lot less.
 He bought a 3,500-square-foot four-bedroom house with a three-car garage in Montverde, about 35 minutes from Walt Disney World, for $300,000. He earns less than the $80 an hour he commanded in New Jersey, but still feels as if he is ahead of the game. 
 ''I don't have the $165,000 income I was used to,'' Mr. Joubert said, ''but then again I don't have a $500,000 mortgage, so it's O.K.'' 
 A quest for affordable housing is driving an increasing number of young people, families and empty nesters from the New York suburbs to destinations near and far, a review of migration data by The New York Times shows.
 Mr. Joubert is part of one of the fastest-growing segments of the population, those who have made the exodus to central Florida. Nearly 10,000 taxpayers from the northern suburbs of New Jersey followed that path in 2004, a 66 percent increase over 1996. But the new emigres from New Jersey are also including destinations in gentrifying neighborhoods in Hudson County and New York City, exurban communities in Pennsylvania and upstate New York, and boomtowns throughout the Sun Belt.
 ''I do think a lot of this movement -- to Florida and the exurbs -- reflects, in part, a 'housing affordability' movement, or what I have sometimes termed a 'middle-class flight,' '' Prof. William Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan, said in an e-mail message. ''They'll move as far out as eastern Pennsylvania, or northern Connecticut. But many are probably looking at Sun Belt markets, including central Florida, Georgia, North Carolina.''
 To be sure, not that there is any danger of the older suburbs emptying out. Thousands are still following the traditional migratory paths from New York to New Jersey as well as other inner-ring suburbs in Westchester County and on Long Island. And, of course, many couples continue to have children when they arrive, so the population is not declining.
 But more people are leaving northern New Jersey than are arriving, and that gap is growing. The net migration from the older suburban counties of Bergen, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties was 26,889 taxpayers in 2004, up 75 percent from 1996. Essex County, which has a combination of urban and suburban populations, was not included in the analysis.
 A review of Internal Revenue Service data on taxpayers who move from one address to another between tax years shows the following pattern from 1996 to 2004, the most recent year available:
 Increasing numbers of young people and empty nesters are migrating from those eight New Jersey counties to such urban areas as Hudson County, Brooklyn and even the Bronx. Interestingly, the number of households that moved from New Jersey to the Bronx in 2004 was 60 percent higher than 1996. 
 Increasing numbers of middle-class residents, particularly young families, are moving from older suburbs to the exurbs in Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. In addition, the number of taxpayers from suburban New Jersey who are moving to Berks County, Pa., the area around Reading -- 100 miles from Times Square -- has doubled since 1996. 
 Increasing numbers of residents are emigrating to more affordable suburbs and cities around the country, especially to central and northern Florida. Indeed, the rate of migration from the New Jersey suburbs to the Orlando area is up 80 percent over 1996. And these days, the migration is not dominated by retirees, who historically had headed to such coastal retirement destinations as St. Petersburg, Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach.
 Professor Frey wrote: ''There seems to be a widening out of the traditional city population (young people, minorities and immigrants) while suburbia moves further out. Pricey inner suburbs are spreading to mid-New Jersey and Connecticut, and affordable suburbs for young families are populating areas that had not previously been considered in New York's orbit.''

On the Move Again
 Andrew Kapochunas and his wife, Aileen Bassis, were born and raised in New York, but they moved to the suburbs -- first to Connecticut and then to Ridgewood -- to raise their children. The schools were good, and their two children had yards to play in.
 They moved to a ''transition house'' after the children went off to college -- large enough to accommodate the work of Ms. Bassis, an artist, and the children when they visited. But now that both children have graduated and are living on their own, the couple is moving again, this time to a loft in the Hamilton Park neighborhood in Jersey City.
 ''It will let us take advantage of a jazz concert or a reading or something that comes up at the spur-of-the-moment living,'' said Mr. Kapochunas, a 58-year-old staff consultant for Dun & Bradstreet. ''With Jersey City we think we're going to be able to do that. It's a quick conduit to Manhattan.''
 Mr. Kapochunas and Ms. Bassis are part of a growing wave of suburbanites returning to cities. The I.R.S. data show that these people tend to have smaller families than those moving to other destinations, and demographers say they are either the grown-up children of suburbia, or people who have completed the jobs they moved to suburbia to do -- in other words, empty nesters.
 ''They may have originally come from the boroughs to suburbia and now they want to go back to where there are more activities, and Manhattan is too expensive,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Affairs at Rutgers University.
 The latest figures back up that observation. While migration from the suburbs to Manhattan is flat or even declining, the number of people moving to Hudson County and the outer boroughs of New York City is growing. 
 For instance, the number of people who left the eight suburban counties in northern New Jersey for such cities in Hudson County like Hoboken and Jersey City was up 34 percent in 2004 over the 1996 levels, and migration to the Bronx was up 60 percent. By contrast, the number of people moving to Manhattan was up only 8 percent in the same time period.
 ''We get some people who normally would be going to Harlem or Park Slope or Prospect Heights, and have found those places to be too expensive,'' said Glen Calderon, a real estate agent who sells property in the South Bronx. 

A Shift in Suburbia
 This wave is also likely to include many grown-up children of suburbia, a group that has always tended to leave, often returning to raise their own families. But these days, those 20- and 30-somethings find it even harder to afford houses in the suburbs.
 ''These are children who grew up in suburbia, but they can't afford to stay here because they can't afford our housing,'' said Pearl Kamer, an economist with a business group on Long Island called the Long Island Association. ''Many of them are single or newly married, they work in New York City or on the Island and they're moving to Queens and Brooklyn for lower-cost housing.'' 
 While suburbia has always tended to lose singles and young married couples, today it is seeing an increasing number of number of families with children leaving, the I.R.S. figures show. 
 What's more, the pattern has an income curve: The lower the income, the farther the move. Those with incomes below average, but not too far below, are moving one or two counties further out.
 ''It seems to me that there is a definite trend toward moving to the outer exurbs among families from all over the New York region,'' Professor Frey wrote. ''They appear to be low-income families at the early stage of the life cycle.''
 While the exurban trend has been noted by demographers for some time, and the I.R.S. data confirm that, a stream from the older suburbs as well as city dwellers are filling the new subdivisions in Pennsylvania and upstate New York.
 For instance, data show that Northampton and Lehigh Counties in Pennsylvania as well as Atlantic County in South Jersey are the fastest-growing destinations for residents of North Jersey. And even counties in Delaware are seeing a growing influx of families from the suburbs of North Jersey.
 ''Starter homes for today's young New Yorkers aren't in close-in Levittown (as in earlier generations) but really far out,'' Professor Frey wrote. 
 And increasingly, moving far from New York City for economic reasons entails leaving the region entirely. Indeed, the I.R.S. data show that the young families leaving the metropolitan area tend to have lower incomes, and demographers say they are in search of a combination of better pay, a lower cost of living and a warmer climate. Not surprisingly, the fastest-growing destinations are in central Florida.
 Yes, the trail to from New York to Florida was blazed by retirees in past decades, and that flow continues today. But more and more, the flow is enhanced by couples with young children. Migration to St. Petersburg, a notable destination for New Jersey taxpayers with low family size -- in other words, retirees -- has fallen by 20 percent. But the flow to Tampa, a neighboring city, is up 67 percent.
 ''There have been so many immigrants from the Northeast over the years, mainly retirees, that they brought the Northeast with them,'' Professor Hughes said. ''Central Florida has been reinvented as the Northeast without snow.'' 
 For now, the economy is good, and although the jobs do not pay as well, the cost of living is also lower.
 ''Florida is now a very diversified economy,'' Professor Hughes said. ''It's not too different from the Northeast economy.''
 That contrast in living costs can be especially stark for residents of the suburbs surrounding New York, who are among the leading contributors to the area's population.
 ''The 'new' New York-to-Florida migration is not just old-timers but younger and middle-age families to central Florida,'' Professor Frey says. ''These along with movers to other Sun Belt suburbs represent a new extended version of suburbanization: people in quest of a suburban lifestyle who cannot afford the suburbs within the New York area, or deal with the long commute to the exurbs.''
 Or, as Mr. Joubert put it, ''Compared to New Jersey, they are practically giving houses away down here.''

Chart/Map: ''Leaving New Jersey''
As New Jersey housing gets more expensive, families that cannot afford homes or want to live more cheaply are moving farther out to exurban counties in New York, Pennsylvania and
 Delaware, extending the reach of traditional suburbs. Lower-income families are choosing central Florida, while young people and empty nesters are moving to Hudson County, N.J. and
 New York City.

HEADLINE: Historic Estate Is at the Heart of an Open-Space Battle

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN 

 BODY:
THERE'S a battle being waged in this historic county seat, where Washington slept and Alfred Vail burned the midnight oil perfecting the telegraph. 
 The battleground is a six-acre estate linked to Mr. Vail's design and construction of the two transmitters that he and Samuel F. B. Morse used to send the first telegraph signal in 1844.
The fight is over a proposal to build 26 town houses on the estate, the last significant swath of open space here and part of the same Speedwell Village Historic District that includes the workshop where Mr. Vail did his civilization-altering work. The estate, which includes a 17-room mansion known as Willow Hall, belonged to Mr. Vail's brother, George, who officials say built it in 1848 with profits from his investment in the telegraph.
 ''It is inappropriate to build modern construction on the site,'' said Marion Harris, chairwoman of the Morristown Historic Preservation Commission, which opposes the town houses. 
 The proposal, submitted by K & K Development of Millburn and now pending before the Morristown Board of Adjustment, would actually preserve the mansion. But Ms. Harris and others say that building three town house clusters on the surrounding acreage would corrupt the historic integrity of the Willow Hall site, which overlooks the remains of the Speedwell ironworks. 
 The ironworks was founded by the Vail family in the early 19th century, and historic in its own right as a manufacturer of parts for the nation's first railroads. The entire Speedwell Village district, including Willow Hall, the Factory and other buildings or ruins clustered around Route 202 near Speedwell Lake, are on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places, said Mark Sutherland, a superintendent for the Morris County Park Commission, which operates a visitors center there. Willow Hall is privately owned.
 Morristown, where Washington made his headquarters at Jockey Hollow for part of the Revolutionary War, is a three-square-mile town of about 19,000 residents and is the seat of Morris County. Much of its land is occupied by tax-exempt country offices and nonprofit organizations, and supporters of the town house plan say Morristown needs the tax revenues the project would generate, estimated to total more than $500,000 annually. Proponents also welcome the jobs and other local economic activity that the project's construction and new residents would generate. 
 ''Why are you giving these developers such a hard time, when our town's so desperate for ratables?'' said Mark Axelrod, a local businessman who has circulated a flier headed ''Change Is Inevitable. The Choice Is Yours,'' urging residents to support the project. ''When Willow Hall came along, I thought, 'This guy's willing to save the mansion, he's willing to put an easement around Speedwell Lake.' And it just seemed to me like this was a great opportunity.''
 The developer is seeking variances from the Board of Adjustment to build town houses on property zoned for single-family homes, and to encroach on an artificial slope. A hearing before the board is scheduled to continue on Wednesday, although a decision is not expected for some time. 
 An unusual aspect of the proposal by K & K would establish a fund financed by the town house owners' condominium association to maintain the landscaping immediately surrounding the house, said James Cavanaugh, a former Essex County freeholder hired as the project manager by K & K. The town houses would have design elements alluding to the architecture and materials of the stone house.
 Mr. Cavanaugh said the town houses would be priced at about $800,000 and marketed to older couples without children, and therefore have little effect on the local school district or municipal budget.
 But in addition to opposition from the historic commission, a group known as the Cutler Park Neighborhood opposes the project because of its proposed density and potential environmental and historical impact. 
 ''This is the last six acres in Morristown proper, the last open space,'' said a member of the group, Myra McCready, a retired theater producer who moved to town from Stamford, Conn., two years ago. ''As much as I like new ratables and new residential opportunities as much as the next person, I think it's important that we preserve this space.''
 The county parks commission tried to buy Willow Hall. But its owner, Frederick Stradtman, a 76-year-old retired public-school teacher who inherited the estate from his aunt, said the county's offer was less than half of the $3.2 million that K & K agreed to pay him -- contingent on the town house project's approval. Mr. Stradtman said he was not being greedy. He said he and his aunt, Pauline Stradtman, who died in 1985, had agreed that the proceeds from Willow Hall's sale would finance charities including a scholarship she founded for students of the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago.
 ''The county had first choice, but the offer they came in with was just ridiculous,'' Mr. Stradtman said. 
 Samantha Rothman, a member of the town Environmental Commission, said the project would erode the steep slope down to Speedwell Lake, cut down several trees and disrupt a habitat of the endangered wood turtle. 
 Mr. Cavanaugh said that measures would be taken to prevent erosion and protect the habitat, and that only a few trees would be felled. He emphasized that the house would still be visible from Speedwell Avenue. 
 He said he is confounded by the opposition, because the proposal would achieve the dual goals of preserving the mansion and providing local revenues. 
 ''If you develop this for single families, the road would come right through the house, and you'd lose the house,'' he said during an interview at Willow Hall, whose grandeur is slightly faded but still apparent in its 12-foot ceilings and three-story sky-lit stairwell. 
 In addition, Mr. Cavanaugh said an easement would also be granted for a public walkway on the Willow Hall side of the lake, which would be linked to a public path already on the lake's far side, a wooded hillside now occupied by a town park that includes the stone ruins of buildings that were once part of the ironworks.
 The estate pays about $59,000 a year in property taxes, triple what Mr. Stradtman paid before a townwide revaluation in 2004, although he had put the house on the market before the revaluation, and he said taxes had nothing to do with his plans to sell and move to a warmer climate. Still, the town's rising taxes have fueled support for the town house project, particularly as other development proposals have been slow to materialize, including a 66-unit residential project on Court Street and a mixed-used development on the old Epstein's department store site fronting Morristown's famous village green. 
 Morristown's mayor, Donald Cresitello, a friend of Mr. Cavanaugh's, said he would prefer that the mansion be preserved without the town houses. But, he said, ''In defense of Jimmy's project, it does save the house.'' 
 Jack Schrier, a Morris County freeholder who is chairman of the freeholder board's committee overseeing open space and historic preservation, said the county might still be interested in buying Willow Hall if the K & K application is rejected. But with limited resources, he added, ''You can't preserve everything.''

HEADLINE: In New York City, Still Going Strong

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
THE economy of New York City is a bit of a mystery, even at times to the experts. Battered by the 2001 terrorist attack, high inflation and Wall Street employment losses that have never recovered, it nevertheless remains strong, with flashes of downright brawniness.
 During 2005, the city's unemployment hovered around 6 percent, slightly above the national average, and an improvement over the 6.8 percent rate the year before. Wall Street bonuses continue to skyrocket, leading to an 8.7 percent increase in personal income tax revenue in the third quarter of 2005 over the same period a year earlier, according to the city comptroller's office, and a 25 percent spike in capital gains taxes, all of which line the city's coffers. 
 As for the real estate market, the amount of vacant commercial space has fallen in recent months, and in the last quarter of 2005, apartment sale prices remained above the levels of a year ago, even as sales slowed. 
 In a sign of continued confidence in the city's future fortunes, the number of building permits issued bythe city in the first nine months of 2005 -- the latest figures available from the comptroller's office -- rose 7 percent from the same period in 2004, which meansthat people are still building in anticipation of new-home sales. 
 ''I'd characterize the local economy as relatively strong over all,'' said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''Commercial real estate, the securities industry, and thus personalincome and tax revenues, and, to a lesserextent, the labor market are all showing signs of strengthening. The housing market has shown some signs of cooling recently, but remains pretty strong in terms of levels.''
 The questions that economists, elected officials and others who spend their professional lives gazing into the crystal ball of economics ponder most are: what engine drives the economy, and how long can it last? 
 These questions are particularly urgent at a time of high heating costs nationwide and high inflation locally, and when many sectors of the economy, like professional services, continue to show sluggish growth or, like construction, have posted losses. In addition, many jobs lost on Wall Street at the beginning of the decade are not expected to return. 
 But New York is often at odds with the rest of the nation, or at least finds itself at the extremes of national trends, with an ever-frothy real estate market, a tourism industry that depends heavily on foreign visitors and a dependence on the mercurial ways of Wall Street.
 The improvement in the city's economy last year was in large part a result of the weak American dollar, which made New York a better bargain for foreign visitors and led to a boom in tourism, and to employment gains in other major industries, like health care and education. During the first 10 months of last year, for instance, the number of jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector grew 3 percent over 2004, while jobs in health and education services rose 2.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 The continued decrease in crime has further increased tourism and the willingness of New Yorkers to buy or rent homes in a variety of city neighborhoods, keeping prices high.
 But nipping at the heels of all this success is continued inflation, which New Yorkers feel acutely. Consumer prices in New York rose last year about 4.1 percent, above the nation's 3.8 percent, led by the costs of food, housing and gas. Inflation can be felt in every nook of the city, in the deli counters, the rental offices of apartment buildings and the movie theaters. 
 There are signs that inflation is makingit hard for some people and businesses to stay in New York. The creative fields -- which make up roughly 10 percent of the city's work force -- are particularly affected. 
 For example, from 2001 to 2004, the number of jobs in New York's motion picture and sound recording industries declined by 36 percent, according to a recent report by the Center for an Urban Future, a research group in Manhattan that analyzes urban policy issues. 
 The report also pointed out that 20 years ago, New York was the headquarters for half of the world's advertising agencies, but is now home to fewer than a third. Scores of artists have left the city in recent years for cheaper cities like Philadelphia and Seattle, undermining New York's dominance in the fine and commercial arts.
 And while the city has continued torecover from Sept. 11 better than economists and officials predicted at the time,the pace of that recovery has lagged be-hind the nation's, with slower growth in economic output and a slower rise in payroll jobs. 
 Further, while available office space dwindles, the number of people working in those offices has not increased by a corresponding amount, puzzling some economists. ''I still don't know why we haven't added more jobs in recent months, especially given how well the commercial real estate market has done,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate firm. 
 ''Net absorption, which measures the increase in occupied office space, has been strong, but office job growth has been tepid,'' she said. ''This is inconsistent: companies are leasing space but not adding enough jobs to fill the space.'' Another New York mystery.
 While New York has worked hard to diversify its economic base, almighty Wall Street still dictates much of its fortunes. The sleuths of the economy remain as they do at the beginning of every calendar year: skeptical. 
 In a report by the city's comptroller office released in December, the authors wrote: ''The cost pressures and risks facing the national economy are of concern forthe city as well. Since the city's economyis highly dependent on the financial sector, the impact of higher interest rates will be amplified locally. The city's economy is likely therefore to grow more slowly in 2006, despite generally positive leading indicators.''

HEADLINE: Retraining for Silicon Alley

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
HUGO COELLO was skilled in a basic software program for database management, enabling him to work as a database administrator for a nonprofit group. That skill later got him a job with an information technology consulting company, but to be more valuable to his employer, he needed to master software for creating and managing larger databases.
 Roberto Ruggiero and Anika Reynolds majored in computer science in college. Mr. Ruggiero could not get a job in software operations, and Ms. Reynolds wanted to learn a major programming language that her college courses did not cover before she started her job search. All three found the same solution: training courses offered by the New York Software Industry Association, the leading trade group for software, information technology and Web development companies in the New York City area. 
The free courses, financed by a grant of nearly $3 million from the United States Labor Department, have been offered for two and a half years as part of an effort to help Silicon Alley -- the city's slice of the information technology industry -- rebound from the battering it has suffered in recent years. 
 The blows were inflicted by the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001 -- which hurt Silicon Alley even more than it did the industry elsewhere -- and the outsourcing of technology jobs abroad.
 ''There was a serious downturn,'' said Bruce E. Bernstein, president of the software trade group. But, he added, the industry in New York ''never went away, and now it's coming back.''
 Citing developments in areas like blogging and Web video, Mr. Bernstein said, ''New technologies and new sorts of services on the Internet are giving rise to new companies doing new things.'' The training program, he said, is intended to help the revival by enhancing the abilities of job seekers and advancing the skills of current workers who are challenged by constant change. ''The training program is part of an effort to keep the New York region as competitive as possible,'' not only with China and India, he said, but with high-tech hubs like Boston and northern Virginia.
 After growing an average of about 15 percent a year since the early 1990's, Mr. Bernstein said, the number of software and information technology jobs in New York City has plummeted in the last five years. How much, he added, is not entirely clear. 
 The New York State Labor Department has estimated that the number of jobs at New York City companies specializing in computer systems design and related services totaled 50,000 in November 2000, but was 33,000 to 34,000 in November 2002, 2003 and 2004. It was estimated at 35,000 two months ago. 
 Such companies, however, employ fewer than half the computer specialists in the city, the department's statistics indicate. Many are employed by financial institutions, communications companies, government agencies and other organizations, and their numbers are more difficult to track, Mr. Bernstein said. 
 In any case, the Labor Department has estimated that the overall number of computer specialists and systems managers in the city will grow to 127,000 in 2012 from 103,000 in 2002.
 The training courses, offered on two levels, were drawn up by the City University of New York's Institute for Software Design and Development, which also provides the instruction. 
 An advanced level, completed so far by more than 450 people, is for workers like Mr. Coello, who attend on their company's time to improve their skills. These courses are short but intensive, usually running 25 to 35 hours over a week, covering topics that have included building and deploying firewalls, managing software projects and working with XML, a Web standard that facilitates data sharing across systems.
 An intermediate level, completed by nearly 80 people, is mostly for those seeking their first job in the industry and for those who have been displaced because their skills are obsolete. These courses, running several months, include topics like designing and developing Web-based applications using the Java programming language, and installing and maintaining servers, the computers that provides services like e-mail routing to other computers on a network. 
 Mr. Bernstein said that the federal grant paying for the program would run out in April, and that his group was looking for alternative financing. One possibility, he said, is having companies share the cost of the advanced courses. 
 Two more advanced course are scheduled with the remaining grant money, both starting in February, and have openings. Their subjects are described on his group's Web site, nysia.org. Further intermediate courses -- students in the latest will graduate Jan. 31 -- will be scheduled when new financing is arranged, Mr. Bernstein said. 
 The program, which has no beginner courses, has included efforts to help the intermediate students get jobs, and many have been placed with organizations like I.B.M. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he said.
 Mr. Ruggiero, 24, a Brooklyn resident, said recently that he had been unable to land a job in the computer industry despite a computer science degree earned at Hunter College, from which he graduated in 2004. He realized, he said, that the kind of companies he hoped to work for ''want to see that you have hands-on knowledge of the Windows environment, especially the Windows Server environment,'' which he had not been taught in college.
 So after passing the aptitude test for the intermediate program, he signed up for classes that included instruction in the Microsoft Windows Server System. Now, as a network engineer with Corporate Power, a technology management consulting company in Manhattan, ''the majority of work I do is on Windows Server,'' he said.
 Ms. Reynolds, a 30-year-old Manhattan resident, graduated from City College two years ago with a major in computer science. After working as an intern in computer programming at General Electric, she decided that her next step would be learning Java, so she took a course in the group's program.
 Though she does not use Java in her current job as a program analyst with ALLSector Technology Group, a Manhattan consulting company, knowing the language, she said, will be valuable for a future job.
 Mr. Coello, 27, from Staten Island, was already working as a database specialist at Metis Associates, a consulting company in Manhattan, when he took an advanced course. He had been working with databases built and managed with the Microsoft Access system, but to work with larger databases, he said, he had to learn a more comprehensive system, Microsoft SQL Server.
 So at his boss's suggestion, he said, he took the course on Microsoft SQL, and ''it enabled me to get into more advanced and bigger projects at my company.''

HEADLINE: The Independent Drugstore Goes the Way of the Soda Fountain

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
ON the Internet, a search for Kaye's Pharmacy and Home Healthcare in Meriden turns up this advertisement: ''Kaye's Pharmacy. Your real neighborhood drugstore.''
 The virtual Kaye's may be a neighborhood drugstore, but the real Kaye's was bought by CVS in 2003. And it is just another on a long list of independent drugstores in the state that have been taken over by chains, showing how Connecticut has become a microcosm of the battle between the mammoths of the drug industry: Walgreens and CVS, and to a lesser degree their smaller competitors, including Brooks Pharmacy and Rite Aid.
 Hardly a month goes by that a local planning and zoning commission does not see a proposal for another store, even if the town already has two or three within striking distance. Add to that the pharmacies in the local Shaw's and Stop & Shop, and drugstores seem to be flooding the landscape. 
 But the perception belies a more complex reality: Connecticut has fewer pharmacies than it did 14 years ago, and certain areas remain underserved. The chains have undeniably grown in the state. Walgreens, which operates 5,000 stores nationwide, has 53 in Connecticut, and it plans to open 10 more this year and 10 more in 2007. CVS, with 5,300 stores nationwide, operates 132 in Connecticut. 
 Yet some independent drugstores are fighting back, trying to find new ways to capitalize on their traditional strengths of customer service and personal interaction. 
 In 2005, there were 645 drugstores in Connecticut, according to state figures, said Margherita R. Giuliano, the executive vice president of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association. Of these, 479 were chain stores and 166 were independents, she said. 
 Fourteen years ago, there were 743 pharmacies in the state, she said. Of that number, 265 were chains, and 478 were independent. From 1992 to 1996, the independents closed at a faster rate than the chains grew, falling victim to competition, higher costs and lower insurance-reimbursement rates.
 ''That's a pretty staggering number when you think that's the number of businesses that closed in one industry in a four-year period,'' Ms. Giuliano said, ''and we're a small state.'' 
 She witnessed the effect firsthand. George Loalbo, her uncle, and his partner, Frank Bonelli, were the owners of Tunxis Pharmacy in West Hartford when a CVS store opened next door. The two drugstores shared a parking lot. 
 When the partners were ready to retire, they could not find a buyer. ''Uncle George ended up having to sell to CVS because nobody could afford to purchase his pharmacy,'' Ms. Giuliano said. ''Independent pharmacies are the real community pharmacy. Their owners live in the community, give to the community. They're the ones who sponsor the Little League teams. People forget these little businesses are a big part of their tax bases.''
 The loss of the independent drugstores in conjunction with the growth of the big chain drugstores has spawned new critics who say that convenience has trumped community, and in turn, that communities will end up paying in the future.
 ''Often when these stores come in, they are touted as job creators or tax-revenue creators, but studies show that's not the case,'' said Stacy Mitchell, the author of ''The Big-Box Swindle: The True Cost of Mega-Retailers and How Citizens Can Fight Back'' (Beacon Press, 2006). She is also the senior researcher for the Institute for Self-Reliance in Minneapolis, a nonprofit organization that is an advocate for community-oriented economic development.
 The institute did a study in Maine that tracked the dollars spent at locally owned businesses. ''Those businesses then spent their money locally,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''But much of the dollars that go into a CVS leaves the local economy. And there are many other things -- quality of life, the value of being a unique place that helps draw entrepreneurs, the importance of local investment. There is a civic value to the kinds of social economic webs that you don't see in a place where the business is headquartered elsewhere.'' 
 Mike DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, said the company's business model is based on customer convenience.
 ''CVS offers multiple convenient locations,'' he said. ''Any CVS customer can use any CVS pharmacy, the pharmacy is open late at night or even 24 hours to handle emergency prescriptions, we have automated phone lines where customers can call in and have their prescriptions ready when promised, and CVS has drive-through pharmacy service. Having said that, I want to reiterate that our pharmacists live and work in the community, just as pharmacists who work for the independent drugstores do.''
 Daniel Tuba is the town planner in Monroe, a town of not quite 20,000, where several chain drugstores have opened in the commercial district, and more are on the way.
 ''They probably offer a lot of things to people who are looking for convenience,'' Mr. Tuba said. ''People run in and grab a quick item or two. These stores fill that niche. Instead of somebody traveling to a big-box store someplace, they can just get the basic needs there.''
 In Glastonbury, the town's Plan and Zoning Commission denied an application by CVS to remove almost 6,000 truckloads of dirt from a hillside to make way for a new building. The town already has two CVS stores and a Stop & Shop pharmacy; a Walgreens is going up, and another CVS is in East Hartford, just over the town's border. But Patricia Low, a member of the commission, said the decisions of the agency are based on the facts of each case.
 ''We live in a capitalist society,'' Ms. Low said. ''We're not there to legislate whether there are 6 shoe stores or 12 shoe stores. We look at the regulations and the proposal there in front of us and how it fits the property.''
 On its Web site, Walgreens boasts that it opens a new store every 20 hours. When asked why Walgreens opens so many of its stores within a stone's throw of a CVS, Michael Polzin, a Walgreens spokesman, said, ''I wouldn't say that's the goal, but certainly we compete with them in markets across the country.''
 ''We do not locate a store simply based on where our competition is,'' he said. ''Certainly how the market is currently being served is one of the factors, but it's one of dozens of factors.''
 Mr. DeAngelis of CVS said: ''The markets that we are entering now are new and growing markets in terms of population growth and rise in elderly population.''
 ''We are moving where the population is moving,'' he explained. ''When we open a new store in Connecticut, it's more likely to be a relocation.''
 Mr. DeAngelis did not have a projection for new stores or relocations for CVS in Connecticut for the next year, saying the company was always seeking new opportunities. 
 The growth of the chain stores, along with other business pressures, has proponents of independent drugstores lobbying Congress for passage of the Community Pharmacy Preservation Act, which seeks to change antitrust laws to allow independent pharmacists to negotiate terms and conditions of insurance contracts as a collective unit. 
 Ms. Giuliano said: ''I think we're seeing a change in congressional recognition -- that it's critical to keep these independents in the mix. Without help, they're not going to be able to be in the mix with the pressures coming from the reimbursements and the costs of doing business.''
 Dan Lupariello's father opened Lupe's Pharmacy on Main Street in Bridgeport, two blocks from St. Vincent's Hospital, in 1946. His father eventually turned the business over to Mr. Lupariello. Recently, he talked about the changes he has seen, including the emergence of mail-order prescriptions and the massing of the chains.
 ''They're surrounding me,'' he said, laughing. ''They build them every mile or two. Initially, they didn't hurt my business, but now that they build so many stores, it has thinned out some of the new business I could probably get.''
 Still, Mr. Lupariello is a legend to his customers, including Deborah Moye, whose husband is a dialysis patient. 
 ''There aren't words to describe Danny or his staff,'' Mrs. Moye said. ''The people are absolutely phenomenal. I used to use the chains, but I don't anymore. I like the pharmacy that has a private owner and personalized service.'' 
 While the old-time corner drugstore was compact -- with space for the pharmacist, a couple of rows of isopropyl alcohol and bandages, and possibly a luncheon counter -- the new generation of chain drugstores is a spinoff of the old five-and-dime store, with a huge selection. Besides full-service photo processing, they offer rows of detergent, milk, eggs, paper goods of all kinds, toiletries, makeup, perfume, decorative items for whatever holiday is at hand, and in the rear, the pharmacy.
 Their demands for increasing amounts of space has drawn opposition in some localities, including West Hartford, where residents sued and lost to Walgreens in an effort to stop the Art Deco Elm Theater from becoming a drugstore. In Windsor Locks, several residents on Elm Street are appealing the town planning and zoning commission's approval of a Walgreens, contending it would harm their quality of life. That store is to be built close to a CVS.
 The big chains are not necessarily going into areas that need more pharmacies. Often, they move in across the street from an existing drugstore, like the CVS that sits across from Kerr's Village Pharmacy in Old Greenwich.
 In Monroe, all of the independent drugstores are gone. ''There's probably a lot of intangibles with that loss, in my mind the biggest loss being the personal touch and the personal relationships.'' said Mr. Tuba, the town planner. ''I hate to use this phrase, but it was the good old days: the druggist knew you, and you knew the druggist. You could have that conversation about medically related things and drug-related things. Now, when you go into a chain pharmacy, you look at the plaques listing the pharmacist on duty, and there are three of four names. Go back the next day, there are three of four different names.''
 Yet in Beacon Falls, a town in western New Haven County with 5,246 residents, just a quarter of the population of Monroe, there was no drugstore until two months ago. Then, in a move that went against the trend, Marion Bradley, a pharmacist, and her husband, Bob, a businessman, opened the independent Beacon Falls Pharmacy in the town's tiny commercial district, where it has joined a grocery store, a couple of gas stations, a tavern and a package store. 
 In a throwback to earlier days, the Bradleys are listed in the telephone book, just in case somebody needs them after hours, which somebody did recently -- the Bradleys drove down to their store, opened up and filled an emergency prescription. 
 ''We fill a little niche,'' said Mr. Bradley, who grew up in Beacon Falls. ''Seymour and Naugatuck next door have tons of chains, but we have none. That's been our selling point. We're getting a sense that our customers are kind of tired of the chains. Anyone who is in town has to make a 20-minute trip to get their prescriptions. So we save folks some time, and we do free deliveries. In an emergency, we're here for anybody who needs us.''

BYLINE: By Andrew Zimbalist. 
Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of economics at Smith College, is the author of the forthcoming ''In the Best Interests of Baseball? The Revolutionary Reign of Bud Selig.''

 BODY:
PLANS to build a new Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx have kicked up a small storm of local protest. Many people who live near Mullaly and Macombs Dam Parks, where the new stadium will be built, are concerned about what it will mean for their neighborhood, and rightfully so. But the crucial public policy question here is whether there will be a net benefit for residents of the Bronx and the other boroughs. The answer is yes. 
 Those who want no disruption and the maintenance of the status quo need to think again. The existing stadium was built in 1923 and grows more unsafe and expensive to maintain with each year. The Yankees have been spending nearly $10 million a year on maintenance at Yankee Stadium -- money that their lease allows them to deduct from the rent they pay the city. Engineering studies say it's time to build a new stadium. 
The Yankees are proposing a fair financial deal to the city. Nationally, during the last 15 years, the public share in stadium development costs (that is, the stadium plus roads, utilities and so forth) for professional sports has averaged around 75 percent. The Yankees are planning to spend $800 million of their own money on the new stadium (no major league baseball team has spent more than $300 million on their own playing field). The city and state together will spend about $210 million for improvements in the neighborhood. By this reckoning, the public share is only about 21 percent.
 Yet most of this public spending will be of direct benefit to the community, and a significant share will come back to the state and city. As part of the $210 million, the city will spend a projected $130 million to replace and upgrade the parks and their athletic facilities. According to the plan, there will be 10 percent more park space, more ball fields, an upgrade to the existing running track and soccer field and the addition of basketball, handball and tennis courts. 
 Contrary to some reports, these fields will be at ground level. Other than the new tennis center, which will be on the river (part of a 5.5-acre riverfront park with esplanade and bubble for winter use), the fields and open space are linked, and adjacent to the new stadium. Together with the development of surrounding commercial space and the prospect for a new Metro-North platform, the project will be a major facelift for the area and help gentrify the South Bronx.
 Also part of the $210 million is the state's investment of $70 million into new parking garages. Under the proposal, all parking revenue would go back to the state and more than pay off the investment. The city and state would each contribute $5 million toward other improvements.
 Further, the city will be able to sell off all the seats and other memorabilia from the present Yankee Stadium, lowering its net cost on the project. The Yankees are also agreeing to cover any cost overruns on the new stadium.
 Naysayers will object that the Yankees contemplate getting a substantial part of the construction financing from tax-exempt bonds issued by a new local development corporation. Debt service on these bonds will be covered by the Yankees via payments in lieu of taxes to the corporation. The critics will argue that if the Yankees cover the debt service instead of paying taxes, then, in effect, the public treasury is paying for the bonds and the stadium through forfeited tax collections. 
 This objection was valid in the case of the vetoed West Side stadium for the Jets, but it applies only to a small degree to the Yankees project. The Bronx is already in a tax abatement zone -- commercial developers in the borough don't pay real estate taxes on new projects for 15 years. 
 So while it could be argued that in net terms, the Yankees are contributing only $756 million to the new stadium and not $800 million, the team is still paying 75 percent of the total project costs.
 All major investment projects, no matter how positive they may be for a community, disrupt the life of somebody. Undoubtedly, some residents will be made worse off. But as an investment, the Yankees' stadium plan is a winner for the Bronx and all of New York.

HEADLINE: Mott Street Blues

BYLINE: By RICHARD MORGAN. 
E-mail: streetlevel@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN Philip Lam's office, at Green City Realty on Market Street near the Manhattan Bridge, a picture of a property under renovation is pinned to the wall. The two-bedroom condo has huge windows, pristine hardwood floors and an airy luxury that gives the space the look of a SoHo loft.
 But this attractive posting has people in Chinatown worried. The condo sits not in SoHo but at 173-5 East Broadway, right in their neighborhood. The other 28 condos under development in the 60,000-square-foot building are no less luxe, and will variously offer 18-foot ceilings, four exposures and gas fireplaces, and carry price tags of $600,000 to $5 million. 
In an odd juxtaposition, crowded, workaday Chinatown is surrounded by some of Manhattan's poshest neighborhoods, such as SoHo and TriBeCa. If those areas begin to spill over on them, Chinatown residents fear, they may be priced out of their own neighborhood. Many manufacturers have already moved to cheaper locations, like Sunset Park, Brooklyn; Mr. Lam and other real estate agents also report a recent uptick in the number residential buyers who are not of Chinese descent.
 The resentment is growing, among nonresidents who treasure the area's character and, especially, local residents who feel invaded. ''This is not for the outside world,'' Zhihao Song, a 32-year-old garment worker, said. ''This is for the Chinese people.'' The other day, as he picked with chapped hands through exotic produce at an open market under the Manhattan Bridge, he asked, ''What can you call Chinatown if the Chinese people cannot live here?''
 The lure of Chinatown grew this month, when Gov. George E. Pataki designated it as one of the first of a dozen new economic Empire Zones. The program grants a mix of tax benefits to encourage development. 
 ''It's just supply and demand, very simple,'' Dean Lui, the owner of Century 21 New Golden Age, a real estate firm at Chatham Square, said of Chinatown's allure. ''We are a lot cheaper than TriBeCa and just a few blocks away. It makes a lot of sense.'' 
 But this surge of buyers and investors cannot be easily absorbed with more buildings; Chinatown is cramped as it is. As a result, condo prices in Chinatown have soared, from about $450 a square foot in 2004 to about $700 a square foot today. Mr. Lui, who handles higher-end condos, said he had seen the average cost go from $860 a square foot two years ago to $1,100 now.
 Mr. Lam, who has sold real estate in the area for 17 years, makes the best of the situation by working as a Mandarin-speaking middleman for the new non-Chinese owners of eight rental buildings, all residential. ''For every 20 Chinese buyers in Chinatown, there is just one American buyer,'' he said. ''But two, three years ago, that was one American for every 50 Chinese buyers.'' Mr. Lui, for his part, estimated that over the past few years, the Chinese stake in Chinatown ownership has fallen to 75 percent from 90 percent.
 Mr. Lam said of the change: ''This is America, so it doesn't surprise me too much. If I could buy buildings, I could either buy one building in SoHo that will go up a little bit in value over the next five years, or I could buy five buildings in Chinatown that might double in value.'' 
 John Kuo Wei Tchen, a history professor at New York University who specializes in Chinese immigration, has a different calculus. Development has been a ''neutron bomb,'' he said, that has reduced other ethnic enclaves to building facades, tourist traps and memorial plaques. He fears the same will happen in Chinatown. 
 ''To me, Chinatown is one of the few remaining real Manhattan neighborhoods,'' Dr. Tchen said. ''It's not just a facade here. You look around and what do you see? Little Italy is gone. The Jewish Lower East Side is gone. Even Harlem is fading. But Chinatown survives as the real thing. It's a living community.''
 If the signs are grim, Chinatown optimists can point to at least one sunnier fact. Chinese New Year, which begins on Jan. 29, will usher in the Year of the Dog. It is said to be a much luckier time than the current Year of the Rooster.

HEADLINE: A Place for Sex Offenders

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki has proposed turning a woodsy upstate prison into a pseudo-prison for certain convicted sex offenders who have already done their time. His impulse is understandable: rather than allow men who seem likely to repeat terrible crimes back onto the street, why not lock them up for psychiatric treatment until they get their impulses under control? The United States Supreme Court has declared the practice permissible for people deemed ''mentally abnormal,'' and 16 other states have so-called civil-confinement laws.
 But it isn't necessary to be a raging civil libertarian to be queasy about the Pataki plan, under which the state would spend $130 million to raze and replace Camp Pharsalia, 50 miles north of Binghamton, with a new treatment center run by the State Office of Mental Health. 
There will never be an easy or wholly satisfying solution to the problem of violent sexual criminals. Sickened by highly publicized crimes against children and dubious about the odds of rehabilitation, Congress and the states have been adopting ever-tougher laws governing where and how sex offenders can live, work and travel. 
 But peace of mind has been elusive. An era that began with laws requiring freed sex offenders to register with local law-enforcement officials now features laws requiring notification of neighbors when offenders move in, the posting of offenders' names on the Web, electronic monitoring and restrictive ''distance laws'' meant to keep them away from places like schools and parks. 
 Preventive detention for violent sex offenders is the natural end point of the logic embraced by Mr. Pataki and his allies: that these are a special class of misfits whom existing laws are incapable of subduing, and that no price is too high for safety. But while no one disputes society's obligation to protect the innocent, it is fair to ask whether the state's limited resources might be better deployed at the front end of the problem. A bill sponsored in the Assembly by Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Lentol, while allowing for the civil confinement of sexual predators, places a heavier emphasis on treatment behind bars. The current prison treatment system, underfunded and understaffed, typically offers six months of group therapy run by corrections officials. The Assembly bill would require at least two years of treatment by mental health professionals for everyone imprisoned for a felony sex offense, and provide for continued treatment after release. 
 But treatment is not the entire answer. Few would deny that the universe of sex criminals includes a small number of repeat offenders who do not respond to therapy, and that the criminal-justice system will eventually run out of ways to deal with them. The admittedly imperfect answer in that case would be to seek longer sentences for violent sex crimes to reduce the chances that dangerous predators will be released too soon, and to aggressively monitor offenders upon release with electronic bracelets and a strengthened parole system.
 Psychiatric treatment in prisons, intensive outpatient therapy and close monitoring are, in the main, preferable to a questionable reliance on preventive detention. The remaking of Camp Pharsalia, in fact, seems more like an upstate jobs program. We should not forget that only last year lawmakers were urging Mr. Pataki to keep Camp Pharsalia open somehow, lest its neighbors lose 100 jobs and $11 million in economic activity. 
 We are all for upstate development, but the more urgent questions have to do with public safety and whether lavishing resources on a place for warehousing a small subset of sex offenders -- rather than aggressively treating and keeping tabs on a far larger cohort of criminals -- will really make all of us safer, or just make it seem that way.

HEADLINE: New at E.R.'s: More Sense Of Urgency

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: Cortland Manor 

 BODY:
IT had all the markings of a typical emergency department waiting room: magazines scattered on end tables; a wall-mounted television; more than two dozen institutional chairs lining the walls. 
 Only the people were missing. On a recent weekday afternoon, the waiting room at the Hudson Valley Hospital Center here was empty. The hospital has adopted a no-wait emergency room procedure. A recent $1 million renovation eliminated the registration desk. A greeter now sends patients to one of three triage rooms. Insurance information is taken at bedside. The department is split into two zones: fast track, for minor injuries and illnesses treatable by nurse practitioners, and critical care.
''Nobody wants to wait for anything anymore,'' said Dr. Raymond Iannaccone, director of the emergency department. ''We have to focus on clinical care, but no-wait is also good medical care.'' 
 The revamped emergency room is among the first in a wave of planned emergency department renovations in the county. Most have similar aims -- to reduce waiting times, expand working space, improve privacy and upgrade technology. 
 White Plains Hospital, which has the busiest emergency room in the county, with 45,000 visits last year, plans a $10 million renovation that will double its size by 2008. Phelps Memorial Hospital, in Sleepy Hollow, just broke ground for a $12 million project that will triple the size of its emergency department.
 Officials at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, which last updated its emergency department in 2000, said that they plan a $7 million expansion, adding space for triage, fast-track and acute-care areas, and a new preadmissions unit for patients awaiting admission that will free more emergency beds. Northern Westchester Hospital, in Mount Kisco, is planning an all-new emergency department, double the size of the current one. Cost estimates run from $13 million to $16 million.
 Sound Shore Medical Center, in New Rochelle, aims to double the size of its emergency department over the next two years. Mount Vernon Hospital has similar plans: officials there hope to open a new $2.7 million department in a year. 
 And at Hudson Valley Hospital Center here, the expansion isn't yet finished; more work is planned, at a cost of about $8 million, hospital administrators say.
 Several factors are driving this trend, the first of which is an overall increase in the number of emergency visits. Jon Schandler, president of White Plains Hospital, said that emergency room visits there increased by 8.8 percent last year. Hudson Valley Hospital had a 10.7 percent increase over that period. Similarly, Lawrence Hospital, which had 25,000 visits in 1993, had 34,000 last year. 
 These increases have various causes, said Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents hospitals, nursing homes and other providers, and president of the State Medical Society, which represents doctors. One reason, he said, is that because Medicaid reimbursements are low, many doctors simply tell their sick patients to go to the emergency room for treatment. 
 The growing number of uninsured people adds to the pressure on emergency rooms, too, because they turn to the emergency rooms for non-emergency ailments, but even privately insured people are being seen there, because their doctors, needing to meet minimum quotas of patient visits per hour to maintain profitability, cannot afford to see too many time-consuming sick patients. 
 The aging of the population has also increased demand for emergency room space, according to experts. Once at the emergency room, elderly people tend to stay a lot longer, because their medical problems are more complicated. ''Ninety-two-year-old people with abdominal pain and a list of 15 medicines they're on, that's not going to be a 20-minute visit,'' said Joel Seligman, president and chief executive of Northern Westchester Hospital. ''That's going to be hours of observation, a CAT scan, a lot of lab work, and it's going to take up one of those beds for hours. Years ago, we might have taken mom or dad to the doctor's office on a Thursday afternoon. These days, if you call, they're going to say 'Take her to the E.R.' ''
 More pressure comes from hospital closings. Whenever hospitals close, emergency rooms in other hospitals tend to pick up the slack, and in Westchester in 2003, the closing of two community hospitals -- United Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester and St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains -- added pressure to the remaining emergency departments, particularly at White Plains Hospital. 
 Throw in a general nursing shortage, a surge in substance abuse and the fallout from deinstitutionalizing mentally ill patients in the 1980's and 1990's, Mr. Sisto said, and it is not surprising that emergency departments are at capacity. In addition, the emergency departments help out when there is a logjam elsewhere in a hospital; much of the monitoring equipment in the intensive care unit can also be found in emergency, and acutely ill patients can be held there.
 YET despite all these factors, investing millions of dollars in emergency departments does not seem to make sense at first glance. Hospitals in New York State have been losing money for seven years, according to the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers, and emergency departments tend to be money losers. They are expensive to run, with high-tech equipment and intensive staffing, and many patients they treat don't need such high-level care.
 But hospitals are making the investment because the emergency department is the portal for admissions, as well as the first impression many people get of the hospital. ''E.R.'s tend not to be profitable on a per se basis, if you look at it as a revenue center,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. ''However, where the equation changes is that half the admissions on the inpatient side come in from the emergency department, so from the hospital economic point of view, having a top-drawer emergency department is tantamount to having a good hospital.''
 In 2003, the most recent year for which figures are available, 48 percent of all Westchester hospital admissions came through an emergency room, according to the hospital association. At Phelps, 67 percent of patients were admitted through the emergency department; at Lawrence, the figure was 50 percent, and at Hudson Valley it was ''close to 70 percent,'' said John C. Federspiel, president of the hospital.
 Having an efficient, patient-friendly emergency department is also an important marketing tool, hospital administrators say. 
 ''It's the first contact, certainly, for people who are new in the community, and particularly those with young families,'' said Keith Safian, the chief operating officer at Phelps. ''Our whole focus here is to eliminate all the anxieties about something everyone hates: going to the emergency room and waiting.''
 The plans at Phelps include eliminating the standard all-purpose waiting room. Instead, patients will be taken to a private treatment space for triage and treatment. The 30 private rooms will have telephones, televisions and chairs for visitors, although there will be a larger family waiting area for relatives who prefer that. Pediatric patients and their families will have a separate area, with a playroom.
 Several hospitals already have a greeter or ombudsman who acts almost like a concierge, keeping patients informed of how far along they are in their treatment, and sometimes providing coffee or cookies. 
 ''Many people do not understand why someone else is taken when they've been waiting for four hours, and in the meantime we may have had four ambulances coming in with cardiac arrests,'' said Heather Morrison, vice president for development and marketing at Lawrence Hospital, which hired a greeter in 2004. ''If your child is 3 years old and has a cut and is crying or bleeding, you're anxious. A greeter will let that person know what is happening.''
 Similarly, White Plains Hospital has two patient representatives to communicate with families. 
 ''Everyone is vulnerable and nobody wants to be there,'' said Mr. Schandler, the White Plains Hospital president. ''The biggest problem is, people don't have the information they need. People are willing to wait, at least if they know that lab work is being done or we had a more critical patient come in.''
 The new emergency department at White Plains will have dedicated spaces for chest-pain patients, stroke victims and children, he said. There will be a large fast-track area so that patients who are not critically ill can move through more quickly. In addition to curtains, there will be glass partitions, which provide more privacy for conversations. All the renovations include plans for increased privacy, upgraded technology and expanded fast track areas. 
 But even as they expand, hospitals are keeping an eye on demographics. Residential construction in the White Plains area is booming. Mr. Federspiel, of Hudson Valley Hospital, said there are 3,000 new units of housing being built in the hospital's catchment area.
 Near Phelps, three different developments under way will add more than 1,700 households to the area. Hospital administrators also point to the trend of retirees choosing to stay in Westchester rather than move.
 ''We are trying to build our new emergency department so that 10 years from now, when the 30 private rooms are not enough for the community, we can expand again,'' said Mr. Safian of Phelps.

HEADLINE: Key to Health-Club Vigor: Stay Limber 

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
HEALTH clubs and gyms have not had an easy time lately in Westchester: A middling economy has put a damper on some companies' growth; others have seen business siphoned off by the rapid incursion of national chains like Curves, which offer quickie workouts at relatively modest prices. 
 Fitness companies seem to be responding by taking their own advice: Stay flexible. Those already established in the county have been making themselves more available by adding outlets, some aimed at specific subsets of fitness buffs. 
Last March, for example, Altheus opened a high-intensity cycling and endurance facility just a half-mile from its main performance and training fitness center in Rye. The new place is partly a retail store, but also a performance laboratory where cyclists can hook their bikes up to computers to simulate some 300 bicycle race courses, like the Tour de France. 
 Club Fit, on the other hand, has been trying to give its clubs more of a resortlike air, by adding features like larger pools and more children's activities. Together, its two locations -- one in Briarcliff Manor, the other in Jefferson Valley -- have 600 to 700 children a week on their client lists.
 According to Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data, a sports market-research company in Hartsdale, certain segments of the public may be riper targets for fitness providers. Health club membership nationwide has grown 138 percent over all since 1987, but among those older than 55, it has grown 563 percent; among those under 18, the number amounts to 230 percent. 
 ''The fitness industry is a tricky business,'' Mr. Lauer said in a recent interview, ''but senior fitness is still a hot button within the industry, as is kids' fitness.'' 
 So far, only a few commercial health clubs here have made a concerted effort to lure the over-55 set, but children's fitness has picked up support. Velocity Sports, for example, offers training, in very small groups, for children 8 to 18. And Bill Beck, a Club Fit owner, says that over the next five years his company will pursue competitive sports training for children.
 In Westchester, Mr. Lauer estimates, there are now about 80 commercial health and fitness clubs in Westchester, with some 75,000 members. But that number seems to be growing. 
 Over the past year New York Sports Clubs has opened three clubs in the county. In September it opened its largest Westchester club to date: a sleek 56,000-square-foot facility on the roof of the City Center in White Plains. 
 Judy Taylor, a spokeswoman for Equinox, which already has clubs in Scarsdale and Mamaroneck, says the company is looking aggressively to expand in the area.
 Expansion is also on the cards for Velocity Sports Performance, based near Atlanta, which already has 62 centers nationwide, and The Gym, based in Montvale, N.J. Both companies are now opening their first clubs in Westchester, on Business Park Drive in Armonk. And Velocity has already sold the rights to two more clubs within the county to a local franchisee, Brian Fee. 
 Club Fit, for its part, is in negotiations with three local condominium developers on plans to manage their fitness facilities. 
 Convenience is another way to win customers, and New York Sports Clubs, whose parent company is Town Sports International, has so far put about half its Westchester clubs into local shopping centers. 
 Partnerships can also help profitability. Altheus opened its main facility in Rye three years ago, but lately it has been busy trying to spread its personalized approach to fitness by partnering with other clubs -- some here in Westchester, some in Manhattan. 
 Last fall, it began offering services at the West End Sports and Aquatic Center, on West 63rd Street in Manhattan, where it runs a training center for triathletes, and it has already partnered with Sports and Fitness Ventures, a Mamaroneck company that operates throughout New York City, to start a cycling and endurance center near Union Square. 
 In Westchester, meanwhile, Altheus is working to take its services to The Club @ 800 Squash & Fitness, a Rye Brook-based company that specializes in corporate fitness and high-performance squash. 
 To Dr. Tom Crawford, Altheus's founder, this kind of expansion makes sense. ''We don't want to go into the real estate business, nor do we want to have a cookie-cutter approach,'' he said. ''Still, we want to extend our business model, so partnering makes sense.''

HEADLINE: Now Even the Suburbs Are Getting Suburbs

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN and DAVID SCHARFENBERG

 BODY:
TEN years ago, when the Narin family decided to move to Westchester, they might have been following a script. With children nearing school age, they sold their condominium in the Bronx and bought a house in Cortlandt Manor in search of better schools.
 Hundreds of thousands before them had beaten that well-worn path from the city to the suburbs, and for good reason. ''It's homey,'' David Narin said. ''It's very, very nice. There's nothing wrong here -- except the prices are crazy.''
But Mr. Narin, a real estate agent, is bent now on rewriting his family's second act, the one in which the children graduate from high school and go to college. During a vacation in Florida last year he saw an opportunity: a growing economy in a place with low property taxes and no income tax. So he is buying a house near Orlando. Even though it's about the same size as his three-bedroom colonial in Westchester, he stands to pocket a six-figure profit in the move to Florida. 
 ''It's a nice, cozy community,'' Mr. Narin said. ''You get more home for your money.'' 
 A quest for affordable housing is drawing greater numbers of young people, families and empty nesters from the suburbs surrounding New York City and casting them out to destinations near and far, a New York Times review of migration data shows. 
 Mr. Narin is part of one of the fastest-growing segments: the exodus to central Florida. More than 1,700 other Westchester taxpayers followed that path in 2004, a 40 percent increase over 1996. But the new emigres from Westchester are also choosing destinations in gentrifying neighborhoods in the city, exurban communities in Pennsylvania and upstate, and boomtowns in other parts of the Sun Belt.
 ''I do think a lot of this movement -- to Florida and the exurbs -- reflects, in part, a 'housing affordability' movement, or what I have sometimes termed a 'middle-class flight,' '' Prof. William Frey, a University of Michigan demographer, said in an e-mail message. ''They'll move as far out as eastern Pennsylvania or northern Connecticut. But many are probably looking at Sun Belt markets, including central Florida, Georgia, North Carolina.''
 Not that there is any danger of the county's emptying out. Thousands are still following the traditional migratory paths from New York City to Westchester and to other inner-ring suburbs like Long Island and northern New Jersey. And, of course, many continue to have children when they arrive, so the population is not declining.
 But more people leave than arrive, and that excess is growing. The net emigration from Westchester was 4,252 households in 2004, up 50 percent from 1996.
 A review of Internal Revenue Service data on taxpayers who move from one address to another between tax years shows the following pattern from 1996 to 2004, the most recent year available:
 Increasing numbers of Westchester's young people and empty nesters are emigrating to Brooklyn, Queens, even the Bronx. The number of households that moved from Westchester to the Bronx in 2004 was 30 percent higher than in 1996. 
 Middle-class flight from older suburbs to exurbs is accelerating. Westchester families are skipping over next-door Putnam and Rockland communities to settle in Dutchess and Orange Counties. They are moving in smaller but fast-increasing numbers to Monroe and Pike Counties in Pennsylvania, to Burlington and Ocean Counties in central New Jersey and to New Haven County in Connecticut. 
 Increasing numbers of taxpayers are leaving for more-affordable suburbs and cities across the country, especially in central and northern Florida. The rate of migration from Westchester to Osceola County, south of Orlando, has tripled since 1996. The new Florida migrants are not predominantly retirees; moves from Westchester to traditional coastal retirement destinations like St. Petersburg, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach have not increased as much.
 Professor Frey wrote: ''There seems to be a widening out of the traditional city population (young people, minorities and immigrants) while suburbia moves further out. Pricey inner suburbs are spreading to mid-New Jersey and Connecticut, and affordable suburbs for young families are populating areas that had not previously been considered in New York's orbit.''
 THOMAS PORTER and Richard Purdue, a couple for the last 23 years, spent the better part of the 1990's on an experiment in expansive suburban living: fixing up a large four-bedroom house in Larchmont. When they finished, they realized it was too much.
 ''We loved living there, loved Larchmont,'' said Mr. Porter, 46, an architect. ''But when we were done, we said, 'We don't need this.' ''
 In October 2002, Mr. Porter and Mr. Purdue, 46, a scientific consultant, bought a waterfront condominium on City Island, a Bronx community in Long Island Sound that is gentrifying but retains a faded Victorian charm.
 They are part of a growing wave of suburbanites moving within city boundaries. The I.R.S. data show that these people tend to have smaller family sizes than migrants to other destinations, and demographers say they are either the grown-up children of suburbia, or people who have completed the jobs they moved to suburbia to do -- in other words, empty nesters.
 ''They may have originally come from the boroughs to suburbia,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Affairs at Rutgers University. ''Now they want to go back to where there are more activities, and Manhattan is too expensive.'' Emigration from the suburbs to Manhattan itself is indeed declining. But the number heading to the outer boroughs is growing. In 2004, the most recent year for which data are available, Brooklyn and the Bronx had the biggest increases over the 1996 levels -- about 20 percent. Emigration to Manhattan was down about 8 percent in that time period.
 ''We get some people who normally would be going to Harlem or Park Slope or Prospect Heights, and have found those places to be too expensive,'' said Glen Calderon, a real estate agent who sells property in the South Bronx. 
 This wave is also likely to contain a lot of grown-up suburban children. Although this group has always tended to leave just after college and return later with families, the 20- and 30-somethings of today are finding affordable suburban residences ever more elusive.
 ''It's outrageous to pay those kind of taxes to live in the suburbs if you don't have kids in the schools,'' said Dayna Basile, who grew up in Westchester but recently bought a house in the Bronx. She has two children who are not yet school age. ''I don't know what I'll do when they're older,'' she added.
 Michael Aparo, a 34-year-old actor, is in the process of moving from a one-bedroom co-op in Yonkers into a one- or two-bedroom waterfront co-op in the Bronx. ''Yonkers is a great neighborhood,'' he said in a recent telephone interview. ''I got nothing against it. But I feel like the Bronx is where it's happening -- my business is down here.''
 THE lower the income, the farther the move: That's what the income curve of the families exiting Westchester reveals. Those with incomes below the county average, but not too far below, are moving to the next county out, the I.R.S. data show. 
 ''It seems to me that there is a definite trend toward moving to the outer exurbs among families from all over the New York region,'' Professor Frey wrote. ''They appear to be low-income families at the early stage of the lifecycle.''
 The exurban trend has been noted by demographers for some time, and the I.R.S. data confirm that it isn't just city people who are filling the new subdivisions in more remote areas, but also a stream from the older suburbs.
 In Westchester's case, the migration data show that Orange County in New York and New Haven County in Connecticut are the fastest growing of these more-remote destinations. Putnam and Rockland Counties still get an influx from Westchester, but those numbers did not change much from 1996 to 2004. The number of families moving to Orange nearly doubled.
 ''Starter homes for today's young New Yorkers aren't in close-in Levittown (as in earlier generations) but really far out,'' Professor Frey wrote.
 ''Far out'' increasingly means leaving the region entirely. As the I.R.S. data show, families leaving the metropolitan area tend to have lower incomes. Demographers say these are young families looking for a better mix of income, cost of living and climate. The most popular destinations are in central Florida.
 The trail to from New York to Florida was blazed by retirees, and that flow continues. But more and more it is enhanced by families. Migration to St. Petersburg, a notable destination for Westchester taxpayers with low family size -- retirees -- has fallen by 26 percent. But the flow to Tampa, just next door, is up 102 percent.
 Other Sun Belt destinations are also increasing in popularity -- for instance, San Diego gets twice as many Westchester taxpayers as in 1996. But Florida is a favorite, perhaps because it is perceived to have become friendlier to New Yorkers.
 ''There have been so many immigrants from the Northeast over the years, mainly retirees, that they brought the Northeast with them,'' said Mr. Hughes, the Rutgers professor. ''Central Florida has been reinvented as the Northeast without snow.'' 
 The economy is good, even if incomes are not as large. 
 ''Florida is now a very diversified economy,'' he added. ''It's not too different from the Northeast economy. The jobs don't pay as well, but the cost of living is so much cheaper.''
 That contrast in living costs can be especially stark for suburban New Yorkers, who are among the leading contributors to central Florida's population. The top three non-Florida counties contributing residents to Tampa in 2004 were Queens; Cook County, Ill.; and Suffolk on Long Island.
 ''The 'new' New York-to-Florida migration is not just old-timers but younger and middle-age families to central Florida,'' Professor Frey says. ''These along with movers to other Sunbelt suburbs represent a new, extended version of suburbanization -- people in quest of a suburban lifestyle who cannot afford the suburbs within the New York area, or deal with the long commute to the exurbs.''
 Mr. Narin, the Cortlandt Manor resident, believes it will be a good place not only to buy a home for himself, but also to sell homes to those he believes are going to follow him.
 ''There's a lot of people moving down there,'' he said, ''so I should get a lot of leads.''

HEADLINE: A Place for Sex Offenders

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki has proposed turning a woodsy upstate prison into a pseudo-prison for certain convicted sex offenders who have already done their time. His impulse is understandable: rather than allow men who seem likely to repeat terrible crimes back onto the street, why not lock them up for psychiatric treatment until they get their impulses under control? The United States Supreme Court has declared the practice permissible for people deemed ''mentally abnormal,'' and 16 other states have so-called civil-confinement laws.
 But it isn't necessary to be a raging civil libertarian to be queasy about the Pataki plan, under which the state would spend $130 million to raze and replace Camp Pharsalia, 50 miles north of Binghamton, with a new treatment center run by the State Office of Mental Health. 
There will never be an easy or wholly satisfying solution to the problem of violent sexual criminals. Sickened by highly publicized crimes against children and dubious about the odds of rehabilitation, Congress and the states have been adopting ever-tougher laws governing where and how sex offenders can live, work and travel. 
 But peace of mind has been elusive. An era that began with laws requiring freed sex offenders to register with local law-enforcement officials now features laws requiring notification of neighbors when offenders move in, the posting of offenders' names on the Web, electronic monitoring and restrictive ''distance laws'' meant to keep them away from places like schools and parks. 
 Preventive detention for violent sex offenders is the natural end point of the logic embraced by Mr. Pataki and his allies: that these are a special class of misfits whom existing laws are incapable of subduing, and that no price is too high for safety. But while no one disputes society's obligation to protect the innocent, it is fair to ask whether the state's limited resources might be better deployed at the front end of the problem. A bill sponsored in the Assembly by Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph Lentol, while allowing for the civil confinement of sexual predators, places a heavier emphasis on treatment behind bars. The current prison treatment system, underfunded and understaffed, typically offers six months of group therapy run by corrections officials. The Assembly bill would require at least two years of treatment by mental health professionals for everyone imprisoned for a felony sex offense, and provide for continued treatment after release. 
 But treatment is not the entire answer. Few would deny that the universe of sex criminals includes a small number of repeat offenders who do not respond to therapy, and that the criminal-justice system will eventually run out of ways to deal with them. The admittedly imperfect answer in that case would be to seek longer sentences for violent sex crimes to reduce the chances that dangerous predators will be released too soon, and to aggressively monitor offenders upon release with electronic bracelets and a strengthened parole system.
 Psychiatric treatment in prisons, intensive outpatient therapy and close monitoring are, in the main, preferable to a questionable reliance on preventive detention. The remaking of Camp Pharsalia, in fact, seems more like an upstate jobs program. We should not forget that only last year lawmakers were urging Mr. Pataki to keep Camp Pharsalia open somehow, lest its neighbors lose 100 jobs and $11 million in economic activity. 
 We are all for upstate development, but the more urgent questions have to do with public safety and whether lavishing resources on a place for warehousing a small subset of sex offenders -- rather than aggressively treating and keeping tabs on a far larger cohort of criminals -- will really make all of us safer, or just make it seem that way.

HEADLINE: Vanishing in Southampton: Small Houses

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

DATELINE: Southampton 

 BODY:
THE roomy-looking 1960's ranch houses lining the Roscoe section's broad streets in the Village of Southampton lack ocean views, and they are not in a class with the spacious spreads glimpsed through privet hedges in the estate area of the village. Yet they hardly seem endangered.
 But a former mayor of the village, William J. Hattrick Jr., says their days are numbered. A surge of highly profitable McMansionizing that is sweeping the village will, he says, obliterate them, along with scores of other smaller and midsize houses, in a way that is rapidly changing the character of the historic village.
 ''They all have crossbones on them, they are all marked for death,'' said Mr. Hattrick, the president of the Southampton Association, an old-guard civic group with about 400 members, mostly seasonal residents who have owned homes in the village for many years. 
 Some of the Roscoe houses are being knocked down and replaced by much larger ones, while others are being expanded and remodeled beyond recognition, Mr. Hattrick said. Either way, one result is generally a huge house shoehorned onto a modest lot, dwarfing the houses of neighbors, who complain bitterly about lost privacy, light and ambience. ''Profits are fine,'' Mr. Hattrick said. ''Just don't kill the guy next door.''
 Demolition and home enlargement have become increasingly common all over Long Island in recent years, spurred by the same robust demand and low interest rates that sent house sales soaring. 
 But in this second-home Hamptons community, where real estate sometimes seems all-consuming and political infighting has become a blood sport with lawsuits for sabers, Mr. Hattrick and others say they see a deeply troubling new turn. 
 Real estate developers, builders and speculators are no longer just influential in the village, Mr. Hattrick and his supporters contend: drawn by big profits, the real estate interests, they say, have all but taken over local government, directly and through surrogates, and have cleared away all obstacles to the transformational big-house trend.
 ''They run this village,'' said Cathy Bellows, the former chairwoman of the village Board of Architectural Review and Historic Preservation, known locally as the A.R.B. ''And they've made it profitable to tear homes down.'' Even the older dwellings in the village's 770-building historic district are now at risk, she said. 
 The market for the big homes on small plots that almost everyone here now calls McMansions is obviously ravenous. Even the most modest existing homes in the village now often nudge the million-dollar mark in value, and the McMansions built in their place often command twice or three times as much. 
 The market is driven by well-heeled urbanites, many from New York City, who are willing to pay a premium for a large second home in a village that rings with panache and reeks of money. And it is fed by those among the 4,000 full-time residents of the village who see a golden chance to cash in and leave. ''All the sellers are locals and all the buyers are part-time residents,'' Mr. Hattrick said. 
 For several years, the McMansion trend was held at least partly in check in the village, first by a building moratorium and then, starting in 2004, by a zoning regulation known locally as the Bates Law, which limited the residential living space that could be built on smaller lots in the village to 10 percent of the lot's area plus 1,750 square feet. 
 The law, named for William F. Bates, a lawyer practicing in Riverhead whose term on the Southampton Village Board expires in June, was modeled on one that has been in force in East Hampton since the late 1990's, whose limits are even tighter -- 10 percent plus 1,000 feet. 
 On a quarter-acre lot in Southampton, the Bates Law allowed up to 2,840 square feet of living space to be built -- a large house by most standards, but small as McMansions go.
 Builders and developers hated the Bates Law, calling it too stringent and an assault on property rights. They argued that it left many existing homes in the village out of zoning compliance, and that it disregarded recommendations by a village planning commission. 
 The law became a central issue in the village elections last June, when the mayoralty and two more seats on the five-seat Village Board were at stake. In heavy voter turnout, a slate of candidates with strong backing from real estate interests swept to victory. 
 One of the first orders of business for the new majority was amending the Bates Law. It now allows living space of up to 12 percent of the lot's area plus 2,000 square feet, or a house of 3,300 square feet on a quarter-acre lot; homes may also be taller than was previously allowed. 
 The new majority also appointed Roger D. Blaugh, a home remodeler, as chairman of the A.R.B., replacing Ms. Bellows. Mr. Blaugh was the campaign manager for the new mayor, Mark Epley, and for one of the new trustees, Paul Robinson. 
 Mr. Blaugh said the changes simply replaced an overly stringent rule with a more-balanced approach that allowed the big-house trend to live on, within limits. ''The Bates Law steals your property rights,'' Mr. Blaugh said. ''People are going to react negatively to that, and that is going to bring them to the polls.'' 
 Other supporters of the new rules called them reasonable and responded appropriately to market demand. Critics, including Ms. Bellows, said the new formula allowed overly large houses and that the rules contain loopholes that allow even larger homes in some instances. They said that the village planning commission that opposed the Bates Law was dominated by real estate interests. 
 Mr. Hattrick, a senior vice president of Wachovia Securities in Southampton, said that the village had fallen further behind East Hampton in protecting its character from overbuilding. ''They have got us so outclassed,'' he said, referring to East Hampton's regulations.
 The new mayor, Mr. Epley, who is executive director of the Seafield Center, a drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment center in nearby Westhampton Beach, defended the new zoning rules as an economic necessity for the village. ''People make their money off of real estate, and most everything is associated with the real estate market,'' he said.
 Mr. Robinson, one of the two new trustees, is a retired Suffolk County administrator and an owner of rental properties in the village. The other new trustee, Nancy McGann, is a real estate sales representative. 
 They argued that the voters approved of their approach. The June election ''was a reflection of the sentiments of the citizens of the village,'' Mr. Robinson said.
 Mr. Bates said the law bearing his name was discarded before it had a chance. ''It provided an outstanding balance between allowing people to expand their homes while at the same time preventing overbuilding,'' Mr. Bates said. ''If someone wants to come into the village and renovate a property, I welcome that. But what they create should be compatible with what's there.'' 
 Mr. Hattrick said that opponents of the Bates Law tried to scare voters with talk that it would lower property values, even though prices were soaring in the village.
 The tighter restrictions on house size in East Hampton were enacted with no controversy, according to Larry Cantwell, the village administrator. ''Not one person spoke against the law at the hearing,'' he said.
 Southampton Village has fewer than 4,000 homes, more than half of them owned by part-time residents. Mr. Blaugh said that his board now receives about 40 applications for approval of construction or remodeling plans every month. 
 Far from harming the village, Mr. Blaughsaid, new and remodeled houses were often more aesthetically pleasing than what they replaced, and usually reflected historic building styles in the village. 
 ''What residents wanted was something fair and equitable,'' he said. ''They didn't want McMansions, but they wanted family rooms.'' 
 Mr. Hattrick and others said home enlargement on smaller lots was all about money, not aesthetics. ''Now the brokers have buyers in their pockets for anything that comes on the market,'' he said of the buyers, many of them developers active in the market. ''And the buyer never lives in the house. They simply tear it down and then the broker gets to sell the new house at three times the price.'' 
 Ms. McCann, the new trustee and a sales associate at Allan Schneider, an area real estate firm, said Mr. Hattrick was exaggerating for effect. ''He is painting a picture of things being completely out of control,'' she said. ''That is not the case. The voters have spoken, but apparently that's not enough for them.''
 But a former trustee, Harald Steudte, a builder, said he thought real estate avarice was indeed reshaping the village. 
 ''I would describe it as greedy,'' he said. ''What seems to be the norm is how quickly you can generate a lot of money. We cease to be neighborhoods where people live. We have become investment vehicles.''
 Mr. Steudte, who supported the Bates Law, was prevented from seeking re-election last June after a court ruled that his home, at the edge of the village, was just outside its boundary. Opponents of the Bates Law brought the suit challenging him.
 For its part, the Southampton Association argued last fall that Ms. McCann and, particularly, Mr. Robinson should not vote on zoning matters because of conflicts of interest. It claimed that Mr. Robinson owned at least eight investment properties in the village and stood to benefit directly from the zoning change.
 Mr. Robinson said he owned seven properties in the village, and that five were rental units. He said he had sold only two homes in the village over the past 14 years.

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Leader Solidifies Region's Leftward Tilt

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO and LARRY ROHTER; Juan Forero reported from Tiwanaku for this article, and Larry Rohter from Buenos Aires.

DATELINE: TIWANAKU, Bolivia, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
When Evo Morales, an Aymara Indian and former head of the Bolivian coca growers union, is sworn in as president on Sunday, it may be the hardest turn yet in South America's persistent left-leaning tilt, with the potential for big reverberations far beyond the borders of this landlocked Andean nation. 
 While mostly vague on details, and recently moderating his tone, Mr. Morales promises to transform Bolivia and ''end the colonial and neoliberal model,'' as he put it on Saturday in an elaborate ceremony at the sacred ruins of this pre-Incan civilization.
He has said he would ''depenalize'' cultivation of coca, the prime ingredient for cocaine, which Washington has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than two decades trying to eradicate. 
 He pledges to inject the state in Bolivia's oil and natural gas industry, troubling the multinational energy companies that first flocked here in the late 1990's, even though Mr. Morales recently said he would not expropriate foreign holdings.
 He has disparaged American-backed free trade policies, and seems certain to stand as the southernmost outpost of a new anti-American nexus with Cuba and Venezuela, whose president, Hugo Chavez, has become among the Bush administration's most ardent critics.
 Any and all of those steps in a country where coca tracts and rich energy holdings give it a strategic importance far outweighing its tiny population could unsettle Washington and the region. 
 Bolivia's gas reserves, the continent's second-largest, help power South America's largest economies. Brazil has plowed $1.5 billion into energy investments in Bolivia and worries about rising drug and crime problems in its urban slums if Bolivia's coca crop is not controlled.
 Mr. Morales is at least the seventh Latin American leader to take power since 2000 from the left, a varied crop that ranges from Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador to Venezuela, with strong leftist contenders surging in Peru and Mexico, both of which will also hold elections this year.
 His success is also the most prominent example of Latin America's recent democratic revolutions. Throughout the region, the indigenous and the poor, increasingly mobilized by frustration with Washington-backed economic prescriptions, have used the ballot box to put in place a group of leaders more representative of their interests for the first time in nearly five centuries. With the exception of Mr. Chavez, who is bankrolled by Venezuela's oil wealth, most of the continent's other left-leaning leaders, like Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, have pursued pragmatic policies once faced with the real task of governing. 
 In recent weeks, Mr. Morales has toned down some of his more strident language and struck a more accommodating note with American officials. But in Bolivia's case, political analysts here say, it is far harder to know exactly how Mr. Morales might rule. 
 Mr. Morales, a former congressman, is untested as an executive and known less as a pragmatist than as a fiery orator and protest leader. Several of his associates, including Vice President-elect Alvaro Garcia and Carlos Villegas, who will oversee economic planning, are leftist academics with no experience in government.
 ''There could be realism and pragmatism in their policies, or they could allow ideology to guide them,'' said Roberto Laserna, a political analyst with San Simon University in Cochabamba, the city where Mr. Morales makes his home. ''But we do not have a way to gauge their management experience.''
 What is clear is that Mr. Morales's compelling storybook rise to power has brought this isolated country of nine million people the kind of international attention it has rarely received. A former llama herder who saw four siblings die in childhood, Mr. Morales won Bolivia's Dec. 18 election in a landslide not seen since the country's return to democracy in 1982.
 The first Indian elected president in a country where most people are indigenous, Mr. Morales, dressed notably casually in an open-collar shirt and sweater, embarked on a 10-day world victory tour. He met this month with the President Jacques Chirac of France, President Hu Jintao of China and Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez of Spain. 
 On Saturday, in a ceremony attended by tens of thousands of Aymara and Quechua Indians at this archaeological site some 14,000 feet above sea level, Mr. Morales donned the replica of a 1,000-year-old tunic similar to those once used by Tiwanaku's wise men, was purified in an ancient ritual and accepted the symbolic leadership of the myriad indigenous groups of the Andes.
 ''We are not alone,'' Mr. Morales told the crowd. ''The world is with us. We are in a time of triumph, a time of change.''
 On Sunday, for his official state inauguration, he expected about a dozen foreign leaders, far more than have ever attended a Bolivian inauguration.
 Part of that solidarity stems from his role as representative of a new Latin American pole in global politics, as the region coalesces as a counterpoint to unpopular United States policies. More and more Latin American countries are taking exception to Washington's economic prescriptions and those of the International Monetary Fund. Some are strengthening ties with China, which is investing heavily in the region. 
 Many have refused to go along with Bush administration demands to exempt Americans from criminal prosecutions at the International Criminal Court at The Hague. No South American countries have sent soldiers to support the war in Iraq. And anti-American criticism has become political sport, as opinion surveys give President Bush the lowest standing in Latin America of any American president in the region's history.
 As varied as the region is, no other part of the world has seen as uniform a shift in its political landscape.
 Mr. Morales, however, has already had to find middle ground between the explosive populist talk that helped propel him to power and a pragmatic path that will help Bolivia's tiny $9.5 billion economy grow, said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Washington-based Center for Global Development, which studies economic issues affecting developing countries.
 In a 2002 interview, Mr. Morales told The New York Times that the solution to Bolivia's economic troubles was ''communal socialism,'' having peasant communes run mineral and metals mines and agriculture. Mr. Morales, while railing at globalization, now says that trade agreements can work, if fair to both sides, and that foreign investment is needed. 
 Since calling Mr. Bush a ''terrorist'' in December, he has sounded a more conciliatory tone. He noted this week that he, too, had been the target of harsh barbs from American officials.
 ''Everything here is pardoned,'' Mr. Morales said. ''We are in new times. Let us start talking, not in a dialogue of submission, but to find solutions.''
 Among those who will advise Mr. Morales is Juan Ramon Quintana, a moderate academic who has worked extensively with international organizations and governments. ''There is still the perception of Evo Morales as a radical leader,'' he said in an interview. ''But Evo Morales is undergoing an important transformation. We all believe that he can become a statesman.''
 The United States, too, has been more accommodating. Thomas Shannon, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, recently told reporters that Washington wanted dialogue with Mr. Morales and to continue ''positive relations'' between the two countries. 
 On Saturday night, he and the American ambassador, David Greenlee, met with Mr. Morales to lay the groundwork for future discussions. ''We want the Bolivian people to succeed, and for the Bolivian people to succeed, this government has to succeed,'' Mr. Shannon told reporters after the meeting. ''It's a democratically elected government, and we hope that we're going to be in a position to work with them.''
 Still, if the Bush administration decides that Mr. Morales is pursuing policies that run counter to American interests, either in trade or on drug policy, aid could be frozen or cut -- and the United States is this country's largest donor. It has provided $655 million from 2000 to 2004, two-thirds of it for development, and is considering a Bolivian request for $600 million to build roads.
 Solidarity aside, for Bolivia's neighbors, too, Mr. Morales's ascension creates new challenges as well that are hardly mitigated by the fact that most are led by nominally leftist governments. The main concern is assuring access to Bolivia's vast natural gas reserves.
 More than any other country, Brazil has vital economic interests to protect. About half the natural gas consumed in Brazil comes from Bolivia, one third of Bolivia's exports go to Brazil, and Brazilian companies are the largest group of investors in Bolivia, led by the state-dominated oil company Petrobras.
 So Brazil has watched with concern as Bolivia has become increasingly unstable in recent years. President da Silva's government has been careful not to arouse Bolivian nationalism, reacting calmly to Mr. Morales's statements that he is seeking ''partners, not bosses'' in developing its gas reserves. 
 When Mr. Morales visited Brazil this month, Mr. da Silva invited Bolivia to become a full member of Mercosur, the South American trade union that Brazil dominates. Membership, some analysts in the region say, could constrain any Bolivian temptation toward radicalism.
 ''We have the advantage, in that we are not run by a Brazilian Bush but a president whose origins, like those of Morales, are in the labor movement and who wants to avoid excessively dramatic conflicts,'' said Helio Jaguaribe, a leading Brazilian foreign policy analyst.
 The stakes are high for Argentina, too. Until now, Bolivian governments have provided it with gas at below market prices. Mr. Morales said during a visit to Buenos Aires this week that he planned to end that arrangement, a step that is likely to add inflationary pressures. 
 But Bolivia's most prickly relations will be with Chile, even with the election last week of the Socialist Michelle Bachelet as president. Chile's victory in a 19th-century war that cost Bolivia its coastline continues to bedevil the relationship. Mr. Morales has even criticized Chile's capitalism and close relations with the United States, and anti-Chilean sentiment remains rampant here.
 ''The United States wants to convert Chile into the Israel of Latin America,'' Mr. Morales charged in a newspaper interview that has been widely quoted in Chile. The two countries have not had full diplomatic relations since the 1970's, and Mr. Morales led a campaign against a pipeline that would have sent Bolivian gas to Mexico and the United States via a Chilean port.
 Still, Mr. Morales has invited Chile's departing president, Ricardo Lagos, to the inauguration, the first Chilean leader to visit Bolivia for such an occasion in decades. Ms. Bachelet has said she favors greater integration between Chile and its poorer neighbors.
 Indeed, Mr. Morales begins his term with good will -- and wariness -- all around. Venezuela has pledged diesel fuel and energy cooperation, while Spain has offered debt relief, according to Bolivian officials. Other countries have pledged stronger ties. 
 Mr. Morales, while welcoming trade with countries as far away as Belgium and South Africa, has been besieged by requests from countries with investments here to ensure that Bolivia maintains a healthy environment for foreign companies.
 Mr. Morales has tiptoed around them so far. But there is little doubt he will also give more authority to the state, remaking some ministries and creating others. ''The state needs to be the central actor to plan economic development,'' he explained.

HEADLINE: College Aid Plan Widens U.S. Role In High Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
When Republican senators quietly tucked a major new student aid program into the 774-page budget bill last month, they not only approved a five-year, $3.75 billion initiative. They also set up what could be an important shift in American education: for the first time the federal government will rate the academic rigor of the nation's 18,000 high schools.
 The measure, backed by the Bush administration and expected to pass the House when it returns next month, would provide $750 to $1,300 grants to low-income college freshmen and sophomores who have completed ''a rigorous secondary school program of study'' and larger amounts to juniors and seniors majoring in math, science and other critical fields.
 It leaves it to the secretary of education to define rigorous, giving her a new foothold in matters of high school curriculums. 
 Mindful of the delicate politics at play when Washington expands its educational role into matters zealously guarded as local prerogatives, senior Department of Education officials said they would consult with governors and other groups in determining which high school programs would allow students to qualify for grants.
 ''I do not see this, at all, as an expansion of the federal role,'' Sally L. Stroup, an assistant secretary of education, said in an interview. Washington, she said, would not impose a curriculum, just judge programs of study outlined by states. ''Our job is to make sure that those are valid standards and valid programs,'' she said. Furthermore, states and communities can decide on their own whether their students will compete for the grants. ''We don't force people to do anything,'' Ms. Stroup said.
 But Terry W. Hartle, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education, the nation's largest association of colleges and universities, said the new program ''involves the federal government in curricular matters in a way that opens a new chapter in educational history.'' 
 ''I'm very sympathetic to the goal of getting more students to take more math and science courses, but this particular plan has the potential to turn the Department of Education into a national school board,'' Mr. Hartle said.
 Ms. Stroup and other department officials said they had not yet figured out how, if the program is approved, they would go about identifying which students to qualify from which high schools. The department would have $790 million in new grant money to distribute to college-bound students by this fall, a tight timeline that Ms. Stroup said would force the department to postpone the rule-making process that usually accompanies new programs. Susan Aspey, a department spokeswoman, estimated that more than 500,000 students would receive grants.
 Several prominent educators said they expected the legislation to unleash a scramble by high schools to gain recognition of their curricula as rigorous.
 The Constitution outlines no role for the federal government in education, and local control of schools is a cornerstone of the American system. But Washington's role has grown since Congress began financing college studies for World War II veterans. Several laws increased federal aid to education, including the landmark National Defense Act of 1958, but specifically prohibited federal officials from assuming supervision or control over programs of instruction. And while President Bush's education law, No Child Left Behind, imposed mandatory testing, it allowed the states to choose their own tests. 
 Like the No Child Left Behind law, the new grants are largely an effort to take a Texas idea nationwide. The legislation is modeled on the Texas Scholars program, begun during Mr. Bush's governorship, which enlisted certain Texas high schools and encouraged their students to take a ''rigorous course of study,'' defined to include four years of English; three and a half years of social studies; two years of foreign language; and a year each of algebra, geometry, advanced algebra, biology, chemistry and physics.
 After Mr. Bush became president, his administration financed a Center for State Scholars, based in Austin, to spread a curriculum modeled on Texas Scholars nationwide. In the 2006 budget, he proposed supplemental Pell Grants for college freshmen and sophomores who had completed the ''rigorous'' curriculum outlined in the State Scholars initiative, in which some 300 school districts in 15 states are participating. A House bill closely reflected that administration proposal.
 But the legislation evolved. Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, responding to rising anxiety over America's economic competitiveness, sponsored legislation establishing new grants to college juniors and seniors majoring in math, science or engineering. In December, Republican lawmakers working with the administration grafted the House and Senate bills together, adding language requiring the secretary to recognize at least one rigorous high school program in each state. Democratic lawmakers said they were barely consulted. 
 ''We were shut almost completely out of the process,'' said Representative George Miller of California, the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
 The new one-year grants, designed to supplement the broader, $13 billion Pell Grant program, range from $750 for low-income college freshmen and $1,300 for sophomores to $4,000 for juniors and seniors who are pursuing majors in the physical, life or computer sciences, mathematics, technology, engineering or certain foreign languages. Applicants must have a 3.0 grade point average to be eligible as sophomores, juniors and seniors.
 The administration's original proposal would have been simple to administer. But under the proposal approved by the Senate, Department of Education officials would need to scrutinize high school courses of study and discuss curricular matters with local officials to a degree that Washington officials never have.
 ''We haven't actually sat down yet and decided how we're going to go about it,'' Ms. Stroup said.
 Pell Grants have been based on financial need, but eligibility for the new grants is more complicated, with requirements changing twice as students advance through college. The requirement that students maintain a B average, for instance, will force the department to decide how to handle applicants attending institutions like Hampshire College and Sarah Lawrence College, which do not give letter or numeric grades. With little time before crucial decisions must be made, some educators said they were expecting considerable confusion.
 ''This will be like trying to land a 747 on an airstrip built for a single-engine plane,'' said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. ''And we're all going to have to fly in by the seat of our pants.''
 The department's most politically ticklish determinations, however, appear to be those involving which high school programs are rigorous.
 Department officials said that in the 35 states that do not participate in the State Scholars initiative they hoped to find that governors or other authorities had established programs recognizing rigorous courses of study. The National Governors Association last year issued an ''Action Agenda'' that urged the authorities in every state to define a rigorous curriculum as a requisite for high school graduation, but their model included no recommendations for science or foreign languages. Dane Linn, director of the association's education division, said it was not clear whether states had moved to enact the agenda.
 Some have developed home-grown programs that the departmentcould easily recognize as rigorous. Indiana, for instance, has designated a challenging curriculum it calls the Core 40, and more than a dozen states, including New York, extend higher-rated diplomas to students who complete more difficult coursework. Virginia awards an ''advanced studies high school diploma'' to students who complete four years of English, math, science and history, three years of foreign language, and other requirements. 
 But perhaps 20 states do not participate in State Scholars, have not recognized any similarly rigorous curriculum and do not offer more than a basic diploma. In such states, Ms. Stroup said, the department may consider recognizing some combination of Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate courses as a rigorous program of study. 
 ''We're going to have to go out and just talk to schools,'' Ms. Stroup said.
 Even in states like New Jersey and Connecticut, where the State Scholars program is operating, however, it may be politically awkward for federal officials to declare programs of study at a few high schools to be rigorous while withholding that designation from others, educators said. In New Jersey, for instance, just 35 of 300 high schools participate in State Scholars. In Connecticut, 4 of 180 public high schools participate. 
 Another problem is that private school operators believe that the legislation renders their graduates ineligible by saying applicants must have completed a ''program of study established by a state or local educational agency and recognized by the secretary.'' The bill ''would inadvertently exclude over 5.3 million private K-12 school students,'' the National Association of Independent Schools, which represents some 1,200 private schools, said in a letter to senators last month. The same legislative language may also exclude parochial and home-schooled students.
 Conservative groups that have protested the No Child Left Behind law are also grumbling. Michael D. Ostrolenk, education policy director of the Eagle Forum, called the proposal ''more meddling'' by Washington.
 ''If people in Congress really want to improve the educational system in the United States, they should start by abolishing the federal Department of Education,'' Mr. Ostrolenk said.
 Several Colorado schools have turned down some federal funds because they dislike No Child Left Behind's extension of federal influence into schools, and some Colorado educators expressed similar reservations about the new grants.
 ''The president said he would like to extend N.C.L.B. into the high schools, and this is just the precursor for a new federal invasion,'' said Gerald Keefe, chairman of the Colorado Rural Schools Caucus. 
 Ms. Stroup shrugged off such criticism.
 ''We believe high school reform is important to the country; so do the governors,'' she said. ''So I don't think we're out in left field talking about trying to use incentives to get kids to take good programs.''

HEADLINE: 30 Seconds with Paul Pierce

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:

Paul Pierce, in his eighth season in the N.B.A., is a four-time All-Star forward. Rick Pitino, then president and coach of the Boston Celtics, drafted him out of Kansas with the 10th choice over all in 1998. Amid intense trade speculation last week, Pierce entertained some questions. LIZ ROBBINS

IF YOU WEREN'T A BASKETBALL PLAYER, WHAT WOULD YOU BE? A detective. I majored in criminal justice. I like ''CSI,'' all that, ''24.'' I watch those shows on A&E, if I watch TV. I don't really watch TV shows. 


DO YOU READ MYSTERIES? No. I read educational books, stuff on economics or if I want to learn a language.

LAST BOOK READ -- ''The 77 Laws of Power.'' [Actually, ''The 48 Laws of Power.'']

BEST MEMENTO FROM COLLEGE -- My painting. They gave me a painting when I made all-America. It's up on the wall in my basement. That's the first picture anybody painted of me. It's lifelike. They'll put it in the arena, and they'll make an extra one for you.

FIRST CAR -- White Nissan Sentra. My mom gave it to me my 11th-grade year in high school. It was just an A-to-B car: got me to school and back.

ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH ANY RED SOX OR PATRIOTS?
I know Willie McGinest. They're in Foxborough; they live out that way. When the Red Sox are in town, we're not really playing.

BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT BOSTON -- That it's a racist town. I don't see it. Maybe back in the day. I don't know. I play sports. A lot of people say that.

WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT WHEN BOSTON DRAFTED YOU? I was more worried about Pitino than anything else.

HEADLINE: Broad Survey of Day Laborers Finds High Level of Injuries and Pay Violations

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The first nationwide study on day laborers has found that such workers are a nationwide phenomenon, with 117,600 people gathering at more than 500 hiring sites to look for work on a typical day.
 The survey found that three-fourths of day laborers were illegal immigrants and that more than half said employers had cheated them on wages in the previous two months.
The study found that 49 percent of day laborers were employed by homeowners and 43 percent by construction contractors. They were found to be employed most frequently as construction laborers, landscapers, painters, roofers and drywall installers.
 The study, based on interviews with 2,660 workers at 264 hiring sites in 20 states and the District of Columbia, found that day laborers earned a median of $10 an hour and $700 month. The study said that only a small number earned more than $15,000 a year. 
 The professors who conducted the study said the most surprising finding was the pervasiveness of wage violations and dangerous conditions that day laborers faced.
 ''We were disturbed by the incredibly high incidence of wage violations,'' said one of the study's authors, Nik Theodore of the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''We also found a very high level of injuries.''
 Forty-nine percent of those interviewed said that in the previous two months an employer had not paid them for one or more days' work. Forty-four percent said some employers did not give them any breaks during the workday, while 28 percent said employers had insulted them.
 Another of the study's authors, Abel Valenzuela Jr. of the University of California, Los Angeles, said: ''This is a labor market that thrives on cheap wages and the fact that most of these workers are undocumented. They're in a situation where they're extremely vulnerable, and employers know that and take advantage of them.''
 In some communities, tensions have soared over day labor sites, with complaints that the workers interrupt traffic, block sidewalks, trespass on store property and litter. In addition, the laborers have become the target of groups opposed to illegal immigrants. 
 Nine percent of day laborers reported having been arrested while waiting for work, while 11 percent reported receiving police citations and 37 percent reported being chased away. Nineteen percent said merchants had insulted them, and 15 percent said merchants had not let them use their bathrooms or make purchases.
 The survey found that 59 percent of day laborers were from Mexico and 28 percent from Central America, while 7 percent were born in the United States. Sixty percent of the immigrant workers said that day labor was their first occupation in the United States.
 While waiting for work Friday morning near a Home Depot in the Pico Union section of Los Angeles, Cesar Ramirez, a 46-year-old immigrant from Mexico, said he had been hired only one day in the previous week. 
 He said he makes $15 an hour when he works on plumbing or electrical jobs, but $8 or $10 an hour when hired to do landscaping. Many weeks, he said, he does not earn enough to support his six children.
 ''I come here every morning and sometimes I leave at 3 p.m. without work,'' said Mr. Ramirez, who said he had worked as a day laborer since arriving from Oaxaca, Mexico, four years ago. ''I keep doing it because I can't find a permanent job. I'd like to find something better.''
 He said a contractor had recently failed to pay more than $500 due him after he had spent five days doing electrical and plumbing work. Mr. Ramirez asked a workers' rights group to help him get paid, but he was unsuccessful because he did not have the contractor's name, telephone number or address. 
 ''Sometimes they take advantage,'' Mr. Ramirez said.
 Nearly three-fourths of the day laborers surveyed said they gathered at day labor sites five or more days a week, with the average laborer finding work three to three-and-a-half days a week. In good months, day laborers earn $1,400, the report found, and in bad months, especially winter months, $500.
 The study said that the number of day laborers had soared because of the surge of immigrants, the boom in homebuilding and renovation, the construction industry's growing use of temporary workers, and the volatility of the job market.
 ''For many workers in cities with declining employment prospects, day labor provides a chance to regain a foothold in the urban economy,'' the study said. ''For others, it is a first job in the United States and an opportunity to acquire work experience, skills and employer contacts. For still others, it represents an opportunity to earn an income when temporarily laid off from a job elsewhere in the economy.''
 The study found that 44 percent of those surveyed had been day laborers for less than a year, while 30 percent had done that work for one to three years, suggesting that many moved to jobs in other sectors of the economy. Twenty-six percent said they were day laborers for more than three years.
 The report said that 36 percent were married, while 7 percent were with living with a parent. Two-thirds said they had children.
 The study found that 73 percent said they were placed in hazardous working conditions, like digging ditches, working with chemicals, or on roofs or scaffolding. The report said that employers often put day laborers into dangerous jobs that regular workers were reluctant to do -- often with minimal training and safety equipment. 
 One-fifth said that in the past year they had suffered injuries requiring medical attention, and 60 percent of that group said their injuries caused them to miss more than a week of work. 
 ''Day laborers continue to endure unsafe working conditions, mainly because they fear that if they speak up, complain, or otherwise challenge these conditions, they will either be fired or not paid for their work,'' the report said.
 Among day laborers injured on the job during the previous year, 54 percent said they had not received the medical care they needed, mostly because they could not afford health care or the employer refused to cover them under the company's workers' compensation insurance. 
 The biggest hope for day laborers, the study said, are the 63 day labor centers that operate as hiring halls where workers and employers arrange to meet. These centers, usually created in partnerships with local government or community organizations, often require workers and employers to register, helping to reduce abuses. The centers provide shelter, bathrooms and water -- sometimes even English lessons -- while workers wait. Many set a minimum wage, often $10 an hour, that employers must pay the laborers.
 ''The first thing to do to improve things for day laborers is to have more of these centers,'' said Pablo Alvarado, national coordinator of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, an advocacy group for such workers. ''The second thing is to have the government enforce the labor laws more consistently.''

HEADLINE: Detroit Polishes, and Demolishes, for the Super Bowl

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick is so determined to show Super Bowl visitors a new face for his beleaguered city that he is willing to sacrifice its Motown roots.
 This week, wrecking crews began taking down the long-abandoned office building that was home to Motown Records from 1968 to 1972.
The destruction upset Francis Grunow, executive director of Preservation Wayne, a group that has tried for decades to save some of the city's more significant buildings.
 ''It seems very sad that all it's worth is 50 parking spots for the Super Bowl,'' Mr. Grunow said. 
 The mayor said he could no longer tolerate the marred facade, broken windows and empty corridors of the building. ''I just couldn't take it anymore,'' he said in an interview.
 The demolition, which Mr. Kilpatrick said had the blessing of the Motown founder, Berry Gordy, is part of a much bigger plan by city officials to show Detroit in a different light to the estimated 100,000 visitors who will arrive before the kickoff on Feb. 5 at Ford Field. 
 ''It's an opportunity to present people with the next Detroit,'' Mayor Kilpatrick said.
 Although the city has torn down a few buildings, many dilapidated ones remain readily visible. Long-empty structures like the old United Artists Hotel are draped with signs like ''Premium Development Opportunity.'' 
 Storefronts on Woodward Avenue that had been boarded up for years have new glass, if no commerce. For residents and boosters, the big question is whether those buildings will be occupied in a year or whether their glass will be broken again.
 To embellish the image of a revival, the host committee of the Super Bowl, led by Roger Penske, the entrepreneur and auto racing team owner, is spending $10 million on parties, concerts, sports clinics, and indoor and outdoor festivals.
 ''This is going to be a blockbuster event,'' Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan said. ''They have every detail covered.'' 
 Ms. Granholm, who plans to attend some of the 120 events that the National Football League has sanctioned, said she hoped that the Super Bowl would help divert attention from the bad economic news ricocheting across the city and the state.
 In all, the Super Bowl could contribute up to $300 million to the local economy, including spending on hotel rooms, meals, transportation and other attractions, the mayor said. 
 Detroit badly needs the infusion. Its economy has been pummeled by the billion-dollar losses at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, whose chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., also owns the Detroit Lions. On Monday, Ford Motor is widely expected to announce plans to cut up to 30,000 jobs and to close factories, similar to steps that G.M. took in November.
 That month, Detroit had the highest unemployment rate, 6.8 percent, of any urban area in the nation except New Orleans, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 About $100 million in public and private money has been spent on sprucing up the central business district and development projects to create apartment lofts in old buildings near the stadium. Nobody has estimated the cost of police protection on game day. 
 The city faces a budget deficit of up to $30 million, forcing Mayor Kilpatrick to close 9 of 30 recreation centers this month and lay off the mounted police division. 
 Despite the cuts, every officer in the department will be on duty for Super Bowl Sunday, downtown or in their precincts, the mayor said. 
 The host committee is tutoring thousands of volunteers to ''say nice things about Detroit'' when encountering visitors.
 Another effort is trying to help the homeless leave the streets for shelters on Super Bowl Weekend. One shelter, the Detroit Rescue Mission, plans a three-day Super Bowl party with food and four big-screen television sets. Experts estimate that 3,000 or more homeless people are on the streets at any one time, with up to a total of 13,000 homeless people. 
 Charities that plan to be hosts for some sanctioned events hope to collect $8 million leading up to the game. One is the Children's Center, whose board and officers include four members of the Ford family.
 The impact of the city's downturn has been felt acutely by charity organizations like Focus:Hope, which was founded after the 1967 riots to provide food, job training and other aid to the poor. Last year, Focus:Hope suspended its parts manufacturing program, in which trainees made automobile parts. Because it is not on the list of officially sanctioned charities, Focus: Hope will not raise money directly because of the Super Bowl, said its chief executive, Eleanor M. Josaitis.
 Nonetheless, Ms. Josaitis supports the Super Bowl efforts by Mayor Kilpatrick, who came from behind in November to win re-election after a scandal-plagued first term.
 ''It is changing the landscape,'' Ms. Josaitis said. ''It is changing the attitude of people within the city. There is a sense of pride. You can feel it.'' 
 A sign posted above the empty Madison Theater on Grand Circus Park in the entertainment district advertises loft apartments. And some new businesses have opened downtown, including a CVS drugstore, a Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlor and a Borders bookstore.
 Mr. Kilpatrick says the city has gained 33 restaurants like sushi bars and coffeehouses in the last three years. As a result, many Detroiters, accustomed to driving through empty avenues with stretches of crumbling structures, are raving about how good the city looks. The Super Bowl ''is doing more to change the physical appearance of this community than corporate relocations, three casinos, two stadiums and the last three mayors have,'' Daniel Howes, a columnist in The Detroit News, wrote last week. 
 Regardless, Detroit will continue to look rundown to visitors accustomed to much more activity in an urban center. For one thing, there are no brand-name luxury hotels, meaning high rollers will stay at the Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn, 15 miles away, or at the Townsend, a boutique hotel in Birmingham, 30 miles from the city center.
 Vacant houses line the embankments above major freeways, while empty factories, a reminder of the glory days, sit in every part of the city, as if mocking the determination to make downtown sparkle.
 The mayor said that did not bother him. ''Detroit is a gritty town with rough edges, and we love it, and we celebrate it,'' he said. ''People have been trying to make us into something else for so long. It's better than Chicago or Philadelphia. People are going to be pleasantly surprised.''
 The challenge will be trying to turn the rush of activity into permanent improvements after the fans and football players leave. 
 Despite her support of making downtown look its best, Ms. Josaitis said, other neighborhoods need help, too.
 ''How can we get these areas cleaned up -- not just for the Super Bowl?'' she asked.
 Mr. Grunow, the preservationist, added: ''There is a long, long history of cities pushing themselves for a single day like the Super Bowl or a single week'' like the Republican national convention, which was held here in 1980. 
 The proof, he said, will be whether interest in improving the city continues afterward, or whether the city's problems will push the promises off center stage.
 ''We can always be hopeful,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection

BYLINE: BY JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
At the halfway mark between the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina last year and the beginning of the 2006 hurricane season on June 1, the Army Corps of Engineers has completed only 16 percent of its planned repairs to New Orleans's battered flood protection system, according to corps representatives.
 The corps says its work is on track for restoring the system to its pre-hurricane strength by the June 1 deadline, but in the meantime many groups that have studied the disaster are coming up with proposals of their own that they say could be cheaper, faster or stronger. 
 The Bring New Orleans Back Commission, the group formed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin to produce a blueprint for the city's recovery, issued a proposal on Wednesday to upgrade hurricane protection with measures beyond what the corps has called for. To prevent storm surges from pushing into the city's drainage canals, the commission proposed a series of jetties to stand in front of the three canals, which it says could be built quickly and cheaply and provide New Orleans with some much-needed peace of mind. 
 ''There is, very much, a tension between things that can be done quickly versus those that might take a little longer,'' Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in a telephone interview on Friday. His group has weighed in with far-reaching recommendations, and other groups are preparing proposals of their own.
 The mayor's commission also proposed a network of dams that would block or slow the opening between the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and Lake Pontchartrain, and block storm surges from flowing up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel that has been blamed for a storm surge funnel effect that increased the damage to eastern New Orleans. 
 The group is also calling for long-term flood-control structures that would block or slow surges at the two passes between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 The fast-track structures would cost $100 million to $170 million, according to the commission's estimates, a fraction of the $3.1 billion the federal government has proposed spending on flood control measures in the area. The commission said its proposals would not interfere with any of the corps's plans, but would be add-ons that complement the current plans.
 The proposals have not yet found broad support among other engineering experts who have been working on strengthening New Orleans's storm defenses, but Dan Hitchings, the director of the corps's Task Force Hope, which is coordinating the hurricane response in Louisiana and Mississippi, said the plans were welcome and would be examined.
 Mr. Roth, of the Society of Civil Engineers, said there would always be competing ideas about how to improve flood protection. The idea of jetties, he said, might be made moot by closing off the canals and putting in new pumping stations at the lake, as the corps has planned. 
 ''Many different people can look at a problem and come up with many different solutions, all with tradeoffs,'' he said. ''Which would be better -- jetties or a pump station? You might never get an answer to that.'' 
 Meanwhile, the corps's work to restore flood protection to its pre-hurricane levels continues around the clock. This month the corps solicited bids for building temporary closures and pumps at the mouths of the city's three drainage canals, and it is rebuilding long stretches of levee in St. Bernard Parish and along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal.
 The corps is looking to measures that will further strengthen the flood protection system, including restoring levees to their originally designed heights. These measures can be in place by September 2007, according to the corps.
 Beyond that, the corps has embarked on a two-year, $8 million study to determine how to strengthen the hurricane protection system for New Orleans and southern Louisiana. A preliminary version of that report is due in June.
 While the Bush administration's top official on Gulf Coast reconstruction, Donald Powell, has said the government will build a system that is ''better and stronger'' than what was there before, the administration has not committed to what the people of New Orleans desperately want: protection from Category 5 storms, the toughest that nature can dish out.
 Mr. Hitchings said that the corps was slightly behind schedule but that he expected things to move quickly. ''It's not linear,'' he said, because the ''gear-up time'' to get contractors in place and to make materials like the enormous quantities of soil available was so great. 
 Now ''they're really moving out,'' he said. The corps built 30 days of weather delays into the schedule, he said, and with a little help from favorable weather, ''I'm very optimistic that they will regain their schedule and in the end get it all finished with plenty of time.'' 
 The corps's long-term study, he said, would probably have a lot in common with the outside proposals that are beginning to flow in, but ''right now, we're focused on the very near term.''
 The engineering society is investigating the failure of the levees and is working with the groups that will monitor the corps's progress. Its recommendations include ''armoring'' the dry side of levees so they are not eroded away from underneath if water spills over the top. Without armoring, Mr. Roth said, ''failure is catastrophic because it causes the wall to fail.''
 The corps has said that the armoring process, like other projects that would go beyond the restoration of the levees to pre-hurricane strength, will have to be approved by Congress.
 ''It's going to take people being willing to take a chance, to be bold, to sort out Louisiana's levee problems,'' said Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and a member of Team Louisiana, the group formed by the state to investigate the causes of the levee failures. His group, too, will be making proposals for upgrading protection for the region.
 ''We may get lucky,'' he said. ''Nature may give us another 10 years before we get another Katrina, or maybe not. But we've got to seize the moment or we're going to lose coastal Louisiana.''

HEADLINE: PAKISTAN'S PUSH IN BORDER AREAS IS SAID TO FALTER

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL and MOHAMMAD KHAN; Ruhallah Khapalwak contributed reporting from Asadabad, Afghanistan, for this article.

DATELINE: PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Two years after the Pakistani Army began operations in border tribal areas to root out members of Al Qaeda and other foreign militants, Pakistani officials who know the area say the military campaign is bogged down, the local political administration is powerless and the militants are stronger than ever. 
 Both Osama bin Laden, who released a new audiotape of threats against the United States this week, and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed to be living somewhere in the seven districts that make up these tribal areas, which run for more than 500 miles along the rugged Afghan border and have been hit by several American missile strikes in recent weeks.
The officials said they had been joined by possibly hundreds of foreign militants from Arab countries, Central Asia and the Caucasus, who present a continuing threat to the authorities within the region. 
 The tribal areas are off limits to foreign journalists, but the Pakistani officials, and former residents who did not want to be identified for fear of retribution, said the militants -- who call themselves Taliban -- now dispensed their own justice, ran their own jails, robbed banks, shelled military and civilian government compounds and attacked convoys at will. They are recruiting men from the local tribes and have gained a hold over the population through a mix of fear and religion, the officials and former residents said. 
 An American military official in Afghanistan, in an e-mail response to questions about Pakistan's tribal areas, said: ''I believe this region is going through a period of revolutionary change, in which moderates and extremists fight for the future of their nations. And with vast, lawless areas in which Taliban-style justice holds sway, Pakistan faces serious challenges.'' The official agreed to comment only on the condition of anonymity.
 Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, chief spokesman for the Pakistani military, said the accounts of the size of the militants' forces were exaggerated. He put the number of foreign militants in the whole of the tribal areas at ''100, plus or minus.''
 But the officials and residents say the militants are far more numerous, and have embarked on a disruptive campaign of terrorism, particularly in North and South Waziristan: in the last year, 108 pro-government tribal elders, 4 or 5 government officials, informers and even 2 local journalists, have been assassinated by militants, local journalists say. 
 Qaeda operatives are the driving force behind the local militants and are influencing their tactics, the officials said. The militants have managed this despite a hammer-and-anvil strategy in the region, with American military forces pressing from the Afghan side of the border. There have been three American strikes in the area in the past six weeks, involving missiles fired from remotely piloted Predator aircraft operated by the Central Intelligence Agency, but whether they were an expression of American frustration or the outcome of a burst of intelligence remains unclear. 
 Despite government denials, the officials said, the strikes may have had the tacit approval of Pakistan's leadership, which has issued mostly pro forma condemnations. The officials asked not to be identified because their supervisors do not allow them to talk to the media.
 The most recent strike, in Bajaur on Jan. 13, killed as many as 18 civilians, but might also have killed several high-level Qaeda members. 
 [On Saturday, President Pervez Musharraf told Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns that the Jan. 13 strike ''must not be repeated,'' The Associated Press reported.]
 Bajaur, Afghan and Pakistani security officials said, is not as out of control as North and South Waziristan, but it has become a staging post for fighters entering and leaving the eastern Afghan province of Kunar, where American forces have encountered some of the most serious resistance over the past year. 
 Al Qaeda's propaganda unit has produced video CD's showing Afghan fighters being trained by an Arab commander and mounting ambushes on American soldiers and convoys in Kunar. Afghans know of two Arab commanders who fought against Soviet forces and have stayed on in Bajaur, said the governor of Kunar, Asadullah Wafa.
 The Afghan border police say they learned of a meeting in a mosque in Bajaur six months ago between members of the Afghan Taliban, a group led by the renegade mujahedeen commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar from Afghanistan and the Arabs, during which they are said to have divided up responsibility for insurgent operations in Afghanistan. 
 Pakistan's military has become more cautious about emerging from its bases in North and South Waziristan, and the civilian administration is so hamstrung that the senior government representative in South Waziristan does not even live there. 
 ''We run a government on paper, but not on the ground,'' said one government official who has worked in North and South Waziristan, which have seen some of the heaviest combat of the past two years. 
 Now, the heaviest fighting has shifted to North Waziristan, where there are reports of casualties among the military or the civilian population almost daily. At least three small mountain lookout posts built by the army with American funds have been knocked out, one official who was there recently said. 
 ''The situation is going from bad to worse,'' the official said. ''No one can raise their voice against the Taliban.'' Armed local militants come and go freely and have even opened offices in the main bazaar of Wana, in South Waziristan, driving up in pickups filled with armed fighters. They use the offices to recruit followers from the large, illiterate and unemployed youth of the area, a former resident said, asking not to be identified for fear of retribution from the militants.
 Military operations, which have killed at least 40 civilians and wounded 600, said one official, have also driven youths to join the militants.
 General Sultan, the military spokesman, cautioned against taking such reports too seriously. ''Calling them Taliban is sensationalizing the situation,'' in an interview in his headquarters Rawalpindi. ''There is a mix of foreigners, Al Qaeda and Taliban and local supporters.'' By Taliban, he meant fighters from Afghanistan. 
 He said foreign militants had been eliminated in South Waziristan and existed in North Waziristan now only in small groups, adding that there were also few local militants allied to Al Qaeda and other foreigners. 
 He did not have figures for military casualties in 2005 but said there were fewer than in 2004, when 250 Pakistani soldiers died. ''It's not anything like that now,'' he said. 
 Home to six million people and covering 10,000 square miles, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas for years provided a sanctuary for Afghan and other foreign fighters opposed to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But for the past four years, after members of the Taliban, Al Qaeda and foreign allies were driven out of Afghanistan, they have lived in the area and gradually taken greater control. 
 Government officials who have spent time in the tribal areas say there may be as many as 1,000 foreign militants there, but because many have intermarried and raised families, their status as foreigners is somewhat blurred.
 Today the region is believed to be home to a kind of rogue's gallery. Besides Al Qaeda's leaders, Tohir Yuldashev, the Uzbek leader of the Independence Movement of Uzbekistan, which was allied with the Taliban, is thought to be in North Waziristan. 
 Jalaluddin Haqqani and Mr. Hekmatyar, who are both wanted by American forces in Afghanistan, and gained their fame as Afghan commanders from the days of resistance to the Soviet occupation, are widely believed to move between the tribal areas and Afghanistan. 
 (The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, and his close deputies, are thought to be farther south in the province of Baluchistan.)
 The local militants are mostly also men who gained fought in Afghanistan, either against the Soviet Army or alongside the Taliban in its civil war against the Northern Alliance. But it is the foreign fighters who have most radicalized the local population, all agree. ''The driving forces are the foreigners,'' General Sultan said.
 The American military official in Afghanistan said the solution to the problem was to strengthen the Afghan Border Police, and ''almost certainly it will involve Pakistan continuing to conduct operations in the border region and coming to grips with the Taliban influence inside Pakistan.'' 
 ''Pakistan appears to struggle with whether to crack down on Al Qaeda and the Taliban, not just with how to crack down on them,'' he wrote. ''This war will take time and unfortunately we expect future attacks on coalition and Afghan forces.'' 
 The inhabitants of the tribal areas are deeply religious, yet the local militants have introduced a new extremist language, like that of Al Qaeda, said one official who has spent time in the tribal areas. 
 The militants' main obsession is to fight Americans in Afghanistan, but they also attack the Pakistani Army and government officials, who are seen as subservient allies.
 ''They are religious, mujahedeen, and they think the military are serving the cause of Bush,'' the official said. The struggle is cast in the most messianic of terms, as a battle between God and Satan, he said. 
 Anyone who is seen to have links to the West or the government, including journalists who work for international news agencies, are also targets. Two local journalists have been killed and one kidnapped in recent months. Another left the area with his family last month after a bomb destroyed part of his house.
 The military, rather than pacifying the region, has aggravated the situation by sidelining the civilian administration and the traditional tribal councils, which have also been drastically undermined by the numerous assassinations of tribal elders, the officials said. 
 The army's tactic of negotiating with militants in South Waziristan has only emboldened them, the Pakistani officials said. Self-styled Taliban militants have emerged in spectacular fashion in North Waziristan. 
 On Dec. 7 in Miram Shah, the administrative center, a band of militants waged a battle with a local criminal gang, killing 11 of them and burning down 25 houses. 
 The military and the Frontier Corps, which is a militia drawn from the local tribes, stayed out of the battle, and later the Taliban killed 26 or 27 gang members. 
 The clash made the militants enormously popular among local residents, who had suffered extortion at the hands of the gang, the official said. The campaign was reminiscent of those under the Afghan Taliban, who were born out of a movement to cleanse southern Afghanistan of rapists and other criminals in 1994. 
 Now, the official said, no one can contest the Taliban's authority in Miram Shah. General Sultan dismissed that, saying both groups in the clash had been put out of action.

HEADLINE: CORZINE ADDRESSES FISCAL ILLS 

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEZIN JONES

 BODY:
A day after taking office, Gov. Jon S. Corzine left open the possibility last Wednesday that New Jersey's looming fiscal problems could force him to freeze aid to the state's municipalities. During a meeting with members of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, the first public event on his first full day as governor, Mr. Corzine said his administration was still weighing a range of options to address a budget deficit that he has predicted might be as high as $6 billion. While the governor reiterated his desire to lower property taxes, improve the child welfare system and possibly provide more money for antiterrorism efforts, he would not be drawn into a discussion of how the deficit might affect municipal aid.

HEADLINE: Pockets of Concern Slow a Strong U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
IF you believe most statistics, the national economy is doing quite well. Corporate profits are soaring. Consumer spending and business investment have been growing at a healthy clip. In the third quarter of last year, output expanded at an annual pace of about 4.1 percent. And private-sector economists are expecting growth above 3.5 percent this year. 
 Yet, amid the vim and vigor, there is a weak spot that does not quite mesh with these readings. More than four years since the economy emerged from recession in November of 2001, businesses are still not hiring much. Employment grew by a mere 3.5 million jobs, or 2.7 percent, in 49 months' worth of this economic expansion. Last year, the job market grew by 1.5 percent.
This is not negligible. The unemployment rate, the most frequently used measure of labor-force vitality, dipped to 4.9 percent in December. This is the lowest it has been in more than 30 years except for the prosperous late 1990's, when it fell briefly below 4 percent. 
 But compared with similar moments in the nation's economic history, this shot of job growth appears less brisk than at first blush. In the 49 months after the recession of the early 1990's, employment jumped almost 8 percent. It surged by more than 13 percent in the same period after the recession of the early 80's.
 What growth there is comes from a decline in the pace of layoffs, not from employers picking up hiring.
 In the first quarter of last year -- the last period for which there is published data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- employers hired 7.6 million people, still almost a million less than the average pace of hiring in the second half of the 90's. 
 And even as the declining unemployment rate seems to indicate plenty of opportunity in the labor market, workers' wages are still treading water, especially along the bottom rungs of the income scale, suggesting there remains substantial slack in the labor market. 
 In fact, wage growth has slowed. According to Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute, growth in the median wage dropped to 2.4 percent in 2004 and 2005, from about 3 percent, on average, in 2002 and 2003, the first two years after the end of the recession.
 In real terms, taking inflation into account, wages have declined in the last two years across all pay scales except for the very top earners, according to Mr. Bernstein's crunching of census data. Last year, the wages of ordinary workers in production jobs and other nonmanagement positions declined by 0.4 percent, after accounting for inflation.''By some measures, the economic expansion has been impressive,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''That employers are still so cautious about hiring is extraordinary.''
 PART of the sluggishness of workers' wages is a result of the rising burden of health care benefits. 
 In a study last year, Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra, economists at Dartmouth College, found that rising premiums of employer-supplied health insurance were not only eating into workers' compensation, but they also discouraged employers from increasing their payroll. 
 This is hardly the whole story. Productivity is growing at breakneck speed, much faster than what usually happens this late in an economic expansion. 
 Even if you include the growing share of benefits, compensation of workers in the private sector rose by merely 3 percent in the third quarter of last year compared with a year earlier, says the latest reading of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employee compensation index. 
 That's the smallest increase in nearly seven years.
 As a share of national income, workers' wages and salaries are 2 percentage points below where they were in 2000. Meanwhile, corporate profits have escalated to levels not seen in more than half a century. In the third quarter of last year, profits after tax rose to 9.6 percent of national income, the highest corporate share since 1950.
 Some economists suspect that the lingering effect of technology breakthroughs spurring productivity growth may still be weighing on employers' appetite for hiring. Others speculate that competition from cheap labor markets like China is impelling American companies to become more productive by wringing more out of their existing work forces, and weakening workers' general bargaining position.
 Despite the apparent conundrum, however, the explanations for the labor market's current weakness may be more straightforward. Two dynamics emerge as likely drivers: one is the impact of a relatively strong dollar on trade -- stimulating imports and hindering exports. The other is the investment bust after the dot-com boom. 
 Trade has long been a tempting explanation for America's labor market woes. Since September 2001, exports have increased 40 percent, but imports have grown 60 percent. The overall trade deficit, now running above $60 billion a month, represents a substantial portion of American demand going to foreign suppliers. 
 Yet Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, argues that the main contributor to the story is the shock to business spending as the Internet economy shriveled. 
 The dot-com boom encouraged a feast of business investment in all sorts of technological applications. It also spurred exuberant hiring. When it popped, debt-saddled companies emerged from the recession with a decided focus on paying down debt and shoring up their balance sheets. Hiring was far from their minds.
 ''At the Council of Economic Advisers in the late 1990's, we knew there was going to be a period of adjustment,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''In a sense, we had an excessively strong labor market; there had to be this wringing-out period.''
 Actually, this reading of the economic tea leaves allows for a bit of optimism. 
 Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a business research group in Arlington, Va., argues that the sluggishness of the labor market looks less like an aberration if you believe that the recession ended in the middle of 2003 instead of November 2001, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group that measures when recessions begin and end. 
 Manufacturing's doldrums extended at least until then -- with industrial production in the manufacturing sector falling by roughly 5 percent between the middle of 2000 and the middle of 2003, as corporate investment plunged and exports sagged. 
 In those three years, manufacturing lost 2.4 million jobs, accounting for 80 percent of the decline in employment across the economy.
 MANUFACTURING is not out of the woods. It lost 50,000 jobs last year. But since the middle of the 2003, overall job growth looks more like the first months after the end of the recession of the early 1990's. Companies also started to spend more on capital goods since then.
 Exports have grown by more than 10 percent in the last two years, up from 4 percent in 2003. The cycle seems to be turning more favorable for labor. ''If you consider an eight-month recession from March to November of 2001, then the comparison with past cycles is weak,'' Mr. Meckstroth said. ''But if you believe the recession was much longer than that, then you get something that doesn't look nearly as bad.''

HEADLINE: Hating The Bomb

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The Iraq debate split the country into two partisan camps, but the Iran debate is much more complicated. It's opening up a rift between conservatives and the Bush administration. It's dividing Democrats into rival factions: those who can contemplate the eventual use of force against Iran and those who can't.
 It's an anguished debate because all the options are terrible. But this will be the major foreign policy controversy of the 2008 presidential election, and you can already see four different schools emerging:

THE PRE-EMPTIONISTS -- John McCain and most American conservatives believe the situation reeks of Nazi Germany in 1933. An anti-Semitic demagogue is breaking treaties and threatening to wipe Israel off the map. The madman means what he says and can't be restrained by normal economic or diplomatic incentives. 
 Therefore, Iran cannot be allowed to get the bomb. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may not immediately lob the big one onto Tel Aviv, but a psychotic, hegemonic Iran would unleash its terrorist vassals and strangle democratic efforts in the Middle East, and could set off a cataclysmic war.
 Pre-emptors would work with Europe and the U.N. to step up pressure on Iran, while making it clear the world is willing to do what it takes to halt the nuclear program. As McCain said on ''Face the Nation'': ''There is only one thing worse than the United States exercising a military option. That is a nuclear-armed Iran.''

THE SANCTIONISTS -- Democratic presidential contenders like Hillary Clinton and Evan Bayh have begun hitting the Bush administration from the right. But as Ivo Daalder of the Brookings Institution notes, this is not just campaign posturing. Centrist Democrats also believe Iranian nukes are unacceptable. Such nukes would set off a regional arms race. They would lead to Cuban missile crisis standoffs in the world's most unstable region. If Iran completes its program, that would completely delegitimize the international system.
 The Sanctionists don't rule out a pre-emptive strike, but they don't emphasize it. Instead, they say the U.S. should be directly involved in negotiating with Iran, and the world should quickly impose serious economic sanctions, what Chuck Schumer calls an ''economic stranglehold.'' 

THE REFORMISTS -- Oddly, the Bush administration finds itself on the cautious, noninterventionist side. Bush officials have been walking away from broad economic sanctions and pre-emptive strikes (while not formally ruling them out). Blustery threats may sound good, they say, but when you are governing, you have to consider the consequences; you have to hold the global coalition together; you have to make sure Iran isn't provoked into really dismantling Iraq.
 In all my conversations with senior administration officials, I have never heard them be so cautious about what they can know and tentative about what they can achieve.
 Their chief leverage, they say, is that Iran is not North Korea. The Iranians do not want to be global pariahs. There is an Iranian elite that likes travel and conducts international business, and it is beginning to react against Ahmadinejad's radical talk.
 The administration believes blunt sanctions will drive the populace into the arms of the regime, but surgical sanctions will motivate internal reformers to change the regime's course. Privately, some administration officials believe there is no way to prevent Iran from getting the bomb; we might as well try to make the regime as palatable as possible. 

THE SILENT FATALISTS -- Mainstream Democrats have been remarkably quiet on this issue. Their main conviction is that American-led military action would be disastrous. This shapes their definition of the problem. A nuclear Iran may not be so cataclysmic, they privately say. Why shouldn't Iran have as much right to the bomb as any other nation? The regime may be nasty, but it's containable with deterrence and engagement.
 These liberals argue that if we weren't in Iraq, we'd have a lot more freedom to act against Iran, though you could also say the crisis would be worse if Saddam were still in power.
 These four approaches have one thing in common: they all stink. For example, despite administration hopes, there is scant reason to believe that imagined Iranian cosmopolitans would shut down the nuclear program, or could if they wanted to, or could do it in time -- before Israel forced the issue to a crisis point.
 This is going to be a lengthy and tortured debate, dividing both parties. We'll probably be engaged in it up to the moment the Iranian bombs are built and fully functioning.

HEADLINE: Iraq Is in a Race Against Time As Congress Grows Restless 

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Roger Cohen writes the Globalist column for The International Herald Tribune.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq 

 BODY:
WHEN Iraq's leaders gather this week to begin the elaborate horse-trading required to fashion a coalition government, one non-Iraqi will be very much at the table: Zalmay Khalilzad, the unabashedly hands-on American ambassador.
 The advice of Zal, as he's known here, will not be subtle. The United States did not expend its blood and treasure to go coy at this critical time. ''A Kurdish-Shia government will not solve the problem,'' he said. ''Iraq needs a government of national unity.'' 
In other words, it needs one including the Sunnis, whom Mr. Khalilzad has assiduously courted since his arrival last year. The Sunnis' main grouping took 44 seats in the 275-member assembly, a score suggesting nascent interest in democracy but paling beside the 181 seats taken by Shiite and Kurdish parties, three short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government. 
 To the Sunnis, the Kurds are secessionists-in-waiting, the Shiites little more than agents of Iran. To the Kurds, the Sunnis are Baathist irredentists deluded into believing their manifest destiny is to rule.
 As for the now dominant Shiites, who took 128 seats, their intermittent shorthand for the Sunnis is ''the terrorists.''
 A government uniting such bedfellows would, in many ways, be an exercise in political perversion. But Iraq, which is born a little and dies a little every day, defies all rules. Almost three years after Saddam Hussein's fall, and after the largest injection of rebuilding funds since the Marshall Plan, it finds itself at a second zero hour: its four-year government about to be formed, its constitutional framework in place, its army being born and, not least, its American benefactor losing patience by the minute.
 A race against the clock has begun. Iraq must convince Congress that it's moving in the right direction, otherwise mounting pressure to cut troops and money will grow. With America's presence standing between Iraq and all-out civil war, those developments could be devastating. This is why a unity government has assumed such importance: it would be a tangible sign of headway in the morass.
 ''This is a tough lift, made more difficult by a lot of mistakes, but it's not impossible,'' said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts during a visit last week to Iraq. ''If there's a government of national unity, with a real program of reform and ministerial development, things have a chance of coming together, but without that all bets are off.'' 
 With the $21 billion already pledged by the United States almost exhausted, and the needs still great, the uncertainty may focus Iraqi minds. Dawn Liberi, the director of the United States Agency for International Development in Iraq, reckons that the money will run out in August if new funds are not approved. ''I'm very concerned,'' she said.
 But Iraqi time is not American time. The former may be measured in the months needed to agree on a new government. The latter is that of what one concerned American in Iraq, Col. Jeffrey Snow, called ''an instant gratification society that wants results now and doesn't see that the Iraqi timetable is generational.''
 For now, Iraqi politicians are talking a line that will please Mr. Khalilzad. In an interview, President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, said: ''The Shia and Kurds could rule the country together, but it would not be right because there would be no peace and security. National unity now will serve the country. Then perhaps in 12 or 15 or 20 years, out democracy will be strong enough to have one group dominate.''
 Adel Abdul Mahdi, a strong candidate to be prime minister and a member of the most influential Shiite party, sounded equally accommodating. ''We have to do it with the Sunnis,'' he said. 
 Such declarations, however, cannot mask deep distrust of the Sunnis and differences over a host of Sunni demands -- including the revision of the just-drafted constitution to ensure a more centralized state and a timetable for withdrawal of American troops. With the drift toward sectarian violence, the fight for control of the two most powerful ministries -- defense and interior -- will be venomous. 
 Sunnis believe current Shiite control of the Interior Ministry has allowed Shiite militias to run riot. Shiites counter that the previous Sunni control of the ministry allowed Baathist abuse. Another problem is that the Sunni political involvement appears guarded: Is it simply war by additional means, an exploratory gambit while assistance to the insurgency persists? As Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army demonstrated in Northern Ireland, such arrangements are not easy to disentangle.
 Sunni politicians, under fire from insurgents for participating in the elections, have become masters of ambiguity. ''Working with the resistance is a red line for my party,'' insisted Tarik al-Hashimi, leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party. ''But we respect their option. There is a national resistance with legitimate reasons.''
 Mr. Khalilzad, a Sunni Muslim himself, born in Afghanistan, has succeeded in fashioning a partial shift in his efforts to prod the Sunnis toward an embrace of the cut-and-thrust of democratic politics. ''Right on arrival he bridged 60 percent of the problem,'' said Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, the leader of a Sunni party. ''He saw the problem was in the Sunni areas, and he knows that Sunnis only give things through dialogue and respect. His message was the train is moving and we should jump in before it's too late. We listened.''
 The ambassador painted for the Sunnis a dire picture of a protracted conflict: the wealthy flee, schools decline, businesses collapse while your rivals move ahead. Learn from the Palestinian mistake and opt in.
 It's too early to say to what degree the Sunnis have reversed course or what effect this would have. But a decisive test of Iraqi bridge-building is imminent. If division prevails, the outlook will be bleak for Iraq and for American involvement. ''I think American impatience has to do with the notion that we don't know what we're doing,'' Mr. Khalilzad said. ''If we could project that we are moving in the right direction, Americans are ready to be very patient.''

HEADLINE: Why Not A Strike On Iran? 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DIPLOMATS around the world keep repeating the mantra: There is no military option when it comes to slowing, much less stopping, Iran's presumed ambitions to get the Bomb. The Europeans say so. The Chinese, who need Iran's oil, and the Russians, who make billions supplying Iran's civilian nuclear business, say so emphatically.
 Even the hawks in the Bush administration make no threats. When Vice President Dick Cheney was asked Thursday, in a television interview, if the United States might ever resort to force to stop Iran, he handled the question as if it, too, were radioactive.
''No president should ever take the military option off the table,'' he said, carefully avoiding the kind of language he once used to warn Saddam Hussein. ''Let's leave it there.'' 
 Mr. Cheney, it seemed, was trying to sow just enough ambiguity to make Iran think twice. Which raises two questions. If diplomacy fails, does America have a military option? And what if it doesn't? 
 ''It's a kind of nonsense statement to say there is no military solution to this,'' said W. Patrick Lang, the former head of Middle East intelligence at the Defense Intelligence Agency. ''It may not be a desirable solution, but there is a military solution.''
 Mr. Lang was piercing to the heart of a conundrum the Bush administration recognizes: Iran could become a case study for pre-emptive military action against a gathering threat, under a policy Mr. Bush promulgated in 2002. But even if taking out Iran's facilities delay the day the country goes nuclear, it would alienate allies and probably make firm enemies out of many Iranians who have come to dislike their theocratic government. And Iran simply has too many ways of striking back, in the oil markets, in the Persian Gulf, through Hezbollah. 
 ''Could we do it?'' one administration official who was deeply involved in planning the Iraq invasion said recently. ''Sure. Could we manage the aftermath? I doubt it.''
 Similar fears, he said, gave President Bill Clinton pause about launching a strike on North Korea in 1994. Later that year he reached an accord for a freeze on the North's nuclear production facilities. But in 2003 everything unfroze, and now the North, by C.I.A. estimates, has enough fuel for at least half a dozen bombs. 
 The Iranians took careful notes then, and here in Washington today the Korean experience underlies diplomacy-versus-force arguments that rarely take place on the record. 
 The problem is not that Washington lacks targets. Many of Iran's nuclear facilities, or at least those that American intelligence agencies know about, are in plain view or in underground sites whose construction was recorded by spy satellites. The problem is the global consequences of an attack to cripple them. 
 ''The irony is that this is the opposite of Iraq,'' said John J. Hamre, a deputy defense secretary from 1997 to 1999. ''We know a lot about what they have because the international inspectors have been there.'' Those inspection reports have helped Pentagon planners who, in imagining every contingency, have already mapped out Iran's most vulnerable facilities.
 ''Elimination of the nuclear program is not possible, but with the right strikes you could decisively set them back,'' said Ashton B. Carter, an expert at Harvard on proliferation problems. 
 In Iran's case, any attack would almost certainly start at Natanz, where Iran clipped off the International Atomic Energy Agency's seals a week ago and said it was preparing to reassemble a connected series of 164 centrifuges for purifying uranium.
 Just beyond the research laboratories is a huge underground chamber, designed to hold as many as 50,000 centrifuges, yet unbuilt. Iran hid its existence for years.
 Also on the target list, officials said, would be factories that manufacture the centrifuge components, and a plant at Isfahan where raw uranium is converted into a form that can be fed into the centrifuges.
 Then there are research centers and military installations where the United States suspects -- but cannot prove -- that clandestine nuclear-related activity may be taking place. Given the track record in Iraq, however, there is always the risk that those facilities will turn out to be a watch factory, or, worse, a schoolhouse. (The Iranians hid one facility behind a false wall in a Tehran factory, but the I.A.E.A. found it.) 
 ''You are talking about something in the neighborhood of a thousand strike sorties,'' said Mr. Lang. ''And it would take all kinds of stuff -- air, cruise missiles, multiple restrikes -- to make sure you've got it all.'' Other former officials say fewer bombing runs would be needed. 
 The Israelis, who see Iran's nuclear program as a threat to their existence and have been far more outspoken about a military option, give a similar assessment. But they also say they lack the air power, or the reach, to do the job.
 In any event, it is one thing to talk about such strikes in purely military terms, and another to consider the political cost. 
 ''What you do with a bombing campaign is bring a whole country rallying around its radical leaders,'' said Mr. Hamre. ''And that's the opposite of what we are trying to achieve in Iran,'' which is to convince a well-traveled, well-educated, and in some cases pro-American population to usher in a very different kind of leadership. 
 But if Iran knows the United States and its allies ultimately have no stomach to put military muscle behind their demands, what is its incentive to give up its weapons program? Efforts by the Europeans and Russia to come up with formulas that would provide Iran with nuclear material that cannot be used for weapons have been rejected, at least so far. And no one wants to threaten truly tough sanctions, for fear that by hurting ordinary Iranians they will only drive moderates into the camp of their leaders. Those leaders have been threatening retaliation, even to measures as weak as a letter of warning from the United Nations Security Council.
 They have threatened to cut off oil exports and send the markets into a panic, though most experts said an embargo is not something Iran could execute for very long without damaging its own economy. Iran could also step up interference in Iraq and dispatch Hezbollah on terror missions. In addition, the Iranians often boast that their missiles can reach Israel.
 Some of those threats may be inflated. And for now, at least, Iran's centrifuge program appears to have hit some technical hitches. I.A.E.A. inspectors are still in Iran, and the Iranians have not yet dared throw them out, as the North Koreans did three years ago. A senior European diplomat involved in the talks with Iran dismissed most of the country's threats last week as ''bluster meant to buy them some time, and keep us paralyzed.''
 But, he added, ''it may work.'' 
 Several American officials, when promised anonymity, said they thought that in 5 or 10 years, Iran will most likely have a weapon. 
 ''They have read us pretty well,'' Mr. Hamre said. ''They have skated right at the edge of controlled pugnaciousness.'' 
 The debate among the West, Russia and China is whether, together, they are willing to skate to the same edge in hopes that, in a repeat of the cold war, the other side blinks first.

HEADLINE: A Closed Bridge Mirrors Venezuela's Many Woes

BYLINE: By BRIAN ELLSWORTH

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Rodolfo Jimenez, 22, loves baseball, but his barrio on the outskirts of Caracas does not offer much in the way of playing fields. This month he and his friends found an unlikely place for pickup games -- the two northbound lanes of the carefully engineered highway connecting the mountainous capital to the airport and the port city of La Guaira.
 Usually a bustling thoroughfare that rumbles with 18-wheel cargo trucks, cars and vans, the highway has been virtually empty since early this month when the government shut down a bridge -- a half-mile span over a dizzying canyon -- that it said showed signs of imminent collapse. 
 ''The highway is like a sports arena now,'' said Mr. Jimenez, a vegetable seller, sitting on a median strip that now doubles as a dugout.
 The highway, which opened in 1953, allowed cars to reach Caracas -- close to the shore but tucked behind an 8,500-foot mountain called El Avila -- in only 45 minutes. The trip now takes three and a half hours along a winding, 80-year-old strip known as ''the old road to La Guaira.'' 
 Authorities recently approved a shortcut through the dirt-poor slum of El Pauji, a settlement built over a closed garbage dump that still leaks methane. Confused drivers try to follow hand-drawn cardboard signs through the labyrinth of run-down zinc shacks.
 Venezuela, a country awash in cash from a wave of a high oil prices, is also mired in infrastructure problems. Its leader, President Hugo Chavez, has been spending the billions of dollars in annual oil profits to provide education, health and social services to millions of poor Venezuelans. In a well-publicized thumb in the Bush administration's eye, he even has been subsidizing heating oil for Americans in Chicago and the Bronx. 
 Meanwhile, Venezuela's roads and electrical grid have been suffering. Government statistics show the number of major electricity blackouts jumped to 80 in 2005 from 49 in 2004, despite increased government spending in each year. The main highways linking Caracas to the eastern and western parts of the country are also in disrepair and may face bridge collapses as well. The local news media are reporting that the government actually reduced its budget for road maintenance in 2006. 
 And in the coastal state of Vargas, residents say the government never completely repaired the roads damaged by huge mudslides in 1999. 
 Infrastructure was a forgotten issue during Venezuela's 30-month political crisis, which included an oil industry shutdown and botched coup d'etat as part of opposition efforts to force Mr. Chavez from office. Now, the possible collapse of the bridge -- known as Viaduct No. 1 -- is a major issue for Venezuelans from all walks of life. 
 Hospital workers in Vargas are putting in overtime hours because commuting doctors cannot arrive on time. Fishermen along the coast say the price of bait has tripled and fewer trucks are available to ship their catch to Caracas. Authorities at Maiquetia International Airport say the number of arriving flights has fallen by 9 percent. The cost of transporting merchandise to the capital from the coast increased 30 percent to 40 percent within two weeks of the bridge closure. 
 Dulce Navarro, 36, a school counselor who lives in San Onofre, a slum on the outskirts of Caracas, described the situation as critical. 
 ''The road is overflowing with traffic, it's completely chaotic,'' she said, adding that many other services like electricity, water, gas and trash collection have suffered as a result of the bridge problem. Engineers discovered in 1987 that the pillars of Viaduct No. 1 were moving as a result of soil erosion. 
 Successive administrations, however, did nothing about the problem. Erosion worsened as thousands of poor families built homes on the precarious hillsides. By Jan. 5, engineers found that the bridge pylons were slipping rapidly and they could no longer guarantee the bridge's safety. 
 Mr. Chavez's critics have blamed him for the problem. 
 ''This government has not had any specific plan for maintenance of public works, and the result is that the country's road system is facing a serious crisis,'' said Enzo Betancourt, president of the Venezuelan College of Engineers, the country's main engineering group and a consistent critic of Mr. Chavez. 
 Venezuela's largest business group, the opposition-affiliated Fedecamaras, warned that the problem could reduce the expected growth of nation's gross domestic product to 4 percent in 2006 from 7 percent. 
 Mr. Chavez insists that previous governments are equally responsible for the declining state of the country's roads and that opposition leaders exaggerate the extent of the problem.
 ''Some perverse and wretched minds take this as a good thing so they can blame the government, and most of all Chavez,'' he said during his weekly Sunday broadcast after the bridge was closed. 
 Mr. Chavez has approved a $24 million tax exemption for coastal businesses, offered subsidies of up to $68 a day to public transit vehicles and has promised that an alternate route around the bridge will be completed by February. 
 Despite an onslaught of attention in the news media, the problem is not likely to exact a heavy political cost from Mr. Chavez. His strong following among the country's poorest residents has allowed him and his allies to win repeated electoral victories, including a sweep of last December's legislative elections. Most of his supporters are considered unlikely to turn against him even if they grumble about the bridge failure. 
 Only a small number of Caracas residents have no complaints about the bridge closure. 
 ''It gives us so much room to play!'' said Enderson Ozuna, 8, of El Limon, taking advantage of the empty highway to fly a homemade kite made from a plastic bag and a pair of sticks. Not far from him, a group of two dozen eight-foot concrete tubes stashed by the side of the highway have become a sort of jungle gym. 
 Graciela Velandiz, 48, a homemaker, watched the children playing from the shoulder of the highway. ''It's so beautiful to see these kids with so much space to run around,'' she said with a smile. ''But the situation is just horrible. They need to fix that bridge as soon as possible.''


CORRECTION-DATE: February 1, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Jan. 22 about Venezuela's abundance of cash from high oil prices referred incorrectly to the recipients of subsidized Venezuelan heating oil in some American cities this winter. Venezuela did offer to subsidize heating oil for Chicago, as reported, but the city did not accept because many homes there are heated with natural gas. (Venezuela later sought to provide diesel fuel for Chicago's public transit system, but no agreement on this has been reached.)

HEADLINE: At First G.O.P. Forum, Candidates for Governor Focus Their Fire on Spitzer

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, N.Y., Jan. 21 

 BODY:
At their first public gathering of the 2006 campaign, the four Republican candidates for governor lashed into their main Democratic opponent, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, on Saturday, calling him a handmaiden of lobbyists and labor unions who would raise taxes, continue the status quo in Albany and bully anyone in his way.
 The candidates, speaking before 100 Republican activists, also sounded alarms about the New York economy: too many jobs leaving upstate, too many young people leaving, period, and too many increases in taxes and spending. 
Although George E. Pataki, a Republican in his last term as governor, has presided over the state for the past 12 years, the Republican candidates trained their fire on Mr. Spitzer to argue that he would make matters worse.
 ''No amount of slick rhetoric can hide the fact that their candidate is aligned with the very special interests who want to continue business as usual in this state,'' said John J. Faso, a former Republican Assembly leader. Another candidate, Assemblyman Patrick Manning, used the harshest language, saying that Mr. Spitzer had acted like a ''thug'' and a ''bully'' against his enemies while coddling his Democratic allies.
 The campaign manager for Mr. Spitzer, Ryan Toohey, fired back in a statement, saying that the only ''special interest'' Mr. Spitzer defends is the people of New York.
 ''These desperate candidates are just upset because Eliot has been tough on their special interests -- the big businesses that were systematically robbing everyday New Yorkers,'' Mr. Toohey said.
 Aside from the speeches, the Republican forum was a first chance to compare the candidates for governor side by side.
 Randy A. Daniels, a former secretary of state and an energetic speaker, drew the most applause as he hailed President Reagan and said that Republicans should stick to core principles and stop being ''Democratic lite.'' He called for shrinking the size of government, combating ''long-term stagnation'' with economic reforms and offering voters ''a positive Reaganesque message.''
 ''Why are Republicans retreating? Why are we confused? Why have we forgotten who we are?'' Mr. Daniels asked.
 No one clapped, by contrast, for former Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld as he delivered his remarks, which ranged from a meandering recitation about his children's Ivy League educations to a laundry list of ideas for the economy. Taking his glasses off and putting them on -- a distraction that several audience members noted afterward -- Mr. Weld recalled cutting the state budget in Massachusetts by 10 percent, and working with minority groups and forming a commission to prevent suicide among gay and lesbian youth.
 ''I'd like to run that kind of administration here,'' Mr. Weld said.
 While the Syracuse region has been a base of support for Mr. Daniels, he has struggled to raise money statewide and win support from leaders in the most populous counties. Mr. Weld has done much better on both scores; though he is usually charismatic before small groups and reporters, he seemed to lose his touch inside the Syracuse venue -- a cavernous, echoing convention center where people were scattered among thousands of seats.
 ''I liked Randy, the fire and brimstone, and he made me feel good about being a Republican and an American,'' said Dave Fontecchio of Fulton, N.Y., adding that he was leaning toward Mr. Daniels or Mr. Manning.
 ''With Weld, I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be,'' Mr. Fontecchio said. ''He seemed too much of the old guard, too aristocratic.''
 The forum also marked the political return of Jeanine F. Pirro, the former Westchester district attorney, who dropped out of the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton last month and began a bid to succeed Mr. Spitzer as attorney general instead.
 Although Ms. Pirro's Senate campaign became known for her gaffes, her appearance here was smooth and well received, and she seemed more at ease with her new message of pledging to bring her prosecutorial talents to the job in Albany.
 ''I've done it as district attorney, and I'll do it as your attorney general,'' she said.
 Another possible candidate for attorney general, Chauncey G. Parker, who is Governor Pataki's criminal justice aide, drew mixed reviews after a lengthy speech that dwelled on his background. Mr. Parker still works for the state and has yet to enter the race, so he has been circumspect about his political agenda. He did stand out as the only Republican who lavishly praised Mr. Pataki.
 The most likely Republican challenger to Senator Clinton right now, former Mayor John Spencer of Yonkers, also addressed the audience. In a toughly worded speech, he denounced Mrs. Clinton for ''raising moo-lah from the mullahs'' -- a reference to her donations from some Iranian-Americans -- and for being ''part of the Ted Kennedy crowd, the John Kerry crowd.''
 ''They are 'appease, appease, appease,' '' he said. ''I don't want to appease when we are at war.''
 A campaign spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, told of Mr. Spencer's remarks, said he would prefer not to comment.

HEADLINE: Held in 9/11 Net, Muslims Return To Accuse U.S.

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Hundreds of noncitizens were swept up on visa violations in the weeks after 9/11, held for months in a much-criticized federal detention center in Brooklyn as ''persons of interest'' to terror investigators, and then deported. This week, one of them is back in New York and another is due today -- the first to return to the United States.
 They are no longer the accused but the accusers, among six former detainees who are coming back to give depositions in their federal lawsuits against top government officials and detention guards, at a time when the constitutionality of part of the government's counterterrorism offensive is under new scrutiny.
As in the cases of all the Muslim immigrants rounded up in the New York area after the terror attacks, the six were never accused of a crime related to 9/11; officials eventually cleared all of them of links to terrorism. A report by the inspector general of the Justice Department found systemic problems with immigrant detentions and widespread abuse at the federal detention center where the six had been held; several guards have since been disciplined. 
 But as the six return to the city -- four of them from Egypt, one from Pakistan, one from London -- the conditions imposed by the United States government include the requirement that they be in the constant custody of federal marshals. 
 They are barred from calling anyone during their weeklong stays at an undisclosed New York hotel, where 12 days of closed depositions are to begin today. They can expect hours of questioning by lawyers representing at least 31 defendants in the lawsuits, including John Ashcroft, the former attorney general, and Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I.
 The first returning detainees, Yasser and Hany Ibrahim, who are brothers, say that putting themselves back in the hands of the government they are suing is an act of faith in America. In recent telephone interviews from Alexandria, Egypt, the two described themselves as frightened but resolute in pressing a 2002 class-action lawsuit charging that they were abused and deprived of due process because of their religion or national origin.
 ''I'm seeking justice,'' said Yasser, 33, who had a Web site design business in Brooklyn before he and Hany, 29, a deli worker, were delivered in shackles to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn 19 days after 9/11. ''It's from the same system that did us injustice before. But I have faith in this system. I know what happened before was a mistake.''
 Charles S. Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said officials would not comment on any aspect of the case, including the conditions of the men's return to the city and their allegations. But in court papers, the defendants deny wrongdoing, and department lawyers argue in part that the Sept. 11 attacks created ''special factors'' -- including the need to detect and deter future terrorist attacks -- that outweigh the plaintiffs' right to sue for damages for any constitutional violations. 
 The detainees' lawyers say that what happened at the Brooklyn detention center can be recognized four years later as the template for many of the counterterrorism measures now being fiercely challenged.
 ''The post-9/11 domestic immigration sweeps were the first example of the Bush administration's willingness to ignore the law and hold people outside the judicial system,'' said Rachel Meeropol, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents the Ibrahim brothers. ''The kind of torture, interrogation and arbitrary detention that we now associate with Guantanamo and secret C.I.A. facilities really started right here, in Brooklyn.'' 
 Richard Peter Caro, a lawyer for Stuart Pray, the lieutenant who oversaw the detainees' arrival at the detention center, said yesterday: ''We're glad that they're coming in to be deposed so we can really get at the facts and finally see what the evidence shows. I'm confident that my client will be found to have committed no wrongdoing at all.'' 
 Last week, the center filed a class-action suit against President Bush and other administration officials over the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping without warrants. Ms. Meeropol is one of the plaintiffs, contending that her communications with clients like the Ibrahims may have been monitored illegally. The government says the surveillance program is a legal and valuable tool in the war on terror. 
 Illegal recording of lawyer-client conversations was one of the abuses documented at the Brooklyn detention center in a scathing 2003 report by the Justice Department's inspector general. The report also found a pattern of physical abuse, some of it caught on prison videotape, including beatings and sexual humiliations like those described by the Ibrahim brothers or other former detainees. The report said it was Mr. Ashcroft's policy to hold detainees on any legal pretext until the F.B.I. cleared them, even though such clearances took months and many detainees were immigrants picked up by chance.
 At the time, Mr. Ashcroft said he made ''no apologies'' for finding every legal way possible to protect the American public. Nonetheless, officials pledged to work on getting kinks out of the system, and said abuses would be punished.
 Critics charge that the authority that Mr. Ashcroft asserted after 9/11 -- to detain any noncitizen considered a ''person of interest'' secretly and indefinitely -- is unconstitutional. Government officials argue that secrecy is needed to keep terrorists in the dark. 
 Mr. Ashcroft has sought to have the two lawsuits brought by the detainees dismissed. But in a decision appealed by the government, a federal judge in Brooklyn ruled in September that he and other defendants would have to answer questions, at a later deposition, in one of the suits: a 2004 complaint by another two of the six returning detainees. 
 Those two men, in their late 30's, are Ehab Elmaghraby, an Egyptian immigrant who ran a restaurant near Times Square, and Javaid Iqbal, a Pakistani immigrant whose Long Island customers knew him as ''the cable guy.'' 
 ''I am not afraid,'' Mr. Iqbal wrote last week in an e-mail message about his return. ''I am also sure that justice will be served because peoples of U.S.A. are justice-loving people regardless of race and religion.'' 
 The Ibrahim brothers are more fearful. They say that their parents begged them not to return to the country where they were held in maximum security without charges for eight months and, the brothers charge, beaten and tormented by guards. ''Part of my motivation is to make sure that what happened to us doesn't happen to more people in the future,'' said Yasser, who was due to arrive in New York today, joining his brother, who came on Friday. 
 Both spoke with nostalgia of the three or four years they lived in New York, on and off, before 9/11. When they were not working, they said, they hung out together in Greenwich Village, browsed electronics stores near Times Square and took friends on the rides at Coney Island. Hany proudly recalled how he worked his way up from stock boy to grill man and then manager of a deli in Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn. ''The best I lived in my life was in New York,'' he said. 
 Right after the World Trade Center attack, they said, their parents urged them to come home. ''We assured them,'' Yasser recalled: '' 'This is the United States. They don't arrest people for no charges. We didn't do anything, so nothing's going to happen to us.' ''
 But at 2 p.m. on Sept. 30, 2001, the lawsuit says, a dozen terrorism investigators from the F.B.I., the police and immigration services knocked at the door of the Ocean Parkway apartment that the brothers shared with several Egyptian and Moroccan friends. After questioning, the investigators took away Yasser, Hany and another man, all of whose tourist visas had expired.
 Why investigators showed up is unclear, said their lawyer, Ms. Meeropol. But she noted that some interrogations were prompted by anonymous tips about ''suspicious-looking'' foreign men. Federal officials have contended that at a time when a second terror attack seemed imminent, all tips had to be checked. As a practical matter, once the brothers were labeled ''of interest'' to investigators, they were destined for the maximum-security unit of the Metropolitan Detention Center. 
 Physical abuse, the lawsuit says, began the moment they arrived, chained and shackled. As Yasser described it, guards supervised by Lieutenant Pray slammed his brother face-first into a wall where an American flag T-shirt had been taped, then did the same to him. 
 Pain became part of the brothers' daily routine, the lawsuit charges. Escort teams cursing them as Muslims and terrorists slammed them into every available wall when they were taken from their cells, twisted their wrists and fingers, and stepped on their leg chains so that they fell, their ankles bruised and bloody, according to the suit. 
 But worse than physical or verbal abuse, Yasser said, was ''the feeling that we are being hidden from the outside world, and nobody knows in the outside world that we are arrested and in this place.'' Hany, who says he had a nervous breakdown when he returned to Egypt, recalled that guards and lieutenants terrified him by saying, ''You're going to stay here the rest of your life.''
 At a closed immigration hearing on Nov. 20, three weeks after their arrest, the brothers agreed to immediate deportation. By Dec. 7, the lawsuit says, F.B.I. memos stated that clearance checks on the Ibrahims had shown no links to terrorism. But they were held six more months -- Hany until May 29, 2002, and Yasser until June 6. 
 The suit asks the court to declare that all the detentions were unjustified and illegal, to award compensatory and punitive damages, and to order the government to return personal property it confiscated.
 To prevent unnecessary detentions and abuses of noncitizens in the event of a new national emergency, the Justice Department's inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, in 2003 recommended changes in counterterrorism policy as well as disciplinary action against at least 10 guards and supervisors. In his last report to Congress, in August 2005, Mr. Fine said that many of his recommendations had been acted upon but that formal policy changes were still being negotiated. 
 The Federal Bureau of Prisons has fired two detention officers, suspended two for 30 days and demoted one in connection with the Brooklyn inquiry, said Traci Billingsley, a bureau spokeswoman.
 The Ibrahim brothers say that when they finally reached home, they found that the presumption of guilt had followed them into an Egyptian secret service dossier that made them unemployable. Yasser, now married with a 2-year-old son, said he and Hany were eking out a living in a small jewelry business.
 ''It's going to be very difficult for me to go back for just a week and not to be able to see the places that I loved before,'' he said of his return. ''America's the land of the free.''

HEADLINE: In a Stronghold, Fatah Fights To Beat Back a Rising Hamas

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: NABLUS, West Bank, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Nasser Joumaa, pale and thin, was facing some tough questions from his own Fatah members.
 ''Our generation is being ignored,'' said a tall, bearded man in a small house, packed and cloudy with cigarette smoke, as more young men listened at the windows. ''Where are the respected people to vote for on Fatah's list? Not you, Nasser, but there are corrupted people in this list.''
 Mr. Joumaa, 39 and respected here for his military and political prowess, looked pained. ''I share your concerns,'' he said. ''People are angry with Fatah and its performance, and so am I. I'm one of the angry members of Fatah. But we express our anger inside. We face a bigger challenge now from Hamas, and in a difficult situation we stand together.''
 Fatah, the mainstay of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization, is in trouble, even here in Nablus, one of the West Bank's toughest and largest cities, and a longtime stronghold for the group. Fatah is struggling to beat back the radical Islamic movement Hamas -- which won an astonishing 13 of Nablus's 15 local council seats a month ago, and elected an efficient, worldly yet devout mayor, Adli Yaish. 
 Palestinians vote Wednesday in elections for a new legislature, the first such vote in a decade. The United States, which lists Hamas as a terrorist organization, has quietly spent almost $2 million on dozens of quick projects to strengthen Fatah's hand, American and Palestinian officials say. [Page 10]
 The coming vote is the first time that Hamas has run in elections for roles within the Palestinian Authority -- because the authority was set up in the 1993 Oslo accords with Israel, which Hamas is committed to destroy. 
 But Mr. Joumaa is convinced that Hamas means to destroy Fatah first, if not now then by stages, and he warns Fatah members not to lose sight of the longer battle.
 ''Hamas talks of partnership with Fatah, but it wants to replace Fatah,'' he said. ''We have power and authority, and we can't just give it up. We don't know Hamas's real program or goals, or to whom they will be subject. We cannot leave ourselves in Hamas's control.''
 Nablus is a stunning city, set in a steep valley, founded by the Romans in A.D. 72 and proud of its ancient aqueducts. It is the second-largest city in the West Bank, with some 325,000 people. But it has also been severely affected by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially in the last five years, with the highest number of casualties, most severe physical damage and most intensive restrictions on movement in the West Bank, according to a report issued by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in December. Fatah and the Palestinian Authority are paying the price for the economy and the border closures, as well as for Fatah's reputation for corruption.
 Palestinian opinion polls vary, but all show that Fatah still leads Hamas, but not by much, and Hamas seems to be gaining. Fatah has 42 percent to Hamas's 35 percent, according to pollster Khalil Shikaki of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research; it has 35 percent to Hamas's 30 percent, with a larger number of undecided voters, according to Nader Said, a poll director for Birzeit University in Ramallah. Both polls have margins of error of at least 2 percent, but both show Fatah holding onto a majority, especially in coalition with other secular candidate lists like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, that of the independent Mustafa Barghouti, and another independent list called the Third Way, headed by the former finance minister Salam Fayyad, the likely next prime minister.
 Both independent lists are getting aid from European and American supporters. But Fatah and Mr. Joumaa are worried that those competing independents, especially in constituencies, where many are also using the Fatah symbol, could allow Hamas candidates to win with small pluralities. Each voter will cast two ballots. Half of the 132 seats will be determined by votes for party lists, and half by votes in 16 local districts, which are harder to predict through polling.
 So Fatah is trying to overcome its internal hatreds and unite, at the end, to face down Hamas, including pressing Fatah members running independently to withdraw. It is not easy for some in Fatah, upset that Hamas is even being allowed to take part. Fatah activists in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus insist they will not allow the elections to proceed, and there are worries of election-day violence.
 Mr. Joumaa has reasons to be angry with Fatah's leader, President Mahmoud Abbas, who mismanaged its party primaries, finally scrapping them. Mr. Joumaa was a top member of a rival slate of 40-somethings led by the jailed leader Marwan Barghouti and was unhappy when that slate was merged with the official Fatah one. He is No. 18 on the list, so will be elected to the new legislature (as will Marwan Barghouti, who is No. 1), and his posters show him with Mr. Barghouti and the slogan: ''Only the shoulders of the fighters can raise the torches of freedom. Vote for Fatah.''
 It has been an extraordinary personal journey for Mr. Joumaa, who spent 14 months in a Palestinian prison beginning in 1996, when older Fatah figures accused him of disloyalty. He was tortured there, and watched his best friend die there from torture, but then became the commander of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades in Nablus. He was wanted by the Israelis and kept hidden, even as his mother was dying, 15 months ago, from cancer. When her body was laid out in a crowded mosque, however, he slipped in to pay last respects.
 With the cease-fire brokered by Mr. Abbas early in 2005, Mr. Joumaa is no longer being hunted. He has laid aside his arms -- for good, he hopes -- and turned to Fatah politics, one of the young men toughened by a life under Israeli occupation and by Palestinian misrule. Between Sept. 29, 2000, and Oct. 31, 2005, 522 Palestinians were killed in Nablus, including 80 children and 28 women -- 27.8 percent of all West Bank Palestinians killed, according to the December United Nations report.
 A center for Palestinian militancy, Nablus is surrounded by six Israeli checkpoints and 53 other physical obstacles to travel, and by 14 Israeli settlements and 26 settlement outposts. But with the cease-fire, the number of military incursions and curfews has dropped and some of the obstacles have been removed, and the number of deaths and injuries has dropped considerably from 2004.
 So there is some new optimism here, but not much confidence, and many men still have difficulty getting permission to travel out of Nablus. 
 Mr. Yaish, the new Hamas mayor here, only three weeks in office, is an example of why the group is doing well. He is devout, but wealthy from auto parts and a Mercedes agency. He studied mechanical engineering in England from 1970 to 1975 and speaks English fluently; he speaks the modern language of efficiency and budget oversight; he keeps a picture of Yasir Arafat in his office and not Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the Hamas leader killed by Israel in March 2004.
 ''This is a government office,'' Mr. Yaish said. ''President Abbas said to leave the photos of Arafat in offices, so we left it. Sheik Yassin was not elected, and this is not my house.''
 Mr. Yaish agrees that some people will vote differently on national and local issues, and he expects Hamas to get nowhere close to the 73 percent of the local vote it received a month ago. ''We want partnership with Fatah,'' he said. ''Democracy is competition and makes us stronger.''
 Hamas in the legislature will monitor government work, especially finances and accounts, to prevent corruption, he said, and to improve tax collection. ''The same party as judge and jury is not good,'' he said. ''If there is no oversight, even a good man can be tempted.''
 Hamas opposes negotiations with Israel, but Mr. Yaish thinks its presence in the legislature will stiffen the Palestinian Authority's back in dealings with Israel. ''I don't like the Palestinian Authority to negotiate from a weak position,'' Mr. Yaish said, pragmatically. ''We're occupied, and I want my government to talk harder to Israel.''
 Mouna Mansour is another Hamas candidate, 44 years old, a physics teacher and the widow of a famous local Hamas leader, Jamal Mansour, who was assassinated in 2001 by an Israeli missile strike on his office. His colleague and six others, including two children, also died in what the State Department then called ''excessive'' and ''a new and dangerous escalation.''
 Today, Mrs. Mansour lives in a building named for her husband in an apartment filled with his ''martyrdom'' posters. She is practical and straightforward. ''Hamas wants to be in the legislature to protect the resistance against occupation,'' she said. ''It is our strategic choice. Our political role is to back the resistance.''
 But resistance is not just arms and bombs, she insists. ''Resistance is also the farmer steadfast on his land, or the factory worker hiring as many as he can and making local products,'' she said.
 ''We will be partners with Fatah,'' she said. ''The role of the legislature is accountability.''
 Should the cease-fire with Israel continue? ''It's needed for a period of time, because our people are exhausted by the occupation,'' she said, and then added, smiling: ''It's a time for the warriors to rest up.''
 That is exactly what Israel warns, that Hamas has not changed its goals.
 Mr. Yaish says benignly: ''I say to the world with open heart: 'Don't worry so much.' ''
 Mr. Joumaa thinks differently. ''Hamas wants to infiltrate the institutions and take over,'' he said. ''I think a Palestinian state now is farther away.''

HEADLINE: Bolivia Indians Hail the Swearing In of One of Their Own as President

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Evo Morales, a Socialist protest leader and steadfast critic of American policies in the region, was sworn in Sunday as president of Bolivia, the first Indian to hold the position in this landlocked country whose indigenous majority had long felt oppressed and cut off from political power.
 With tears welling in his eyes, his left fist raised and his right hand over his heart, Mr. Morales, 46, an Aymara Indian, took the oath of office as the leaders of 11 countries, American diplomats and the crown prince of Spain watched from the gallery of the country's ornate 19th-century Congress. 
 The son of a shepherd who grew up in an adobe home in the frigid highlands, Mr. Morales was dressed true to his anti-establishment roots, in a wool jacket featuring white pre-Hispanic motifs on the lapels and an open-neck shirt, but no tie.
 Outside, tens of thousands of people celebrated, many of them Aymara and Quechua Indians, tin and silver miners, coca farmers and leftists from around the world. They blew cow horns, danced to brass bands and waved the seven-colored wipala flag of the Andean Indian nation. By evening, Mr. Morales and his vice president, Alvaro Garcia, a former guerrilla leader who spent five years in jail for rebellion, had joined them.
 ''This is a historic day,'' said Gregorio Mamani, 43, like Mr. Morales an Aymara. ''I am so happy that after so many years, we have an indigenous president, one we can be proud of before the whole world.''
 In the Congress, Mr. Morales asked for a moment of silence for Inca martyrs, for the Argentine guerrilla Che Guevara, who died in a failed effort to start a revolution here in 1967, and ''the millions of humans who have fallen in all of Latin America.'' In a rambling, passionate speech that mixed Spanish and Aymara, Mr. Morales did not veer from the populist themes that enthralled his followers and gave him a landslide win in the election on Dec. 18.
 He criticized ''neoliberal reforms,'' the American-backed free-market prescriptions that are now being tested throughout the continent, for failing to pull Bolivians out of poverty. He lamented that there were no high-ranking Indians in the army, and he railed against the corruption of past governments.
 Mr. Morales promised to ''change our history'' and give voice to the downtrodden.
 ''I want to say to you, my Indian brothers concentrated here in Bolivia, that the 500-year campaign of resistance has not been in vain,'' Mr. Morales said moments after being sworn in. ''This democratic, cultural fight is part of the fight of our ancestors, it is the continuity of the fight of Tupac Katari, it is a continuity of the fight of Che Guevara.''
 But while Mr. Morales is clearly among the more anti-establishment in a crop of leftist leaders who have recently swept to power in Latin America, he has tempered his tone since his victory and has spoken of the need for Bolivia to trade and build ties with other countries. ''I have learned that the president of a government has to do good business deals for his country,'' Mr. Morales said Sunday. 
 Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Morales enters the presidency with overwhelming good will from inside Bolivia and beyond. The economy is solid, having grown at 4 percent in 2005, the best measure in years. The International Monetary Fund in December wrote off the country's $231 million debt, while the deficit has shrunk significantly, thanks to higher tax revenues and spending constraints.
 Political analysts say the sound economic picture, coupled with the mandate that propelled Mr. Morales to power, should give his government time to maneuver. 
 Still, he has to keep in mind supporters in the crowd like Gregorio Machicado Quispe, 48, who said, ''We expect a complete change.''
 ''The government needs to favor the poor, suffering classes,'' he said. ''We have to control the wealth here in Bolivia.''
 Gustavo Torrico Landa, 46, a congressman from Mr. Morales's Movement Toward Socialism Party, said: ''The government has to show that it has begun to function But it's not like Evo on the 22nd becomes president and this becomes Switzerland on the 24th.''
 Indeed, Bolivian officials close to Mr. Morales, including his top economic adviser, Carlos Villegas, said in interviews that the government was carefully considering what economic path to take.
 That means determining everything from how to attend to poor farmers, a priority for Mr. Morales, to how much foreign aid to receive from the United States and other countries, which officials say cannot come with tough conditions. 
 Mr. Morales and other officials have also said trade is important, but have not decided what kind of agreements should be signed. In the meantime, Bolivia plans to ask Washington for an extension on a preferential trade deal that ends in December, Mr. Villegas said.
 ''The only path for Bolivia is to open itself to the world, but under better conditions than in the past,'' said Juan Ramon Quintana, another adviser to the president.
 The policies that will be most closely watched, especially by multinational oil companies like Petrobras of Brazil and Repsol of Spain, will be in Bolivia's huge natural gas industry. Mr. Morales plans greater control, increasing taxes on the companies, but on Sunday he also said his government needed help from energy experts in formulating a policy.
 Mr. Morales's history as leader of the country's coca farmers, and his campaign pledge to become a ''nightmare'' for the United States, has worried American officials concerned that his presidency could lead to instability and increased drug trafficking. On Sunday, he praised one of his closest allies, Fidel Castro of Cuba, and he warned that the United States could not use the fight against drugs ''as an excuse'' to ''dominate and submit other peoples.''
 Yet, in his speech after the swearing in, he also welcomed Thomas Shannon, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, who was at the inauguration. Mr. Morales had a cordial meeting on Saturday night with Mr. Shannon and David Greenlee, the American ambassador, which will probably lead to more talks.
 ''We have international support,'' Mr. Morales said. ''There is international solidarity.''

HEADLINE: United States Ranks 28th on Environment, a New Study Says

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
A pilot nation-by-nation study of environmental performance shows that just six nations -- led by New Zealand, followed by five from Northern Europe -- have achieved 85 percent or better success in meeting a set of critical environmental goals ranging from clean drinking water and low ozone levels to sustainable fisheries and low greenhouse gas emissions.
 The study, jointly produced by Yale and Columbia Universities, ranked the United States 28th over all, behind most of Western Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Costa Rica and Chile, but ahead of Russia and South Korea. 
The bottom half of the rankings is largely filled with the countries of Africa and Central and South Asia. Pakistan and India both rank among the 20 lowest-scoring countries, with overall success rates of 41.1 percent and 47.7 percent, respectively.
 The pilot study, called the 2006 Environmental Performance Index, has been reviewed by specialists both in the United States and internationally.
 Using a new variant of the methodology the two universities have applied in their Environmental Sustainability Index, produced in four previous years, the study was intended to focus more attention on how various governments have played the environmental hands they have been dealt, said Daniel C. Esty, the director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy and an author of the report. 
 The earlier sustainability measurements ''tell you something about long-term trajectories,'' Mr. Esty said. ''We think this tool has a much greater application in the policy context.''
 For instance, Britain ranked 65th in last year's sustainability index, but 5th in the latest study, among the 133 nations measured. Among the reasons for the earlier low ranking, Mr. Esty said, was that ''they cut down almost all their trees 500 years ago and before,'' something that modern British governments could not control.
 The 16 indicators used in the latest study, the report says, provide ''a powerful tool for evaluating environmental investments and improving policy results.''
 The report will be issued during the World Economic Forum, an annual conclave of business and political leaders which meets in Davos, Switzerland, this week. Mr. Esty said the report was also intended as a tool to help monitor progress on the environmental issues included among the Millennium Development goals adopted by 189 nations at the United Nations Millennium Summit.
 ''It's like holding up a mirror and having someone help you see what you couldn't see before,'' he said. But the report acknowledges ''serious data gaps'' that resulted in leaving more than 65 countries out of the rankings. In addition, some thorny methodological issues, like how to measure land degradation or loss of wetlands, have no widely accepted solutions, the report noted, and the authors used the best measures they had available. 
 Like the sustainability index produced last year, the pilot study ranks countries within their geographic peer groups, so that nations in arid regions or tropical ones can be measured against one another. So Belgium's overall ranking of 39, with a 75.9 percent score, can be viewed by region and by issue. Belgium ranks last, for instance, among European countries in protection of its water resources.
 Air quality rankings tend to favor less industrialized nations like Uganda, Gabon, Ecuador and Sri Lanka. Among the countries of the Americas, the United States ranks in the bottom third on this scale.
 In the Americas, the United States is at the bottom of the scale measuring agricultural, forest and fisheries management, in part because the study is weighted against countries with a high level of crop subsidies. The study's authors say that such subsidies ''in agriculture, fisheries and energy sectors have been shown to have negative impacts on resource use and management practices.''
 In the area of environmental health, the study measured such factors as sanitation, lead exposure and indoor air pollution, a particular concern in the least developed countries, where indoor home fires may be common. In those measures, the richest countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Britain, Ireland and the countries of Northern and Central Europe score near 100 percent.
 On the same scale, the poorest countries fared worst, with 32 of 37 sub-Saharan African nations, along with Bangladesh, Haiti, Yemen, Tajikistan, Laos, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, scoring at or below 40 percent. Chad and Niger rank last in the world, with scores of 0 percent and 1 percent, respectively. 
 ''In the zone we capture as the field of play, they're at the very bottom,'' Mr. Esty said. ''It doesn't mean that nobody there has a toilet. It means a very, very small percent do.'' 
 The energy sustainability portion of the index factors national wealth into measurements of energy efficiency and greenhouse-gas emissions. Nonetheless, all but three of the top 25 spots in the worldwide rankings are occupied by countries in economic distress, including Uganda, Chad and Myanmar. Switzerland, Costa Rica and Peru are the exceptions.
 The study's definition of renewable energy resources does not include nuclear power -- in part, Mr. Esty said, because countries with a high proportion of nuclear-fueled energy, like Japan, the Czech Republic and France, reaped the benefits of their energy choices by earning high rankings on the study's other scales, like the air quality index measuring particulate matter. 
 To create another scale that disproportionately favored nuclear-energy users would have undermined the overall reliability of the study, he said. As a result, the renewable-energy rankings tilt heavily toward countries reliant on hydropower, like tiny Bhutan.
 The study shows that annual carbon dioxide emissions, measured as metric tons per $1 million of gross domestic product, average about 363 tons. North Korea, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Mongolia rank at the bottom of the scale, with amounts ranging from Mongolia's 1,992 tons to North Korea's 4,859 tons.
 Carbon dioxide emissions from nations with rapid economic expansion, like China and India, are more than double the world average (731 tons and 621 tons, respectively). The United States, at 171 tons per $1 million of gross domestic product, ranks well behind some other nations in the Group of 8, the major industrial powers -- France (56), Japan (57), Germany (80) and Britain (118) -- but close to Canada (168), ahead of Australia (209) and far ahead of Russia (914).

HEADLINE: Explosions in Southern Russia Sever Gas Lines to Georgia 

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Explosions in southern Russia on Sunday morning severed the country's natural gas pipelines to Georgia, swiftly plunging Russia's neighbor into heat and electricity shortages and causing a diplomatic flare-up between the nations.
 Two more explosions hours later severed one of Russia's main electricity cables to Georgia, deepening the electricity shortage even as the gas supply in Georgia dwindled. Russia supplies Georgia with all of its natural gas.
By late afternoon, President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia said gas flow had ceased and energy rationing would be necessary. He ordered universities closed and said Georgia was seeking fuel from Iran and Azerbaijan. Hospitals were being provided emergency propane and oil, he said. 
 The shortage was expected to last at least two days, as Russian technicians rushed to repair the severed main and reserve lines. Georgia, usually balmy, was having a cold snap, with temperatures dropping below freezing at night and hovering just above by day.
 The break in supply -- which also led to shortages in Armenia, which receives gas from Russia after it passes through the Georgian pipeline network -- raised fresh questions about Russia's reliability as an energy partner and exposed anew the tensions between Russia and Georgia, a nation formerly under Soviet rule that has spurned Moscow in recent years.
 Russian officials initially said the explosions appeared accidental but later announced that a criminal investigation had begun and that the blasts were acts of sabotage, perhaps by insurgents in the region using makeshift bombs.
 Mr. Saakashvili disputed that contention, saying that the break in supply seemed intended to put political and economic pressure on Georgia, which since 2003 has been pursuing a strongly pro-Western course. He offered no evidence for his position, but said the circumstances were suspicious.
 ''We don't think it is accidental in any way,'' Mr. Saakashvili said in a telephone interview from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. ''The places where it happened, the environment in which it happened, the history in which it happened -- this all looks like a policy decision.''
 No insurgent group claimed immediate responsibility for sabotage, and Mr. Saakashvili noted that none of the guerrilla or terrorist bands in the region had threatened Georgia. Those bands often act in coordination with Islamic separatists in nearby Chechnya.
 Mr. Saakashvili said that the flow of gas had ceased as Russia had been trying to pressure Georgia into selling Russia the Georgian gas pipeline network, and that officials at several levels of the Russian government had been issuing veiled threats in recent weeks.
 He also said that this was the first winter since the collapse of the Soviet Union that Georgia had not had electricity and gas shortages, and that Russia probably resented that success. Mr. Saakashvili compared the gas shortage with the recent pricing dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which led Russia to briefly cut the flow for Ukraine and brought widespread Western criticism of Russia's handling of the incident. ''This is not civilized behavior,'' he said.
 A spokesman from President Vladimir V. Putin dismissed Mr. Saakashvili's characterization, suggesting that the notion that either the Kremlin or Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, would destroy sections of Russia's pipelines was absurd.
 ''If he is postulating that Gazprom or Moscow was standing behind these explosions, I don't think that there is any need for comment on this,'' said the spokesman, Dmitri Peskov. ''There is no need for any attempt for politicization. It has nothing to do with politics. It has nothing to do with pressure. It is a situation of an emergency.''
 The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted angrily, issuing a statement calling the Georgian government's remarks ''hysteria and bacchanalia,'' a reference to Georgians' fondness for wine. The ministry suggested that Georgian officials ''have decided to irrevocably ruin relations with Russia.''
 Four explosions on Russia's side of the border created the shortages, Georgian and Russian officials said. The first two occurred roughly at the same time, before sunrise, severing the main and reserve gas pipelines that flow into Georgia from the Russian supply network. 
 Later in the morning, two more explosions severed a power transmission cable in two places.
 Aleko Khetaguri, the deputy energy minister in Georgia, said in a telephone interview that as a result of the explosions, Georgia had lost all gas flow and roughly a quarter of its electricity, including electricity that was generated from domestic turbines powered by Russian gas. 
 Gas provides heat and cooking fuel in many of Georgia's urban households, he said, but in the countryside many homes are warmed with wood or kerosene. 
 Mr. Khetaguri predicted that repairs to the main line would take three days, and to the reserve line one month. He said repairs to the electric transmission line, which provides roughly 5 percent of Georgia's electricity, would take about a week.
 While Georgia depends in full on Russian gas, it has shifted its electricity supply to accept more energy from Turkey and Armenia. It also expects to import gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia late this year when construction is complete on a network from the Caspian Sea, decreasing its reliance on its former rulers in Moscow, with whom it quarrels on several issues.
 Officials in Armenia said the situation was not as dire, because the country had fuel reserves. Still, they called for conservation and said electricity would be cut to some nonessential customers, news agencies reported.
 Mr. Saakashvili said that to meet demand in Georgia, electricity would be shut off temporarily in different districts on the grid, rotating the shortages until the crisis was resolved. Mr. Khetaguri said that as of Sunday night Georgia was still ''supplying electricity to the entire country, but with interruptions.''

HEADLINE: A Country and a Continent, Hanging in the Balance 

BYLINE: By Lydia Polgreen

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
The past week was a busy one for Olusegun Obasanjo, the Nigerian president. There he was Monday morning, beaming as Liberia's new president took the oath of office, cementing a peace Mr. Obasanjo had worked to build. And here he was Wednesday, perched on a settee and clasping the hand of the president of Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo, trying to put out the flames engulfing that country as militant youths rampaged against the United Nations and France. 
 By week's end he was preparing to head to Khartoum for a meeting of the African Union, of which he is the departing chairman, to weigh in on the long list of crises besetting the continent at the moment: brutal warring in the Darfur region of Sudan, political violence in Ethiopia and bellicose posturing between Chad and Sudan, to name a few.
But two crises unlikely to make the agenda in Khartoum are the ones Mr. Obasanjo faces at home: one in the Niger Delta and the other on the country's contentious political scene. Those fraught situations are tearing at the delicate threads that hold together the ethnic and religious crazy quilt of vast, populous Nigeria -- about twice the size of California, with a population nearing half that of the United States. 
 In the always volatile delta, fresh violence from militants seeking more local control over oil wealth has slashed oil production and helped send prices to a four-month high. The militants, from the delta's dominant Ijaw tribe, have attacked pipelines and captured four oil workers, demanding that the government release two of their jailed leaders and $1.5 billion from Shell, Nigeria's biggest oil producer. [On Sunday, a militant group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, promised more attacks if their leaders were not freed, and threatened in an e-mail message that it could hold the hostages for years, Reuters reported.]
 The political crisis has emerged from widespread speculation that Mr. Obasanjo will seek to alter the Constitution in order to run for a third term in 2007, a possibility that Mr. Obasanjo has not ruled out. The crisis has already upset the delicate ethnic and religious balance in national politics, with each group staking a what it believes is an ironclad right to claim the presidency. Nigeria, despite its history of dictatorial military rule within its borders, has long been an enforcer and guarantor of democracy in Africa, a role that Mr. Obasanjo has expanded. 
 Its troubles come at a time when the stakes for Africa could not be higher. With crucial elections scheduled in many countries this year and next, including Congo, Uganda, Ivory Coast and Nigeria, the fulcrum between democracy and good governance and autocracy and tyranny could shift significantly. 
 And so the prospect of new ferment in Nigeria could reverberate with deep and lasting impact.
 Nigeria's Nobel laureate and longtime pro-democracy agitator, Wole Soyinka, recently declared that he and his fellow activists must prepare to head ''back to the trenches'' of the struggle, so grave is the current threat. 
 ''Even the incurable optimists, as some of us are, are deeply worried,'' said Kayode Fayemi, director of the Center for Democracy and Development in Nigeria, a political scientist and longtime pro-democracy activist. ''Six years down the line in the attempt to build democracy this is what we get: violence in the land, and a government in breach. The only thing happening is politics. It is motion without movement.'' 
 Political violence of the type that preceded the country's elections in 1999 and 2003 appears to be on the rise as well. The wife of a prominent northern politician was found stabbed to death in her home. Nothing was taken from the house, according to Nigerian newspaper reports, leading many to conclude that her killing was a warning to her husband, Abubakar Rimi, a crucial member of a coalition of powerful northerners opposed to any extension of Mr. Obasanjo's rule. 
 Nigeria's vice president, Atiku Abubakar, a former general and northerner, would like to succeed Mr. Obasanjo, but the president has made it clear that he opposes that, and a deepening political row in the governing party has broken out over the succession question. 
 In the complex ethnic politics of Nigeria, factions have emerged in the People's Democratic Party urging that the presidency shift to a different ethnic group. Ruled for most of its history by Muslim generals from the north, Nigerians in the South-South, as the Niger Delta is known, say it is their turn, while northerners say that after two terms of Mr. Obasanjo, a Yoruba Christian from the southwest, they should get the presidency again. 
 The two crises are not entirely separate. The political confusion has created the space for delta militants seeking more local control over oil wealth to seize the national stage. Attacks on oil facilities and kidnappings have long been used to extort jobs, development projects and cash from oil companies, but the latest violence appears to be political in nature and pure sabotage, a worrying development, according to Sebastian Spio-Garbrah, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a private research firm. 
 Taken together, these situations pose a huge challenge for Nigeria as it enters a period of great uncertainty. Indeed, nearly 46 years after its independence, a period in which the country seesawed between civilian and military rule, the unity of Nigeria is still by no means assured. Though it is undoubtedly among the most powerful, wealthy and influential African nations -- South Africa is its only serious rival in this regard -- it has always struggled to make sense of its volatile mix of cultures, languages, religions and even landscapes. In its awesome diversity, it is the whole of Africa in microcosm.
 ''Nigerian unity is only a British invention,'' said the northern politician Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, in 1948, 12 years before independence made him Nigeria's first federal prime minister. 
 Of course a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then. The searing experience of the Biafran War, a brutal conflict in which Mr. Obasanjo played a crucial role in ending as a junior army officer, has long given Nigerians contemplating secession pause. And the discovery of oil in the 1950's in the delta has given Nigeria an economic logic for unity for decades. 
 Still, a report on the future of sub-Saharan Africa published by the National Intelligence Council, a government think tank for the United States intelligence services, after a conference on the topic last March, identified the collapse of Nigeria as the most important risk facing Africa today.
 ''While currently Nigeria's leaders are locked in a bad marriage that all dislike but dare not leave, there are possibilities that could disrupt the precarious equilibrium in Abuja,'' the report said. ''If Nigeria were to become a failed state, it could drag down a large part of the West African region.''
 ''Further,'' it continued, ''a failed Nigeria probably could not be reconstituted for many years -- if ever -- and not without massive international assistance.''
 Nevertheless, Nigeria has along history of ferment, but also a long history of pragmatism that has kept it together despite its troubles. 
 ''This is a very critical moment for Nigeria,'' Mr. Fayemi said. ''But we have a history of going to the edge, then pulling back from the brink.''

HEADLINE: Iraq's Power Vacuum

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman

 BODY:
In the State of the Union address, President Bush will surely assert, to choreographed applause, that he has a strategy for victory in Iraq. I don't believe him. In fact, I believe that three years into the conflict his administration refuses to admit defeat but has given up even trying to win.
 To explain myself, let me tell you some stories about electricity. 
Power shortages are a crucial issue for ordinary Iraqis, and for the credibility of their government. As Muhsin Shlash, Iraq's electricity minister, said last week, ''When you lose electricity the country is destroyed, nothing works, all industry is down and terrorist activity is increased.''
 Mr. Shlash has reason to be strident. In today's Iraq, blackouts are the rule rather than the exception. According to Agence France-Presse, Baghdad and ''much of the central regions'' -- in other words, the areas where the insurgency is most active and dangerous -- currently get only between two and six hours of power a day. 
 Lack of electricity isn't just an inconvenience. It prevents businesses from operating, destroys jobs and generates a sense of demoralization and rage that feeds the insurgency. 
 So why is power scarcer than ever, almost three years after Saddam's fall? Sabotage by insurgents is one factor. But as an analysis of Iraq's electricity shortage in The Los Angeles Times last month showed, the blackouts are also the result of some incredible missteps by U.S. officials. 
 Most notably, during the period when Iraq was run by U.S. officials, they decided to base their electricity plan on natural gas: in order to boost electrical output, American companies were hired to install gas-fired generators in power plants across Iraq. But, as The Los Angeles Times explains, ''pipelines needed to transport the gas'' -- that is, to supply gas to the new generators -- ''weren't built because Iraq's Oil Ministry, with U.S. encouragement, concentrated instead on boosting oil production.'' Whoops.
 Meanwhile, in the early days of the occupation U.S. officials chose not to raise the prices of electricity and fuel, which had been kept artificially cheap under Saddam, for fear of creating unrest. But as a first step toward their dream of turning Iraq into a free-market utopia, they removed tariffs and other restrictions on the purchase of imported consumer goods. 
 The result was that wealthy and middle-class Iraqis rushed to buy imported refrigerators, heaters and other power-hungry products, and the demand for electricity surged -- with no capacity available to meet that surge in demand. This caused even more blackouts.
 In short, U.S. officials thoroughly botched their handling of Iraq's electricity sector. They did much the same in the oil sector. But the Bush administration is determined to achieve victory in Iraq, so it must have a plan to rectify its errors, right?
 Um, no. Although there has been no formal declaration, all indications are that the Bush administration, which once made grand promises about a program to rebuild Iraq comparable to the Marshall Plan, doesn't plan to ask for any more money for Iraqi reconstruction. 
 Another Los Angeles Times report on Iraq reconstruction contains some jaw-dropping quotes from U.S. officials, who now seem to be lecturing the Iraqis on self-reliance. ''The world is a competitive place,'' declared the economics counselor at the U.S. embassy. ''No pain, no gain,'' said another official. ''We were never intending to rebuild Iraq,'' said a third. We came, we saw, we conquered, we messed up your infrastructure, we're outta here. 
 Mr. Shlash certainly sounds as if he's given up expecting more American help. ''The American donation is almost finished,'' he said, ''and it was not that effective.'' Yet he also emphasized the obvious: partly because of the similar failure of reconstruction in the oil sector, Iraq's government doesn't have the funds to do much power plant construction. In fact, it will be hard pressed to maintain the capacity it has, and protect that capacity from insurgent attacks.
 And if reconstruction stalls, as seems inevitable, it's hard to see how anything else in Iraq can go right.
 So what does it mean that the Bush administration is apparently walking away from responsibility for Iraq's reconstruction? It means that the administration doesn't have a plan; it's entirely focused on short-term political gain. Mr. Bush is just getting by from sound bite to sound bite, while Iraq and America sink ever deeper into the quagmire.

HEADLINE: Conservative Win in Canada Could Help Repair Ties to U.S.

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Unless every national poll here is amiss, what has been perhaps the world's winningest political party is heading toward a humiliating defeat on Monday.
 Stephen Harper, 46, an economist and social conservative who is writing a history of ice hockey, appears poised to lead his Conservative Party to victory over the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Paul Martin, something that seemed highly improbable just a few weeks ago. The Liberals won the last four national elections, governing Canada for 13 years -- as the party did for three-quarters of the past century.
But whether a Harper victory would represent a seismic shift, in a country that has long promoted itself as a beacon of social democracy and frequent critic of American foreign policy, remains an open question. If he cannot muster a majority in the House of Commons, Mr. Harper may lead a weak, unstable government opposed by three left-of-center parties represented in Parliament. 
 Mr. Harper -- in a campaign largely free of ideology -- promised to cut the national sales tax, grant families child care for preschoolers and introduce mandatory prison sentences. A longtime member of the House of Commons representing Alberta, he has a conservative record, but steered clear in recent months of promising major changes to the national health insurance program.
 The absence of strong ideological overtones would appear to make a Thatcherite-style revolution unlikely, even in the face of a strong Conservative showing. Mr. Harper even noted that judges appointed by Liberal governments and an appointed Senate filled with Liberals would serve as checks on his power.
 ''I'm basically a cautious person,'' Mr. Harper said in a recent speech. ''I believe it's better to light one candle than to promise a million light bulbs.''
 A change in Ottawa would almost certainly bring, at the least, a warming of relations with Washington, which have been strained since the American-led invasion of Iraq and have worsened over a series of recent trade disputes and Canadian moves to soften domestic drug laws.
 Mr. Harper, while careful not to appear overly supportive of President Bush, has suggested he would reconsider Canada's refusal to join the American missile defense program. He has also promised to increase military spending and make a bigger contribution to NATO and peacekeeping operations in places like Haiti and Afghanistan. But he also said recently that he had no intention of sending troops to Iraq.
 Mr. Martin, a former finance minister and shipping executive, has tried to emphasize the Liberal government's stewardship of the strong national economy, marked by low inflation and unemployment, a strengthening currency and a large budget surplus. He has promised to create a national child care program, expand aid grants to college students and ban handguns. 
 These are not unpopular stances, but the decline of Liberal fortunes is due less to any shift in Canadian public opinion than to two years of federal inquiries. Those investigations documented an embarrassing party money-laundering and campaign-finance scheme that had been devised to counter separatists after the close referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1995.
 Adding to the Liberal Party troubles, in the middle of the campaign, federal police investigators announced that they were looking into reports of possible Liberal government leaks of tax information to friendly investors that had spurred a flurry of insider trading.
 And in Quebec, once a bastion of Liberal support, the party's free fall quickened with the publication of a book documenting allegations that the federal government had laundered millions of dollars of illegal aid to a group opposing separatists during the referendum campaign.
 In recent weeks, the Liberals tried to recover votes with advertisements linking Mr. Harper to Mr. Bush, who is unpopular in Canada, and suggestions in speeches that Mr. Harper would attempt to reverse the legalization of same-sex marriage and abortion rights.
 ''A Harper victory will put a smile on George W. Bush's face,'' one Martin commercial said.
 Various national polls in the final days of the campaign showed the Conservatives about 10 points ahead of the Liberals, but the Conservatives could still fail to win a majority in the House of Commons.
 Mr. Harper leads a party that only three years ago merged a very conservative Canadian Alliance party with the much more moderate Progressive Conservative party.
 ''There are different factions and backgrounds and points of view in the Conservative coalition,'' noted Desmond Morton, a McGill University historian. It will not be easy to manage the factions, he said.
 Mr. Harper's greatest success so far has been his surprising breakthrough in socially liberal Quebec, by taking votes away from both the Liberals and the separatist Bloc Quebecois.

HEADLINE: Sailor's Case Reflects Shift In U.S. Image For Japanese

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
After a United States Navy sailor was confined on an American base near here, accused of the Jan. 3 beating death of a Japanese woman, 20 people held a protest at the base. One man held up a sign that read, in English, ''Dear Sailors, Don't Kill Local Women.'' 
 A decade ago, when three American servicemen were detained on an American base in Okinawa for the rape of a 12-year-old girl, 85,000 people marched one weekend, many demanding the expulsion of American bases from the island. 
The difference is only partly explained by the way the United States handled the two cases. In 1995, American officials were much slower to allow the Japanese to place an American in custody; this time the suspect was transferred as soon as a Japanese arrest warrant was issued. Another major factor is the change in Japanese attitudes toward the military alliance with the United States.
 In 1995, the cold war had only recently ended, and many Japanese expressed the belief that Japan no longer needed American troops. But the most recent case occurred days after Taro Aso, the foreign minister, warned that China was becoming ''a considerable threat.''
 Koji Murata, an international relations professor at Doshisha University, said: ''Japanese people are more and more concerned about China's economic and military rise, and North Korea. Japanese people are getting more and more realistic and think we have to sustain the military relation with the U.S.''
 Indeed, after a few days, coverage of the murder case had vanished from the Japanese news media. Instead, two Tokyo newspapers ran front-page photographs of Japanese Self-Defense Force soldiers and United States Marine Corps instructors practicing amphibious landings near San Diego. 
 ''Japanese media has changed its attitude,'' Tatsuya Yoshioka, director of Peace Boat, a private group devoted to reducing military tensions in the region. ''There is a completely hostile nationalism against North Korea and China that is promoted in the Japanese media, and on television.''
 In the fall of 1995, popular anger stewed in Okinawa as the three Americans suspected of rape were kept in American military custody for almost two months until there was a Japanese indictment. In March 1996, a Japanese court convicted the three Americans and gave them sentences ranging from six and a half to seven years. The sentences were served in a Japanese prison.
 Under the agreement regulating relations between Japan and the American military, the United States is not required to hand over American military personnel suspected of committing crimes off duty and off base without an indictment. But after the Okinawa rape case, the United States agreed to give ''sympathetic consideration'' to the early transfer of suspects of major crimes. 
 The suspect in the new case, William O. Reese, 21, was the fourth such transfer; he was transferred as soon as a Japanese arrest warrant was obtained, four days after the victim, Yoshie Sato, 56, died. She had a fractured skull and her purse was missing the equivalent of $131.
 The Navy allowed the transfer to be filmed for Japanese television.
 ''Transfer of custody is absolutely the right thing to do in this case,'' Rear Adm. James D. Kelly, commander of American naval forces in Japan, said in a statement. The United States military made other gestures. Admiral Kelly expressed regret and apologized to the victim's family.
 About 100 United States Navy officers and sailors attended a wake for Ms. Sato. Admiral Kelly and Capt. Ed McNamee, commander of the Kitty Hawk, the aircraft carrier where the sailor was billeted, burned incense in her memory.
 In Tokyo, the American Embassy promised close cooperation with Japanese authorities. Ambassador J. Thomas Schieffer expressed his ''personal sorrow and outrage about the uncivilized behavior that resulted in the death of Ms. Yoshie Sato.''
 Some analysts note the gap between attitudes in Yokosuka, the city where the sailor is based, and those in Okinawa. Yokosuka is 30 miles from downtown Tokyo and is the home district of the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, who is vigorously pro-American. In contrast, Okinawa has long resented the fact that about half the Americans based in Japan, currently about 50,000, are stationed there.

WHITHER FORD? -- Ford Motor's ''Way Forward,'' the revamping plan it is scheduled to unveil today, may leave lots of workers behind. It is likely to involve tens of thousands of layoffs and the closure of several plants. Ford is under extra pressure to make changes after General Motors' reorganizational plan, disclosed in November, failed to impress Wall Street. Ford's earnings report, also due out today, may be less painful: William Clay Ford Jr., right, the company's chairman and chief executive, said at Detroit's auto show that it would report a profit for 2005. 


BONANZA OF EARNINGS REPORTS -- Along with Ford, several big-name companies are set to release earnings reports this week, starting today with American Express and Bank of America. Watch for Johnson & Johnson, McDonald's and Sun Microsystems tomorrow; BellSouth and ConocoPhillips on Wednesday; G.M. and Microsoft on Thursday; and Chevron on Friday, among others.

MOUNTAIN TALKFEST -- Corporate chieftains, government ministers and protesters will gather at Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, which begins Wednesday. In a new twist this year, the group plans to offer podcasts of some discussions, which will be available for downloading from its Web site at www.weforum.org.

SALSA FOR SALE -- McDonald's plans to spin off its Chipotle Mexican Grill chain this week in an initial public offering that could raise $144 million. The stock is expected to start trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The ''fast casual'' chain has 489 outlets and is growing quickly. The week's biggest offering is likely to be the one from Resource Capital, a real estate investment trust that is also set to make its debut on Wednesday.

THE BIDDING GOES ON -- Johnson & Johnson faces a deadline tomorrow to raise its bid for the Guidant Corporation, the medical device maker. Boston Scientific, with help from Abbott Laboratories, offered $80 a share for Guidant last week, topping Johnson & Johnson's bid of $73 a share. Analysts say that Johnson & Johnson is unlikely to let Guidant slip away despite Guidant's problems with defective products and recalls, and that it could raise its bid as soon as today.

EYEING NEMO -- Walt Disney's board holds a regularly scheduled meeting today amid talk that the company is negotiating to buy Pixar Animation Studios, the animation factory whose movies have come to outshine Disney's own cartoon creations. ''Cars,'' the last Pixar film to be released under a distribution deal that the company has with Disney, is due out this summer.

ECONOMIC WATCH -- The major economic release of the week will come on Friday with the first look at the gross domestic product for the fourth quarter. Several numbers for December are scheduled to be released: existing home sales on Wednesday, durable goods orders on Thursday and new home sales on Friday.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Market Merchants Sue to Keep New Neighbor Out

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Merchants at a South Bronx wholesale market that is a major supplier of the New York region's fruits and vegetables have sued the city, trying to stop a produce company's planned move to a city-owned site across the street. 
 Baldor Specialty Foods, one of the Northeast's largest importers and distributors of produce, intends to move this summer to a 12.8-acre Hunts Point site that includes a 185,000-square-foot refrigerated warehouse and distribution building.
 The site, at 155 Food Center Drive, is outside the exit gate of the produce market, known as the Hunts Point Terminal Market. The market receives produce daily from around the world and is part of the city's wholesale food distribution center in Hunts Point, where city officials say more than 130 wholesalers generate annual revenues of more than $3 billion.
 In court documents filed last week in the State Supreme Court in the Bronx, lawyers for the produce market's merchant cooperative say that the city's Economic Development Corporation illegally awarded Baldor, a nonunion company, a lease for the site and that it threatens the cooperative's roughly 50 family-owned businesses.
 ''Having another major produce business in the cooperative's very backyard would prove crippling to the cooperative's members' businesses, and, given the cooperative's long-term investment in the terminal market and its facility, this blow will be particularly devastating,'' said the lawyers, Randy M. Mastro and Cynthia S. Arato.
 A lawyer for Baldor, which was also named in the suit, said in a statement that the case was without merit. ''Hunts Point Terminal Market is asking the court to halt the expansion of a business that now employs more than 500 people and will hire more than 300 additional workers to its payroll as a result of the move to new headquarters,'' said the lawyer, Kevin McGrath.
 A spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation and a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said yesterday they could not comment on pending litigation. A spokesman for the merchants' cooperative also declined to comment. A judge has scheduled a hearing today on the case.
 A lawyer for the merchants, Mr. Mastro, also represented Laro Service Systems, the company whose lawsuit against the city delayed for months the Fulton Fish Market's relocation from Manhattan to its new home in Hunts Point.
 Members and supporters of Teamsters Local 202, the union that represents drivers and warehouse workers at the produce market, demonstrated on Friday outside Baldor's South Bronx headquarters. They said that the company paid substandard wages and that it fired two workers who had attempted to organize a union. 
 In a statement, Baldor denied the allegations and said that it offered better wages and benefits than the union.
 The two sides held rival rallies. A group of Baldor workers stood on the loading docks wearing antiunion T-shirts, a hand-painted banner fastened to the top of the red-brick building declaring, ''Proud to be union-free.'' 
 Meanwhile, passing trucks honked in support of union members, who wore signs hanging from their necks with messages like ''Baldor drivers deserve respect!!''

HEADLINE: Slight Rise in Leading Index Points to Moderate Growth 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A closely watched gauge of future economic activity edged higher in December, pointing to continued but perhaps uneven growth in the year ahead, a private research group said yesterday.
 The group, the Conference Board in New York, said that its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent last month, smaller than the 0.2 percent gain forecast by analysts. The December increase came after gains of 0.9 percent in November and 1.0 percent in October, both of which were revised upward. 
 The three consecutive monthly increases suggest that the economy is likely to expand moderately in the near term and, perhaps, slow later in the year, the board and analysts said.
 ''What it tells us is that we may see a bit of an easing off of economic growth or momentum,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan Private Client Services. ''But even though the trajectory of growth may, in fact, ease a bit in 2006, I think the expansion remains intact.''
 Another economist, Patrick Fearon of A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said the report was consistent with an economy that was likely to grow at an average pace.
 The leading index's increase in December reflected improvements in 6 of its 10 components, including consumer expectations, money supply, stock prices, first-time claims for jobless benefits, the interest rate spread and new orders to manufacturers for consumer goods.
 In addition to the improvement in the leading index, the board's coincident index -- which measures the current economy -- also improved, gaining 0.2 percent, after a 0.4 percent increase in November.
 Its lagging index, which measures past activity, also gained, increasing 0.1 percent in December. The lagging index had increased 0.5 percent in November.
 The small gain in the leading index last month may reflect softening in manufacturing and its slowing effect on the economy, although that appears to be limited to the auto sector, said Mr. Fearon of A. G. Edwards.
 Mr. Chan said the small increase suggested that economic growth had moderated for much of the past year, after a particularly robust expansion in 2004. That will continue, he said, as consumers and businesses pay more to borrow money and purchase fuel.
 ''With all this as a backdrop -- with the Fed raising rates and energy prices rising -- it is no secret that the outcome is likely to be slower growth,'' he said.

HEADLINE: One Booming Business in Gaza: Tunneling for the Gunrunners 

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: RAFAH, Gaza Strip 

 BODY:
Yasser Qishta, 25, shows a visitor into his near-finished house, a two-story cinderblock structure with a pristine, pastel interior, all new paint and gleaming ceramic tile. The house cost him $32,000, a fortune for a man of his age in the Gaza Strip's troubled economy.
 The house tells everyone in the neighborhood what he has been up to: burrowing beneath the border to help bring illegal arms into the Gaza Strip.
''I risked my life, but now I can afford to get married,'' Mr. Qishta said in a deep, resonant voice, sitting on a rug and serving coffee. 
 With Palestinian parliamentary elections on Jan. 25 and Israeli ones in March, the unraveling of public order in Gaza has become a central issue in both societies. Dozens of tunnels have been dug between the Gaza Strip and Egypt in the last quarter century, and through them have come most of the weapons that fill this narrow Palestinian territory, threatening Israel and Palestinians themselves.
 The gunrunning has actually slowed somewhat since Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip in September because weapons flooded across the border immediately after Israel's departure, depressing prices.
 People involved in the trade say activity will pick up again if fighting breaks out between Palestinian factions or if there are renewed conflicts with Israel, as everyone here expects.
 Yuval Steinitz, chairman of the Israeli Parliament's foreign affairs and defense committee, said 12,000 guns, several hundred antitank-rocket launchers, thousands of antitank rockets, tons of explosives and possibly even some shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles have entered the Gaza Strip over the last year, primarily through the tunnels.
 ''We're not talking about weapons for terrorism but about weapons for an army,'' he said by telephone from Jerusalem.
 ''Some of the tunnels were financed by the Palestinian Authority itself, and some of the weapons smuggled through them were bought by the P.A., although most of them went to Hamas, Islamic Jihad or other terrorist organizations,'' Mr. Steinitz added. 
 He complained that Egypt, too, bore responsibility. ''The smuggling doesn't begin in the tunnels,'' he said. ''Egypt is doing to Israel exactly what Syria is doing to the Americans in Iraq, putting troops on the border and then succeeding not to succeed.''
 He said that Israel asked both Egypt and Jordan to stop weapons smuggling into the Palestinian areas five years ago and that Jordan, with a longer border and larger domestic Palestinian population, had managed to do so. ''But Egypt did almost nothing, and today 90 percent of the Palestinians' weapons and arms are coming from Egypt,'' Mr. Steinitz said.
 Since the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement last year promising to police the border more vigilantly if Israel stopped destroying houses, the Palestinian's Preventative Security Service has filled more than 10 tunnels with concrete. But people involved with the tunnels said the Palestinian Authority's ability to close all of the tunnels was limited because of the militia's greater firepower.
 The first smuggling tunnel was dug in 1982 after the border fence left extended families split between the Gaza Strip and Egypt when the border was re-established upon Israel's withdrawal from Sinai. The tunnels were used primarily to smuggle cigarettes, hashish, gold and car parts in those days, residents say.
 But after the first intifada broke out in late 1987, the tunnels were also used to smuggle weapons and people who were wanted by the Israelis.
 The first tunnels were about 200 feet long, dug from house to house under the twin border fences and the ''Philadelphi'' patrol road that ran between them. In those days, the houses were close enough to the fences that the families could shout to one another across the Israeli-patrolled no man's land.
 But after Israel began destroying houses from which the tunnels started on the Palestinian side and Egypt, too, began cracking down, the narrow tunnels grew longer and longer, some eventually reaching three-quarters of a mile.
 The activity increased during the second intifada of 2000 when the incentive for taking such risks was high: a Kalashnikov that cost $500 in Egypt fetched as much as $2,500 in the Gaza Strip at the time. Each shipment included hundreds of guns.
 People with no smuggling experience joined in and charged smugglers a fee for using the tunnels. One Rafah resident involved in the tunneling estimated that as many as 30 main tunnels snaked beneath the border. Others put the number even higher. As Israel destroyed the tunnel entrances, other people burrowed new channels to what remained of the existing tunnels from houses farther away.
 In the beginning, the tunnels started from both sides, each team heading at an angle -- northeast from Egypt, for example, southwest from Gaza -- digging in the soft sand just beneath the region's sedimentary layer of hard clay that formed the tunnels' natural ceiling. eventually, the two channels crossed.
 Since Egypt began cracking down, though, the tunnels have been dug from the Palestinian side, heading several hundred yards into Egyptian territory before surfacing in a pasture or olive grove. The tunnelers send up a pipe for their accomplices in Egypt to locate and break open the tunnel's ''eye'' from below with a car jack at night when the shipment is ready.
 The tunnels are used only a handful of times before they are abandoned because of the quickly increasing risk of getting caught once it is opened on the Egyptian side.
 Israel tried to foil the tunneling by installing an 25-foot concrete or iron wall along the border that extends 10 feet underground. But the tunnels are typically 20 to 65 feet deep. It also used sonar and other sensors to hunt for the tunnels, occasionally setting off charges in the ground to cause undiscovered tunnels to collapse.
 Now, with the Israelis gone, evidence of those tunnels is not hard to find among the bullet-hole peppered houses facing the border and in the collapsed concrete and rebar remains of the destroyed homes. Another member of Mr. Qishta's clan -- the largest of those living here along the border -- recently led a visitor through the wreckage, pointing out rubble-filled tunnel openings.
 Mr. Qishta said he had been earning less than $10 a day working on construction sites for his father when a friend recruited him to help dig a tunnel in June 2003.
 ''He told me that I was going to disappear, that I couldn't even tell my father,'' recalled Mr. Qishta, a tall, muscular man with a short, sandy-colored beard. Tunnel workers often remain in hiding for the months it takes to finish because neighbors who discover the digging may demand a share of the profits to keep quiet.
 His cousin said there were many telltale signs that tip people off, including the smell of clay, traces of sand indoors or dirt under fingernails.
 It is a claustrophobic, dangerous business, with the tunnels only large enough for a slight man to squat in. About 250 yards into the project, Mr. Qishta said, he was almost buried alive in a partial collapse while drilling upward. A colleague dug him out.
 Many others have not been so lucky. In 2001, two brothers, Suleiman and Muhammad el-Sharr, hit a 50-inch water pipe while drilling toward the surface.
 The rush of water collapsed the tunnel, burying them in mud. Their mother, with a dirty apron over her robe and a white knit shawl over her head, said that it took three days to get the bodies out. 
 That tunnel ran hundreds of yards into Egypt and was particularly deep, 50 feet in some places. Members of the family say it was intended to move tons of arms into the Gaza Strip, including Katyusha rockets, mines, mortars, grenades and assault rifles. The weapons were later seized in the Red Sea aboard a ship named the Karine A before they could reach Egypt.
 The seizure of the Karine A was a turning point in the West's post-Oslo disenchantment with the Palestinian Authority under Yasir Arafat, which was clearly implicated in the shipment. The captain of the ship was an employee of the Palestinian Authority's transport ministry, and the man behind the tunnel is now a captain in the Palestinian security forces.
 Mr. Qishta said his team had continued well beyond the border before digging upward in Egypt. In May 2004, they finally opened the ''eye'' and brought four shipments into the Gaza Strip, totaling 900 Kalashnikovs, 400 handguns and 200,000 rounds of ammunition.
 The guns, tied into bundles and packed in empty flour sacks, were pulled through the tunnel with the same cables and electrical motors that the tunnelers had used to remove the sand while they were digging. Each shipment took about an hour to move through the tunnel.
 ''Everyone got $23,000 and a Kalashnikov,'' Mr. Qishta said, adding that the tunnel's initial investor made $150,000. Mr. Qishta said he had sold the gun and last year worked briefly on another tunnel that netted him $5,000. He has been asked to work on other tunnels, but said he did not want to press his luck and has gone back to work for his father instead.

HEADLINE: German Steel Maker Won't Raise Canadian Bid 

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
ThyssenKrupp, the German steel company, said Monday that it would not increase its offer for Dofasco, the Canadian steel maker, a move that suggested that Dofasco would probably be acquired by Arcelor of Luxembourg. 
 While pulling back from the intense bidding war, ThyssenKrupp still stands to be rewarded for its efforts.
With Arcelor currently offering 71 Canadian dollars a share ($61) for Dofasco, analysts expect that the ThyssenKrupp offer of 68 Canadian dollars will expire as scheduled on Thursday.
 On Monday evening, Dofasco's board said in a statement that it was formally ending its agreement with ThyssenKrupp. The decision means that Dofasco must pay a breakup fee of 215 million Canadian dollars ($187 million) to ThyssenKrupp.
 While Dofasco, which is profitable and a major supplier to Japanese and American automakers, would have been a good fit for either of the European bidders, an enhanced offer from ThyssenKrupp would have brought negative financial consequences. 
 After Arcelor raised its hostile bid for the third time, to 71 Canadian dollars, the rating agency Standard & Poor's warned that ThyssenKrupp would risk a downgrade in its own credit ratings if it increased its offer.
 In a statement issued Monday, ThyssenKrupp said increasing its offer ''would go beyond the point of creating economic value.''
 While Dofasco's board originally solicited a bid from ThyssenKrupp to block Arcelor, it has declared Arcelor's current offer to be superior.
 ''Even 68 dollars was a surprise, let alone 71,'' said John Hughes, a steel analyst with Desjardins Securities in Toronto. ''But 68 dollars was as much as ThyssenKrupp's balance sheet could support.''
 The richness of Arcelor's offer, Mr. Hughes added, makes it unlikely that any other company will bid, despite Dofasco's decade-long history of profitability and its reputation for sound management and innovative, high-margin products.
 Assuming Arcelor acquires Dofasco, it will pay about 5.5 billion Canadian dollars ($4.8 billion). Last spring it made an informal joint bid with Nucor of Charlotte, N.C., valued at 43 Canadian dollars a share.
 Mr. Hughes said that Dofasco's management, whose future is not certain under Arcelor's control, has a plan that could reduce the European company's acquisition costs. 
 Before Arcelor's initial bid in November, Dofasco had been planning to offer 70 percent of its iron ore mine as an income trust, a Canadian financial vehicle that pays out most of a company's earnings to unit holders and avoids most corporate taxes. 
 Completing that plan would raise about 1 billion Canadian dollars, Mr. Hughes estimated.

HEADLINE: FORD ELIMINATING UP TO 30,000 JOBS AND 14 FACTORIES

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Jan. 23 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said Monday that it would close as many as 14 factories and cut up to 30,000 jobs over the next six years. It was the latest move in a fundamental restructuring of Detroit's traditional auto companies, hit hard by foreign competitors, who have taken more than 40 percent of the American market.
 The moves by Ford, the second-largest automaker in the United States, come two months after General Motors, the industry leader, said it would close all or part of a dozen factories and eliminate a similar number of jobs.
Including cuts that took place at the Chrysler Corporation, the Big Three automakers have eliminated or announced plans to eliminate nearly 140,000 jobs since 2000, including salaried positions. That is about one-third of their North American payroll, a rollback to a work force size not seen since the end of World War II. ''This may not be the end, but it is certainly the beginning of the end of the automobile industry as we knew it,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. 
 While the Big Three are visibly shrinking, their combined moves do not spell the end of automotive manufacturing in the United States. But the geographic footprint has largely shifted south, where a new auto industry is flourishing. 
 Japanese, German and South Korean companies now employ 60,000 people, or about the same number by which Ford and G.M. have said they will shrink. But foreign makers are creating a younger, cheaper work force, sidestepping Detroit's unemployed and the higher pay and benefits packages that Detroit workers were getting. 
 The United Automobile Workers union, which represents workers in the United States, said the announcement by Ford was ''deeply disappointing and devastating'' for its members. The cutbacks signal a new reality for auto workers -- one in which $30-an-hour wages and generous benefits are no longer a guarantee. [Page C1.]
 Ford's share price closed up 42 cents, at $8.32, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The cuts at Ford are taking place under a turnaround plan it is calling the Way Forward, marking its second attempt to revamp the company in the last four years. Ford's goal is to become as nimble as Toyota and Honda, cutting through layers of bureaucracy that have stymied the development of innovative vehicles like hybrid electric cars. It also highlights Ford's American roots and aims to create clearer identities for its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands. 
 Rising gas and steel prices and strong competition from abroad have intensified the challenge to Ford and G.M., already burdened by rising health care costs and a legacy of promising rich pension packages and other retirement benefits. More important, both companies have failed to find the right formulas to satisfy the American car buyer. 
 The result has been a swift slide in market share. Ford, which held about 25 percent of the car market in 2000, held only 17.4 percent in 2005. Much of the drop is a result of the decline in popularity of big sport utilities, which fueled profits and market share at Ford during the 1990's, when it had about 100,000 hourly workers. 
 Monday's cuts at Ford affect about a third of its hourly payroll in North America, where it has 87,000 workers. The company is also cutting another 4,000 salaried employees, or about 10 percent of its white-collar force, and has pledged to reduce its executive ranks by 12 percent.
 Foreign manufacturers, who now sell more than 4 of every 10 cars and trucks in the United States, have created tens of thousands of jobs at new factories from Ontario to Ohio, across the South and in Mexico.
 Because of their growth, there has been no net loss in American automotive jobs over the last 10 years, according to James P. Womack, an author and specialist in manufacturing efficiency. Auto industry employment has held steady at about 1.1 million workers, including those at parts companies, he said.
 In fact, those foreign companies, which collectively employed about 60,000 workers at the North American plants last year, are expanding their factories. Later this year, Toyota will open a new truck plant in San Antonio, and it is building another factory in Ontario. 
 Earlier this month, Nissan's chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, who became a management model for leading his company's successful turnaround during the last six years, said Nissan might expand its two-year-old factory in Canton, Miss. 
 While foreign automakers have hired some former Detroit workers, most of their workers have no automotive experience and were chosen through rigorous screening processes that stress physical endurance and a bent for working in teams.
 With a smaller market share, Ford has its plants in North America operating at only three-quarters capacity, sparking the company's decision Monday to close assembly plants in Wixom, Mich., outside Detroit; Hapeville, Ga., outside Atlanta; and Hazelwood, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. 
 Two more assembly plants will close, Ford said, although it did not name them. The auto company is also shutting a transmission plant in Batavia, Ohio, near Cincinnati, and analysts said they expected that other Ford parts plants would also shut once the company decided which assembly plants to close.
 Ford is also cutting one shift of workers at its plant in St. Thomas, Ontario, two hours west of Toronto. 
 Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., called the cuts ''a painful last resort.'' But he said the company's plan contained ''the vision and strategic focus to rebuild the business.''
 ''With it,'' Mr. Ford said, ''we will retake the American roadway.''
 Mr. Ford, who unveiled the earlier transformation program in 2002, shortly after he installed himself as chief executive, said that plan had achieved its goals but was not enough in the face of stiff foreign competition.
 ''We will not stand for business as usual,'' Mr. Ford said.
 But Ford held out hope for some workers, saying that it planned to create a new factory somewhere in North America to build small cars at a low cost. Ford executives declined to say when the plant would be built -- or whether it planned to employ unionized workers in the United States or Canada. 
 The idea seemed an echo of G.M.'s original intent with the Saturn Corporation, whose plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., was meant to prove that American workers could build cars that could compete with Japanese autos. 
 In fact, Saturn's vehicles lured buyers away from Toyota and Honda in the early 1990's, when the cars were first on sale. But Saturn cars subsequently declined in popularity after G.M. decided to focus more attention on developing S.U.V.'s. 
 And although G.M. is trying to rejuvenate Saturn, it announced last year that it would close an assembly line at Spring Hill, placing the plant's long-term future in doubt.
 Ford's announcement of the Way Forward plan on Monday ended weeks of speculation that it would eliminate some product lines. But on Monday, Ford declined to comment on specific vehicles. 
 Shortly before it outlined the program on Monday, Ford said it lost $1 billion before taxes on its automotive operations in 2005, up from an $850 million loss in 2004. It posted a full-year profit of $2 billion, down from $3.5 billion in 2004, but its third consecutive annual profit. It has managed to keep making money across the board because of good results overseas and the strength of its financial services division.
 But in December, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services cut its rating on Ford's debt two notches deeper into junk, just as S.& P. did at G.M. after it unveiled its reorganizing plan.
 S.& P. warned that Ford was particularlyvulnerable to steps that G.M. might take to improve its market share, like the steep employee discounts it offered consumers last summer. But the ratings agency, which warned that G.M. could be forced to restructure under Chapter 11 protection, said it was not concerned that Ford would have to do so.
 One reason, analysts said, is that the Ford family, which controls the company through a special class of stock, would do everything to prevent such a move. 
 On Monday, Mr. Ford's cousins, Edsel B. Ford II and Elena Ford, looked on as Mr. Ford invoked his great-grandfather, Henry Ford, in an effort to encourage Ford employees to be more innovative.
 Mr. Ford recalled that Henry Ford built his first car in a shed behind his Detroit house, only to realize it was too big to get out the door. Instead, Mr. Ford said, his great-grandfather knocked down a wall to drive it out.
 ''We intend to remind people every day that if you want to build something that's never been built before, you may have to knock down a wall or two,'' Mr. Ford said.
 But Wall Street was looking to Mr. Ford for more specifics than the company provided in an hourlong presentation. Ford officials, in fact, said the automaker would no longer issue annual earnings guidance to analysts -- a sharp departure from Ford's past practice of stating its goals in advance.
 Indeed, the company said Monday only that it expected to be profitable on its automotive operations in 2008, meaning it would lose money on them this year and next. 
 Mark Fields, recently named president of Ford's operations for the Americas, who was the author of the Way Forward plan, also said that Ford meant to stabilize its declining market share, and eventually gain sales. But he did not say when that would happen or what share of the American market Ford eventually expected to hold.
 Ford's refusal to give more details on its plant closing plans and financial targets was a contrast to the clearly defined outline at Nissan by Mr. Ghosn, the Renault executive who took over the company in 1999.
 Nissan either met or exceeded the goals in three programs outlined by Mr. Ghosn, who vowed six years ago to resign if the company could not achieve its targets. 
 On Monday, Mr. Fields said in an interview that he was approaching his job ''as if my job is on the line.''
 ''Hopefully, if we're successful,'' Mr. Fields added, ''I'll share in the rewards, and if not, I'll share in the ramifications.''

HEADLINE: Canadian Voters Oust Incumbent For Conservative

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Stephen Harper and his Conservative Party defeated the long entrenched Liberal Party in Canadian elections on Monday. A Conservative victory is a striking turn in the country's politics and is likely to improve Canada's strained relations with the Bush administration.
 Prime Minister Paul Martin had hoped to build on a string of four consecutive Liberal national election victories in the past 13 years, but his campaign was damaged by two years of investigations into party scandals that spurred a backlash and a desire for change. 
 Mr. Martin tried to cut into Mr. Harper's lead in the final days with a campaign of rancorous advertising, as opinion polls indicated that many urban voters were wary of allowing the country to veer into uncharted ideological waters.
 But in the end, Mr. Harper seemed to reassure the public that he had evolved into a centrist in recent years and that his government would emphasize cutting taxes and cleaning up corruption, rather than social issues like abortion and gay rights.
 In a concession speech, Mr. Martin announced that he would leave the party leadership before the next national election. ''I telephoned Stephen Harper and congratulated him on being chosen by the people of Canada,'' he said. ''We differ on many things, but we all share the belief of the potential and the promise of Canada and the desire of our country to succeed.''
 Preliminary data showed that the Conservatives won more than 36 percent of the popular vote, and fell short of a majority in the 308-seat House of Commons. 
 Incomplete results showed the Conservatives leading in 125 districts to 102 for the Liberals, followed by the Bloc Quebecois with 51 districts and the labor-aligned New Democratic Party with 29. One independent candidate won.
 The Bloc Quebecois fell well short of its goal of winning a symbolically important majority in Quebec because of the Conservative gains. The Conservatives showed strength across the country, but particularly in rural and suburban areas. 
 Mr. Harper, 46, is a free-market economist who expressed strong support for Washington at the time of the American-led invasion of Iraq and shares the Bush administration's skepticism of the Kyoto climate control protocol, which Canada has signed and ratified. His party was formed three years ago as a coalition of two conservative parties.
 Such positions are in sharp contrast with those of Prime Minister Martin, who rejected cooperation with President Bush's missile defense program, ratcheted up criticism of American trade policies and caustically criticized Washington during the campaign for not supporting the Kyoto protocol.
 Mr. Harper did not emphasize his closeness to the Bush administration during the campaign, and there was no indication that Canadians had suddenly embraced American foreign policy. Mr. Harper pointedly promised not to send Canadian troops to Iraq, and said he would be a tough bargainer in trade talks with the United States. 
 But he did promise $5 billion in new military spending, which would go to forming a new airborne battalion and buying large transport aircraft to airlift troops and supplies during world crises. 
 By falling far short of winning a clear majority in the House of Commons, Mr. Harper may lead a shaky government and could face another national election within two years.
 He will probably have to compromise with lawmakers from three left-of-center parties to pass legislation and remain in power. But in foreign policy the prime minister has broad powers, and he is expected to reach out quickly to Washington to improve a relationship that has been declining since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Canada opposed.
 ''It is in the DNA of this Harper government to improve the relationship with Washington,'' Janice Stein, director of the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto, said before the vote was counted.''
 In domestic affairs, Mr. Harper promised to provide allowances to families with children under age 6 to help with child care, to introduce mandatory prison sentences for serious drug trafficking and gun crimes, to reduce the national sales tax and to provide tax breaks for retirees.
 Mr. Martin promised a vast government-financed child care program, tax cuts for the middle class and a ban on handguns, and said he was committed to cleaning up pollution in the Great Lakes. He emphasized the period of prosperity and social peace under the recent Liberal governments.
 But as Mr. Martin fell behind in the opinion polls, his campaign came to rely on attack advertisements that were unusually caustic for Canada. He tried to depict Mr. Harper as a fanatical American-style conservative and an ally of President Bush, who is unpopular in Canada. The campaign lasted two months, unusually long for Canada, because of holidays. But a turning point came on Boxing Day, the day after Christmas, during a break in the campaigning, when an innocent 15-year-old girl and six others were wounded in a shootout between two gangs in downtown Toronto.
 That unusual appearance of public lawlessness was followed by hints of lawlessness within the government. On Dec. 28, the federal police announced that they were opening a criminal investigation of what appeared to be a flurry of insider trading, set off by what some suspect were leaks from the Finance Ministry about changes in taxes on dividends and income trusts.
 '' The biggest surprise of the campaign was the breakthrough Mr. Harper made in Quebec, where the Conservatives have been weak for a generation. By taking votes from the Bloc Quebecois, he dealt a blow to a sovereignty movement that had been rebounding on a wave of anger over Liberal scandals.
 ''That there is a room for a new federalist voice in Quebec is a Rubicon,'' said Antonia Maioni, a political scientist at McGill University.

HEADLINE: Drawing a Line in the Living Room Carpet Over Enlistment

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Despite the innocuous title, inspired by a Bill Withers song, Leslie Ayvazian's ''Lovely Day'' purports to have serious matters on its mind. The play, which opened Sunday at the Beckett Theater on Theater Row, charts the rift that grows between a heretofore contented middle-aged man and wife when an Army recruiter comes to visit their son's high school, bringing to the fore their widely divergent views on politics of both the global and gender flavors.
 It's a promising seed for a drama, but Ms. Ayvazian, an actress and playwright probably best known for her autobiographical comedy ''Nine Armenians,'' doesn't exactly pile on the fertilizer. She wanders loosely around the subject for about half the play's brief length (less than 90 minutes), beginning with a terminally uninteresting opening scene in which conversation focuses on the rearrangement of furniture in the living room and the straightening of a picture in the hall. 
Deirdre O'Connell plays the distracted Fran, a gentle soul whose idea of taking an activist stand against the American involvement in Iraq is pretty literal-minded. She joins similarly sympathetic locals standing around town at impromptu prayer vigils in strip-mall parking lots.
 Her intellectual response to the general conundrum of war is hardly more active, calling as it does for the global equivalent of a children's time-out: ''If we as a world could commit to no words for a period of time, even a small period of time, maybe then there might be room for the much-needed miracle,'' she tells her husband, Martin.
 An ex-Army officer played with a proper stolidity by David Rasche, Martin benignly tries to avoid engaging with Fran when her maternal instincts spur a renewal of her antiwar agitations. But Martin, too, favors big, bland, blunt statements, albeit from a radically opposed perspective: ''As Americans, we have one value and it's freedom, democracy,'' he says. ''We believe our system is best because it is. And we believe that if it's threatened, we must destroy whoever's threatening it.''
 Whether Fran's anxieties spring from any practical basis is never made clear. The couple's son, Brian, played with an odd, elfin smile by Javier Picayo, evinces no particular attitude toward the recruiting officer -- or indeed anything -- and there is never any sense that the family's economic status (Martin is in the graphic-design business) would truly necessitate Brian's enlistment as an escape route from a life of limited possibility.
 In fact, Ms. Ayvazian's listless play, directed a little bumpily by the actress Blair Brown, making her New York directing debut (better luck next time), leaves much in obscurity. It's hard to reckon, for one, how a man and a woman with such profoundly opposed viewpoints on matters of life and death could live in harmony for so many years.
 By the play's end the family equilibrium is on the brink of shattering, of course. But when the troubled couple at last settle down to plumb the depths of the emotional chasm that yawns between them, we are treated to more remarkably unilluminating, artificially polarized debates about the morality of war. Can we get back to the subject of that pesky ottoman, please?

HEADLINE: Rock Fans, Sit Back, Relax, Enjoy The Show

BYLINE: By MARC WEINGARTEN

 BODY:
In this digital age of expanding leisure options, some old-school ideas still have staying power. Take the very 1970's concept of music fans' attending movie theaters to watch their favorite rock stars on the big screen. It's mounting something of a comeback, as illustrated by a one-night-only event in 115 theaters across the country: a showing tonight of ''Coachella,'' a documentary highlighting six years of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif.
 Of course, there was a time when rock 'n' roll movies were a big deal. The three-hour film of the 1969 Woodstock music festival won the Academy Award for best documentary, and everyone from Pink Floyd (the 1972 ''Live at Pompeii'') to the Grateful Dead (the 1977 ''Grateful Dead Movie'') produced concert films for theatrical delectation in the pre-MTV 70's. For the price of a movie ticket, music fans could experience their favorite rock stars at the local multiplex much as they experienced Luke Skywalker. But the concert films in theaters more or less died with the advent of cable television in the late 70's, as well as the explosion of the video rental business. 
Apparently you can't keep a good idea down for long. The exhibitor behind ''Coachella'' and other recent concert films, Big Screen Concerts, is seeking an elegant solution to a nagging problem: how to fill those thousands of theater seats that tend to collect dust during the dormant preweekend lull, especially with overall ticket sales down by more than 10 percent last year. 
 ''The idea came from trying to figure out what types of content, other than movies, might bring people into the theater from Monday to Thursday,'' said Kurt Hall, chief executive of National CineMedia, a joint venture of the theater behemoths Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark USA that includes Big Screen Concerts among its divisions. ''There is a 75 percent drop-off in movie attendance during the week, yet it seems that there's always an urge among people to get out of the house.'' 
 Especially grown-up music fans, Mr. Hall said, who are well past the age of jostling for position at the foot of the stage with other fans who tenuously cling to sloshing Styrofoam cups of beer. ''Older folks don't want to deal with the hassle of rock concerts,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Also, movie theaters provide a safe environment for parents to experience rock shows with their kids.'' 
 With access to more than 13,000 screens, Big Screen Concerts offers an enticing chance for music labels to reach tens of thousands of engaged fans with one big, surround-sound bang. The company uses a closed digital network to distribute via satellite its concert events, which thus far have either been live concerts or pretaped promotional events for upcoming DVD releases. Among the more notable over the last year were a DVD screening of a Bruce Springsteen concert from 1975 to coincide with the release of Mr. Springsteen's ''Born to Run'' 30th-anniversary box set; a live Bon Jovi concert in September transmitted from the Nokia Theater in Manhattan, which helped the New Jersey band sell more units of its album ''Have a Nice Day'' in its first week of release than any other album in the band's 23-year history. Big Screen Concerts also distributed the jam band Phish's final two shows at the Coventry festival in Vermont in April, beamed via live simulcast to 40,000 fans in theaters in 54 cities. 
 Fans pay $10 and up for the privilege of viewing the digital events, depending on the economics of the event. (Phish, at $20, has been the top-tier ticket thus far.) 
 For participating artists, the appeal of Big Screen Concerts isn't too hard to fathom. For one thing, a touring band can extend its reach beyond the cities that might be on its itinerary, or perhaps not even tour at all. But what's more important from a marketing standpoint is the lead-up to the event. ''The key to the whole thing is not so much the viewing experience, but the promotion Big Screen Concerts can do on their 13,000 movie screens,'' said Doc McGhee, manager for Kiss, which put on the first Big Screen Concert event in 2003; he has entered into a business partnership with Big Screen Concerts for future events. ''When your band is being shown along with the trailers for 20 minutes on all of those screens, you get that nice marketing kick.'' 
 Kiss fans responded to their two-dimensional idols much as they would at a live concert, with all of the attendant applause and lusty vocal support. For Mr. McGhee, that makes Big Screen Concert events a more attractive alternative to concerts beamed on the Web. ''It's hard to get excited about a band when you're looking at them on your laptop,'' Mr. McGhee said. ''You don't get that 5.1 surround sound, or the crowd participation.'' 
 In addition to music events, Big Screen Concerts is trying to figure out other novel ways to use empty theaters during their off-hours, leasing them out for big corporate confabs (or cine-meetings, as the company likes to call them) and possibly beaming sporting events too. Meanwhile, the lure of the venerable concert film remains strong. ''We screened the old 'Grateful Dead Movie' last year,'' Mr. Hall said, ''and it was one of our most popular events.''

HEADLINE: At 80, Tyeb Mehta Breaks Auction Records

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: MUMBAI 

 BODY:
The man who makes the most coveted art in India lives in a small fourth-floor walk-up apartment in a crowded, unremarkable suburb. A sign in the hallway warns of an irregular water supply; the bustle of striving metropolitan India seeps in through his shuttered windows, making it even harder for the artist, 80 and hard of hearing, to entertain a visitor. The only luxury item in his living room is a snowy white iPod, resting on a set of speakers, unless you include a 1959 portrait of his wife, drawn in Chinese ink, that hangs above their dining table, and his 2003 painting ''Falling Bird.''
 Tyeb Mehta's paintings fetch the highest prices of any living Indian artist: last fall, ''Mahisasura,'' a 1997 rendering of the buffalo-demon of Hindu mythology, brought $1.58 million at Christie's in New York, the first time a contemporary Indian painting had crossed the million-dollar mark. (The turning point came five years ago, when a room-size triptych by Mr. Mehta, ''Celebration,'' sold for more than $300,000, signaling a surge of market interest in Indian art.) 
Mr. Mehta's career has mirrored the changing fortunes of contemporary Indian art over the last six decades, from the intellectual fervor of its birth at Indian independence in 1947, to a lifetime of aesthetic and financial struggle, to the improbable rise of the Indian art market in the last few years. As the Indian economy has galloped forward, art galleries have mushroomed, prices have skyrocketed and contemporary art has become the latest marker of affluence among the newly minted rich.
 Mr. Mehta seems to have taken it all in with a sense of amused detachment. He calls the surge in art prices ''meaningless.'' Still, the recognition pleases him.
 ''Good it happens in our lifetime,'' he said. ''I'm 80 years old. I could be bumped off anytime by the Almighty. If somebody has some money, they can buy. Let them buy.''
 Yet Mr. Mehta has, in fact, reaped little financial reward from the art boom. His work has ballooned in price, but the pieces have changed hands several times since he made them, so the sales are in the secondary market. He could churn out drawings and paintings now to profit from the bull market, but he hasn't. Mr. Mehta has never been terribly prolific, and he produces very little today. Art critics rank him among India's least commercial artists. Vincent van Gogh, he is fond of pointing out, died hungry. 
 Tyeb Mehta was born in 1925 in rural Gujarat, in western India, and was reared in the Crawford Market neighborhood of Mumbai, also known as Bombay, in an orthodox Shiite community known as the Dawoodi Bohras. His family was in the movie business, and he too worked in that world for a few years. But he soon left the family trade, joined the Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art here and met the seminal circle of Indian modernists, the Progressive Artists Group.
 Not long after that, he left the family fold altogether. Mr. Mehta recalls it this way: One night, after what was probably an insignificant argument with a member of the extended family, he and his wife, Sakina, walked out of the house. He now calls it the turning point in his life. He was 29.
 ''There was no exposure to the outside world,'' he said, describing the insularity of that milieu. ''You break the rules, you're out. That's the demand of a community. I chose to leave.''
 Mr. Mehta is a frail, cheerful man, with graying hair that nearly reaches his shoulders. One must strain to hear him -- his voice is nearly gone. He speaks with a studied, quiet seriousness.
 The central passion of his work stems from his country's central wound: the 1947 partition of British India that left a million people dead, drove millions from their homes and inscribed a deep sense of anguish across his imagination. In the Hindu-Muslim clashes that broke out around 1947, Mr. Mehta watched as his neighbors butchered a stranger to death. The victim was Hindu and the attackers were Muslim, but it happened the other way around in other neighborhoods. Many Indians his age have an identical memory.
 ''That violence gave me the clue about the emotion I want to paint,'' he explained. ''That violence has stuck into my mind.''
 The bull became a favorite figure. Not a bull in repose, but a tied-up, writhing, mutilated bull. ''I was looking for an image which would not narrate, but suggest something which was deep within me, the violence that I witnessed during partition,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''Have you seen a bull running? This tremendous energy being butchered for nothing.''
 Figures are constants in his work: the falling human figure, the buffalo-demon of Hindu lore, the rickshaw-puller and then, in the late 1980's, the goddess. In his hands, the Hindu goddess Kali is potbellied and squat. Her arms are flailing and her mouth is a terrifyingly gorgeous gash of red. The art critic Yashodhara Dalmia credits Mr. Mehta with making the mythic modern. She calls him an ''arch modernist.''
 ''In terms of art history, he is very important,'' said Ms. Dalmia, who is organizing a retrospective of Mr. Mehta's work later this year at the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi. ''He has reused the modernist method in a wholly inventive and original manner, where the conflict in his environment, the political and social events in his environment, are expressed with a great subtlety of means. It's always personal and public at the same time.''
 Another critic, Ranjit Hoskote, argues that Mr. Mehta's Shiite upbringing, and the central themes of violence and martyrdom in Shia thought, are the foundations of his work.
 Mr. Mehta's own list of his influences includes the ancient sculptures of Elephanta off the coast of Mumbai, European Renaissance painters, Francis Bacon, Paul Klee and Barnett Newman. Certainly, painters of his generation studied them all.
 But they also knew they were making their own path. There was no Indian modern tradition to turn to. ''One had to create from nowhere,'' Mr. Mehta remembered. ''We learned painting together by talking, by looking at each other's work, by criticizing, by appreciating.''
 And also by struggling. Once, there was not enough money to buy canvases to put together a show. Another time, he told his wife they would starve. ''She said, 'O.K., we will starve together,' '' Mr. Mehta recalled. 
 It is rare to hear Mr. Mehta speak of his life without referring to his wife. It was she who worked outside the house and paid the bills. It was he who read and painted at home. It was only after 12 years of painting that he made his first sale: to a buyer brought by his friend and fellow painter M. F. Hussein. Mr. Mehta sold her four canvases for what is now roughly $30.
 ''It felt great,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''Life was cheap in those days. You could live simply. Now simplicity is gone from our lives.''

Crash Course
 The space age has spawned a lot of things -- global communications, precise weather forecasts and Tang, to name a few -- but it has also generated a lot of junk. More than 11 million pounds of orbital debris are now being tracked, including old satellites, pieces of exploded rockets and smaller items like astronaut gloves. 
 All that space junk poses a collision threat to current and future space missions, manned or robotic, government or commercial. And just about every new launching adds more debris. 
But as a review of the situation in the journal Science points out, the problem has taken on a life of its own as well.
 The review, by J. C. Liou and N. L. Johnson of NASA's Johnson Space Center, notes that simulations show that over the next 200 years, the number of pieces of debris will continue to increase, even without more rocket launchings. 
 That's because existing pieces will occasionally collide, producing fragments that will outnumber other debris that has burned up in the atmosphere.
 A few collisions have already occurred, including one a year ago between a 1970's-vintage American rocket body and a piece from a Chinese rocket that exploded in 2000.
 The NASA scientists point out that the worst area for collisions is a band from about 550 to 625 miles up. The density of debris in this band is higher because, among other reasons, larger rocket stages are used to push satellites to this altitude, and it takes longer for orbits there to decay.
 The NASA scientists say that suggested methods of disposing of the junk -- by attaching tethers to fragments, for example, to increase drag and speed up orbital decay -- are not economically feasible. New, cheaper technologies are needed, they say.

 Early risers are familiar with a phenomenon of the avian world, the tendency of many birds to sing at first light. No one knows exactly why this dawn chorus occurs, but there are several theories. 
 One is that as birds become active at that time of day, they don't have enough light for foraging. So the birds use their considerable energy to engage in social communication instead.
 If light availability is important, then different birds should begin chorusing at different times, depending on several factors. Species that live high up in the canopy of trees should begin singing sooner than those near the forest floor, where there is less ambient light. And species with larger eyes, which can see better in low-light conditions, should sing earlier, too.
 Karl S. Berg of Florida International University and colleagues tested the effect of these factors in a tropical forest in Ecuador.
 Dr. Berg, now at the University of California, Berkeley, recorded singing times for 57 species, including many songbirds.
 The findings, reported in Proceedings B, a journal of the Royal Society, showed that in songbird species, height in the trees and eye size did affect when singing started. 
 In nonsongbirds, however, there was less of a correlation. The researchers say that this may be because the nonsongbird species studied have varying diets, with some eating fruits that are easily seen in low-light conditions. Most songbirds eat insects, which remain hard to see until conditions get lighter.

Belts of Their Own
 The existence of the Kuiper Belt, that vast band of icy and rocky objects beyond Neptune that includes Pluto and Quaoar, was confirmed only about a decade ago. But now astronomers from Berkeley and the Goddard Space Flight Center have discovered what they think are similar belts around two other stars. 
 Using the Hubble Space Telescope, they observed debris disks around the stars, both of which are about 60 light-years away. The finding is being reported in Astrophysical Journal Letters, and images are at hubblesite.org/news/2006/05.
 Debris disks have been found around about a half-dozen other stars, but these two systems are older -- so it is more likely that the disk has settled into a stable configuration, like the Kuiper Belt.

Evolution Update: Heavy Breathing in an Early Ear
 Forget that adage about how you've got to walk before you can run. In evolution, it might be more appropriate to say that you've got to breathe before you can hear.
 Scientists in Sweden have filled in a piece of an evolutionary puzzle: how the middle ear developed in tetrapods, four-limbed creatures. 
 The answer, they report in the journal Nature, is that before the middle ear became part of the auditory system, its precursor might have been part of the respiratory system.
 The researchers, Martin D. Brazeau and Per E. Ahlberg from Uppsala University, base their claim on a study of a fossil of Panderichthys, a 370-million-year-old fish that is an immediate ancestor of the most primitive tetrapods. 
 The fossil has an enlarged spiracle, a passageway between the jaw and the top of the head, as well as other changes that represent a middle ground between the relatively simple structures of more ancient fish and the complex morphology of tetrapods.
 ''It's got this combination of fish- and tetrapod-like features,'' said Mr. Brazeau, who undertook the research as part of his work on a doctorate in evolutionary biology.
 Scientists have known since the 19th century that in tetrapods, including humans, the middle ear develops from an embryonic structure called the first gill arch. In fish, the first gill arch forms the support for the jaws including the spiracle. 
 In fish that are ancestral to Panderichthys, the spiracle is small. In Panderichthys, Mr. Brazeau said, ''the first thing that happens is that the spiracle becomes very large.'' Further alterations follow, he said, including changes to a bone that is the forerunner of the stapes, or stirrup bone, that is part of the middle ear structure.
 So the Panderichthys fossil, which was found in Latvia, is a useful snapshot of a moment in evolution. But why do the researchers suspect that the spiracle was part of the fish's breathing system?
 Part of the answer can be found in modern bottom-dwelling marine creatures like rays. When they are on the sea floor, rays use spiracles on the top of the head for breathing instead of their mouths, to avoid sucking up sand. Panderichthys, Mr. Brazeau said, may have been a bottom dweller and have had the same need for an alternate respiration route. ''It may very well have had its face in the mud,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Violent Death, Tales of a Double Life

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: SOMERS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Dr. Joseph Z. Kazigo enjoyed all the trappings of the American dream: a pale yellow colonial-style house here with a stream out back; a career as an emergency-room surgeon; seven grown children, two of them West Point graduates.
 So when the bedroom of his Long Island apartment was found slicked with blood after his family reported him missing, his friends and colleagues were horrified.
More horror would follow.
 Within days, the police arrested his son Mulumba, 26, a quiet, seemingly gentle student at the State University at Albany. The police say he confessed to killing his father, and led a group of investigators to the body, which was wrapped in plastic bags and hidden in underbrush by a reservoir near the family home in northern Westchester County. 
 The story did not end with Mulumba Kazigo's arrest, however. As he has waited in the Nassau County jail since late August, held without bail on charges of second-degree murder, his family has rallied around him, waging a campaign to explain the son's actions by depicting the father as a brute. 
 The siblings have described a household in which they lived in fear of their father's return home on weekends. (During the week, Dr. Kazigo, 67, stayed in his apartment near Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, where he worked the night shift.)
 They have told of beatings for infractions as slight as putting sugar on cereal. They have described how Dr. Kazigo shoved the head of one of his daughters through a window and then stitched up her cuts without anesthesia. They also attribute the mental illness of four of the children, including Mulumba, to what they say was the father's cruelty.
 ''Dr. Kazigo was a very troubled man and led two lives,'' said Steven J. Chaikin, Mulumba Kazigo's lawyer. ''He had a life during the week at the hospital where he was admired by his colleagues and was apparently a very good surgeon. Then he went home occasionally and really did some awful things to his kids and to Caroline,'' his wife.
 Mr. Chaikin said that Mrs. Kazigo did not take part in the abuse of the children. She herself was abused, he said, although it was more often psychological than physical. 
 Mrs. Kazigo declined to answer questions. ''The more I talk, the more I get depressed with the issue,'' she said when reached by phone. ''Enough is enough. It's so painful. This is a tragic death.''
 Mulumba Kazigo has pleaded not guilty. Mr. Chaikin is considering various legal strategies, including a so-called battered child defense and one based on Mulumba's mental status at the time of the killing. 
 But prosecutors have dismissed the idea that the son was defending himself. They have called the murder a ''sneak attack,'' contending that the son killed Dr. Kazigo as he slept on the morning of Aug. 24 by bludgeoning him with a baseball bat and slitting his throat with a knife.
 ''Unfortunately for the defendant, any abuse in this case is a motive for doing what he did,'' said Eric Phillips, a spokesman for the Nassau County district attorney's office. ''It certainly isn't self-defense. He wasn't currently in a fight with his father. He planned a murder ahead of time and executed it.'' 
 A native of Uganda, Dr. Kazigo came to the United States in the early 1960's. He was active among Ugandan immigrants, helping to found a local chapter of Gwanga Mujje, a group promoting social and economic development in the Buganda kingdom of Uganda.
 As a surgeon, Dr. Kazigo earned the respect of colleagues, first at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx and more recently at Nassau University Medical Center.
 ''At any time in the last 20 years, if you took a poll at the hospital and asked, who is the most highly thought of doctor, he would probably be named,'' said a former colleague, Dr. Sam P. Kigongo, a trauma surgeon at Lincoln. 
 Dr. Kigongo socialized with Dr. Kazigo outside of the hospital, but said he rarely saw him at home. He described his demeanor at the hospital as ''very formal and strict,'' but said he never heard him raise his voice. 
 But according to Mr. Chaikin, who said he had talked to all seven children and Mrs. Kazigo, Dr. Kazigo raised more than his voice at home. Much of the information came from the oldest daughter, a West Point graduate who is now an Army doctor stationed in Hawaii. ''When he came home, he tortured his kids,'' Mr. Chaikin said bluntly.
 Mulumba's older brother, Gabe, gave an interview to Newsday in September in which he described several examples of abuse. Family members declined to be interviewed for this article, preferring to let Mr. Chaikin speak for them. 
 The cereal episode was recounted in harrowing detail by Gabe, as well as other siblings, Mr. Chaikin said. In the mid-1980's, after the siblings made the mistake of putting sugar on their breakfast cereal, the father made all seven children, then ages 2 to 12, take off their clothes and lie face down on the living-room floor, Mr. Chaikin said.
 The father then stepped on their heads and beat their backs with a tree branch until they bled, Mr. Chaikin said. Then each child was ordered to say ''thank you'' and sent upstairs to listen to the others' screams.
 Another punishment involved a young son, Lwanga, whose wrists were tied to the overhead pipes in the basement, Mr. Chaikin said. He was then beaten with a stick. ''It's a real tragedy,'' Mr. Chaikin said. ''Some days, he would have the kids go get a stick themselves.''
 Mr. Chaikin also related how the father once thrust the head of his daughter Bernadette, then 15, through a glass window. ''What does Dr. Kazigo do?'' he said. ''He can't have her go to a hospital because this is an obvious abuse, and he sews it up himself without any anesthetic.''
 Over the years, Mulumba Kazigo attempted suicide several times, Mr. Chaikin said.
 But some look upon the abuse allegations skeptically, wondering why they did not surface earlier. 
 Francis M. Ssekandi, an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School who went to school with Dr. Kazigo in Uganda, said he had no specific knowledge of the nature of discipline in the Kazigo home. But he said he doubted that it was so extreme that it could lead to murder. 
 ''In Uganda, many of the successful people who have been able to go to school have had tough parents,'' he said. ''Those kids were not successful for nothing. I wouldn't dispute that he was a disciplinarian with his kids, but if it had been so bad, I would expect it to have been brought up in the community.'' 
 As the children grew into adults, the beatings became less frequent, and at least two of the sons, including Mulumba, started to resist, Mr. Chaikin said.
 Last year, when Dr. Kazigo made a move to beat Mulumba in the head with a book, for instance, Mulumba pushed him, the lawyer said.
 On the night of Aug. 25, Dr. Kazigo's colleagues grew alarmed after he failed to show up for work. A member of the hospital staff alerted the doctor's family in Somers; Mulumba, in turn, called the local precinct on Long Island to report the father missing. 
 ''An officer was dispatched, and while we were at the apartment, Mulumba made a number of additional calls and asked what was going on,'' said Detective. Lt. Dennis Farrell of the Nassau County Police Homicide Squad.
 At the back of the house in Westbury where Dr. Kazigo rented an apartment, the police found a glass door shattered. Inside, a trail of blood led upstairs. ''There was a tremendous amount of blood in the bedroom,'' Lieutenant Farrell said. ''The blood spatter evidence was indicative of multiple strikes. There was no way that the victim could have left on his own.''
 None of the neighbors heard anything unusual, but one reported seeing a young black man outside the house on the morning of Aug. 24 and then saw someone backing a white car up into the driveway.
 When detectives arrived in Somers at 1 a.m. on Aug. 26, they spotted a white car on the family's property on Route 202. ''The trunk was open and it appeared that someone had tried to clean it out,'' Lieutenant Farrell said. ''The detectives smelled the distinctive smell of death in the trunk.''
 Mulumba Kazigo told detectives that he had taken the car, which belonged to a brother, to visit his father on the morning of Aug 24, Lieutenant Farrell said. He made a number of incriminating statements during the drive to Nassau County, and at police headquarters he confessed to killing his father before leading investigators to the body back in Westchester, the lieutenant said.
 Mr. Chaikin said Dr. Kazigo ''triggered'' Mulumba's attack, but refused to be more specific. ''Mulumba was driven to act to prevent what he quite reasonably felt would have spelled disaster for his mom and or himself and his siblings,'' he said. 
 Despite the family's support for Mulumba, there is also profound sadness for the father. At the funeral in early September, one daughter, Dr. Nakizito Kazigo of Hawaii, gave an emotional elegy, describing him as strict but kind, according to an account in The Journal News, which covers Westchester. Mulumba asked for permission to attend the funeral, but a judge denied it.
 ''When I talk to the family, I don't say what a monster Daddy was,'' Mr. Chaikin said. ''This family does support Mulumba. They know why he did what he did. But there's a lot of love there. It's strange, and it's painful to listen to. Even Mulumba was torn.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Lighter, Airier Look For Javits Convention Center

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Nearly 13 months after the State Legislature approved the expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, state and city officials unveiled conceptual plans yesterday to turn the forbidding, black-glass structure on 11th Avenue into a larger, sun-lighted structure with more exhibition space, a tree-lined concourse and cafes. 
 The $1.7 billion proposal would double the overall size of the center and increase the amount of exhibition and meeting space to 1.3 million square feet from 790,000 square feet, officials said, enabling the complex to attract more trade shows and conventions. The project would include what would be the city's largest ballroom, which would double as exhibition space. 
The building itself, which stretches along 11th Avenue from 34th Street to 38th Street, would expand not only vertically, but horizontally as well, to 40th Street. Richard Rogers, the architect who is designing the project with FXFowle and A. Epstein & Sons, called the Javits Center a ''mausoleum'' and said the expanded complex would serve as a catalyst for the rebirth of the neighborhood.
 Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Javits Development Corporation and the state's chief economic development official, hailed the design as ''an unmatched understanding of the project objectives to create a world-class'' convention center.
 But the estimated cost of the project has swelled from $1.4 billion in December 2004, and some of the elements have changed substantially, touching off a dispute with the man who until recently ran the center, Robert Boyle. Several civic groups, too, are concerned that the plan for the convention center still fails to take advantage of its location next to the Hudson River.
 The initial expansion plan envisioned a 1,500-room convention hotel at 42nd Street and 11th Avenue, where it could also attract tourists and business travelers, and $150 million was set aside to buy the property. But officials now say they would put that money into the convention center itself by placing the hotel in a concrete park owned by the state, directly across 11th Avenue, between 35th and 36th Streets.
 An underground pedestrian tunnel already connects the park to the Javits center.
 The new plans also call for moving the marshalling yard, where truck trailers are parked during trade shows, from the south side of the center to the north side, between 39th and 40th Streets. The new six-story marshalling garage would allow for security checks and for up to 300 trucks to load, unload and park at different levels of the convention center, Mr. Gargano said.
 At the same time, the existing marshalling yard on the block between 39th and 40th Streets would be sold to developers, for two office towers, a pair of apartment buildings and a park. Officials believe that a sale could bring in $339 million for the project. Those four buildings, however, may require a long environmental review.
 ''It seems that the Javits development corporation is desperate to show action, and they'll do almost anything to get a shovel in the ground,'' said Anna Levin, a member of Community Board 4. ''But the plan they're pursuing would seem to seriously shortchange the Javits.''
 Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, who supports the plan, disagreed. He said the site was an important element of the city's redevelopment plans for the Far West Side and for the creation of a commercial corridor extending from Madison Square Garden west to the Hudson River along 34th Street. The new garage, he said, would help allow the convention center to function more efficiently.
 But relocating the marshalling yard also forced a 20-percent reduction of meeting space. At a legislative hearing in December, Mr. Boyle objected to the reduction, since trade show producers say space has been sorely lacking. 
 Mr. Boyle was removed from the chairmanship of the Javits center operating corporation last month by Gov. George E. Pataki, although he continues to be a board member.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who presides over a legislative committee that oversees state authorities, said the state and city should not rush forward with the new plan, which he described as worse than the prior proposal. He questioned the wisdom of moving the marshalling yard and the hotel site.
 ''This project has been botched and delayed,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''This will leave New York with a second-rate convention center and a $1.7 billion price tag.''
 But Joseph Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, which has lobbied for the expansion for more than a decade, said that the industry would oppose any further delays.
 Even so, a coalition of eight civic and community organizations and advocates for parks said that the plan would create a wall seven blocks long separating Midtown from the Hudson River waterfront, the Hudson River Park and the new ferry terminal at 39th Street.
 ''They've increased the budget, but the design's still wrong,'' said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. ''It's crazy to put all this money into the park and a new ferry terminal and then block it off from the rest of the city.''

HEADLINE: Renewal of the Sabres Has Been a Balm for Buffalo

BYLINE: By DAVID STABA

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
After six players scored during a 10-1 pummeling of the Los Angeles Kings on Jan 14, it was not easy to pick a first star for the Buffalo Sabres.
 Breaking from hockey tradition, the entire team skated out for an ovation from the capacity crowd at HSBC Arena.
Such camaraderie and fan support have marked the Sabres' dual comeback -- from the lockout that canceled the 2004-5 N.H.L. season and from years of financial uncertainty that left the franchise's future in doubt. 
 ''It's a great hockey city,'' said Buffalo Coach Lindy Ruff, who is in his eighth season, the longest tenure among current N.H.L. coaches. ''To go from where we were at, from being without ownership to getting ownership and out of bankruptcy, we've really turned the corner.''
 The proof is also visible on the ice. Buffalo is 29-15-3, second in the Northeast Division and fifth in the Eastern Conference heading into Tuesday night's game against the Rangers at Madison Square Garden. 
 The day before the Sabres' victory against the Kings was also significant; three years earlier, the franchise was plunged into bankruptcy after the Adelphia Communications financial scandal, which involved the Rigas family, owner of the team and the company.
 Shortly before the 2002-3 season, John J. Rigas, the Adelphia founder, and two of his sons were indicted on charges that they hid $2.3 billion in debt from investors and stole $100 million from the company before filing for bankruptcy protection in June 2002. Adelphia was the nation's fifth-largest cable company at the time. 
 Rigas was sentenced to 15 years in prison in June.
 A bid by a Buffalo businessman to purchase the team collapsed because of a lack of financing, leaving the team bankrupt and fueling speculation that the franchise might leave Buffalo, one of the N.H.L.'s smallest markets. Three years earlier, goalie Dominik Hasek led the upstart Sabres into the 1999 Stanley Cup finals.
 ''I remember thinking, This team might be moving -- we might have to pack up and get out of here,'' said defenseman Jay McKee, who has been with the Sabres since 1996. ''That was really disappointing, because I'd been through the '99 run through the playoffs and the Stanley Cup and seen the energy and the passion the city had for the team. The uncertainty was pretty tough to accept.''
 The Adelphia collapse alienated the fan base in another way. The company had received millions in government aid after promising to spend more than $100 million on an office tower along Buffalo's waterfront; at the time, officials said the tower would create thousands of jobs in a gasping economy. That hope vanished with the indictments.
 ''I think they felt really betrayed by the Rigases -- there were a lot of promises made,'' said Rob Ray, a forward who served as the team's enforcer from 1989 to 2003 and now works on the team's game telecasts. ''And it never really happened. So I think people were very, very down about that part of it, the ownership side.''
 Then along came B. Thomas Golisano, a billionaire from Rochester, who plucked the Sabres from bankruptcy in March 2003. 
 Goalie Martin Biron said Golisano changed the team's mind-set almost immediately, with a postgame visit to the Buffalo locker room that season after the Sabres played to a tie in a game they thought they should have won.
 ''Tom came in and walked through the locker room and said, 'That was such an exciting game and I'm so proud of you guys,' '' Biron recalled. ''Nobody really expected that upbeat atmosphere to be part of the locker room. He brought that, and it's been that way ever since.''
 The attitude adjustment did not immediately transfer to the standings. In Golisano's first full season as owner, Buffalo missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year. 
 The lockout may have helped the Sabres. The imposition of a salary cap helped solidify the finances of the franchise, which lost millions annually under Rigas and the Knox family. The Knoxes had owned the Sabres since they were formed in 1970 and agreed to sell them to Rigas in 1998.
 General Manager Darcy Regier, whose tenure, like Ruff's, dates to the Knox era, was a thrifty shopper on the free-agent market. The biggest addition has been defenseman Teppo Numminen, who is second on the team with 25 assists. He has also provided veteran leadership, along with Chris Drury and Mike Grier, who were acquired before the lockout.
 New rules favoring wide-open play, as well as tighter enforcement of obstruction rules, have served the Sabres' small, speedy roster well.
 ''We came out of the gate a very disciplined club, which, I think, put us ahead,'' Ruff said. ''We took less penalties than other clubs.''
 Buffalo's most impressive statistic may be its attendance. The team averaged fewer than 14,000 fans in 2002-3 and little more than 15,000 in 2003-4, the last season before the lockout. This season, HSBC Arena is regularly at or near its capacity of 18,690.
 ''The fans here demand hard work and guys who live and love the game,'' McKee said. ''They're getting that more now.''

HEADLINE: China's Land Seizures

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Police in China Battle Villagers in Land Protest'' (front page, Jan. 17): 
 The protests by Chinese villagers over the government's land acquisition program, and the forceful police response, illustrate that local land policy is a hot-button issue in both the East and the West.
Resolution of undocumented and imperfect land claims in favor of ordinary American settlers at the dawn of the American Republic was a necessary predicate to social and political stability and helped foster the emergence of a functioning democracy.
 Moreover, the American government's validation of these land claims created property rights in average Americans that financed economic development and growth. 
 While there are clear historical, economic and cultural differences with China, the lesson of the American experience is worth remembering as the Chinese address issues of land ownership and government action.

HEADLINE: Senators Have Strong Words for Mine Safety Officials

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 

 BODY:
Citing the recent deaths of 14 miners in West Virginia, senators said Monday that federal mining officials had failed to enforce safety regulations adequately.
 ''These deaths, I believe, were entirely preventable,'' said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, citing recent budget cuts, staff reductions and ''a culture of cronyism'' as factors contributing to insufficient oversight by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.
But David Dye, acting administrator of the agency, rejected the criticism. 
 Mr. Dye told a hearing of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on mine safety that it was far too early to identify the cause of the accidents: the Jan. 2 explosion at the Sago Mine that killed 12 miners and the conveyer belt fire on Thursday that killed 2 miners at the Aracoma Alma Mine No. 1 near Melville.
 ''Until the joint investigation team can safely enter the mine to thoroughly examine the site, we will not know'' what caused the Sago accident, Mr. Dye said.
 Lawmakers grew increasingly frustrated with agency officials' answers. 
 Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the subcommittee, criticized the Bush administration as not keeping up with inflation in financing mine safety and said that over the last 10 years the safety agency's budget had been cut by $2.8 million, which led to the loss of the 183 staff members.
 About midway through the two-hour hearing, Mr. Dye said he had other matters to attend to and had to leave. 
 Senator Specter responded with frustration: ''I can understand your pressing other business. It may well be that some of the senators here have pressing matters, too. We don't think we are imposing too much to keep you here for another hour.'' 
 After Mr. Specter added, ''That's the committee's request, but you're not under subpoena,'' Mr. Dye got up and walked out.
 ''I can't recollect it ever happening before,'' Mr. Specter said of the departure. ''We'll find a way to take appropriate note of it.'' 
 Senator Byrd criticized agency officials for the communication problems that slowed the rescue efforts after both accidents. 
 ''The mine act requires that rescue teams be readily available in the event of an emergency,'' Mr. Byrd said, ''and yet it took 11 hours before the first team could even begin rescue efforts at Sago. Now, a short two weeks later, the nation watched as similar horrors emerged from a second tragedy at the Alma mine.''
 Ray McKinney, the agency's administrator of coal mine safety and health, said the delay in the Sago rescue efforts was unavoidable. 
 ''It was not safe to enter the mine until carbon monoxide levels showed signs of trending downward and stabilizing,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''We have a rich history of secondary explosions occurring after initial explosions.''
 Asked why the mine safety agency has not mandated the use of handheld devices that can help locate and communicate with miners during emergencies, Mr. Dye said the reliability of such devises was still uncertain. 
 But J. Davitt McAteer, an assistant secretary for mine safety and health administration in the Clinton administration, rejected that view.
 ''To act like these devices aren't ready to go is just plain wrong,'' Mr. McAteer said, adding that the agency had already approved use of small low-frequency tracking devices and one-way text messaging, and that these had helped save lives at several mines that had voluntarily adopted them.
 Lawmakers also questioned whether the current system of fines was sufficient to get mine operators to follow safety regulations.
 Mr. Dye said his administration could close sections of the mine only for violations but had little ability to close a mine for ''accumulated bad acts.''
 He added that he supported the increase of the maximum penalty for each safety violation to $220,000, from the current $60,000.
 According to Mine Safety and Health Administration records, the Sago Mine received 208 citations in 2005, up from 68 in 2004. Sixteen of those were for violations that the mine operators knew about but did not repair before inspectors caught them, the agency said.
 Ben Hatfield, president and chief executive of International Coal Group, which owns the Sago Mine, told the subcommittee that none of Sago's citations from 2005 ''involved an immediate risk of injury,'' and that all but three were corrected before the explosion.
 The only miner to survive the Sago blast, Randal McCloy Jr., 26, of Simpson, W.Va., remained in a coma on Monday, though his condition was upgraded to fair from serious.
 Meanwhile, the West Virginia Senate and House of Delegates unanimously passed a measure requiring mine operators to store extra breathing packs in their mines and to provide miners with devices that would make it easier to locate the packs in emergencies.
 The measure, which Gov. Joe Manchin III, a Democrat, supports, would also require coal operators to contact a new statewide hot line when accidents occur. In addition, mine operators would face fines of $100,000 if they failed to report an accident within 15 minutes.

HEADLINE: Humble Church Is at Center of Debate on Eminent Domain

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: SAND SPRINGS, Okla., Jan. 23 

 BODY:
With bulldozers churning up the earth at the front door, the small Centennial Baptist Church in this struggling industrial hub west of Tulsa seems about to fall to the wrecker.
 But the construction is just roadwork, for now. And that is all it will ever be if the congregation has its way.
''The Lord didn't send me here to build a minimall,'' said the longtime pastor, the Rev. Roosevelt Gildon.
 In what a local newspaper called ''a battle between God Almighty and the almighty dollar,'' Sand Springs is moving ahead with a redevelopment plan to clear the church and other occupants from the rundown district near downtown to make way for superstores like the Home Depot. 
 ''I'm open to anyone telling me how we're going to pay for city services,'' said Mayor Bob Walker, who said the city was seeking to negotiate fair prices with Mr. Gildon and other property owners -- 41 offers have been accepted -- and would use eminent domain only as a last resort. 
 Strengthened by a United States Supreme Court ruling last summer that approved the condemnation of private property by New London, Conn., for resale to other private interests for what the court called ''public purpose,'' municipalities around the country are considering similar forced takings, to a chorus of opposition by local interests and state legislators. 
 Bills to block such seizures are on the docket in Oklahoma and many other states, along with other ballot initiatives. Last summer, the Texas Legislature banned the taking of private property for more lucrative public ventures.
 Here in Sand Springs, a city of 17,600 on the Arkansas River founded by Charles Page, the oilman, industrialist and philanthropist, the redevelopment plan dates from 2003. County voters agreed to add fractions of a penny to the sales tax for special projects, in the Sand Springs case $14.5 million to acquire private tracts on 96 acres along the highway for redevelopment. 
 But the project was thrust into the national spotlight on Jan. 17 with an article posted on National Review Online by a conservative group, Americans for Limited Government, based in Glenview, Ill., that has been working with Oklahomans in Action and other groups to gather signatures for the ''Protect Our Homes'' movement and budget-curbing measures on state ballots. 
 ''It's not just grandma's house we have to worry about,'' wrote Heather Wilhelm, communications director for the limited government group. ''Now it's God's house, too.'' 
 The Sand Springs Leader stepped up coverage of Mr. Gildon, and a local radio host, Dillon Dodge, broadcast a program on the dispute. ''Hannity and Colmes,'' the talk show on the Fox News Channel, plans a program from Sand Springs on Wednesday, Ms. Wilhelm said. 
 City officials, mortified at being portrayed as villains, protested that they had not seized any property and might not. ''Eminent domain is not being used at this time to acquire property,'' City Manager Loy Calhoun said in a statement Friday. ''Media reports to the contrary are inaccurate.'' 
 But in interviews, Mr. Calhoun and Mayor Walker acknowledged that it remained a last resort if the city and property owners could not agree on price.
 Mr. Gildon, sitting in a pew of the church that he has led for 14 years, the last seven in a new building that cost $90,000, said he and other leaders of the congregation met last week with a relocation agent working for the city, the Cinnabar Service Company, and came away believing that they had little choice but to sell. 
 ''If you tell me this is going to happen,'' he said, ''that tells me it's eminent domain.'' 
 He said the offer of $142,000 for the church and two extra lots was not enough to move to a new location where he could serve his 50 or so regular members. He said he was ''praying over'' the question of a counteroffer. ''If I have to move,'' he said, ''we're not going out of existence.'' 
 Mr. Gildon, 48, who works full time for a machine tool manufacturer and is paid $520 a month by the church, said he was not leading a crusade on the issue and made a point of not bringing it up it up in his sermons. 
 ''I've had to say, 'Don't let it go to your head,' '' he said he told congregants. ''We're not celebrities. We're here for God.''
 But he said he was no pushover, either. He taped the meeting with the Cinnabar agent, John Thomas, and said he told city officials, ''The Lord did not lead me here to sell out the church.''
 If the parties cannot agree, a team of three appointed appraisers devises a final offer, and whether or not the seller is happy, the city can take it for that price -- and sell it to someone else.
 Other property owners in the first 25-acre redevelopment zone said they felt that the city's initial offer of $1 a square foot was far too low. A fairer figure, several said, would be $8.50. 
 ''I don't have a problem with the city,'' said Joe Harrison, who runs the Firestone dealership downtown. ''I just don't want them stealing my land.''
 In the Muffler Stop a few blocks from the church, Ernie Nanney said the city first offered him $65,000 ''which is less than I paid 25 years ago.'' He said that he counteroffered $350,000 and that the city came back with $85,000.
 In her small wood-frame house on Oak Street, Ray Jean Smith-Knight, 72, said that when she grew up a few houses away the neighborhood was ''a little old Wall Street'' of black professionals, and survivors of the Tulsa race riot of 1921 were welcomed to Sand Springs by Charles Page.
 Ms. Smith-Knight said that she had yet to receive a buyout offer and that despite the deterioration of the area did not relish leaving. 
 ''I'm not happy about it but I don't have a choice,'' she said. ''So many people have passed away that used to be fighters. One or two cannot fight.''
 Ruth Ellen Henry, founding director of the Sand Springs Cultural and Historical Museum, recalled a cleanup of the neighborhood a dozen years ago that removed a million pounds of debris but failed to halt its slide. She still has many friends there, she said, ''but you can't say they tore down paradise and built a parking lot.''

HEADLINE: France Battles a Problem That Grows and Grows: Fat

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Ariane Bernard contributed reporting from Paris for this article.

DATELINE: ROUBAIX, France 

 BODY:
In a cold, stark municipal hall, 8-year-old Hatim sat silently as the pediatrician passed judgment.
 At about 4 feet 6 inches and 95 pounds, the boy was declared overweight and in danger of becoming obese.
 The morning pastry would have to go. So would the Oasis soft drinks and the after-school Nutella-on-bread. Meat and potatoes would be allowed, but only once a day. A snack could include milk or cheese, but not both. Baguettes were fine, but where were the veggies?
 ''23.6 body mass index,'' Dr. Corinne Fassler announced. ''You have to raise your consciousness. You have to find a sport you like. But if you go to the swimming pool, don't go to the vending machine for chips.'' 
 The French are getting fatter, and Jan. 7 was National Weighing Day for the country's children. A voluntary army of hundreds of pediatricians fanned out to more than 80 cities to weigh, measure, interrogate and enlighten.
 Roubaix is an economically depressed industrial town in northern France, the fattest region in the country. Fifty-one percent of the population here is overweight or obese, compared with the national average of 42 percent, according to the most recent national figures in 2003.
 The trend line is most significant among children. While adult obesity is rising about 6 percent annually, among children the national rate of growth is 17 percent. At that rate, the French could be -- quelle horreur -- as fat as Americans by 2020. (More than 65 percent of the population in the United States is considered overweight or obese.)
 Just a few years ago, obesity in France was a subject relegated to morning television talk shows and women's magazines. Now the issue has become political.
 When Jean-Marie Le Guen, a doctor and Socialist member of Parliament, began introducing bills on how to stop what he calls France's ''epidemic,'' some of his colleagues dismissed him as a radical fringe nuisance. Now he is considered a pioneer.
 ''It used to be little talked about, and when it was, it was the domain of women complaining that they had put on a little weight,'' said Dr. Le Guen, who has written a book, ''Obesity: The New French Sickness.'' The sickness, he predicted, will be ''one of the important themes'' of the Socialists in the campaign for president next year.
 Last September, France banned soda-and-snack-selling vending machines from public schools. The law also banned misleading television and print food advertising and imposed a 1.5 percent tax on the advertising budgets of food companies that did not encourage healthy eating. Schools have been urged to provide students with a half-hour of physical exercise a day.
 But the backlash from the food industry and a lack of political will has made it impossible to impose changes in advertising. More drastic legislation was rejected by Parliament, including health warnings on the packages of unhealthy foods, much like alcohol and cigarette warnings; a proposal to force restaurants to display nutrition and calorie information on their menus; and an outright ban on television advertisements for unhealthy products.
 With its universal health care coverage, the French government is also interested in cutting medical costs associated with obesity and diabetes. A recent advertising campaign by the National Collective of Associations of the Obese, an educational and lobbying organization, shows a markedly obese nude woman under the headline ''Obesity Kills.'' (An estimated 55,000 people in France die of obesity-related illnesses every year.)
 Some of the reasons for the increase in obesity are those that plague the United States and much of Europe: the lure of fast food and prepared foods, the ubiquity of unhealthy snacks and sedentary lives.
 McDonald's is more profitable in France than anywhere else in Europe. Sales have increased 42 percent over the past five years. Some 1.2 million French, or 2 percent of the population, eat there every day.
 There has also been a breakdown in the classical French tradition of mealtime as a family ritual so disciplined and honored that opening the refrigerator between meals for a child was a crime worthy of punishment. A side effect is a blame-the-mom syndrome, as fewer mothers have time to shop at markets every day or two for fresh foods and instead put more prepared dishes on the table.
 Findus, the frozen food giant best known for its breaded, frozen fish filets, filmed French people eating over a period of time and was shocked by the results.
 Contrary to the myth that the French spend hours sitting around the table savoring small portions of several courses, the films showed them eating in front of their television sets, while on the telephone and even alone. In fact, the average French meal, which 25 years ago lasted 88 minutes, is just 38 minutes today.
 With all the awareness of obesity, there is also a countertrend. The French may have begun to embrace the large woman.
 Six years ago, the French government declared the model and actress Laetitia Casta (5 feet 7, 120 pounds) the new ''Marianne,'' the symbol of the republic on statues and public buildings.
 But in his fashion show last October, the designer John Galliano stunned the audience by putting fat women on the runway alongside string-bean-thin models.
 And last month, millions of television viewers voted and chose Magalie Bonneau, a 19-year-old student who is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 pounds, as the winner of the hit talent and reality show ''Star Academy.'' Liberation called her the ''icon of 'real people.' '' A cover story in the magazine Tele Cable Satellite referred to her as the new ''heavyweight'' of the channel TF1.
 She managed to lose 29 pounds during the rigors of the competition, and attributes her victory to her big voice, not her big build. Not that she thinks her size hurt. ''Audiences are getting used to seeing plump girls,'' she said. ''A barrier has been crossed.''

HEADLINE: Wage Squeeze Hits All of City But Manhattan

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
As the pay and purchasing power of Manhattan residents have moved higher and higher, incomes in all four of the boroughs outside Manhattan have trailed inflation over the last few years, in a stark example of the increasing income disparity in New York City. In terms of wages, Manhattan families are doing better on average than those in the rest of the nation, while families in the four other boroughs are doing worse.
 In Manhattan, real wages -- earnings adjusted for inflation -- rose 5.4 percent between the first quarters of 2002 and 2005, led by the finance and information industries, while the national average was flat.
Soaring year-end bonuses seemed to play a major role in the Manhattan increase. Economists generally look on first-quarter results as providing the best indicators of trends. 
 But in the rest of the city, those wages fell at least 2.9 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The drop was biggest on Staten Island at 8.3 percent, although that figure may be more volatile because that borough has the smallest population in New York City. 
 Real wages are one of the best indicators of how people are doing financially. Driving the buying power of these wages down, it appears, is inflation. There is also an absence of serious upward pressure on wages in most industries, especially those that employ the lowest earners. The number of both high- and low-wage jobs has grown, but there is little mobility between the two.
 Stories of financial frustration abound in the boroughs outside Manhattan. 
 Joshua Henderson, who is 29 and works in Queens as a case manager for a welfare-to-work company, said his salary had gone up about $10,000 since he left his former teaching job. 
 But a rise in rent on his apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn -- to $950 a month from $850 -- and increases in telephone, cellphone and utility costs have eaten up much of his salary increase, he said.
 Mr. Henderson feels ''priced out of Brooklyn, where I was born and bred,'' he said, adding: ''I feel disgusted. I feel like the 'Sex and the City' set has taken over, spending most of their money on rents, which puts pressure on the rest of us.''
 Limits on opportunity have also contributed to the trend toward lower real wages. Low-skilled workers -- many of them immigrants -- now tend to get the lowest-paying jobs in the market, like restaurant jobs, in contrast to unskilled laborers of the past, who often found work in manufacturing, shipping and other industries that offered benefits and a chance for advancement. 
 ''The typical jobs for immigrants with health benefits and union benefits don't exist anymore,'' said Frank J. Franz, president of the Belmont Small Business Association in the Bronx.
 ''My father had no skills at all, but he worked in a paper manufacturing plant on Bruckner Boulevard and ended up at the post office, bought a house, sent us to Fordham, and threw my sister a big wedding,'' he said. ''You think a guy who works at a post office now who has a wife who doesn't work can send a kid to Fordham University today?''
 New data compiled by the federal government suggests that New Yorkers who work outside Manhattan are being increasingly squeezed by inflation and slow wage growth -- the bookends of economic struggle. And while inflation may vary somewhat from borough to borough, economists say that those variations do not affect the overall trend.
 ''There are two dynamics at work,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York. ''You had, in all boroughs except Manhattan, increases in wages and salaries that were less than in the rest of the country but inflation being greater. And this has had a significant impact on the purchasing power of people who live in the city.''
 Workers who toil in Manhattan but who live in the four other boroughs may be earning more than those working in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx, Mr. Dolfman said, but their wages would not change the data, because by and large those earners tend not to have the highest-earning jobs in Manhattan.
 To be sure, most workers in New York City benefited from the economic boom of the 1990's, and the recovery after a recession in 2001. From 1996 to 2005, the real wages of Manhattan workers grew almost 40 percent, and grew 2.5 percent in Queens and Staten Island. They were flat in the Bronx and fell 1 percent in Brooklyn. 
 But while prices have risen on health care and education around the country in recent years, and housing prices in major cities have also soared, inflation has hit harder in New York in other areas.
 The Consumer Price Index rose 24 percent from 1996 to 2005 nationwide but grew 27.6 percent in every borough of New York. In the last three years, New Yorkers saw fuel prices rise 27 percent, while they grew 19 percent nationwide. And while the housing prices rose 8.4 percent nationwide, they went up 14.7 percent in New York. At the same time, benefits have decreased in many professions.
 ''My salary has gone up 40 percent over the last several years because I have had several promotions,'' said Loreto Porte, a professor at Hostos Community College in the Bronx who lives in Queens. ''But my expenses have gone up 50 percent. We have lost health benefits.'' She said that the electricity bill for her house had climbed, adding: ''Property taxes have gone up. It's everything.'' 
 While Manhattan workers were not impervious to inflation, their wages helped shield its blow. Indeed, the number of families in Manhattan earning more than $200,000 a year rose almost 20 percent from 2002 to 2004 alone, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Economists are divided on what this data means. Some say that rising tides still lift all economic boats, even if some of those are actually ships with giant lido decks and an open bar while others remain dinghies bobbing precariously. 
 They argue that low crime, which has led to soaring real estate prices, has helped improve nearly every corner of the city. 
 ''The tangible C.P.I. and income is good summary measure,'' said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''But then you have to ask, if you take a family in Bushwick and you look at them and their income in mid-90's and now it is this much higher but prices have gone up more than their average in income. The next question you have to ask is does that fully capture their quality of life.'' 
 ''Because,'' Mr. Bram continued, ''one statistic that really strikes me is that in the poorest neighborhoods the rate of crime and other indicators like abandoned houses have improved more dramatically than in New York City as a whole.''

HEADLINE: Clogged Rockies Highway Divides Coloradans

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SILVERTHORNE, Colo., Jan. 22 

 BODY:
When Interstate 70 was built through here in the 1960's and 70's, the Colorado Rockies were largely rural and remote, and the old roads that the highway replaced were a widely recognized danger. 
 Over the years, as the population grew, delays and frustrations on the highway began to mount. Traffic jams at nosebleed altitude became common. In 8,800-foot-high Silverthorne, which was little more than a gas station pit stop a generation ago, with a grocery that got fresh produce only on Thursdays, alpine meadows gave way to factory outlet stores.
Now state officials are considering a major and contentious widening project for Interstate 70 that is dividing people over the question of who the highway is for and how it transformed these mountains. 
 The project is a variation of a drama that is playing out across much of the West as once-rural outposts are transformed into brimming settlements with newfound political and economic clout in transportation decisions. 
 As the Federal Highway Act of 1956 established the Interstate System and helped open vast expanses of the West, highways like Interstate 70 changed just about everything by putting on the map distant places that had been mostly untouched. 
 Now, the very places that were changed, like Silverthorne -- 65 miles west of Denver -- are wading in as aggressive and muscular participants in discussions about what comes next.
 In Nevada, the expansion U.S. 95 connecting Las Vegas and its sprawling western suburbs has resumed after environmentalists settled a lawsuit last year over the effect of increased vehicle emissions on nearby residents. 
 The proposed Legacy Highway in Utah, extending south of Salt Lake City, was blocked for years before receiving final approval this month. 
 Elsewhere in Colorado, a plan for a toll road across the once-empty plains east of Denver was put on hold last year after opposition from residents. 
 Transportation experts, politicians and residents agree that the stakes and implications of these fights are enormous, touching on tenets of the West that are scriptural: unbridled growth, local identity, civic autonomy and an uneasy dependence on government. 
 Here in Colorado, where Interstate 70 is crucial to the tourism economy and the state's image as the mountain playground of the West, businesses, residents and interest groups do not remotely agree on what to do.
 ''The question is, How much do we really want to improve I-70 -- and do we want to improve it so much that it changes the character of our communities?'' said Gary Severson, the executive director of the Northwest Colorado Council of Governments. ''That's the tightrope.''
 The idea that transportation systems can reshape the regions through which they pass is well established. As far back as the Erie Canal and the transcontinental railroad, geographers and historians say that getting from Point A to Point B has always been at least partly about property values, boosterism and the restless American impulse to move on and create anew.
 But that pattern is being given a decidedly new twist here on a road that was hailed and agonized over as one of the most daunting stretches of the Interstate System.
 Places like Silverthorne -- incorporated in 1967, when it was populated mainly by highway construction workers -- have become destinations for shopping or homebuilding and tend to favor an expansion of the highway that would deliver more of the bounty that Interstate 70 has already bestowed. Towns closer to Denver, like Idaho Springs, which have not seen the influx of vacation homes or tourists and which also have many more commuters to Denver, say mass transit must be on the table. 
 Some politicians and residents say that doing nothing may be the wisest course. Colorado's population in and out of the mountains is expected to increase by 50 percent in the next 20 years, pushing people toward mass transit as traffic congestion worsens. 
 Not everything that has happened here is a result of transportation, of course. The explosion of population and the economy since the completion of Interstate 70's last leg in 1979 -- the second tube of the Eisenhower/Johnson Tunnel at 11,000 feet across the Continental Divide -- also coincided with a demographic transformation as members of the post-World War II generation reached their peak earning years, stock and real estate markets boomed and changes in tax law made buying vacation real estate more attractive. 
 Resorts that opened or grew during the highway's early years -- like Vail, in 1962, Keystone in 1970 and Beaver Creek in 1980 -- have moved toward year-round operations and real-estate development that bring more visitors and residents.
 The results have all fed back into the equation of traffic, which is increasingly bumper-to-bumper on weekends in winter and summer. Another record was set last year for the number of cars trying to squeeze through the four lanes of the Eisenhower/Johnson Tunnel in one month -- just over 37,000 a day, last July.
 Issues of class and clout have further clouded the picture.
 Summit County, where Silverthorne is located, was one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation in the 1990's, with the population up 83 percent. Equally important, many residents and politicians say, is that the nine counties along the Interstate 70 corridor -- led by Summit and Eagle, where the big resorts and the biggest waves of homebuilding are concentrated -- are becoming more and more important to the state's economy. 
 In 2000, a private study commissioned by the state found that the corridor produced about $2 billion in recreation revenue, out of $9.3 billion statewide, and generated $136 million in state and local tax revenues.
 ''Do we accommodate growth, or do we stifle it? That is the question,'' said Lou DelPiccolo, Silverthorne's mayor, who favors a highway widening plan.
 Thirty miles east, in Clear Creek County, where the growth has been slower and the big payoff from the highway never quite materialized, political leaders like the Idaho Springs mayor, Dennis Lunbery, are asking the opposite question: Could they survive the widening of the highway?
 Idaho Springs, confined in a narrow canyon -- the back door of City Hall is less than 100 feet from the Interstate's westbound guardrail -- would be destroyed, Mr. Lunbery said, by the miasma of asphalt, noise and dust that a bigger highway, and the years of construction, would bring.
 Mr. Lunbery said he thought that the state, in its environmental assessment of the corridor, had ''stacked the deck'' toward a highway-widening option by excluding any plan that costs more than $4 billion. Most mass transit proposals would add at least another $2 billion to $4 billion.
 Coincidentally or not, widening is what the destination communities farther west mostly want. Many people farther west also worry that a mass transit rail line, however good it may be for closer-in communities like Idaho Springs, could turn resort communities into bedroom communities, full of commuters catching the train to their offices in Denver. 
 The executive director of the State Department of Transportation, Thomas E. Norton, who is expected to make a decision on the corridor later this year, said he was open to all options. 
 ''I don't think there is a bias in my perspective,'' Mr. Norton said. ''There is a bias toward best use of the public dollar, and until you can get really high transit kinds of usage, the economics are not there. Rail that can move 10,000 people an hour looks great, but if only 12 days of the year it would be used by that many people, it's not an efficient use of dollars.'' 
 Many people, including Mr. Lunbery, who expects the state's study to be challenged in court almost no matter what happens, think that nothing will happen for years on the corridor -- partly because of the difficulty in finding the money -- and that worsening traffic is, for now, the only certainty. 
 Gary Lindstrom thinks that is a good thing. He is a legislator in the Colorado House whose district includes much of the corridor. He is also a Democratic candidate for governor this year and favors the mass transit idea, but he agrees with Mr. Norton that for now it does not appear feasible. Time will change that equation, Mr. Lindstrom said.
 ''The worst thing we can do is widen the highway,'' he said. ''We need to keep the congestion so people will be interested in the transit.''
 No matter what unfolds, Linda Wellington and her husband, Bill, who have lived all their lives here, will probably not see it. Ms. Wellington has watched it all -- the good and the bad -- and often talked it over with her father, a career highway worker, before he died, who regularly plowed the highest passes of the old road before Interstate 70 was built. 
 ''At one time I was bitter. I'd say, 'Dad, don't you hate all the people and the traffic?' and he'd say, 'We need to move forward,' '' said Ms. Wellington, who is in her 50's. ''So that's where I am now. You can't stop it. It's here, we've built it, and you can't close the door.''
 The Wellingtons are planning to move. Mr. Wellington, who is 56, said he had been looking at a place in northeastern Colorado, out on the plains toward Kansas, where it is not as crowded as the mountains have become and where their son now lives. He will hate to leave, he said, but things have changed too much to stay.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about a plan to widen Interstate 70 in Colorado misidentified the last section of the highway to be built and the year of its completion. It was a section near Glenwood Springs, in 1992, not the second tube of the Eisenhower/Johnson Memorial Tunnels, in 1979.

HEADLINE: Few Find Jobs of Equal Stature Years After Company's Collapse 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
For Angelique Chappell, a former administrative assistant at Enron, it all now seems like a mirage.
 There were the trips organized just for assistants, including one to California to visit a new chain of hotels where they would be booking reservations for their bosses. There was the time she won a company drawing for seats behind the dugout at a Houston Astros baseball game in a stadium then known as Enron Field. And, she recalls, there were the American Express gift cards that were handed out frequently to those who answered a trivia question.
''We may have been a little overcompensated, but we worked our tails off every single day,'' said Ms. Chappell, 33, an Army veteran who goes by Angie. ''There was so much fun, so much camaraderie among us. At that time in my life I felt like I could do almost anything.'' But life took a jarring turn for Ms. Chappell, as it did for thousands of others among Enron's rank and file after the company's chaotic collapse into bankruptcy at the end of 2001. Four years of bouncing from job to job followed. Today, Ms. Chappell has finally found a secretarial job that might, sometime soon, even provide health and retirement benefits. 
 Her experience resembles that of most former Enron employees who had nothing to do with the fraud at the company, in contrast to the success enjoyed by those at the top who cashed out early and a comparative handful of high-ranking professionals who were able to parlay their status and skills into lucrative jobs at other energy companies. Few like Ms. Chappell have been able to restore the glitter of their jobs at Enron, a factor that still overlays the mood in Houston as the trial of Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's former chief executives, is set to get under way next week.
 Some of the Enron diaspora have had to start their careers all over again. Karl Klicker, who lost a comfortable employee-training position at Enron with a six-figure salary, recently rejoined the Marine Corps at age 50, and is studying Arabic in hopes of going to Iraq. 
 Like Ms. Chappell, Mr. Klicker had been in the military, a not uncommon background for many of the people Enron hired. A self-described ''base brat,'' he followed his father and grandfather into the Marines shortly after high school, eventually earning a doctorate in adult education while also serving as a Marine intelligence officer. 
 ''I went from the top to the bottom to the top again,'' Mr. Klicker said.
 In the months after Enron's collapse, Mr. Klicker said, he sent out about 400 job applications and had offers for only two interviews. A marathon runner, he said he had plenty of time -- perhaps too much time -- to think about Enron during the 100 to 200 miles he ran each month.
 Of course, other companies have laid off large numbers of workers -- Ford just announced on Monday that it would be eliminating 30,000 jobs over the next six years. But Enron's collapse not only unfolded swiftly, it also destroyed the livelihood and retirement savings of many employees who had believed the company symbolized the future course of the global economy. 
 ''Enron was such an aggressive, complex entity at the avant-garde of many developments,'' said Richard I. Evans, director of the social psychology program at the University of Houston. ''It was not just losing a job. It was losing an identity associated with power and innovation, producing trauma and sometimes grief.''
 For Ms. Chappell, the former Enron secretary, there have been plenty of tears. It took five months for her to find a job after Enron collapsed. By that time, she had adjusted her salary expectations downward after earning nearly $50,000 a year. About the time her unemployment benefits were about to run out in 2002, she found a part-time position in the Houston office of CMS Energy. 
 A contact at CMS suggested to Ms. Chappell that she should avoid discussing her time at Enron, given the general unease associated with the company's demise, particularly in Houston's energy circles. But Ms. Chappell, a talkative native of Southern California, did exactly the opposite.
 ''What was I going to do, ignore that time in my life?'' Ms. Chappell said. She joked in her job interview, she said, about how fast she had gone from working for a respected company to one that had turned into a pauper -- kind of a Cinderella tale in reverse. 
 But soon after she landed the job at CMS, company executives were implicated in a scandal involving trades, similar to some of the manipulations at Enron and other energy and telecommunications companies that exaggerated their revenue. Ms. Chappell helped downsize CMS's office in Houston, moving with a skeleton crew of two other employees to a less expensive location in suburban Sugarland, Tex., before eventually losing the job at the end of 2003. 
 Meanwhile, Ms. Chappell's husband, a native of Houston she had met while they were both in the Army in their 20's, found a new job as a firefighter earning less than $30,000 a year. That helped keep food on the table.
 They have managed to keep the modest tract home they bought in Katy, Tex., a fast-growing distant suburb of Houston, where they live with their two sons, ages 12 and 9. Finances, though, remain extremely tight. 
 ''I still have creditors calling me to pay certain bills,'' said Ms. Chappell. ''I was mad at God for a while, but I got over it.'' 
 Ms. Chappell found temporary administrative work again in the spring of 2004 with a company that charters vessels for the oil and gas industry, but left that job for another temporary position at a mortgage company last October, cutting her commute to an hour from an hour and a half. It is a solid job, she says, with a salary approaching what she made at Enron -- she declined to give the exact amount -- and the possibility of benefits sometime soon. 
 As for Mr. Klicker, with no job in sight, he began painting murals, babysitting and writing about his thoughts on leadership strategies. He said he ate Ramen noodles regularly to cut down on expenses. He founded his own company to advise clients on management training and organizational psychology, but had trouble getting it off the ground. 
 Finally, last August, he decided to rejoin the Marines in a recall aimed at retired officers. The motivation, Mr. Klicker said, had less to do with his financial situation and more to do with a yearning to combat terror threats. He said he lost a friend in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, and still keeps his business card as a bookmark.
 ''A lot of Enron went through my mind when I was unemployed,'' said Mr. Klicker, now a captain in the Marine Corps. ''But I find now, back in uniform, there are many things I learned at Enron about leadership -- like how not to lead.'' 
 ''Take away the corporate setting and the $2,000 wool blend suit and you see the real Ken Lay,'' Mr. Klicker said in a telephone interview from Virginia Beach, where he is now stationed. 
 These days, Mr. Klicker said he was happy training soldiers in leadership procedures and living in an oceanfront rental home during the winter months -- ''unaffordable in the summer,'' he said -- where his 9-year-old daughter can visit him during school breaks. And despite being almost twice the age of some other Marine captains, Mr. Klicker hopes he has the chance for a tour of duty in Iraq. 
 ''I keep my ear to the tracks for an opportunity,'' Mr. Klicker said. ''Of course, I want to go. You never have to explain why as a marine.'' 
 Meanwhile, Ms. Chappell has little set aside for the future. She lost her $12,000 in retirement savings at Enron and has no 401(k). She had to scrimp recently to buy winter jackets for her sons and to take them to a movie.
 But rather than relishing the opportunity to see Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling put on trial, Ms. Chappell said, she was hoping to avoid thinking about the past.
 ''I don't want to turn on the TV and see their faces,'' she said, her voice quivering with anger, as it sometimes does when she is reliving Enron's demise. ''I mean, when is it going to be over? We live paycheck to paycheck and they're spending millions of dollars on their lawyers. 
 ''Ken Lay should have known every nook and cranny of that company. I just cringe when I see his image.'' 
 In the weeks leading up to the company's bankruptcy filing, she was training for a different assignment, feeling somewhat in limbo in redeployment, as that status was called within Enron. So she did not hesitate to accept the suggestion of an Enron human resources employee that she accept a ''temporary'' layoff with a severance package.
 Within days of leaving Enron in late November 2001, however, the company was essentially out of business, ending her hope of getting any severance pay. The whole experience, she says, will shape her outlook on life forever.
 ''I learned not to be loyal to anyone but my family,'' Ms. Chappell said. She said she still dreamed of advancing as she did at Enron, but that her aspirations were now more modest. She would like to finish her undergraduate degree, though she was not sure what her major would be; entering a new career path in her 30's, she said, would not be easy. 
 Ms. Chappell said she had thought of leaving Houston, moving to the Pacific Northwest, where she was stationed in the Army, or going to Iraq, where she hears contractors pay overtime-laden salaries into six figures. But the risks are great and doing so would take her away from her children. She has shelved that option. 
 Now she looks forward to a better life for her sons, hoping they will be able to attend a nearby university like Texas A&M, where she believes they will have the opportunity for an education that may allow them to view something like the Enron story from a higher perch than hers. 
 ''I just don't want my sons to have to experience what I went through.''

HEADLINE: Any Science At Davos Is Anything But Dismal

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Klaus Schwab, the Swiss professor-cum-event-planner who runs the World Economic Forum, is not about to complain, but the Bush administration has done him few favors lately.
 First, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice opted to skip the forum's annual conference, which starts here on Wednesday, citing the press of business at home.
Then the White House invited the newly elected president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to visit Washington, giving her an excuse to bow out at Davos, too. 
 The participation of two black women in high posts of their governments would have injected a jolt of electricity into an event here that for all its multicultural veneer, is still largely a white, male affair.
 Still, Mr. Schwab, who has been gathering the great and the good in this Alpine ski resort for three decades, is a realist.
 ''Unfortunately, we're in competition with the White House,'' he said in a phone interview on Monday. ''I know that Dr. Rice would have liked to have come. Sometimes internal political issues prevail.''
 Besides, Davos remains a high-altitude schmooze-fest of rare quality, with 2,340 people from 89 countries expected -- among them a dozen heads of state, 77 cabinet ministers, 23 religious leaders, 13 union bosses, 735 chairmen or chief executives and Angelina Jolie.
 Ms. Jolie, the actress and United Nations good will ambassador, is a repeat guest, as is Bill Clinton, who is now in the conference business himself, having organized the Clinton Global Initiative last September in New York. On Saturday, Mr. Clinton will take part in a dialogue with Mr. Schwab.
 The atmosphere at Davos is a decent barometer of economic and political stability in the world, and this year, Mr. Schwab predicted, the mood on economics will hover somewhere between hope and foreboding. 
 ''If you look at national economic forecasts, there was a feeling that this would be a good year,'' he said. ''Now, there are suddenly question marks. People are really concerned about what will happen.''
 Among the corporate titans who will try to make sense of these shifting winds are Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael S. Dell of Dell Computer, Larry Page of Google, Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group, Carlos Ghosn of Renault, and E. Neville Isdell, the chief executive of Coca-Cola.
 Davos will draw its share of world leaders, including Angela Merkel, the new chancellor of Germany; Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan; and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.
 Others, like Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister of Israel, sent their regrets.
 On one level, Mr. Schwab said he was relieved that fewer leaders planned to attend this year. They usually demand their own speaking slots, he said, leaving less time for panels, which can be more illuminating.
 ''We had some criticism last year, particularly from the business community, that there were too many political statements,'' Mr. Schwab said. ''This year, we wanted to put emphasis on interaction.''
 There will be plenty to interact about: the crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions; the prospects for Israel and Palestine after Ariel Sharon; Iraq's future, after its recent election; the rise of China and India as economic powers; and the specter of stratospheric oil prices.
 The foreign ministers of Britain and Germany are scheduled to appear, a few days before a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, at which their countries are likely to push for Iran to be referred to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions, after Tehran's decision to resume uranium enrichment activities.
 The agency's director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, is also expected, and will meet with Chancellor Merkel. But Mr. Schwab said he did not invite Iranian officials because he did not feel there was scope for a genuine dialogue, a decision he conceded might bring criticism.
 If Iran is absent from the conference, India will be all but ubiquitous -- or, as its own marketing slogan puts it, ''India Everywhere.'' It is bringing 41 chief executives and 3 leading economics ministers, and plastering ads on the sides of buses in Davos that play up its democratic status.
 China, on the other hand, will have a more modest presence, with a handful of chief executives and a deputy prime minister, Zeng Peiyan. But that does not mean it will fade in importance as a topic.
 ''There's going to be a lot of discussion about the impact of China on the global economy,'' said Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley and a Davos regular. He rejects the idea of an emerging rivalry. ''What China is to manufacturing,'' he said, ''India could be to services.''
 Mr. Roach cited the staying power of the American consumer as another major economic theme. With the housing market in the United States probably cresting, he said, the rest of the world can no longer count on the prolific spending of Americans to fuel the global economy.
 Technology will dominate Davos as well -- not least in the proliferation of Web logs, including one by The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune, which will zealously document the goings-on.
 That poses a ticklish problem for the organizers. The conference is a mix of on-the-record and off-the-record sessions. But the spread of blogs has largely erased those distinctions, and people can find themselves in hot water for remarks they make, which are quickly reported on the Internet.
 A senior executive at CNN, Eason Jordan, was forced to resign last February for remarks he made on a panel, in which he appeared to suggest that American troops had deliberately aimed at journalists in Iraq, killing some.
 ''The only way to deal with the situation is through trust,'' Mr. Schwab said. ''We trust everybody to uphold the rules, but we can't police everything. We have to live with it, and hope for the best.''

HEADLINE: Canada's Shift: To the Right, Gently

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
Has Canada turned upside down in electing Stephen Harper as the next prime minister? Are conservative winds suddenly blowing through cities where gays and lesbians legally marry and the government pays everyone's health bills?
 The next leader of Canada expresses skepticism about the Kyoto climate change protocol, opposes same-sex marriage and wants to make the Canadian military muscular again. He openly supported the American-led invasion of Iraq. All are positions that put Mr. Harper, 46, well to the right on the Canadian political spectrum.
 By electing this free-market economist from Alberta, a conservative oil-producing province frequently likened to Texas, it may seem that the Canadian people were trying to debunk the prevailing political wisdom of recent years that their progressive-minded nation was drawing further and further away from the United States. 
 But many analysts and political observers here caution that it is too soon to draw too stark a conclusion from the election on Monday, in which Mr. Harper's party won a mere 36.3 percent of the popular vote. The shift in Canadian politics is likely to be far from seismic. 
 Mr. Harper ran a tightly orchestrated campaign focused pragmatically on the pocketbook, shirking ideology and hot-button social issues. He promised allowances to families with young children to help them pay for child care. He pledged modest cuts to the unpopular national sales tax and promised tax breaks for people using public transit. He did not make bold proposals for reforming the national health insurance system, and he made it clear that despite his support for the war in Iraq, he would not send troops there.
 The election outcome, in fact, can be read as more of a rejection of Prime Minister Paul Martin's scandal-racked Liberal Party than an embrace of Mr. Harper's own modest agenda. 
 ''It's a very slim mandate, and the party that is holding power is holding it by a thread,'' said Pierre Martin, a political scientist at the University of Montreal. ''If you have a party system divided into four, one party can take power with a proportion of the vote in the 30's percent range. That doesn't mean the country is moving right.''
 Indeed, when the victorious Mr. Harper stepped to the platform early Tuesday morning before his adoring campaign supporters, he was careful not to suggest that he planned anything more than careful change.
 Implicitly acknowledging that his backing was less than overwhelming, he noted that voters had ''asked us to cooperate, to work together and to get on with tackling the real issues that matter to ordinary working people and their families.''
 Arriving in Ottawa in the afternoon, he made the briefest, and vaguest, of statements at the airport. ''I know a lot of you are going to be with us now in the next few months and years ahead,'' he said, ''as we start rebuilding this great country of ours.''
 Mr. Harper's modest words in part reflect a man who is shy to the point of being aloof, someone who has always been careful not to show all of his cards. He is known to have a fiery temper, and he barely disguises his distrust for reporters. His sense of humor on the campaign trail was most revealing in its self-deprecating jokes about his lack of charisma. 
 But the statements on Tuesday were also intended to balance two goals that will probably not always fit comfortably together.
 To enact legislation and even for his government to survive, Mr. Harper must build bridges to work with three left-leaning parties that together will hold the balance of power in the lower house of Parliament, where his Conservative Party won 124 seats of 308 on Monday. 
 At the same time, he must offer hope to his western base that its patience during years in the political wilderness will eventually take it to a more conservative promised land.
 ''The westerners will have to understand they will have to make compromises and move to the center,'' said Michel C. Auger, a political columnist at Le Journal de Montreal. ''But Harper can use the time to build a stronger power base in the Maritimes, Quebec and Ontario so next time he can build a majority government and put forward their agenda.''
 His own background already straddles that geographic and political divide. Born and raised in Toronto, he moved to Alberta to work in the oil and gas industry in his early 20's and began his conservative tilt as he studied economics at the University of Calgary. He met his wife, Laureen, at a Reform Party convention in 1991.
 In the 1990's he directed the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative advocacy group that favored free-market economics, privatizations and tax cuts, an agenda that does not necessarily resonate with most Canadians even today. 
 The one area where Mr. Harper may be able to make a difference is foreign affairs, even though he admits to having little expertise there. He will surely improve the tone of relations with the Bush administration, which has been downright acrimonious since the Iraq invasion, which Ottawa opposed.
 Mr. Harper could serve as a bridge between the United States and countries that have signed and ratified the Kyoto protocol to find ways to cooperate on controlling climate change. He could reopen the debate on whether Canada should join the Bush administration's missile defense system, which Mr. Martin rejected with little diplomatic finesse. But even those modest goals may not be easy. 
 ''It's a delicate balancing act,'' said James Blanchard, a former United States ambassador to Ottawa. ''I am sure that Stephen Harper wants good relations with President Bush and the United States, but any Canadian prime minister has to keep a noticeable independence from the United States, or he loses credibility in Canada.''

HEADLINE: Canada Tilts, Cautiously, Rightward

 BODY:
Canadian voters have done the un-Canadian thing by electing a hard-edged Conservative, Stephen Harper, as their new prime minister. In the past, they have typically chosen leaders from the soft center-left or, less often, from the soft center-right. Mr. Harper's victory puts an end to more than 12 years of economically successful but scandal-marred Liberal Party governments. 
 But with the Conservatives winning only a little more than 36 percent of the vote and obliged to govern in a coalition with more left-leaning partners, Mr. Harper will need to steer clear of radical policy changes, at least on domestic matters. His electoral platform pragmatically recognizes that by emphasizing cleaner government, lower taxes and increased child care subsidies for families with young children.
On foreign policy, where Canadian prime ministers have freer rein, Mr. Harper is likely to move quickly to cozy up to the Bush administration -- Canada's relationship with the United States has been distinctly chilly since the start of the Iraq war. But even here Mr. Harper will need to tread carefully because neither the war nor President Bush are very popular in Canada, and the Conservatives will be angling for a chance to win an outright majority by calling a new election sometime in the next few years.
 Mr. Harper's victory is nevertheless a historic breakthrough for his party, which was formed in 2003 by a merger of the old Progressive Conservatives, based in eastern Canada, and the American-style free-market social conservatives from the West. In contrast with the new party's initial unsuccessful run, in 2004, this election resulted in the party's doing well in every region of the country. That notably includes Quebec, long a stronghold of Liberals and separatists. 
 The Conservatives' success was helped by voters' exhaustion with the divided and squabbling Liberals, with the unending series of slush-fund and inside-dealing scandals that have swirled around their rule for the past few years, and with the distinctly lackluster campaign skills of the outgoing prime minister, Paul Martin, who managed to be uncharismatic even by Canada's undemanding standards. 
 But the victory belongs chiefly to Mr. Harper. We hope he puts it to good use.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Set for Vote And Big Shift

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan. 24 

 BODY:
For better or worse, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has gotten what he wanted: Palestinian legislative elections, the first such vote in a decade. 
 But Mr. Abbas's accomplishment with the election on Wednesday is also an extraordinary risk. He has decided to end the monopoly of his Fatah faction over all the instruments of power in the Palestinian territories, bringing the radical Islamic group Hamas into national politics.
 Many in Fatah, let alone in Israel and the United States, say they believe that Mr. Abbas is inviting the snake into the garden. They think that by trying to co-opt Hamas, rather than confronting it, he risks handing the nascent state of Palestine over to an armed group, sworn to the destruction of Israel. And they say he is digging his own political grave. 
 But Mr. Abbas, a pale, scholarly man of 70, has overridden the objections with his trademark distance from the fray, and his refusal to try to exercise power in the personal, tribal style of his late predecessor, Yasir Arafat. 
 Long Mr. Arafat's No. 2, Mr. Abbas was an obvious successor, but not a natural one. He is a man of logic, not passion; a negotiator, not a politician; a man who wears a business suit, not a military uniform; a man who condemns violence, not incites it; a man who despises personality cults and refuses to put his face up in every office; a touchy man of dark moods, who often threatens to quit, as he quit as prime minister after four months in 2003 when Mr. Arafat did not allow him enough power.
 If the elections fail or if Hamas wins, making it difficult or impossible for him to carry out his intended policies of internal reform and peace negotiations with Israel, Mr. Abbas says he will quit this job as well.
 Abdul Fatah Ayyseh, a Palestinian vendor, voted for Mr. Abbas and likes him. ''Abu Mazen is a smart man who doesn't deserve to be the president of the Palestinian people,'' he said, using the name by which Mr. Abbas is known here. ''He deserves to be the president of a Scandinavian country. He's smart, calm and unmilitary. He rejected the armed intifada, but he wasn't helped by the Palestinian factions, or by Fatah, or by Israel.''
 But Nariman Sharif regrets the moment she voted for Mr. Abbas. ''You can't compare him to Abu Ammar,'' she said, referring to Mr. Arafat. ''Abu Mazen has a weak character. I was expecting the situation on the ground would improve the minute he took over. But he's failed. He has nothing to say except, 'O.K.' Abu Ammar was respected, and the president should enjoy respect and fear. He lacks these things.''
 A pragmatist, Mr. Abbas is a refugee, born in what is now the Israeli town of Safed, which he fled with his family at the age of 13, in 1948. But he is considered by Israelis to be a man of principle who believes that the armed intifada is counterproductive, negotiates fairly and wants two states to live side by side.
 On Tuesday, on the eve of the vote, Mr. Abbas stepped out here to urge all Palestinians to vote. ''The election is a right and duty at the same time,'' he said. ''And I hope that the results of this election will reflect honestly the choice of every Palestinian.''
 Palestinians seem eager to vote, with turnout expected to be above 80 percent and opinion polls suggesting a narrow win for Fatah and its secular allies. But whether Fatah then tries to govern in coalition with Hamas or tries to leave them outside as a large opposition is unclear, and Mr. Abbas, who will appoint the next prime minister, has remained silent about his intentions.
 ''It is Abu Mazen's achievement that these elections will take place on time,'' said Salah Abdel Shafi, a Gazan economist. ''He was under great pressure to postpone or cancel them. It proves his genuine commitment to the process of democracy and the results of these elections.''
 The stakes are immense, Mr. Shafi said: ''The future of Palestine in the near and medium future will be decided in the next week.'' 
 Mr. Abbas's great gamble is a successful outcome in which Hamas is an engaged player but not dominant. ''Either we emerge with a strong parliament and government, or we have the collapse of the Palestinian Authority,'' Mr. Shafi said. ''I don't think there's any third option.''
 Mahdi Abdul Hadi, the director of Passia, a Palestinian research institute in Jerusalem, says the entire region is trying to come to terms with Islamic parties like Hamas, citing Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. ''You can't ignore them any more or deny them or contain them, so you have to bring them in,'' he said.
 Hamas, with an army of 5,000 men, is too powerful to fight, and could take over Gaza within hours if it wanted, many experts say. Mr. Abbas has always said he would not start a civil war, but he has also promised Washington that he would disarm Hamas after the elections. Yet few expect anything more than a cosmetic effort to incorporate the Hamas militia into the Palestinian security forces, the way Fatah's Aksa Martyrs Brigades have been at least partly incorporated.
 Mr. Abbas was elected little more than a year ago to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mr. Arafat, the complicated, charismatic leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, of the Fatah faction and of the Palestinian Authority. ''The Arafat era was three things: to pay, to appoint and to kill,'' said Mr. Hadi, the economist. ''But Abu Mazen doesn't have this character. We don't need this kind of leader, and he is trying to deliver rule of law in stages.''
 Mr. Abbas has long argued that democracy will tame the radicals, and he has stuck to his plan to make that work. But in the process, he has made many mistakes. While his personal standing among Palestinians remains high, with an approval rating of more than 60 percent, he is largely without effective allies, either in Fatah or the Palestinian Authority itself, and Israel has not helped him to convince Palestinians that its withdrawal from Gaza was Mr. Abbas's accomplishment and not due to Hamas's rockets and suicide bombings.
 ''The general view is that he's weak,'' said Mr. Shafi. ''People expected more leadership from him.''
 Mr. Abbas never set up an efficient presidential office, despite American efforts to help him do so. He never appointed a permanent press secretary to help him appeal to the population. He remained reactive and indecisive. ''I don't think he really understood what it is to be president, the challenge before him and the gross mismanagement and corruption of Fatah,'' said a former Palestinian official who watched the process at close hand. 
 ''There is no decision-making process, no clear chain of command,'' the official said. ''It's like throwing cooked spaghetti against the wall. People like democracy, but they wanted institutional change. He inherited a mess, but he promised to end corruption and restore law and order and create 'one law, one authority and one gun,' but he failed miserably to do any of that.''
 The former official, who admires Mr. Abbas, said he had also failed to move against the Arafat holdovers in his office, who retain power to block decisions. In particular, he kept on Ahmed Qurei as his prime minister despite Mr. Qurei's opposition to nearly all of Mr. Abbas's policies.
 Hanan Ashrawi, a Fatah legislator now running on the independent Third Way slate with former Finance Minister Salam Fayyad, was explicit in her criticism. ''Our people have despaired of the corruption in the government institutions, the internal squabbles between the president and prime minister, over the fact that Abu Mazen goes around and does nothing,'' she told the Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot. 
 Legislators brought Mr. Qurei a plan of action for reform, but he did nothing, she said. So they brought it to Mr. Abbas, who was enthusiastic. ''But instead of taking action,'' she said, ''he cooked up a deal: freeze everything, don't throw out the corrupt officials, sit and do nothing, grasp onto the excuse of the elections.''
 But the elections, originally scheduled for last July, are instrumental to Mr. Abbas's effort to clean out the older members of Fatah, like Mr. Qurei, who decided not even to run. 
 Mr. Abbas's theory is that his mandate comes from voters -- unlike Mr. Arafat's, which came from his past. With Fatah split into three parts or more, the Palestinian Authority was scarcely representative, so it needed a new, democratic legitimacy. And Hamas had become too powerful to fight on any battlefield except the democratic one, where he believed it might be contained.
 So in Mr. Hadi's view, ''he left things loose -- he didn't embrace anyone or commit himself to any one path; he let things develop on their own.'' Whether that's good or bad, he said, remains to be seen.
 Mr. Shafi said, ''He understood his role to have new elections and put a legitimately elected government in place, but he didn't understand that he also had to restructure and reform the Palestinian Authority.''
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel ''wanted no Palestinian partner,'' Mr. Hadi said. ''He had no interest in recognizing the Palestinians or dealing with them.'' 
 Israeli promises to Mr. Abbas to release a large number of Palestinian prisoners, hand back large cities to Palestinian control, loosen travel restrictions in the West Bank and ease access of people and goods to Gaza all fell afoul of Palestinian terrorist attacks and Israeli internal politics, making his arguments against terrorism seem hollow.
 ''The fact that Israel and the international community did not deliver hurts Abu Mazen,'' Mr. Ahmed said. ''It's a miscalculation that will be reflected in the results of the elections.''
 Still, Mr. Abbas is the author of many of his own problems, Mr. Hadi said. ''Abbas is no hypocrite,'' he said. ''Everyone wants him to be different. But he cannot be.''

Seats From Electoral Districts
White borders on each map mark the district boundaries.
GAZA -- Poor, religious and conservative, the Gaza Strip has been Hamas's traditional stronghold. The group is expected to do well here, as it did in the municipal elections last year.

NORTH GAZA: 5 seats
GAZA CITY: 8 seats
DEIR EL BALAH: 3 seats
KHAN YUNIS: 5 seats
RAFAH: 3 seats

JENIN
The four district seats could be split among the parties. In the local council elections, Hamas won the same number seats as the coalition of Fatah and a small leftist group.

NABLUS
Although it is a longtime Fatah stronghold and the West Bank's commercial center, Hamas won 13 of the city's 15 local council seats last month and could win several of the district's six Parliament seats.

RAMALLAH
Another Fatah stronghold, and the party is expected to take most of the seats in what is effectively the Palestinian political capital in the West Bank.

JERUSALEM
Israel controls all of the city, and barred Hamas from campaigning here. Most Palestinian voters will have to travel elsewhere, though Israel reluctantly agreed to allow several thousand residents to vote at post offices in East Jerusalem.

BETHLEHEM
With a large Christian minority, Bethlehem has traditionally been politically moderate, but Hamas made a strong showing in the local elections last year and could perform well again.

HEBRON
No municipal elections were held here last year, but Palestinian polling data suggests that Hamas is favored to win most of the nine seats in a town that has been a stronghold for militants.

HEADLINE: Layoff Costs Pared Profit At Times Co. In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit fell 41 percent, largely because of expenses related to job cuts.
 Net income fell to $64.8 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $110.2 million, or 75 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Total revenue in the period rose 3 percent, to $931 million.
Excluding one-time items, the results beat estimates based on a forecast the company issued late last month, and its shares rose 81 cents, or about 3 percent, to $28.12. They are down about 29 percent over the last year. 
 The company announced that it was raising its rates for home delivery of The New York Times by about 4 percent, starting Feb. 6. The seven-day rate in the New York metropolitan area will rise to $9.65 a week, up from $9.25; rates outside the metropolitan region are higher.
 Newspaper companies have been struggling to maintain advertising and circulation in the face of competition from the Internet and must grapple with the rising price of newsprint.
 At The New York Times Media Group, which includes the flagship newspaper, The New York Times, The International Herald Tribune, NYTimes.com and the radio station WQXR, advertising gained 7.9 percent in the quarter. In a conference call with investors, Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive, attributed the gains to an increase in color printing capacity and to strength in the transportation, telecommunications and financial services sectors.
 But advertising revenue at the company's New England media group, which includes The Boston Globe, fell by 3.8 percent, largely because of weaknesses in the automotive, home furnishings, travel and department store categories, a reflection of the sluggish Massachusetts economy. In addition, revenue in the broadcast group fell 10.2 percent because of lower levels of political advertising.
 Over all, advertising for the entire company rose 6.2 percent, to $653.9 million, largely because of strong revenue in December. But the company said that January had been off to a slow start.
 Total revenue from circulation fell 2.3 percent, to $218 million. It was down 1.3 percent at The Times media group, down 7.4 percent at the New England media group and up 1.7 percent at the regional papers.
 The company's digital properties, which include About.com, NYTimes.com, Boston.com and the Web sites of 15 regional papers, generated $198 million in revenue, accounting for about 6 percent of the company's total.
 Total costs and expenses were up 12.6 percent in the quarter, to $809.7 million, largely because of costs related to job cutbacks and stock-based compensation, which the company began expensing in 2005. In addition, newsprint expense rose 9.1 percent.
 The company announced in September that it would cut 500 jobs, many of which have been achieved through buyouts. The cuts will save $50 million to $70 million by 2007, depending on the seniority of the employees who leave and when they do so.
 The increase in the price of home delivery of The Times is expected to generate $7 million to $8 million in additional revenue in 2006.
 Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, raised an eyebrow at the price increase. She said that while The Times had been able to raise its price in the past without much decline in circulation, ''the paper is getting relatively expensive,'' especially outside New York. She also said that while subscriptions to the national edition continued to expand after the last price increase in 2002, they probably would expand more slowly after the next one.
 Executives said in the conference call that they expected minimal fall-off because the price increase was modest and the paper was offering more coverage than it did in 2002, including Thursday Styles, the Escapes section on Fridays and T: The New York Times Style Magazine, as well as enhanced coverage of the arts, travel, business and real estate.
 They said that they expected business to improve this year, with the television stations benefiting from more advertising during the Olympics and the midterm elections. They predicted advertising rates in 2006 would climb about 5 percent at The Times and about 3 percent at The Globe and other regional papers.
 They also expect double-digit revenue and operating profit growth from About.com, where advertising revenue climbed about 51 percent in the quarter over same period a year ago. And they expect a new sports magazine, called Play, which is to make its debut on Super Bowl Sunday on Feb. 5, and appear four times this year, to provide advertisers with a new audience.

HEADLINE: Economy in China Is No. 4 in World

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
The Chinese economy grew at an annual pace of 9.9 percent last year, the third consecutive year of roughly 10 percent growth, government statisticians in Beijing said on Wednesday morning. 
 The statistics, showing a national economic output of $2.26 trillion, sent China soaring past France, with which it was roughly tied in 2004, to become the world's fourth-largest economy, after the United States, Japan and Germany.
Some economists say the actual value of China's output has surpassed Germany's as well, after adjusting for the low value of China's currency and its low domestic prices.
 Rising exports have helped lift China to an average annual growth rate of 9.6 percent over the last quarter century. But economists said that Wednesday's figures showed that domestic demand -- particularly investment but also consumer spending -- was becoming increasingly important as well.
 Liang Hong, a Goldman Sachs economist, noted that retail sales in China climbed 12.5 percent last year. ''We believe domestic demand will increasingly become a much more important driver for growth, and China will become a more positive force for global demand in the coming years,'' she wrote in a report.

HEADLINE: Luring Business Developers Into Low-Income Areas

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

 BODY:
When the low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986, it took years for developers, investors and advocates to understand the program and to learn how to make the most use of it. Now it is one of the most important tools for low-income residential real estate, responsible for creating approximately 1.5 million units of affordable housing to date. 
 Advocates of a little-known development tool called new-market tax credits, the only federal tax credit program for commercial projects in low-income areas, believe the same thing is beginning to happen with commercial real estate. Efforts are already under way to reauthorize the program, which expires next year.
Enacted in December 2000, the new-market tax credit program is helping to create jobs and revitalize streets and even entire downtowns. Projects large and small that most financial specialists agree would never come to fruition otherwise are taking shape because of tax credits worth $500,000 to $150 million and even more. 
 For instance, the tax credits are currently financing the rebuilding of a butter manufacturing cooperative in New Ulm, Minn., that was damaged in a fire. The loss of the cooperative put 130 people out of work, caused economic hardship for 400 family farms and indirectly affected hundreds more jobs in the low-income rural area. 
 Just south of the central business district in Grand Rapids, Mich., is a nearly completed arts-related mixed-use redevelopment project in an area largely abandoned since the 1950's. Called Martineau Division-Oakes, the 12,000-square-foot commercial space is occupied by the art department of Calvin College and a cafe. There are also 23 spaces for artists to live and work in. Once the project got off the ground, the city committed $2 million to landscaping, repaving, new lighting, signage and sidewalk improvements in the development's neighborhood. 
 ''It's a very flexible and powerful program,'' said Robert Poznanski, president of the New Markets Support Company, one of the main recipients of credits from the Treasury Department, which administers the program. 
 ''It's driven by market forces. The federal government doesn't say, 'Use it for this type of business.' It can be used for commercial real estate, a charter school or a community center, as long as the application is competitive and the project is in a low-income area as identified by census tract data.'' 
 Tax credits make riskier projects more viable by reducing the debt associated with development costs. Private investors pay less in taxes and the developer passes the savings on to the community by, for example, lowering rent per square foot.
 The federal program will allocate up to $15 billion in tax credits to community development groups over seven years to make businesses or commercial real estate projects in low-income areas more attractive to private investors. Applicants vie for the credits, and so far the process has been highly competitive. In the first three rounds of allocation, beginning in 2003, demand for the credits has outpaced supply by 10 times, according to figures provided by the Treasury Department. Though the tax credits can be used for business development, the majority are used for commercial real estate because of the way the program is structured. 
 The most recent allocation was completed last fall, bringing the total disbursement to $8 billion to date. Recipients have five years to use the tax credits to attract private investment, or they are withdrawn and can be reissued elsewhere through 2014. 
 Dennis Sturtevant, president of Dwelling Place, a nonprofit community development organization, spearheaded the Martineau Division-Oakes project in Grand Rapids. The project used historic tax credits and other grants, in addition to new-market tax credits, to generate $2.2 million in equity from National City Bank.
 ''When you're talking about tough neighborhoods and all the costs associated with renovating dilapidated, obsolete buildings with lead and everything else,'' Mr. Sturtevant said, ''you need to combine all these resources to make it work.'' 
 Sean P. Welsh, regional president of National City Bank, said: ''It required a lot of creativity. It's complicated, but it's really driving a lot of the urban redevelopment in this and other areas around the country.'' 
 One deal that most everyone agrees would have never happened were it not for the tax credits is Plaza Verde in South Minneapolis. Formerly an abandoned building in a low-income Hispanic neighborhood, it is now a 43,000-square-foot business incubator, with locally owned retailing on the ground floor, office space on the second level and a theater company on the top floor. 
 JoAnna Hicks is the director of real estate for the Neighborhood Development Center, the nonprofit organization that spearheaded Plaza Verde. Even after expenses were deducted, including legal fees, new-market tax credits created almost $1 million in equity for a project that cost $4.2 million total.
 ''Because it's such a complicated financial tool, it's hard for small nonprofits to use,'' Ms. Hicks said. ''But now that we understand it better, we're able to apply it to other projects as well.'' 
 Using another allocation of the tax credits, Ms. Hicks's organization has also undertaken the development of a nearly completed public market, called Midtown Global Market, a $17 million project that will be home to more than 60 vendors selling fresh and prepared foods, as well as handmade arts and crafts. 
 As the program has only begun to mature, larger projects are just getting under way. Bridgeport, Conn., is undertaking a major redevelopment of its downtown, with approximately 25 percent of the financing coming from new-market tax credits. The total project is estimated to cost up to $150 million.
 ''If structured properly, it makes a real difference between a scary development and the deal not being done at all,'' said Kevin Gremse, director of the National Development Council, which provides financial advice and services to municipalities.
 Mr. Gremse used his organization's new-market tax credit allocation to attract a New York City-based private developer, Eric Anderson of Urban Green Builders, to take on the task of reviving downtown Bridgeport, which has suffered years of decline. 
 Advocates are cautiously optimistic that the program will be reauthorized in 2007. Congress recently passed a bill to assist Gulf Coast states with rebuilding efforts after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, which included $1 billion more for the new-market tax credit program geared toward that region. 
 ''The fact that Congress expanded the program is a good sign,'' said Robert Rapoza, who manages the New Market Tax Credit Coalition, an advocacy organization pushing for the program's reauthorization. ''But we have work to do. This is a new tool and government-sponsored finance is relatively uncommon. We're continuing to put together data to strengthen our case.'' 
 Of course, it helps to have banks advocating for the tax credit as well. As one of the more active players in the tax credit industry, Zachary Boyers, a senior vice president of US Bank in St. Louis, closed more than 50 deals involving new-market tax credits in 2005 alone.
 ''The banking community is behind this,'' Mr. Boyers said. ''We are deeply involved in spreading the word. We are working on ways to quantify its impact, which is not easy to do. But other investors, including banks and large corporations, would confirm that they would never be investing in these projects without it.''

HEADLINE: Distant Rumbles Heard In N.F.L.'s Labor Peace

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
The N.F.L. playoffs have often provided nail-biting moments. And now the normally tedious negotiations for labor peace may do that too. 
 With teams free to release players and sign free agents starting March 3, the pressure is on N.F.L. owners and the players union to reach a collective-bargaining agreement in order to avoid immediate disruption of the system that governs how contracts are structured and how players are released.
 But with multiple sticking points between the owners and the players, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in an interview yesterday that he believed it would be well into March at the earliest, perhaps close to the league meetings that begin March 26, before the pieces were in place for a deal. 
 There is no immediate danger of a lockout because the current agreement does not expire until after the 2007 season. But without a new deal, the 2006 season would be the last with a salary cap. And how the issues on the table are resolved could affect competitive balance, the bedrock of the league's success.
 The sides are grappling with complex economic matters, from how to divide local revenue, which has exploded for several large-market teams, to performance-based pay for players. Tagliabue and Gene Upshaw, the players union president, are scheduled to meet this week, and Tagliabue will meet with owners on Thursday in Orlando, Fla. 
 ''Getting beyond the characterizations is some really deep disagreement on both economic and on system matters,'' Tagliabue said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''We've just got a lot of issues that we can't seem to get a breakthrough on.''
 Tagliabue said that the owners presented a proposal to the players union last week that estimated player costs per club would rise to about $155 million a year by 2010. Even though teams share equally in the revenue from national television contracts and other media revenue, that figure per club is only about $135 million a year, well below player costs, Tagliabue said.
 That is an especially significant problem for smaller-market teams -- like Green Bay, Jacksonville and Kansas City -- who do not generate the lucrative local revenue streams from stadium naming rights and luxury suites that teams like Dallas, Washington and Philadelphia do. The Giants and the Jets, who are building a stadium together, are also expected to enjoy that windfall when their stadium is complete. 
 The internal debate among owners and the question that most deeply affects negotiations with the union is how much of that local revenue must be shared and how much of the total football revenue, which includes the national television contract, should be paid to players.
 The Washington Redskins' owner, Dan Snyder, recently lavished lucrative contracts on two assistant coaches that dwarf the contracts of some head coaches. Small-market teams fear that cash-rich teams like Snyder's will gain a competitive advantage if the escalating local revenue is not shared, paralleling the situation in major league baseball. 
 Upshaw is most troubled by high-revenue teams who devote less than 50 percent of their revenue to player costs. Over all, Upshaw wants a new deal to guarantee 60 percent of total football revenue for players leaguewide.
 ''They use it on places, not on players,'' Upshaw said of the spending habits of some high-revenue teams. ''We're not saying there should be a cap on coaches, we're not saying they don't need their facilities. But you can't spend it all over there and not spend it on players, because we're responsible for all those other things.''
 The union and the owners cannot even agree on whether the owners must decide how to divide local revenue before a new labor pact can be reached. The union says they must, so players know how much revenue is available before agreeing to a designated percentage of it. But Tagliabue said that it was impossible to get owners to make a decision about how costs should be shared if they do not know what player costs will be. 
 Tagliabue said owners had a better understanding of cost issues relative to a franchise's market size, and recently the sides agreed that the dollar figure for the salary cap would be set for three years, instead of a new cap being announced each February. That, everyone feels, should help teams plan contracts better. 
 Still, Tagliabue said that recent conversations had been ''one step forward, two steps back.'' And Upshaw has said that if an agreement is not reached by March 3, players will be less inclined to sign one because they would be in position to have an uncapped year in 2007. Upshaw says that getting the cap back once it is gone would be even more difficult than reaching an agreement in the coming weeks.
 ''We're not making progress,'' Upshaw said. ''But I am not going to accept a deal just for the sake of having labor peace. It's not worth it to me. The deal has got to be fair.''

HEADLINE: N.F.L.'s Supersizing vs. Detroit's Downsizing

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS. 
E-mail: selenasports@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE National Football League's A-list of celebrities and buddy list of chief executives will soon descend upon a Motor City struggling to roll forward, arriving in limos with the wheelbase of Kansas, in a party mode fit for Caligula.
 The N.F.L.'s special guests will no doubt be toting $500 bottles of Cristal and talking up their soon-to-be released $25,000 silk-boxed, autographed copies of ''XL: Forty Years of the Super Bowl,'' a 500,000-word, million-little-pounds memoir that also functions as a medicine ball. 
 In between the hip and the hooked up, the heavy hitter's list of N.F.L. owners will be in Detroit, too, including, of course, Seattle's Paul G. Allen, the Microsoft mogul, who, like many of his peers, received millions in public money to build a stadium. 
 This feted cast will alight for Super Bowl XL at Ford Field, luxury home of the Lions, owned by William Clay Ford. He is also the father of the auto heir William Clay Ford Jr., who on Monday set a timetable for eliminating up to 30,000 jobs and 14 factories from yet another Detroit automaker that mistook the S.U.V. for ingenuity.
 The Super Bowl has long been a symbol of gluttony, but the coupling of its decadence with Detroit's careworn psyche makes for an awkward juxtaposition: gilded supersizing on an industrial landscape of downsizing.
 The N.F.L.'s taste testers frown on players who choose to end-zone dance with cellphones and Sharpies and gyrations reserved for discotheques and extreme yoga, but they would never scold themselves for excessive celebration. 
 The N.F.L.'s decorum aficionados have pet peeves for players who like to show up a beleaguered opponent with a nasty stare down or a baiting gesture, but they would never flag themselves for taunting.
 The timing of Detroit's woes isn't the fault of the N.F.L., but by the league's very nature of excess, the Super Bowl will be in the face of the weary. What's the right social mix for the N.F.L. in Motown: party on or tone it down, sensitivity training or indulgence as usual? 
 ''Not only because of the blue-collar work ethic of the city, but its racial makeup, too, I would hope the N.F.L. would do something important as a tribute to those who made Detroit, especially right now,'' said Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida. ''I think that would show some sensitivity to the situation.''
 The N.F.L. is open to ideas. As the league spokesman Greg Aiello said yesterday, the N.F.L. will ask community leaders if there ''is anything else the N.F.L. can do beyond what we're doing.''
 League officials point to the Super Bowl-sponsored community outreach programs, which have nothing to do with the bunny outreach at the annual Super Bowl Playboy bash.
 ''The Super Bowl may literally be America's new Mardi Gras,'' said Mark Rosentraub, dean of Cleveland State's Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs and author of ''The International Economics of Sports,'' adding, ''The N.F.L. has a job to do in Detroit, and that is to produce a premier sporting event.''
 The N.F.L.'s mission is not to soothe Detroit. The N.F.L. likes to manufacture its snuggly side through United Way ads, but it is harder to argue the virtues of professional sports when leagues do more to illuminate than eliminate the widening gap between the rich and poor.
 The N.F.L. is like no other league in highlighting the disparity. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue uses the Super Bowl -- not an All-Star Game -- as a reward destination for the N.F.L.'s corporate sponsors and image-enhancing celebrities. This is why it helps to be as connected as P. Diddy or D. Trump. This is why only 35 percent of Super Bowl tickets will be allotted to fans of the Steelers and the Seahawks. Face value for tickets is $600, a price privilege for the affluent. 
 Your chance of winning one in your team's Super Bowl ticket lottery is most likely enhanced if you're a luxury-box owner. Most average fans of the Steelers or the Seahawks will be forced to pay eBay prices for a seat. 
 What's in it for the host city? 
 Don't be hoodwinked by the N.F.L.'s altruistic math. Its numbers crunchers will tell you the Super Bowl can infuse $300 million into the local economy of a host, but they don't account for the millions it cost city officials to put on the party. And, as Rosentraub points out, a burst of cash is not ''going to change the economic landscape.'' 
 ''The question is, how does a city capitalize?'' Rosentraub said. ''If you had the corporate and social elite in your city for 96 hours, what would you tell them and what would you show them?''
 Exposure is invaluable, but reality is hard to escape. In recent months, Ford, General Motors and Daimler-Chrysler have left Detroit punch drunk from bad news. City leaders have a plan, though, to unveil Detroit's potential to reinvent itself to any Microsoft founder who will listen at the Super Bowl bash.
 It won't be an easy sell, though. It's hard to be heard over the league's excessive celebration of class disparity.

HEADLINE: Picking the Roster for Super Bowl Beer Pitches 

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE players on the Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks who will participate in their first Super Bowl have a counterpart on Madison Avenue. On the biggest day of the year for advertising, the biggest advertiser is entrusting a newcomer to select its commercials.
 The rookie is Marlene V. Coulis, who last August took over as vice president for brand management at the Anheuser-Busch beer division of the Anheuser-Busch Companies in St. Louis. Ms. Coulis succeeded Robert Lachky, who had long overseen the decisions by Anheuser-Busch about which spots would run during the Super Bowl for which brands. 
Under Mr. Lachky, Anheuser-Busch's commercials often ranked highly -- frequently coming in first -- in the many postgame polls and surveys asking consumers which spots they liked the most. Each year, Anheuser-Busch usually buys more commercial time than any other advertiser during the Super Bowl, which is typically the most-watched TV show of the year.
 According to TNS Media Intelligence, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending, Anheuser-Busch paid $230.5 million for Super Bowl spots from 1986 through 2005, 28 percent more than the next largest spender, PepsiCo, at $180 million.
 During Super Bowl XL on Feb. 5, to be broadcast by ABC, Anheuser-Busch plans to run five minutes of spots for brands like Budweiser, Bud Light, Budweiser Select and new Michelob Ultra Amber. The company is considering about 15 commercials and will probably end up with 8 or 9; Ms. Coulis expects to finish winnowing them down by the middle of next week. 
 ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, is selling each 30 seconds of commercial time during the game for an estimated average of $2.5 million, up from the $2.4 million that Fox Broadcasting charged during the Super Bowl last February. Major advertisers like Anheuser-Busch usually get better rates, although the company has to spend an additional unspecified sum to remain the exclusive beer sponsor during the game, which it has been since 1989. 
 When Ms. Coulis took over for Mr. Lachky, who was promoted, she became the first woman and the first Hispanic to supervise brand management -- and the Super Bowl roster -- for America's largest brewer. She had previously been involved in research among consumers to gauge their opinions of Anheuser-Busch's Super Bowl commercials.
 ''If there's a new piece of insight I brought to our agencies it's that we have a lot of female beer drinkers, a lot of coed beer-drinking situations,'' Ms. Coulis said yesterday during an interview in Midtown Manhattan.
 ''They love beer,'' Ms. Coulis said of the women who consume an estimated 20 percent of the company's beer volume. ''And they're influencers, they have influence over brand choice,'' she added, ''so we want to make sure we equally appeal to males and females.''
 That has not always been the case when it came to creating Anheuser-Busch beer ads, particularly the humorous pitches for Bud Light, the company's best-selling brand. For many years, critics complained that the commercials were juvenile, sophomoric, even coarse, appealing more to jejune fraternity boys than mature adults.
 In 2004, for instance, characters in the Anheuser-Busch Super Bowl commercials included a flatulent horse, a crotch-biting dog, a male monkey wooing a woman and a man whose accidental bikini-wax treatment was played for laughs. The brouhaha over Janet Jackson's ''wardrobe malfunction'' that year led to a reaction against salacious Super Bowl content, which led Anheuser-Busch to promise to clean up its act. As a result, the commercials last year were much tamer.
 ''We always want our agencies to push the envelope,'' Ms. Coulis said, ''but at the end of the day we want to make sure we're properly representing the brands.''
 For 2006, the goal is not ''just to make a joke for a joke's sake,'' she added, but rather to infuse the commercials with the kind of humor ''that will make sure drinkers find the brands appealing.''
 That guidance seems to have been followed by the agencies creating the spots that Ms. Coulis is deciding among, based on a look she offered at a dozen of the 15 spots being considered. The approaches are generally broad but not burlesque, the situations silly but not stupid.
 For instance, one Bud Light commercial, which shows the unintended consequences of stocking a ''secret'' refrigerator with Bud Light, has a clever premise and a hilarious punch line. The spot is created by DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.
 A commercial being considered for Budweiser Select is sophisticated enough to show a couple playing chess, a pursuit that rarely if ever has made its way into a Super Bowl spot. That commercial is being created by Peterson Milla Hooks, an agency best known for its glossy, offbeat campaigns for Target; it is the agency's first work for the brand and for Anheuser-Busch.
 A possible Budweiser spot tugs at the heart strings rather than hammering at the funny bone. That spot, by DDB, shows a junior Clydesdale getting some uncredited help from its parents. 
 Ms. Coulis said all the commercials chosen for the Super Bowl will be available for downloading immediately after the game from two Web sites, budlight.com and budweiser.com. ''That's the way we have to be thinking about our advertising,'' Ms. Coulis added. ''As we look to reach the ever-elusive, contemporary adult audience, we've got to understand where they want to be reached.''

HEADLINE: A Two-Day Upward Move; First Since Rally Faltered 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Surprisingly strong earnings at United Technologies and McDonald's and lower oil prices bolstered the market yesterday, giving stocks their first two-day advance since a New Year's rally peaked on Jan. 11
 The fourth-quarter profits outweighed disappointing results at companies including 3M, Texas Instruments and Johnson & Johnson. Similar shortfalls at Citigroup and Intel helped send share prices tumbling last week.
 ''The market is in great shape,'' said Neil Hennessy, who oversees $2 billion as chief executive of Hennessy Advisors in Novato, Calif. ''All of the sudden people are trying to get ahead of earnings and when companies miss by a penny they get pummeled for it. It's ridiculous.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 3.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,266.86. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,712.22. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 16.78 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,265.25.
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 4.39 percent, from 4.36 percent. The price declined10/32, to 10027/32. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
 Oil prices fell on speculation that supplies will meet demand and that Iran, OPEC's second-biggest oil producer after Saudi Arabia, is unlikely to curtail exports because of an international dispute over its nuclear activities. Crude oil lost $1.04, to $67.06.
 Some 1.88 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
 United Technologies, a maker of elevators and air-conditioners, rallied $1.98, to $56.45. It reported fourth-quarter profit, excluding some items, of 71 cents a share. Analysts, on average, expected 70 cents in a survey by Thomson Financial.
 Another component of the Dow average, McDonald's, climbed 14 cents, to $35.85. The restaurant chain said earnings in the fourth-quarter rose 53 percent on higher sales in the United States and Germany. Excluding an impairment charge, per-share profit was 49.5 cents on sales of $5.23 billion. Analysts expected 48 cents and revenue of $5.21 billion, according to Thomson. The company also said it expected to buy back $1 billion of stock this quarter. 
 AT&T gained 21 cents, to $24.66, and BellSouth added 11 cents, to $26.92. Cingular Wireless, the No. 1 United States mobile-phone service provider and a joint venture of AT&T and BellSouth, had a fourth-quarter profit of $204 million after adding a record 1.82 million customers. A year ago, Cingular had a loss of $495 million.
 3M retreated $1.50, to $74.20. The company reported fourth-quarter sales of $5.33 billion. Analysts expected $5.4 billion, according to Thomson. This year, revenue will rise 4 percent to 7 percent, 3M said, below the long-term target of 5 percent to 8 percent set by the former chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr.
 Texas Instruments lost $1.01, to $30.69. The maker of mobile-phone chips said yesterday after markets closed that fourth-quarter sales rose to $3.59 billion, the lower end of a forecast the company gave in December. Revenue in this period may trail analysts' estimates, Texas Instruments said.
 Johnson & Johnson fell $1.83, to $59.36. The maker of medical devices said that fourth-quarter revenue declined to $12.6 billion from $12.8 billion. Analysts expected sales of $13.2 billion, according to Thomson. Fourth-quarter profit was 73 cents a share, up from 41 cents a share a year earlier.

HEADLINE: High Expenses Cited as Sun Microsystems Posts Loss for Quarter 

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Sun Microsystems reported a second-quarter loss yesterday because of high costs. Its revenue rose, but failed to meet Wall Street's forecasts.
 The company lost $223 million, or 7 cents a share, for the quarter that ended Dec. 25, in contrast to a profit of $4 million, and break-even per share, in the quarter in 2004. 
 Revenue for the quarter increased 17 percent, to $3.34 billion, from $2.84 billion, but was below analysts' forecast of $3.49 billion. 
 The company said second-quarter revenue was driven by its $4 billion acquisition of the Storage Technology Corporation, a tape-drive maker, as well as its purchase of SeeBeyond, a business software integration company.
 The earnings miss comes as Sun, based in Santa Clara, Calif., continues its struggle to regain its once-dominant position in the market for computer network servers. After its revenue declined with the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the company has embarked on several strategy shifts in the last five years, including the introduction last quarter of two major new server technologies.
 Most notably, Scott G. McNealy, Sun's chairman and chief executive, said customers showed strong interest during the quarter for its newest products, a line of high-performance but low-power servers based on a new version of the company's Sparc microprocessor, called UltraSparc IV. 
 Company executives said Sun ended the second quarter with a backlog of orders as it failed to ship as many servers as it could have. 
 Mr. McNealy said yesterday in a conference call with analysts that the problem was underestimated demand, rather than any problem with the supplier of the chip, Texas Instruments. He said he expected shipments to be caught up by the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth. 
 The net loss included $145 million in accounting adjustments related to acquisitions and $10 million of restructuring charges, as well as $14 million from a gain on equity investments and a $3 million benefit for related tax effects. Together, these items added about 4 cents a share to the loss. The company also reported $55 million, or 2 cents a share, in stock-based compensation charges. 
 Excluding these items, Sun's results per share were in line with analysts' average forecast of a loss of a penny a share, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. 
 Shares of Sun declined 2 cents, to close at $4.37 before the report was released. They fell another 6 cents a share in after-hours trading.
 Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, called the revenue miss ''more of the same'' and questioned why the company was not more capable of turning customer demand into profits.
 ''We're seeing a technology turnaround, but they don't seem to have the cost structure to turn that into a financial turnaround,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Smoking, and Venting About Prices Eclipsing $8 a Pack 

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER; Matthew Sweeney contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mark Twain is said to have had a good line about the pains of quitting smoking: It's easy. Done it a thousand times.
 Twain was probably not on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's mind on Monday when he announced that he was calling for a 50-cent increase in the city's cigarette tax. But getting smokers to quit clearly was.
''There's a clear correlation,'' the mayor said in Albany. ''You raise your cigarette taxes, fewer children go and smoke.'' 
 The problem is that smokers are a stubborn bunch. If lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and the like have failed to stop them, why, some asked, would a simple pair of quarters do the trick?
 ''We're hooked,'' said Lou Sepe, who was pulling on a smoke yesterday afternoon outside his Times Square office. ''That's the problem.''
 Smokers in the city now pay $3 in taxes, and if the tax increase becomes law, some brands could start costing more than $8 a pack, making New York the most expensive place to buy cigarettes in the country.
 That does not bother Yuri Gridin, an information technology expert from New Jersey, where cigarettes are several dollars cheaper. Still, it bothers him that Joe Smoke will be hit much harder than the Dunhill set.
 ''It's a disgrace,'' he said. ''Basically it affects poor people more than it affects the rich.''
 It also bothers Mr. Gridin, 47, that Mr. Bloomberg is a former smoker -- a species of humanity of which he says, ''There's nothing worse.'' 
 According to the city's health department, there are about 1.1 million smokers in New York -- a decrease of 188,000 since 2002, when the last cigarette tax increase took effect. Such numbers may bolster Mr. Bloomberg's argument that inflicting economic pain can persuade some smokers to surrender their smokes.
 Still, cigarette taxes have been rising for years but it has not affected sales, said Damien Banner, a manager at Nat Sherman, which bills itself as the Tobacconist to the World.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Banner believes that if taxes do keep rising, there will come a day when only the upper class will smoke. 
 ''At some point in time, tobacco products will become for the elite,'' said Mr. Banner, himself quite dapper with his necktie, pocket square and hand-rolled cigar.
 When that point will come, he does not know. But he guesses that a $12 pack may be the threshold. ''I don't see anyone paying more than that,'' he said.
 One man smoking yesterday in the clear, cold light of 42nd Street said that he obtained his cigarettes at a discount from relatives in North Carolina, where cigarettes can cost as little as $20 for a 10-pack carton. 
 And when the cupboard is bare? ''Well, then you pay,'' he said.
 On 125th Street, smokers can buy a pack for $5 from a street peddler. Or they can get loosies at four for a dollar. News of the pending price increase was greeted there with exasperation. 
 ''I'm going to go to New Jersey or to Connecticut,'' said Kelly Ferguson, 70. ''I have family in both places.''
 Or she can call her son, who lives near an Indian reservation upstate.
 ''If I tell him to go get them, he will,'' she said.
 Michael Shin, a 31-year-old who works for Reuters, admitted that the mayor's plan might cause him to quit. ''It was a New Year's resolution, cutting down.''
 Then there was Dwayne Walker, 47, who has been smoking Newport menthols since 1973. He remembers when a pack cost 60 cents.
 ''It's too much money,'' said Mr. Walker, a deliveryman, ''but I figure he's just trying to get people to stop.''
 Then again, he said, ''If you're a hard smoker, you're going to keep on buying -- at least until you drop.''

HEADLINE: Dollars And Sense

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The Greeks used to say we suffer our way to wisdom. The Democrats have been doing most of the electoral suffering, and these days the wisest political analysis comes from Democrats who are trying to figure out what went wrong. 
 Over the past few decades, Democrats have generally conceived of America as a society divided between comfortable haves and insecure have-nots. Having read thousands of gloomy articles about downsizing, outsourcing and wage stagnation, they've tried to rally the insecure working majority against the privileged minority -- or, as Al Gore put it, the people against the powerful. 
 But since this strategy has notably failed, some analysts are thinking maybe there is no frightened majority longing for government succor.
 Last year, the liberal economist Stephen Rose posted an essay on the Emerging Democratic Majority Web site in which he observed, ''It is an occupational hazard of those with big hearts to overestimate the share of the population that is economically distressed.'' Rose concluded that only 19 percent of males and 27 percent of females are poor or working poor -- a percentage that is ''probably much smaller than most progressive commentators would estimate.''
 Furthermore, he wrote, the percentage of Americans with reasonably well-paying corporate jobs has expanded over the past few decades: ''Contrary to what some on the left might think, the share of bad jobs fell significantly as more workers with postsecondary education moved into an expanding set of managerial and professional jobs.'' 
 Rose calculated the household incomes for people between 26 and 59 and found that the average annual family income is somewhere around $63,000 a year -- an impressive figure. Opinion polls consistently show that people at these income levels feel as if they're doing quite well and don't feel oppressed by forces beyond their control.
 This suggests that liberals have adopted an overly negative view of reality. Barbara Ehrenreich's books are well and good, but if you think they represent the broader society, you'll get America wrong.
 Smart Democratic analysts are also taking another look at values issues. There has been a tendency in Democratic circles to regard values as a sideshow that Republicans use to fool the working class into voting against its self-interest.
 But over the past year the Democratic polling firm of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner has noted that voters don't separate values issues from economic issues. They use values issues as stand-ins and figure the candidates they associate with traditional morality are also the ones with sensible economic policies.
 In the current issue of The American Prospect, Garance Franke-Ruta also notes the interplay between values and economic issues. ''Traditional values have become aspirational,'' she writes. ''Lower-income individuals simply live in a much more disrupted society, with higher divorce rates, more single moms, more abortions, and more interpersonal and interfamily strife, than do the middle- and upper-middle-class people they want to be like.''
 With these sentiments, Democrats seem to be moving away from materialistic determinism. In past decades, Democratic political campaigns have been based primarily on appeals to economic interests. But especially in the information age, social values and cultural capital shape a person's economic destiny more than the other way around. 
 If you are a middle-class woman, you have more to fear from divorce than from outsourcing. If you have a daughter, you're right to worry more about her having a child before marriage than about her being a victim of globalization. This country's prosperity is threatened more by homes where no one reads to children than it is by big pharmaceutical companies. 
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan observed that the core conservative truth is that culture matters most, and that the core liberal truth is that government can reshape culture. But liberals have turned culturally libertarian. Afraid to be judgmental about things like family structure, they've dropped out of the core values debate. 
 Conservatives, especially evangelicals, have had free rein to offer their own recipe for social renewal: churches that restrain male selfishness, decency standards that check hedonism, social norms that discourage childbearing outside wedlock.
 Middle-class Americans feel social anxiety more acutely than economic anxiety because they understand that values matter most. Democrats are beginning to understand this, too.

HEADLINE: Big Test Looms For Prosecutors At Enron Trial

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting from Houston for this article.

 BODY:
In the court of public opinion, they were convicted long ago. But as Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, the onetime leaders of Enron, step into a court of law next week, the outcome of their fraud trial is far from certain, creating one of the most closely watched and hotly contested white-collar criminal cases ever.
 On one side of the Houston federal courtroom starting Monday will be two top-flight teams of defense lawyers, who will be taking the risky approach of proclaiming many of the controversial actions of Enron and some much-criticized statements of their clients to be legal and truthful.
On the other, the prosecutors for the Justice Department's Enron Task Force, who have racked up an impressive array of guilty pleas in the case, but whose performance at trial has been decidedly less dazzling. 
 ''For the government, if they lose the Enron case, it will be seen as a symbolic failure of their rather significant campaign against white-collar crime,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. ''It will be seen as some evidence that some cases are too complicated to be brought into the criminal justice process.''
 Of the three major Enron-related criminal cases brought by the government before juries, guilty verdicts stand from only one, which involved Enron's booking what the government said were phantom profits on the sale of Nigerian barges to Merrill Lynch. A second case, against the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, was thrown out by the Supreme Court on appeal. The third, involving the broadband division of Enron, resulted in no convictions, but the five defendants await a retrial.
 Those cases involved narrower accusations of wrongdoing than those against Mr. Skilling, 52, who has been charged with dozens of counts, including fraud, conspiracy and insider trading, and Mr. Lay, 63, who is accused of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. Indeed, this trial will be the first time that the government's theory of the existence of an overarching criminal conspiracy at the company has been put to the test.
 Learning its lesson from previous corporate fraud trials involving Enron and other companies, the government is expected to keep this trial as simple as possible to avoid confusing and boring the jury. Riding on the prosecution's success, experts said, is public support. 
 The implications of the outcome of the case against Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling, whose names have become fused to the scandals that have exploded across corporate America in recent years, are sure to be felt far beyond the courtroom. 
 ''Most people in the white-collar world would agree that Enron is the granddaddy of all frauds in the last two decades,'' said Stephen L. Meagher, a former federal prosecutor who is now a lawyer in San Francisco. ''How this comes out is a test of the limits of what the corporate community will tolerate in business practices.''
 The importance of the trial to the government and the defense is underscored by the millions of dollars each side is committing to the case.
 Mr. Skilling, for example, has hired Daniel Petrocelli, a top civil lawyer who has no criminal trial experience but made his name winning a $33.5 million verdict for the family of Ronald Goldman in a wrongful-death suit against O. J. Simpson. Mr. Skilling alone has some two dozen people, half of them lawyers, working full time at a makeshift office near the courthouse. Several more are employed as trial consultants helping with jury selection, which begins Monday.
 The government is also committing significant resources, with 8 lawyers and 10 agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation working exclusively on this case. 
 In presenting the case, the government will be depicting a company where law breaking was commonplace. In official reports from the government, the bankruptcy court and the independent directors of Enron, and in the guilty pleas of former executives, Enron has emerged as a company that failed to follow the dictates of federal securities laws, with executives who deceived investors, directors and, in some cases, one another. While that is helpful to prosecutors, experts said that the government would have to be wary of focusing too much on the broad problems within the company.
 ''To the extent this becomes more of a trial about Enron and less of a trial about Skilling and Lay, that is likely to play into the defense's strategy to put the accounting techniques on trial rather than the individuals,'' said Robert A. Mintz, a former federal prosecutor who is now head of white-collar criminal defense at McCarter & English in Newark.
 The defense case will focus on the requirements and dictates of accounting and securities rules. While both defendants deny knowledge of some of the brazen crimes, like transactions that resulted in millions of dollars from Enron's coffers being drained into other executives' personal bank accounts, there will be little effort to distance themselves from some of the financial dealings that have become infamous over the last few years. These include Enron's use of byzantine off-books partnerships that helped pretty up the company's balance sheet and improve its income statement. 
 Instead, according to people who know both men, their statements and actions will be defended with a simple response: their business practices may have been aggressive, but everything they did was lawful. Both men, who are expected to testify, plan to maintain that many of the accounting and financial decisions were both correct and appropriately disclosed, and their statements about them were truthful. 
 There are dangers to this strategy. At times, the defense -- particularly that of Mr. Skilling, a former chief executive who is charged with playing a direct role in some of the partnership deals -- will have to maintain that accounting rules allowed Enron to exaggerate earnings or hide losses, practices that strike outside experts as bizarre and that jurors may have a hard time accepting. There is the complexity of explaining why, if so much of what Enron did was legal and the company's finances were as strong as the executives maintain, the company quickly collapsed into bankruptcy. 
 There is also one final challenge, which experts refer to as the Simon problem. In a decision from the early 1970's in United States v. Simon, a federal court held that compliance with accounting rules is not, in itself, enough to disprove an accusation of fraud. In that case, the court held that there was also a positive duty for full and fair disclosure under the securities laws, which might not be met simply by following generally accepted accounting principles. 
 That these executives and this case would ultimately serve as a symbol of an era of corporate corruption might have seemed laughable five years ago, when Enron was repeatedly proclaimed by Wall Street and academics as among the best of the best, a cutting-edge company redefining the boundaries of business. 
 The government, however, hopes to bring in evidence that it contends will prove that Mr. Lay oversaw a reckless organization from soon after its founding as a gas pipeline company in 1985 with the merger of Houston Natural Gas and Internorth of Omaha. By early 1987, Mr. Lay, then the chairman and chief executive, was confronted with evidence of potential financial wrongdoing by top executives at Enron's oil trading unit in Valhalla, N.Y. 
 The government will seek to admit testimony that despite hearing the evidence, Mr. Lay allowed the executives to remain and, months later, those same executives committed other improper acts that exposed Enron to as much as $1 billion in losses. While prosecutors have been arguing that they should be allowed to present the Valhalla episode to the jury to show that Mr. Lay had a pattern of tolerating wrongdoers, the federal judge who is hearing the case, Simeon T. Lake III, has not issued a final ruling on whether he will allow such evidence.
 A crucial witness in the government's case will be Andrew S. Fastow, the former Enron chief financial officer who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the prosecution.
 Mr. Fastow was a specialist in the growing business of structured finance, a technique that companies use to gain access to new capital by essentially selling off portions of their risk through the use of off-books partnerships. When such transactions are done properly, at least 3 percent of the entity's capital is contributed by an independent investor. Under the accounting rules, assets sold to the entity can then be moved off the balance sheet and the purchase price can be reported as revenue.
 By 1996, Mr. Fastow began committing crimes through use of the off-the-books entities for personal enrichment. He arranged to be the 3 percent investor himself -- a strategy that would not have met the accounting standards for independence -- then set up elaborate schemes in which bogus ''investors'' stood in as fronts for him. In one deal, called RADR, Mr. Fastow funneled money to various investors, who then returned profits to him. In another, called Chewco, Mr. Fastow allowed a close colleague, Michael J. Kopper, to control the 3 percent investor, then accepted kickbacks on the deal. 
 While neither RADR nor Chewco appear in the criminal indictments against Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling, the defense lawyers have already argued that they need to explore both transactions in front of the jury to try to prove that Mr. Fastow had a pattern of hiding illicit personal profits from his bosses.
 It is this point -- from Mr. Fastow's crimes beginning in 1996 to the charges against Mr. Skilling for actions years later -- that will serve as a crucial battleground, with both the defense and the government fighting over the questions that the jurors should be asking themselves.
 If Mr. Fastow engaged in crimes involving RADR and Chewco without the knowledge of his superiors, the defense argues, how can the jury believe that he told his bosses in later years about similar illegal acts that were used to manipulate Enron's financial reports? But, the government will counter, would Mr. Fastow -- along with other executives who have pleaded guilty, including Richard A. Causey, the former chief accounting officer -- have engaged in subsequent illegal acts that seemed to solely benefit the company without consulting superiors? 
 Numerous allegations against both Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling relate little to Mr. Fastow. Instead, they portray the executives as consistently working to disguise the true economic realities of Enron in violation of federal securities laws.
 The economic underpinnings of Enron began to become unhinged in 1998. That summer, Enron entered into several capital intensive transactions that ultimately proved to be abject financial disasters, including a venture into the water business and the purchase of a portion of an electricity distribution plant in Brazil. 
 The government's case is built not so much on showing that Enron was destroyed by fraud, but rather on showing that fraud, including the suspected deceptions by Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling, prevented the marketplace from knowing how badly things were going inside the company. But the cases against the two men are very different. Mr. Skilling faces the most complex series of allegations, which essentially accuse him of leading a concerted effort to make Enron appear more financially sound than it actually was.
 Through the use of the off-books partnerships, the company avoided reporting losses and was able to generate tens of millions of dollars in profit. It wrote up the value of certain assets when it needed income, and did not write them back down when circumstances changed. It entered into transactions in which there were secret buyback agreements that would have required accountants, had they known, to remove the related profits from the company's books. All of this, according to the indictment, involved Mr. Skilling.
 The charges against Mr. Lay are far narrower, on the other hand. He is not accused of involvement in the partnership machinations; rather, the vast majority of the allegations against him involve public statements he made in the final few months of Enron's existence. The government says that many of those statements, including upbeat assessments of the company's liquidity and business performance, were lies through which Mr. Lay continued the earlier deceptions involving Mr. Skilling.
 In many ways, it is fitting for Enron's tale to end with a trial that is widely viewed as a verdict on business practices in the late 1990's. When it was flying high, the energy giant was celebrated from boardrooms to business schools as a lodestar for the future of the corporate world, the embodiment of a company that got everything right. But with its collapse into bankruptcy in 2001 -- costing investors billions and pushing thousands of employees out onto the street -- it became emblematic of everything wrong in corporate America.
 ''Enron has become a poster child for an era, so I think people will remember what happens at this trial more than any other white-collar trial that occurs,'' said Linnea Bernard McCord, associate professor of business law at the Graziadio School of Business and Management at Pepperdine University. ''It made a real imprint on everybody's psyche.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Agree on Keeping Nuclear Arms From Iran, but May Differ on How, Envoy Says 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: CHENGDU, China, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
China and the United States both want to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but their ''approach may differ'' on the best tactics to achieve that result, Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoellick said Wednesday after a round of meetings on the subject in Beijing.
 His comments suggested that China, despite heavy lobbying, had left doubts as to whether it would back a proposal by Britain, France and Germany, supported by the United States, to involve the United Nations Security Council in deciding how to handle Iran's nuclear program, including whether to impose penalties. 
Mr. Zoellick said he emphasized that he viewed the United States and China as having a common interest in preventing Iran from developing atomic weapons, as well as a mutual concern about energy security in the Middle East, and he said he believed China shared those ''core principles.'' 
 But he called the diplomatic discussions fluid and said differences remained over what steps should be taken to respond to what Western powers say is a covert program by Iran to build nuclear bombs.
 ''It would not surprise me that China would not want to take exactly the same course as the E.U.-3 and the U.S.,'' Mr. Zoellick said during a brief stop in Chengdu in southwestern China after meeting with Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, and Li Zhaoxing, its foreign minister, in Beijing. The E.U.-3 refers to Britain, France and Germany.
 ''We will see how close we can come,'' he added.
 China is considered crucial if foreign powers hope to use pressure to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China could use its veto power to scuttle any penalties. Europe and the United States have argued that diplomatic steps to constrain Iran's nuclear program will have greater effect if China and Russia support them.
 But China has long opposed the use of penalties in international affairs and has argued that continued negotiations are the best way to resolve the nuclear dispute with Iran, as well as the one involving North Korea.
 A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Kong Quan, repeated Tuesday that China preferred to steer Iran back to negotiations rather than to talk of penalties for not complying with its commitments to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 Mr. Kong said China was ''conscientiously studying'' a draft proposal by the Europeans to have the atomic energy agency refer the matter to the Security Council, and he did not rule out supporting the proposal.
 ''But on the other hand, we believe that further applying diplomatic efforts and diplomatic means to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue remain relatively suitable and better options,'' he said at a briefing.
 Iran supplies about 12 percent of China's oil imports, which have become increasingly crucial to its booming economy, and the two nations have signed agreements to increase oil and gas shipments. Chinese foreign policy specialists say Beijing has signaled a greater willingness to discuss imposing penalties on Iran than on North Korea, which has openly acknowledged defying international agreements to pursue atomic weapons. 
 That may be partly because China has not traditionally sought to exert as much sway in the Middle East as it has in North Korea, and because Iran recently broke off negotiations with Europe over its nuclear program, provoking a relatively sharp reaction from Beijing.
 But they say it remains an open question whether China will back strong-arm tactics against Iran, abstain from any decision on the matter or, in a move that it could put it in conflict with other major powers, reject the use of penalties altogether.
 Mr. Zoellick has urged China to be more assertive with Iran to show that it intends to play a constructive role in world affairs to match its growing economic clout.
 Last fall, he said China should consider itself a ''stakeholder'' in world affairs and do more to coordinate its actions with the United States, stop nuclear proliferation, support world trade and explain its military buildup. In Chengdu, Mr. Zoellick visited a reserve where China breeds pandas that it lends to friendly nations, including the United States. He hugged a female cub named Jing Jing.
 Later, he said Chinese officials had frequently told him that they were focused primarily on addressing internal political and social problems and that they did not intend to compete with the United States for influence far from their own shores.
 But Mr. Zoellick said, ''It is a sign of China's success that it cannot help but influence world events.''

HEADLINE: Dead to the World

BYLINE: By Felix G. Rohatyn. 
Felix G. Rohatyn was the United States ambassador to France from 1997 to 2001.

 BODY:
DURING my four years as the American ambassador to France, I discovered that no single issue was viewed with as much hostility as our support for the death penalty. Outlawed by every member of the European Union, the death penalty was, and is, viewed in Europe as a throwback to the Middle Ages. When we require European support on security issues -- Iran's nuclear program; the war in Iraq; North Korea's bomb; relations with China and Russia; the Middle East peace process -- our job is made more difficult by the intensity of popular opposition in Europe to our policy.
 Several years ago, Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke to the senior staff of our embassy in Paris on this issue to help them explain our position to a very hostile French audience. I was agreeably surprised when he indicated his belief that sooner or later, we would have to take into account the views of Europeans in determining what constitutes ''cruel and unusual punishment.'' 
Last March, the Supreme Court, in a 5 to 4 decision, abolished capital punishment for juvenile offenders, concluding that the death penalty for minors is indeed cruel and unusual punishment. ''Our determination,'' Justice Kennedy wrote in the majority decision, ''finds confirmation in the stark reality that the United States is the only country in the world that continues to give official sanction to the juvenile death penalty.'' 
 While, unsurprisingly, Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented, it is notable that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor agreed with Justice Kennedy that international trends affect the meaning of ''cruel and unusual punishment.'' Justices Scalia and Thomas, on the other hand, took the majority to task for taking ''guidance from the views of foreign courts and legislators.''
 This attitude, reflecting a narrow and parochial view of the issue, is also found in Judge Samuel Alito's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his nomination to the Supreme Court: ''I don't think it appropriate or useful to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution. I think the framers would be stunned by the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of countries of the world.''
 To the contrary, globalization has made it not only ''appropriate or useful'' but vital to look at foreign laws. It is in our interest to be aware of their impact whether they concern antitrust, food safety or the death penalty. Contempt for the laws of our allies is a major factor in our increasing isolation in the world; our present posture in Iraq reflects that reality. That is why is it is deeply troubling that the next member of the Supreme Court will most likely share Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas's point of view.
 The Supreme Court is our most respected institution. Whether it is conservative or liberal is important; but it is even more important that it be enlightened. It must show understanding, if not respect, for other peoples' beliefs and laws, and occasionally be willing to support reasonable changes. Our Constitution, itself, was an extension of Enlightenment ideas that were incubated on the Continent. It certainly did not spring up in a vacuum, but was affected by strains of political thinking in Europe. 
 ''That our understanding of the Constitution does change from time to time has been settled since John Marshall breathed life into its text,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote last year, concurring with Justice Kennedy. Taking the views of 450 million Europeans into account is not a sign of weakness on our part, nor is it a commitment to change our views. It is simply recognition that the laws of our most important allies, our biggest foreign investors, foreign employers, foreign customers and trading partners are worthy of our attention. That is a sign of enlightenment.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Fell Again In December

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell in December for the third consecutive month, a trade group reported yesterday, even as the housing market registered a fifth consecutive year of increased sales.
 The data appear to suggest that the era of rapidly increasing sales may be coming to a close. Sales in December fell 5.7 percent, to an annual pace of 6.6 million homes, after a 1.3 percent dip in November and a 2.7 percent drop in October. It was the lowest level of sales since March 2004.
 Sales of existing homes fell or stayed flat in all four regions of the country, while the total inventory of homes for sale dipped slightly, the National Association of Realtors reported. Median prices -- half the homes sold for less, half for more -- were up 10.5 percent, to $211,000, from a year earlier. 
 For the year, home sales grew 4.2 percent, to 7.07 million, setting another record. The nation's long housing boom is almost a decade old, with the exception of 2000, when sales fell by 0.4 percent.
 ''The housing boom in the United States is over,'' said Lynn Reaser, the chief economist for Bank of America's investment strategies group. ''It at this point appears to be on the soft-landing plane, with sales slowing, some growth of inventory and sellers not receiving their full asking price.''
 The economy has become increasingly dependent on the growth generated by home sales, mortgage refinancings and related spending. A housing slowdown is figuring prominently into many analysts' forecasts for slower economic growth in 2006.
 But forecasters have pronounced an end to the boom before and were proved wrong. Mortgage interest rates, though higher than a year ago, remain near historical lows, making home ownership more affordable for many. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.1 percent last week, up from 5.71 percent in January 2005, according to Freddie Mac.
 Economists say the sharpness of the current slowdown, and whether it will become more severe, will not become clear until the peak spring and summer home-buying season.
 Prices in markets on the coasts that have experienced sharp increases will be an important barometer for the housing market this year, along with mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Prices, though still higher than a year ago, did not rise as fast in December as they did earlier in 2005. 
 Officials with the Realtors' group said a fundamentally strong economy and housing demand would help keep home sales generally steady, but even they acknowledged that the market had changed. ''Clearly the air is coming out of the balloon,'' David A. Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors association, said, according to Bloomberg News. ''We're transferring from a sellers' market to a buyers' market.'' The association expects sales to drop 4.4 percent in 2006. 
 December sales dropped the most in the West, 11.4 percent, followed by the South at 7.2 percent and the Midwest at 2.6 percent. Sales activity in the Northeast was unchanged from November.
 Nationwide, the number of homes available for sale dropped to 2.8 million at the end of December, from 2.9 million, but because of the slower pace of sales, that represented 5.1-month supply of homes, up from a five-month supply in November.

HEADLINE: 'India Everywhere' in the Alps

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Delhi swept into Davos on Wednesday, with an extravagant public relations campaign by India intended to promote the country as the world's next economic superstar, and as a democratic alternative to China for the affections of foreign investors.
 There were few places one could go, on this first day of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting here, without seeing, hearing, drinking, or tasting something Indian. The organizers call the campaign ''India Everywhere'' and they appear to mean it literally. 
''The last two years, we felt there was too much about China, and India wasn't being heard,'' said Ajay Khanna, the chief executive of the India Brand Equity Foundation, which is orchestrating the promotion. ''This year, we decided to make a major effort to give India a voice.'' 
 There is little danger of India's being drowned out, with a 150-member delegation, including 3 cabinet ministers and 41 chief executives. Mr. Khanna estimated the total cost of the campaign and the travel expenses at $5 million. Never before, officials of the forum said, has a country mounted such an elaborate charm offensive at Davos.
 ''We're going to showcase the arrival of the global Indian entrepreneur,'' said Nandan M. Nilekani, the chief executive of Infosys Technologies, which grew to $2 billion in sales in 2005 from $120 million in 1999 and has come to symbolize India's vaulting ambitions.
 The question is whether India's unspoken message -- that it is another China -- is credible. After all, China still grows faster than India, has attracted 10 times the foreign direct investment and has built a gleaming network of airports and highways that make India look ramshackle.
 ''There are a number of areas where people gloss over India's challenges,'' said Jim O'Neill, the head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs, citing India's inadequate education system and barriers to foreign ownership of Indian assets as significant weaknesses.
 ''It's starting to be tricky to find skilled workers there,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''India is also a very closed economy.''
 Goldman contributed to the euphoria about India, by projecting that its economy could be 50 times its current size by 2050, which would make it the world's third largest, after China and the United States.
 But Mr. O'Neill said that when he ranked countries by the potential risks to their growth -- everything from inflation to corruption -- India ranked 97th in the world, behind Brazil and the Philippines.
 Indian entrepreneurs concede their country has problems. Social tensions from mass migration and the fragility of the current government could disrupt development. Roads and airports remain woeful, and construction projects are often snarled in bureaucracy.
 ''If you want to make Barbie dolls, don't come to India,'' said Anand G. Mahindra, the head of one of India's largest conglomerates. ''Because if you order one million of them, they'll probably be held up in traffic from Mumbai to the port,'' he said, using the post-colonial name for Bombay.
 Still, India is beginning to enjoy China-like growth, expanding 8.1 percent from April to June 2005. Its gross domestic product will expand by an average of 6.1 percent a year from 2005 to 2010, according to Goldman.
 Advertisements on buses here promote India as the world's ''fastest-growing free-market democracy'' -- a not-so-subtle reference to China, which has done little to relax the grip of the Communist Party over society. India, by contrast, is a clamorous democracy, with 675 million eligible voters.
 ''Democracy is a big advantage for us,'' said Malvinder M. Singh, the president of Ranbaxy Laboratories, India's top drug company. ''It is not the only advantage, but it is definitely one big advantage.''
 Mr. Singh, a 33-year-old with an M.B.A. from Duke University, said India's strength in chemistry had given its pharmaceutical industry an edge over that of China. While Chinese companies focus on raw materials, he said, Ranbaxy produces generic drugs and plans to expand its proprietary products.
 Despite the constant comparisons to China, most Indians insist the two are not competing, and can both prosper. ''I call it Chindia,'' joked Nikhil Meswani, the executive director of Reliance Industries. 
 With companies like Reliance, Ranbaxy and Infosys already global competitors, experts say India's further development will hinge largely on whether the government can loosen up the labor market, build decent roads and airports, and knock down hurdles to foreign investment.
 India, for example, still prohibits Wal-Mart and Carrefour, Europe's largest retailer, from opening stores in the country. But this week, it announced that it would allow single-brand merchants, like Tommy Hilfiger, to open shops. 
 ''I'm sure people in the government wanted it to be done in time for Davos,'' said Montek S. Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Indian Planning Commission, ''but it wasn't done for Davos.'' 
 India has left little else to chance in its courting of people here. It has organized daily news conferences and happy hours, as well as an art exhibit. For the gala ball, which will have an Indian theme, it is flying in chefs from 14 Taj luxury hotels to whip up Indian cuisine.
 In their hotel rooms on Wednesday, participants found tiny iPods with Indian music recorded on them, and Pashmina stoles, described as a ''gift from the Himalayas to keep you warm in the Alps.''
 Mr. Nilekani said he hoped the campaign would polish India's image and attract tourists, as well as some foreign investment. At a cost of $5 million, he noted, ''we get a lot of bang for our buck.''

HEADLINE: Would You Take the Bird in the Hand, or a 75% Chance at the Two in the Bush?

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (dynamist.com) is the author of '''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness.''

 BODY:
WOULD you rather have $1,000 for sure or a 90 percent chance of $5,000? A guaranteed $1,000 or a 75 percent chance of $4,000?
 In economic theory, questions like these have no right or wrong answers. Even if a gamble is mathematically more valuable -- a 75 percent chance of $4,000 has an expected value of $3,000, for instance -- someone may still prefer a sure thing.
People have different tastes for risk, just as they have different tastes for ice cream or paint colors. The same is true for waiting: Would you rather have $400 now or $100 every year for 10 years? How about $3,400 this month or $3,800 next month? Different people will answer differently. 
 Economists generally accept those differences without further explanation, while decision researchers tend to focus on average behavior.
 In decision research, individual differences ''are regarded as a nuisance -- as just another source of 'unexplained' variance,'' Shane Frederick, a management science professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in ''Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making.'' The article is published in the Fall 2005 issue of The Journal of Economic Perspectives, which includes a special section of articles devoted to ''cognition, brain science and economics.'' (The article is available at mit.edu/people/shanefre/publications.htm.) 
 Professor Frederick discovered striking systematic patterns in how people answer questions about risk and patience, including those above. This short problem-solving test, he found, predicts a lot:
 1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
 2) If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
 3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half the lake?
 The test measures not just the ability to solve math problems but the willingness to reflect on and check your answers. (Scores have a 0.44 correlation with math SAT scores, where 1.00 would be exact.) The questions all have intuitive answers -- wrong ones.
 Professor Frederick gave his ''cognitive reflection test'' to nearly 3,500 respondents, mostly students at universities including M.I.T., the University of Michigan and Bowling Green University. Participants also answered a survey about how they would choose between various financial payoffs, as well as time-oriented questions like how much they would pay to get a book delivered overnight.
 Getting the math problems right predicts nothing about most tastes, including whether someone prefers apples or oranges, Coke or Pepsi, rap music or ballet. But high scorers -- those who get all the questions right -- do prefer taking risks.
 ''Even when it actually hurts you on average to take the gamble, the smart people, the high-scoring people, actually like it more,'' Professor Frederick said in an interview. Almost a third of high scorers preferred a 1 percent chance of $5,000 to a sure $60.
 They are also more patient, particularly when the difference, and the implied interest rate, is large. Choosing $3,400 this month over $3,800 next month implies an annual discount rate of 280 percent. Yet only 35 percent of low scorers -- those who missed every question -- said they would wait, while 60 percent of high scorers preferred the later, bigger payoff.
 Men and women also show different results. ''Expressed loosely,'' he writes, ''being smart makes women patient and makes men take more risks.''
 High-scoring women show slightly more willingness to wait than high-scoring men, while the differences in risk-taking are much larger. High-scoring women are about as willing to gamble as low-scoring men, while low-scoring women are even more risk-averse
 For instance, 80 percent of high-scoring men would pick a 15 percent chance of $1 million over a sure $500, compared with only 38 percent of high-scoring women, 40 percent of low-scoring men and 25 percent of low-scoring women.
 The connection between cognition and risk preferences challenges some of the ''prospect theory'' developed from the pioneering work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. They observed that people would accept larger risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains, even when the two choices were mathematically equivalent. The same person might take a sure $100 instead of a 50 percent chance of $300, yet prefer a 50 percent chance of losing $300 rather than a sure $100 loss. 
 This result, which has implications for investment and insurance, is one of the major findings of behavioral economics. Although prospect theory ''is spectacularly true'' for the low-scoring group, Professor Frederick writes, high scorers treat potential gains and potential losses about the same.
 Psychology studies often find that small differences in wording seem to produce large differences in survey answers. But since these experiments are usually done on college campuses using students, the real difference may lie elsewhere.
 Maybe, suggested Professor Frederick in the interview, ''it's because one study was done at University of Toledo'' -- where the mean score on his test was 0.57 out of a possible 3 -- ''and one study was done at Princeton,'' where the mean was 1.63. The test groups may not really be the same.
 ''Most researchers are finding that subtle differences in framing cause different preferences,'' he said, ''but it might just be that these people are a whole lot smarter on average than these other people, and that's why you're getting these results.''
 The correct answers, by the way, are 5 cents, 5 minutes, and 47 days.

HEADLINE: China Reports Another Year of Strong (or Even Better) Growth

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
China's economy surged 9.9 percent last year, government statisticians said in Beijing Wednesday, amid signs that growth may have been stronger still. 
 For a third consecutive year, China reported growth that nearly grazed the 10 percent mark. That left some economists wondering if the figures had been deliberately kept beneath that level to avoid drawing the anger of other industrialized nations and furthering calls for a higher yuan.
Over the last two years, China has shown a penchant for issuing quarterly and annual growth statistics barely under 10 percent, and then revising them upward many months later, when few are paying attention. 
 This month, China revised upward the growth in 2003 and 2004, previously set at 9.5 percent in both years, to 10 percent in 2003 and 10.1 percent in 2004.
 The statistics for 2005, showing national economic output of $2.26 trillion, sent China soaring past France, Britain and Italy to become the world's fourth-largest economy, after the United States, Japan and Germany. Some economists, however, adjust China's figures for the low value of its currency and its modest domestic prices to suggest that at comparable prices, the actual value of China's output has surpassed Germany's as well.
 Given the clumps of tall cranes that dot the skylines of Chinese cities; the shopping malls packed with buyers; and the containers full of exported shirts, toys and other goods that clog Chinese docks, the economy is growing so fast that some experts suggested Wednesday that China is perhaps again underestimating the true level of growth.
 The country may well have reason to do that. A figure of 10 percent or higher might send prices for oil and other commodities that China imports even higher, and might prompt the United States to make even stronger demands that China's currency be permitted to rise appreciably in value against the dollar, said Stephen Green, a China economist with Standard Chartered Bank.
 China, like most countries, calculates its economic output mainly from data supplied by factories and other producers. But the government's own data on spending by the government, investors, consumers and foreign buyers suggest that the true rate of growth last year may have been as high as 15 percent, Mr. Green said.
 Rising exports in particular have helped lift China to an average annual growth rate of 9.6 percent over the last quarter of a century. But economists said that Wednesday's figures showed that consumer spending was becoming increasingly important.
 Liang Hong, an economist in the Goldman Sachs office in Hong Kong, noted that retail sales in China climbed 12.5 percent last year.
 ''We believe domestic demand will increasingly become a much more important driver for growth, and China will become a more positive force for global demand in the coming years,'' she said in a research report.
 Some experts continue to question whether China is too reliant on investment spending. They also ask whether too much of that investment involves ill-considered splurges on new factories and the latest equipment, even in industries like auto manufacturing and steel making, where overcapacity is becoming a serious problem.
 China has been gradually whittling away at the serious problem of bad loans at state-owned banks. But China remains heavily dependent on continued borrowing by companies to build ever more factories and apartment buildings, even as they struggle to earn enough from existing operations to repay past loans.
 ''Given the evidence of deteriorating investment efficiency, China needs to rebalance its growth by shifting away from investment toward consumption,'' said Qu Hongbin, the senior economist for China at HSBC.
 Strong Chinese demand for new power plants, cranes, high-speed locomotives and trucks has fed a boom in Chinese imports of these and other kinds of capital equipment from Germany and Japan in particular. Tao Dong, chief Asia economist for Credit Suisse, said a detailed analysis showed that exports to China played a critical role in recent signs of a revival in the German and Japanese economies. ''China has become one of the forces lifting these two countries out of recession,'' he said.
 The economic figures released Wednesday are so strong that they suggest the Chinese economy may even be reaccelerating this winter, despite the government's efforts to discourage property speculation through tax changes and administrative measures, Mr. Tao said.
 One reason for the economy's strength is that the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has raised its benchmark interest rate only slightly more than a quarter of a percentage point in three years, even as the Federal Reserve has pushed through 13 quarter-point increases.
 Many consumer-oriented service businesses are now palpably running at capacity as a result. Mr. Tao said that when he visited Beijing last week, he had to call seven high-end restaurants before he could find one with a table free for dinner.
 ''After six restaurants turned me down,'' he recalled, ''I said, 'Gee, the economy is booming.' ''

HEADLINE: Property Taxes Push Residents To Their Limit, L.I. Poll Shows

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Long Islanders pay among the highest property taxes in the New York region, a new study says, and a majority of residents polled complain that soaring tax bills have pushed them to the breaking point.
 Taxes ranked as the island's biggest issue in a recent survey of 1,215 residents, with 95 percent calling the problem serious.
 A majority favored drastic changes like a local income tax to replace property taxes for schools, the biggest and fastest growing part of the tax bill. Many of those polled said they might pack up and leave altogether. 
 Property taxes averaged $8,389 per household in Nassau County and $6,320 in adjoining Suffolk, the study found. Calculated by person, Nassau's taxes were triple the national average.
 The figures for other major suburban counties in the region were $7,021 in Westchester, $6,268 in Bergen in New Jersey and $5,690 in Fairfield in Connecticut. The numbers were for 2002, the most recent for which complete data were available, researchers said. 
 For most homeowners, the problem has only worsened since then, as taxes have steadily climbed. 
 In the poll, 54 percent of Long Islanders reported difficulty making monthly mortgage payments, which often include taxes. That percentage was up sharply from 35 percent two years before. And 56 percent said they were likely to move away to escape the high cost of housing and taxes. The poll's margin of error was about 3 percent.
 The tax study and poll were commissioned by the Rauch Foundation, based here, as part of its Long Island Index reports on public policy issues.
 ''Long Islanders are really struggling with the cost of local government, and it's worse than ever,'' said the foundation's president, Nancy Rauch Douzinas. ''The good news is, for the first time ever, people are open to -- even requesting -- innovation. The surprise was their willingness to consider new remedies.''
 Tax rebellions emerged last year when Long Island voters defeated 36 percent of first-time school budgets, compared with a statewide rejection rate of 12 percent.
 The island's two county executives, Thomas R. Suozzi of Nassau and Steve Levy of Suffolk, praised the study and said they wanted to harness public opinion to make changes. ''It cries out for action,'' said Mr. Levy, who relishes the role as a penny pincher. ''Affordability has reached crisis proportions.'' 
 Mr. Suozzi is trying make local taxes a statewide issue as he explores whether to seek the Democratic nomination for governor. Local taxes in New York are the highest in the country, 72 percent above the national average, he said.
 On Long Island he pointed to school taxes as ''the No. 1 culprit.'' Though the county has no control over schools, he recently called school officials together to seek solutions. One problem is that Nassau's schools get only 17 percent of their budgets in state aid, while the statewide average is 37 percent and the national rate is 57 percent, he said. 
 Long Island is notorious for balkanized government -- 901 entities at last count. Together they spent about $16 billion in 2003, the report said. ''That's a huge amount -- it really hits you between the eyes,'' said Charles Zettek Jr., director of the Center for Governmental Research in Rochester, a nonprofit group that did the study.
 Salaries and benefits accounted for more than half the spending. Rising pension and health care bills pushed up benefit costs by 30 percent from 1998 to 2003, the study found.
 To finance their budgets, local governments levied $7.2 billion in property taxes and $1.9 billion in sales taxes, the study said. The rest came in state and federal aid, fees and other income.
 Schools accounted for half the local spending. The rest was spent by the counties, towns, villages, two small cities and various special districts, the study said. Schools were also the fastest-growing segment. From 1998 to 2003, their spending jumped 26 percent, twice the rate for all local government on the island.
 Fifty-five percent of those polled supported a local income tax, posed in the survey as a tax that would ''would increase by up to a maximum of 9 percent for the wealthiest households'' and replace two-thirds of the property tax for schools. But most public officials consider income tax proposals political suicide.
 Seventy-six percent favored taking tax revenue from commercial properties and sharing it evenly among school districts, the survey found. The present system funnels that money to the districts where they are located.
 Although Long Island has 126 school districts, residents split on the idea of combining districts to economize, with 48 percent against and 46 percent in favor. Short of consolidation, Mr. Suozzi urged school officials to seek savings in cooperative efforts like joint purchasing of supplies.
 ''It's a dramatic sea change that people are talking about subjects that historically have been taboo,'' Mr. Suozzi said of the tax issues. ''Everybody finally agrees this is a problem, and everybody agrees something has to be done.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Bloomberg to Lay Out His Plans for Another Term 

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
When he gives his annual State of the City address today, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will announce plans for accelerating the pace of development at ground zero, a new effort to combat poverty and a series of initiatives to limit the influence of moneyed interests on city government, officials said yesterday. 
 Administration officials said he would use today's address -- his fifth -- to lay out what he and aides have described as an ambitious second-term agenda.
In a departure from the usual protocol, when Bloomberg administration officials release one key detail of the address the day before it is given, to build interest in the news media, officials yesterday released a preview document that highlighted several new initiatives. But the document had very few specifics.
 Officials said they were highlighting several initiatives ahead of time this year because the mayor would be laying out a broad agenda today and they did not want any single initiative to overshadow the others.
 A written statement above the list of initiatives, attributed to ''a senior administration official,'' read, ''The mayor will lay out an ambitious blueprint for achieving long-term stability and growth in every area of life important to New Yorkers.''
 The document said the city would work with New York University and the City University of New York to develop a new teacher training program and develop initiatives to improve high school education. That program is to be financed by the Carroll and Milton Petrie Foundation and includes a plan to put teacher trainees into high schools.
 The mayor will announce a similar public-private partnership as part of what the document said would be a plan to ''decrease the number of New Yorkers living in poverty by marshalling the resources of social service and economic development agencies.'' That effort, the document said, would be led through a ''public-private task force.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic opponents in last year's mayoral race had frequently criticized the administration for not doing enough to help the poor. 
 The document released yesterday said the mayor would introduce measures to ban lobbyists from giving gifts to city officials, a campaign to reduce the potential for companies to win city business through campaign contributions, and another to change the judicial selection process.
 The document also said the mayor would lay out detailed plans to combat illegal guns, and that the plans would include proposed legislative measures as well as new crime fighting techniques. (Yesterday Mr. Bloomberg's new deputy mayor for government relations, Kevin Sheekey, was spotted at City Hall with Representative Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island, for whom gun control is a signature issue.)
 The document also promised that the mayor would commit to moving ahead on what it called ''a variety of big projects across the city,'' but did not name anything other than the World Trade Center site.

HEADLINE: Bush Expected to Avoid Big Proposals in Speech 

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Having stabilized his political standing after a difficult 2005, President Bush is heading into his State of the Union address on Tuesday intent primarily on retaining his party's slim majority in Congress this year and completing unfinished business from his existing agenda.
 Unlike last year, when he used the occasion to kick off an ambitious and ultimately failed effort to overhaul Social Security, Mr. Bush seems unlikely to reshape the political landscape with his speech on Tuesday, members of both parties said.
Lawmakers said this election year would not be a good time to push difficult initiatives, and the White House has already shelved what it had initially planned as its big idea for 2006, a rewriting of the tax code.
 Administration officials and other Republicans in Washington said Mr. Bush would focus on several topics, including health care, spending restraint, illegal immigration and the nation's international economic competitiveness, as well as an unapologetic restatement of his national security policy. 
 Much of the speech, they said, will be tied together under a broad theme acknowledging that the United States is going through transitions that involve wrenching dislocation as well as opportunity. 
 His aides portray Mr. Bush as undaunted by the plague of setbacks last year that loosened his grip on his party and drove down his poll numbers, which, though up from their lows last fall, remain at anemic levels. They said he was intent on using the nationally televised address on Tuesday to set out a forceful agenda that he would use to draw sharp contrasts with Democrats.
 ''People don't sit around here wallowing and wondering if we should go the school uniform route because we had some challenges last year,'' said Nicolle Wallace, the White House communications director, referring to an initiative once championed by President Bill Clinton that has come to symbolize a retreat into small-bore leadership.
 ''The state of the union address will be directional for our party and our country, and visionary,'' Ms. Wallace said. ''That is not code for it lacking substance.''
 In the broadest sense, Mr. Bush's challenge is to demonstrate to both parties that he can still drive the national agenda despite the increasing difficulties he has had keeping Republicans together on domestic issues and in line with his assertively expansive view of his own wartime powers. 
 After five tumultuous years in office, he must show that his administration is not exhausted and bereft of ideas, and that the more ambitious goals he has set out at home and abroad have not crashed up against the nation's tolerance for ideological change.
 The president's main goals for the year appear to be showing progress in Iraq, the issue that more than any determines his public support, and doing all he can to help maintain Republican control of Congress in the fall elections.
 Part of that calculation, members of both parties said, is acknowledging that overreaching on legislative initiatives this year could carry outsized political risks, since the loss of even a few seats in either chamber could endanger his ability to get anything done for the remainder of his term. 
 ''We shouldn't underestimate the White House's ability to win a political campaign, so to the extent that success in November is his objective, this is his announcement speech, and an important one,'' said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, an organization of centrist Democrats.
 The speech is an opportunity for Mr. Bush to frame the legislative debates that will dominate Congress in coming months and provide ammunition for the fall elections. He has signaled that he will push hard for the extension of his tax cuts, arguing that failure to do so would amount to a tax increase that would endanger the economy. He is also fighting big fights over reauthorization of the antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act and legislation to stem illegal immigration.
 Aides said he also wanted to set out a broader vision of where the country should be heading and how it should get there.
 ''He views the times we are living in to be transformational, and with that comes great anxiety,'' said a senior administration official who is working closely with the president on the speech and who was granted anonymity in order to provide a glimpse of the speech's contents.
 Mr. Bush, the official said, will bring up topics like protectionism and isolationism to make a point that ''America is at its best when we are shaping events, not when we are being shaped by them, both in foreign policy and domestically.''
 The president goes into the speech having dealt to a large degree with the most acute political problems from the latter half of last year. One was the demoralization of his conservative base, whose enthusiasm could determine the control of Congress. The other was his loss of control last fall of the terms of the partisan debate over national security, the issue that more than any other has determined his political fortunes.
 The nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court, and the smooth handling of his confirmation process, has gone a long way toward calming social conservatives. Economic conservatives say they have been reassured by signals from the White House that Mr. Bush will tackle more directly their main area of concern, the rapid growth in government spending. 
 On the politics of national security, Mr. Bush has struck back forcefully after spending much of last year on the defensive, especially over the continued bloodshed in Iraq and his evolving rationales for taking the United States to war. 
 ''They're on their way up, and they're going to be slow and methodical about recovering the political capital and the ground they will need to advance more of their agenda,'' said Pat Toomey, a former Republican member of Congress who is now the president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee.
 Mr. Bush and other White House officials have issued broad hints about his 2006 agenda, especially a repackaged set of health care initiatives built on existing proposals. 
 The White House has signaled that Mr. Bush will highlight his support for expanding the tax deductibility of medical expenses for people who lack employer-provided insurance or who have out-of-pocket expenses. 
 Economists who have consulted with the administration on the issue said Mr. Bush might push for a tax credit for uninsured medical expenses that would be structured so that even people who pay little or nothing in federal income tax would receive it.
 Supporters of this proposal say it would mitigate a bias in the tax code that encourages employer-provided health insurance rather than individually purchased coverage.
 R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University and a former chief economist at the White House, and two other economists set forth the rationale in a recent book, ''Healthy, Wealthy and Wise.'' 
 If the government encourages people to buy individual insurance policies with lower premiums and higher co-payments, they said, consumers will ''make careful choices about their health care spending,'' and this, in turn, ''will significantly reduce the growths in health costs.''
 In his budget last year, Mr. Bush proposed a refundable tax credit for the cost of health insurance bought by individuals under 65. The Treasury estimated the 10-year cost at $74 billion. Mr. Bush also said that people should be allowed to take tax deductions for the premiums they paid for high-deductible health insurance plans. 
 People buy such plans when they establish health savings accounts to pay routine medical expenses. The Treasury said the proposed deduction would cost $28 billion over 10 years.
 On health care and other issues, however, Mr. Bush faces daunting hurdles. House Republicans are in the middle of a leadership fight that will not be concluded until after the State of the Union address. In addition, the criminal inquiry into bribery and corruption by lobbyists holds huge risks for Republicans. 
 Federal budget deficits limit the president's ability to undertake new programs. And members of his own party, especially in the Senate, are beginning to maneuver for advantage for the 2008 presidential race.
 ''You're starting to see the beginnings of a shift in the center of gravity away from Bush and his agenda toward the next agenda and the next leader of the party,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a conservative commentator who is often critical of the administration.

HEADLINE: Filings Show Spitzer's Allies In Big Business 

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 25 

 BODY:
Eliot Spitzer has not angered everybody in the business world.
 In fact, Mr. Spitzer, New York State's attorney general and the front-runner in the polls for this year's governor's race, has taken contributions from some of the biggest names in hedge funds, venture capital, real estate and commodities in building a $19 million war chest for his campaign nine months before the election.
That figure exceeds the $16.3 million that Gov. George E. Pataki had raised at this same point in 2002, when he enjoyed the formidable fund-raising powers of incumbency. In Mr. Spitzer's case, his campaign finance filings suggest the influence of his actions as attorney general on political donations in the race for governor. 
 Mr. Spitzer's donor list appears to lack support from veterans of Wall Street investment banks, though many of the banks are barred from contributing to state races. Those that can, including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, appear to have largely avoided the governor's race. Citigroup's political action committee, for instance, has contributed extensively to political candidates on both sides of the aisle in recent years. But in the current race for governor, it has contributed only $500, which went in 2003 to Randy A. Daniels, a Republican former secretary of state considered a long-shot candidate in the polls. 
 Mr. Spitzer's high-profile investigations of investment banks and of the New York Stock Exchange have helped his opponents raise Wall Street cash. Mr. Spitzer's campaign has been compensating in part by tapping managers of hedge funds, the secretive and lightly regulated investment pools that have proliferated in the past decade. 
 In fact, campaign finance filings detail the emergence of hedge funds as a force in political fund-raising, with many stars of the industry spreading their money around candidates in the governor's race. Three of the most highly paid managers gave to Mr. Spitzer, who has largely spared the industry from his prosecutorial zeal.
 ''I think he's a smart, honest guy,'' said Marc Lasry, founder of Avenue Capital, a prominent hedge fund, who has, along with his wife, contributed more than $25,000 to Mr. Spitzer's campaign. 
 Of Mr. Spitzer's investigations of the financial world, he said: ''I have a very simple view toward life: If you do things that are wrong, they're wrong, whether you're a hedge fund or not. I just like the fact that he's bright and committed.''
 The most vociferous voice against Mr. Spitzer on Wall Street has been Kenneth G. Langone, a former director of the New York Stock Exchange and co-founder of Home Depot. He has dedicated himself to raising money for Mr. Spitzer's potential Democratic rival, the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi. 
 One civic group that supports Mr. Spitzer recently calculated that friends and relatives of Mr. Langone, who is a constituent of Mr. Suozzi's, have already contributed more than half a million dollars. 
 ''Ken is reaching out to as many friends and associates and New Yorkers as he can,'' said a spokesman for Mr. Langone, Jim McCarthy, in an interview Wednesday.
 A case in point appears to be Stanley Druckenmiller, the hedge fund manager who was once the top lieutenant of George Soros, and who joined Mr. Langone in an attempted takeover of the stock exchange last year. In 2003, Mr. Druckenmiller and his wife, Fiona, contributed $50,000 to Mr. Spitzer. 
 More recently, however, the couple have contributed to anyone but Mr. Spitzer, giving $32,000 to Mr. Suozzi this month and, late last year, more than $48,000 to the leading Republican candidate, William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts.
 There was no response to a message left at Duquesne Capital, Mr. Druckenmiller's hedge fund.
 Mr. Langone's pique stems from the suit filed by Mr. Spitzer's office against Mr. Langone and Richard A. Grasso, the former chairman of the stock exchange. Mr. Spitzer has said Mr. Grasso's $139 million compensation package over eight years violates a state law related to oversight of nonprofit institutions. In a court filing on Tuesday, Mr. Langone asked that the suit be dismissed. 
 In a speech last month, Mr. Langone said Mr. Spitzer was motivated by ''raw ambition for pure political gain'' and said his actions had harmed New York's economy. 
 But Mr. Spitzer's donor list shows that he has found a wide range of supporters in the financial community: $5,000 from Nelson Peltz, the billionaire investor who has become a major investor in Wendy's; $40,000 from Lewis S. Ranieri, the chairman of Computer Associates and of the American Ballet Theater; $37,500 from Paul Fribourg, the chairman and chief executive of the commodities giant ContiGroup. 
 John Hummer, one of Silicon Valley's best known venture capitalists, has contributed $5,000, while Ira Rennert, the financier known for bringing the megamansion to the Hamptons, has given $50,000. Among real estate barons, Howard Milstein, a former owner of the New York Islanders, has given $50,000 since 2003, while Robert K. Futterman, who owns a leasing company, has given $5,000. Mr. Spitzer himself comes from a wealthy real estate family. 
 ''The business community around the state has always been supportive of Eliot, and they are excited about the prospect of him as the next governor,'' said Ryan Toohey, Mr. Spitzer's campaign manager.
 Among Mr. Spitzer's corporate donors are Wal-Mart, the insurer Aflac and even Taser, the maker of stun guns. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped an investigation of Taser related to statements it had made about the safety of its stun guns, but the S.E.C. continues to investigate trading in the company's stock. 
 Mr. Spitzer has also taken contributions from TD Waterhouse, which, as a discount brokerage, has not had the conflict-of-interest issues related to stock analysts, which have plagued the large investment banks. 
 Mr. Weld, whose most recent job has been at a Manhattan private investment firm, has raised his share from Wall Street in building a campaign balance of $1.8 million. 
 Among Mr. Weld's donations are $25,000 from Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, and his wife; and $7,500 from John C. Whitehead, the former Goldman Sachs chairman, who has his own feud with Mr. Spitzer. 
 Several of the biggest names among hedge fund managers are backing Mr. Spitzer, including Mr. Lasry as well as Richard Perry and James Simons, three of the 25 best-paid hedge fund managers, according to Institutional Investor, which tracks the industry. 
 But other hedge fund managers are looking elsewhere. Among Mr. Weld's contributions is more than $48,000 from one of the deans of the old guard among hedge investors, Julian H. Robertson Jr. 
 Mr. Suozzi's hedge fund backers include David Einhorn, who, along with his wife, has poured $100,000 into his campaign coffers, while another manager, Daniel S. Loeb, has contributed $50,000.

HEADLINE: American Buffalo: The Hunt Is On

BYLINE: By JOSHUA KURLANTZICK

 BODY:
LIKE many visitors to southern Montana, especially the region of the state adjacent to Yellowstone National Park, George Clement marveled at the vast wilderness of the West. On a cold day in the middle of November, Mr. Clement, his wife, Bonnie, and their two teenage sons walked down an old road about four miles from the park boundary. 
 ''The terrain was all wild prairie, with mountains surrounding it,'' said Mr. Clement, who lives in Belgrade, Mont., about 50 miles northwest of the park. ''No trees, just totally open.''
From the road, Mr. Clement and his two sons headed up and over one of the mountains. Then, through binoculars, they glimpsed a small group of buffalo on the plains in front of them, grazing in the tall sagebrush. The Clements marveled at the buffalo, massive beasts with full winter coats, some probably weighing a ton. 
 The Clements began to follow the buffalo, slowly moving through a series of ravines, which concealed them from the animals. ''We popped up out of a ravine and suddenly, we were face to face with a buffalo,'' Mr. Clement said.
 The animals stood their ground. And then one of the sons, 17-year-old Buddy, took aim. 
 ''My son shot one shot, and he put it exactly it was supposed to go -- at the base of the ear,'' Mr. Clement said. ''The animal kicked and he shot it twice more.''
 It took a while to realize the significance of that successful kill, since they were absorbed with gutting the animal. Only later, Mr. Clement recalled, did they realize that ''we'd been part of Montana history. How many times do you get to win the lottery?''
 The Clements aren't the only Montana hunters who feel like they've hit Powerball. This winter, for the first time in over a decade, Montana has allowed a small number of hunters to apply for a license to hunt bison (also known as buffalo), the legendary animal of the plains that was almost hunted to extinction. Buddy Clement was the only member of his family to receive a license.
 Scholars believe that at one point more than 30 million buffalo roamed the West. Indians revered the animal, praising its spirit in dances and seances and building their culture around buffalo. But westward expansion of the United States and an insatiable demand for bison hides led to large-scale buffalo massacres, decimating herds. 
 By the early 1900's, Yellowstone was home to only about 30 bison, and conservationists began efforts to revive the national treasure. As the historian Andrew Isenberg has written, Teddy Roosevelt even feared that the collapse of the buffalo population would neuter American masculinity, since men could no longer hunt big game in the United States.
 In recent decades, the buffalo population in Yellowstone, one of the last wild buffalo herds in North America, has been restored. It numbers near 5,000, and buffalo wander out of the park in the winter to feed on grass. Montana's cattle ranchers worry that the wandering buffalo could spread brucellosis, a disease that causes cows to abort.
 Seeking a solution, this winter Montana authorized its first buffalo hunt in 15 years, handing out 50 licenses. In coming years, Montana may increase the number. More than 6,000 hunters, including Gov. Brian Schweitzer and over 100 from out of state, entered a lottery for the licenses.
 The few winners seemed dumbfounded at their good fortune. (Mr. Schweitzer did not win.) ''I thought the chance to hunt buffalo would never come around in my lifetime,'' said one winner, Darrlyd Pepprock of Stevensville, Mont. 
 In the late 1980's, Montana also briefly allowed hunters to shoot buffalo wandering out of the park. At that time, game wardens guided the hunters so close they could shoot point-blank. This plan drew harsh criticism, because the guiding guaranteed hunters a kill, anathema to the ''fair chase'' hunters. 
 ''I wouldn't apply for the hunt in the late 1980's because I didn't like the way the hunt was organized,'' said Robert Waller of Bozeman, who applied and won a license this year. ''You might as well shoot a Hereford.'' 
 This time around, said Hal Harper, Governor Schweitzer's chief policy adviser, hunters were not guided and were not guaranteed a thing. ''We've made every effort to make this a fair chase hunt,'' he said.
 Like Civil War re-enactors, the community of hunters drawn for this year's hunt studied the past. Before their hunts, Mr. Pepprock and Jim Kinsey, two lottery winners, read accounts of settlers who had hunted on the Plains. Other hunters have scoured the Internet for research on Indian buffalo hunts, or studied ways to sneak up on bison. 
 ''It's a very personal thing,'' said Rich Clough of Choteau, Mont., who won a license. ''It's taking an animal without them ever knowing you're there.''
 Thomas Blazina of Billings, a license winner, also embraced the past. After researching the buffalo's history, Mr. Blazina said, ''We bought an 1895 Winchester rifle -- the type Teddy Roosevelt used, and that's what we're going to use.'' 
 Mr. Blazina even decided to hunt on horseback, to better approximate the 1800's. 
 SOME hunters applied for the buffalo license not to fulfill a romantic vision of the 1800's but to fill their freezers (cooking kills the brucellosis bacteria). ''My wife and my daughters and I all hunt,'' Mr. Pepprock said. ''Our family is sustained on game meat, one hundred percent.'' 
 He said he shot a bison bull that weighed about 1,800 pounds, which will feed his family for a year. (By comparison, elk he hunts weigh some 600 pounds.) ''All our friends and family are asking for it, so we've had to give gift packages of meat,'' he added.
 Robert DeLong, a Great Falls, Mont., hunter who won a license, sounded a theme that could be heard at any suburban Whole Foods. ''If you buy bison meat, you don't know if they have hormones in them,'' he said. ''This is all natural. We do our own butchering and we have a walk-in cooler. The meat is real high in omega-3 acids. I'm an older person, and I need that.''
 Mr. DeLong uses the entire animal. ''It's amazing how big the tongue is,'' he said. ''You take it and you boil it, skin it, and then slice it. Add horseradish and, man, you've got a good sandwich.''
 Despite the hunters' excitement, and efforts to make this hunt a fair chase, protests still have erupted throughout the Montana winter. One group, the Buffalo Field Campaign, has not only petitioned the governor against the bison hunt but also shot video of sportsmen with their bison kills, to document the hunt.
 Mike Mease, head of the Buffalo Field Campaign, and a subsistence hunter himself, says the hunt is an unfair slaughter. Because the buffalo spend much of the year in Yellowstone, where they interact closely with tourists, they are not truly wild, he said.
 ''The state wants them to walk outside Yellowstone for three months and be fair chase, then walk into Yellowstone and be docile for tourists,'' Mr. Mease said. ''You can't train these animals to do both.'' 
 Instead, he said, the state should enlarge the buffalo habitat, giving the animals access to more year-round land outside the park -- land normally used by the cattle industry -- so that the buffalo become as wild as possible.
 Some Montana hunters agree. ''It's still just another parklike hunt,'' said Joe Gutkowski, who was once named the toughest man in the West by Field & Stream magazine. ''I want to see them allow these buffalo to migrate all over public land.''
 The debate clearly still divides the community; when the Bear Creek Council, a Montana conservation group, held a public forum in December on the bison hunt, it drew apacked house and a fiery discussion. But, said Chris Marchion, president of the Montana Wildlife Federation, a sportsman's group, even if some Yellowstone buffalo have been tamed, if hunts continue, animals will become more wary of hunters -- which he says has happened with elk.
 THE hunt can at times seem cruel. Buffalo often gather around a fallen animal, an attempt to protect their peers that can resemble mourning. Several hunters this winter said they saw bison walking over to the bloodied bodies and prodding them, as if trying to revive the animals, before hunters shooed them off. 
 Still, interactions between the Field Campaign and hunters have been peaceful, a contrast with the late 1980's and early 1990's, when hunters and protesters were confrontational, and some protesters were charged with misdemeanor assault. 
 ''I assure them I won't get in their way, but I will document,'' Mr. Mease said. ''We're not an anti-hunting group. There's a big potential for these hunters to be allies in the future, and we're not against a hunt down the road. Hunters can advocate for the habitat of the species they hunt.''
 Some hunters and conservationists have begun making these linkages. Over the last two decades, as ranching has become less viable in the Great Plains, human populations in Montana and other parts of the Plains have plummeted, allowing for the revival of wildlife like pronghorn antelope.
 Across southern Montana, in fact, small towns are littered with boarded-up storefronts and the detritus of old industrial and ranching operations. Many homes look abandoned, their yards covered in weeds.
 As the Plains have become depopulated, with social services closing down, conservationists, sportsmen and academics have developed a concept called the Buffalo Commons -- an idea first proposed by the land-use specialists Frank and Deborah Popper. In the Buffalo Commons idea, much of the Great Plains would be returned to the way it was before 19th-century settlement, a wild frontier. Creating the Buffalo Commons also would prevent the land from being controlled by large private owners, who often keep hunters off their land.
 Already, conservationist groups like the American Prairie Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund have begun buying land in the Great Plains to create a prairie-based preserve, full of bison herds and other native wildlife. Some advocates think hunting could be used to help manage the Buffalo Commons, with sportsmen coming from all over the world to shoot big game in a truly wild landscape, plowing money into the Montana economy.
 ''We don't want a hunting preserve, strictly, but hunting would be permitted,'' said Sean Gerrity, president of the American Prairie Foundation.
 There is a precedent. In the 19th century, European nobles went on safari not only to Africa but also to America's Great Plains, sometimes employing Indians as guides.
 According to Nebraskaland magazine, in one famous case, Grand Duke Alexis, a Russian nobleman, arrived in rural Nebraska in 1872 with other nobles and a retinue of servants lugging the duke's Champagne. Buffalo Bill Cody and Sioux warriors led the duke around the frontier, until Alexis took down a buffalo with Cody's personal rifle, the Lucretia Borgia. After the hunt, Alexis put his booze to good use, and the Russians and the Americans partied the night away.
 It could happen again.
 ''I want the Plains to be a Serengeti-type landscape of large mammals and carnivores, unparalleled in the U.S.,'' said Glenn Hockett of the Gallatin Wildlife Association, a Montana group of sportsmen and conservationists. ''Then we can treat these buffalo like elephants, like the really majestic animals they are.''

A Guide for the Modern Buffalo Bill

GETTING A LICENSE
 This winter, the buffalo hunt season in Montana was divided in two parts. The first 25 licenses were given out for hunting one male or female bison between Nov. 15 and Jan. 15. The second 25 were for Jan. 15 to Feb. 15. This year, 16 of those licenses were given to Indian tribes. Some went to people who had applied for previous hunts and the rest -- 24 -- were awarded by lottery. 
 Almost 6,200 hunters, from Montana and from other states, applied for the hunt. It is likely that next season will operate along similar guidelines and times, though more licenses may be given out. Applications and licenses can be processed online by first going to the Web site for Montana's Fish, Wildlife and Parks: www.fwp.mt.gov.
 Working with outfitters, it is possible to hunt buffalo on large ranches in Montana, though hunters are divided over whether these ranches offer a ''fair chase'' hunt. Hunters who choose the ranch option normally avoid the spring and early summer, when bull buffalo shed their coats and make less attractive trophies. 
 Outfitters say that bison normally yield 30 to 35 percent of their actual weight in meat, so from a 1,800-pound animal, you'll get roughly 600 pounds of meat. 

OUTFITTERS AND OPERATORS
 Anyone shooting a buffalo will need help skinning the massive animal, cutting it into pieces and carrying it to a road. For hunters who received licenses this year, the Fish, Wildlife and Parks agency gave a required course on how to stalk, shoot and butcher a buffalo. 
 Arnaud Outfitting (406-763-4235, www.arnaudoutfitting.com), in Gallatin, takes clients to the Flying D, a ranch owned by Ted Turner with more than 110,000 acres adjacent to Gallatin National Forest, for bison hunts. One-day guided hunts for a trophy bull buffalo cost $4,000; yearlings are cheaper, from $750 each. Arnaud normally leads hunts from June through January. 
 Cowboy Heaven Consulting, in Bozeman (406-587-9563, www.cowboyhvn.com), also runs hunts at the Flying D throughout the year, though it normally does not guide bull hunts from January through May, when the animals are shedding. Trophy bulls cost $4,000.

HOW TO GET THERE
 United flies from New York to Bozeman through Denver. In late January, round-trip flights for late February cost about $585. Northwest flies from Newark to Bozeman through Minneapolis for roughly the same price. 
 From Bozeman, you will have to rent a car. Gardiner, at the north entrance of Yellowstone National Park, is a good base to stalk bison if you have a license; herds wander right past town. Gardiner is about two hours by car from Bozeman. Gallatin is some 20 minutes outside Bozeman. 

WHERE TO STAY
 Gardiner has many motels catering to park visitors. The Yellowstone Village Inn (800-228-8158, www.yellowstonevinn.com), has 43 rooms, including 3 kitchen suites, from $42 in winter. 
 In Gallatin, also full of motels, the Gallatin Gateway Inn (800-676-3522, www.gallatingatewayinn.com), built to serve the old scenic railroad into Yellowstone, is probably the classiest option, with one of the best restaurants in the region. In late January, the 33 rooms started at $89 (the inn is closed Tuesday and Wednesday in much of winter).

HEADLINE: Everybody Into the (Water Park) Pool

BYLINE: By CINDY PRICE

 BODY:
IT'S 8 p.m. at the Great Wolf Lodge, and the hotel is hopping. ''We hope you enjoy your stay, and keep an eye out,'' the receptionist chirps brightly. ''It's about to start snowing in the lobby!'' 
 That might be a curious notion for most hotels, but at Great Wolf, the newly opened $92-million resort in the Pocono Mountains, it's just another wacky twist on the elements. What's a little holiday snowfall in the lobby when you have a 78,000-square-foot water park in the next room?
Get ready, Northeasterners. A rush of new indoor water park resorts, a booming trend in the Midwest for the last decade, is now hitting the East Coast. What began as a quirky fad in western Canada in the mid-80's, spread to the Wisconsin Dells in 1994 and gathered speed in the late 90's in places like Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio, has officially moved in. It's the latest growth spurt for the indoor water-park industry, which analysts say will be worth an estimated $4.8 billion by the end of this year, a huge increase over the $700 million estimated in 2000. 
 In addition to Great Wolf Lodge, which opened on Nov. 1 in Scotrun, Pa., Great Wolf Resorts will open lodges in Cincinnati and in Niagara Falls, Ontario, in 2006. And next month, Six Flags plans to open its own indoor water-park resort, the Great Escape and Splashwater Kingdom, in Lake George, N.Y. Even New York City may be getting into the act -- the Parks Department and Randalls Island Sports Foundation's proposed $168 million East River water park includes a 7.25-acre indoor section. Cutting-edge culture might begin on the coasts and move to the center, but when it comes to family-oriented resorts, the landlocked are paving the way. 
 Winding up the woodsy road leading to Great Wolf's 95-acre property, flanked by the Camelback Mountains and the tiny town of Scotrun, a visitor's first sight of the mammoth 401-suite lodge is a bit like stumbling upon the Pentagon.
 Even with all that space, the hotel has been breaking company reservation records since it opened, according to Mike Ryan, the assistant general manager. ''Most of the guests are arriving from New York, New Jersey or Pennsylvania, and it's not families of four, either. It's groups of five, six, seven coming in together.'' 
 The hotel's general manager, Dale McFarland, indicated the same in a telephone interview.
 ''They call it 'togethering' '' he said, using the travel-industry term for families that vacation with other families or with relatives. For Sherrie Martin of Bethlehem, Pa., the resort is a good solution to the problems raised by her 11-year-old daughter Caroline's wintertime birthday. ''What are you going to do?'' Ms. Martin said. ''This just seemed perfect.''
 How much do kids love water parks? It's hard to gauge, of course, but common sense says ''a lot.'' Mr. Ryan said that for a photo session before Wolf Lodge's opening, local children from elementary schools were invited to come free. ''The call time was 5 a.m. on a weekday,'' he said with a laugh, ''and the lines were still out the door.''
 FROM the lobby window overlooking the water park, it's easy to see the appeal. Spread out before you is a gargantuan collection of slides, pools and play areas in every size, shape and color. Front and center is Fort Mackenzie, a 20-level tree house with two body slides, an enormous dump bucket holding 1,000 gallons of water and 60-plus interactive water apparatuses. (I find out the hard way that the term means an arsenal of water guns commandeered by 12-year-old boys.)
 Both the air and the 380,000 gallons of water running throughout the enclosed space are kept at 84 degrees year-round. There's a huge activity pool, with kids playing water basketball or crossing monkey bars, a wave pool, a lazy river, an ankle-deep kiddie pool and even an adults-only jumbo whirlpool.
 But rising up in the distance, a big blue monster slide makes it clear who's top dog: the Hydro Plunge, a rollercoaster that alternates between a motorized track and a free-fall water slide. Every 30 seconds, a big yellow sausage-shaped tube goes whooshing down holding three people, their screams of delight echoing across the park. And with a 57-foot drop involved, those sounds aren't coming only from the mouths of babes. 
 ''Can you believe this place?!'' a father, dripping wet and holding his daughter's hand, shouted at the top of the Hydro Plunge. ''And they got a bar downstairs?!''
 Another doozy of a slide is the Coyote Canyon -- more commonly referred to by the kids as the ''toilet bowl'' -- an enclosed chute that funnels into a bowl that resembles a gigantic turnip. Here, riders are propelled into the bowl with such force that they are slung around the rim of the bowl about three times before being flushed down the small opening that leads into the exit slide. 
 There are also three twisting, enclosed slides called Alberta Falls, two of which actually go through the building's wall and put the rider outside, albeit enclosed in a tube, for part of the ride. ''No, you don't feel a temperature change,'' Mr. Ryan said. Apparently, everyone asks.
 Like most recently opened resorts, Great Wolf has some kinks to work out. There's no map of the water park, and the food, mostly buffet, is a bit uninspired. But management insists that the buffet format works well because of the sheer volume of business. It also, of course, keeps a hungry family's costs down, and the food and drink are priced quite reasonably. 
 AS night falls, couples linger at the bar and keep an eye on their children scampering around the lobby in pajamas or sitting Indian-style by the fireplace for story time with Biko the Bear. 
 The sense of enclosure at Great Wolf -- to get into the water park, you must be a hotel guest -- lends it an air of safety, almost as if it were a cruise ship. For Bill and BethAnn Wheeler and Greg Feretti, friends with four children between them, that means they could enjoy a beer at the bar while their kids played upstairs in the room. As Mr. Feretti said: ''They thought of everything. If I had $80 million, I'd have built it myself.''
 Industry analysts will be watching to see if the high cost of building and maintaining indoor water parks like Great Wolf will hinder their success in the Northeast. But Bill Haralson, an economic consultant who has been tracking the growth of indoor water-park resorts for years, says that this is just the tip of the iceberg.
 ''The water-park resort is a component of the lodging business, not the water-park business,'' Mr. Haralson said. ''It imbues the resort with entertainment value that can be made available every day of the year, not just when the weather cooperates.'' 
 In his 2005 water-park construction report, Mr. Haralson pointed to the marked growth in the indoor water-park resort industry, especially when compared to the recent stagnation of general hotel openings. Hotels with indoor water parks are growing from 28 to 36 percent annually, while the overall hotel industry expects new supply to grow less than 1 percent in 2005 and 2006. ''In 2000, there were only 18 hotel water-park resorts,'' he said. ''Today, over 100 are open nationwide.''
 The adults in suits will crunch the numbers, but for the kids about to hit the park, the verdict is in. In the words of the birthday girl, Caroline Martin, 11, hopping from one foot to the other in anticipation, ''It's going to be awesome.''

WATER WORLD

Broadway

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring Jonathan Pryce and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Eileen Atkins), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Ron Eldard), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street; (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Judy Kuhn replaces Maria Friedman from Feb. 14 through March 26. Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street; (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'ALMOST, MAINE' John Cariani's comedy comprises almost a dozen two-character vignettes exploring the sudden thunderclap of love and the scorched earth that sometimes follows. It will evoke either ''awww's'' or ''ick's,'' depending on your affection for its whimsical approach to the joys and perils of romance (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' A crisp outline of the Pulitzer Prizewinner Nilo Cruz's new play suggests the crazy-quilt melodramas of early Almodovar: Father and daughter are attracted to the same sexy bad boy, igniting all manner of emotional fireworks. But Mr. Cruz's reflective, unhurried pace and his meandering, lyrical dialogue allow his fuses to burn a little too long, resulting in more fizzle than flash (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street; (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)

'CANDIDA' The two men -- David Tillistrand as Candida's husband, and Danaher Dempsey as the sniveling poet who falls under her spell -- aren't strong enough to make this a great ''Candida,'' but Shaw's insights still shine a century after he wrote the play, and the director, Michael Halberstam, manages to draw some good laughs in the third act (1:55). Jean Cocteau Repertory, at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village; (212) 279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district; (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton; (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'FUNNYHOUSE OF A NEGRO' Adrienne Kennedy's one-act nightmare from 1964, about a young black woman obsessed with whiteness, is still innovative theater, but it also plays as a period piece, making it doubly interesting (50 minutes). Harlem School of the Arts, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, Hamilton Heights; (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'HECUBA' At an intermissionless 90 minutes, this rendition of Euripides' tragedy is fairly painless -- though that's not necessarily a good thing (1:30). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village; (212) 598-9802. (Genzlinger)

* '(I AM) NOBODY'S LUNCH' The elusive nature of truth in a culture swamped with stuff that looks, sounds and smells like information -- but may be something a little more suspicious -- is the serious subject of this merrily unserious, vaudevillian romp through the anxious chatter of contemporary America. Snappy, scrappy and performed with a youthful blend of earnestness and deadpan razzmatazz by the buzzed-about downtown troupe the Civilians (1:30). 59E59, 59 East 59th Street; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street; (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Lean, mean and about as deep as a shot glass, Diane the Hollywood agent is just the tonic New York theatergoers need in the depths of an urban winter. Played by Julie White in an irresistible adrenaline rush of a performance, Diane is the arch-manipulator in Douglas Carter Beane's tangy fable of fame and its discontents, directed by Scott Ellis. With Neal Huff as a closeted Hollywood star, and Johnny Galecki as the rent boy who loves him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212) 246-4422. (Brantley)

'LOVELY DAY' Tiresome evening (1:15). Beckett Theater, Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

*'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project @ 45 Bleecker, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village; (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt)

'HARVEST' Manjula Padmanabhan's sci-fi parable is a dark fantasy about a high-tech racket in body organs -- a cross between the 2002 thriller ''Dirty Pretty Things'' and an episode of ''The Twilight Zone.'' Based in Delhi, India, Ms. Padmanabhan wrote the play in 1996; this is its New York premiere (1:25). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710. (Phoebe Hoban)

* 'MAJOR BANG OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE DIRTY BOMB' This disarming exercise in political cabaret demonstrates that laughter in the dark need not be desperate. Written by Kirk Lynn, this multilevel, multiform tale of nuclear anxiety resurrects the sane, inquisitive satiric spirit of the early 1960's, a time when irony was a strategic tool instead of a conditioned reflex. Paul Lazar directs Steve Cuiffo and Maggie Hoffman in a multitude of roles (1:10). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn; (718) 254-8779. (Brantley)

* 'ZOMBOID! (FILM/PERFORMANCe PROJECT #1)' O, the heresy of it! Richard Foreman has introduced film into the realm of exquisitely artificial, abstract theater in which he has specialized for four decades. As it turns out, juxtaposing two art forms allows Mr. Foreman to underscore in resonant new ways what he has been saying for years: reality is, well, relative. And he continues to work in a style guaranteed to infect your perceptions for hours after (1:15). Ontological-Hysteric Theater, 131 East 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ANTON' It is one thing to write a play about Anton Chekhov's last four years, quite another to attempt the master's style, then produce and direct it and portray the title character. Though Pierre van der Spuy's reach far exceeds his grasp, he deserves some credit for trying (2:15). Greenwich Street Theater, 547 Greenwich Street, between Charlton and Vandam Streets, South Village; (212) 352-3101; closing Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)

*'THE END OF REALITY' Violence isn't pretty in the listless but eventful world of Richard Maxwell's hypnotic new play. It's not ugly, either. In this latest work from the king of affecting disaffection, violence doesn't so much explode as drip, like water from a leaky faucet, into the lives of lonely, hapless security guards. Mr. Maxwell's most eloquent statement to date about the blurring of despair and apathy in American lives (1:40). The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

'GONER' The president is shot, and the world's worst doctors get the job of trying to save him in this very funny bit of sketch comedy disguised as a play. Bad taste seems not to be an issue for the author, Brian Parks, but most of the lunacy is inspired enough that you can forgive the insensitivity (1:15). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'HOUSE OF DESIRE' This 300-year-old farce, written by a nun, mostly proves that Baroque women were just as capable as Baroque men of producing forgettable plays. It's sometimes fun watching the energetic young actors trying to breathe life into it, though, especially during a smashing sword fight conducted in semi-darkness (2:10). Storm Theater, 145 West 46th Street; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'MAJOR BARBARA' George Bernard Shaw's polemic against the military-industrial complex and organized religion is still timely 100 years later, and though the director Brooke O'Harra's Kabuki-tinged version lands on the mark and misses it about equally, there is something true and real about the production that is worth seeing (2:35). La MaMa Annex Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing Sunday. (Stevens)

'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street; (212) 719-1300; closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street; (212) 719-1300; closing Sunday. (Brantley)

'WHAT THEN' Even if Rinne Groff's playful play about environmental disaster is occasionally labored, there's never any doubt that there's an active, lively intelligence at work (1:30). Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo; (212) 868-4444; closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Stephen Holden)

* 'CACHE (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (A. O. Scott)

* 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)

'END OF THE SPEAR' (PG-13, 112 minutes) This fact-based story of conflict and resolution between a primitive warrior tribe in Ecuador and North American missionaries in the mid-1950's is inspiring enough to make you wish that the sentimental excesses of this Kiplingesque tale had been reined in. (Holden)

* 'THE FALL OF FUJIMORI' (No rating, 83 minutes, in English and Spanish) Ellen Perry's examination of Alberto Fujimori, who ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000, is a complex study in the psychology of power and also an unsettling examination of the risks that fighting terrorism can pose to democratic institutions and values. (Scott)

'GLORY ROAD' (PG, 109 minutes) The true story, more or less, of the 1966 Texas Western College basketball team -- the first all-black starting five to play in an N.C.A.A. final. By the numbers, but inspiring all the same. (Scott)

'GO FOR ZUCKER' (No rating, 95 minutes, in German) In this German-Jewish comedy, factions of a divided family, half Orthodox Jewish and half secular, join forces to collect an inheritance. It might be described as a hybrid of the much funnier French farce ''La Cage aux Folles'' and the recent Israeli film ''Ushpizin.'' (Holden)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Manohla Dargis)

'HOODWINKED' (PG, 81 minutes) Little Red Riding Hood is deconstructed in this sub-''Shrek'' bummer, the latest collaboration between computers and cynicism. (Nathan Lee)

'HOSTEL' (R, 95 minutes) Two ugly Americans rampage through Europe before finding themselves ensnared in an underground Slovakian snuff club. The calculated outrages of this brutal exploitation film prove less shocking than its relentless bigotry. (Lee)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

'THE LAST HOLIDAY' (PG-13, 112 minutes) Based on a 1950 British film, Wayne Wang's comedy about a gentle soul who learns to live only after learning of her imminent death is one of those generic wish-fulfillment flicks in which the soul in question actualizes her goals through perseverance and pluck. The star Queen Latifah charms, but even she can't gold-plate junk. (Dargis)

'LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD' (PG-13, 98 minutes) Albert Brooks takes his anxious, cerebral act on the road, to India and Pakistan. Great satiric potential, most of it squandered after a hilarious opening. (Scott)

* 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)

'THE MATADOR' (R, 96 minutes) Pithy remarks put into the mouth of a star (Pierce Brosnan) playing against type impart a greasy sheen of sophistication to this weightless, amoral romp about a professional hit man facing a midlife crisis. (Holden)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

* 'MUNICH' (R, 164 minutes) With his latest, Steven Spielberg forgoes the emotional bullying and pop thrills that come so easily to him to tell the story of a campaign of vengeance that Israel purportedly brought against Palestinian terrorists in the wake of the 1972 Olympics. An unsparingly brutal look at two peoples all but drowning in a sea of their own blood, ''Munich'' is by far the toughest film of the director's career, and the most anguished. (Dargis)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

'TRISTAN & ISOLDE' (PG-13, 125 minutes) The lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. A pleasant entertainment from the director Kevin Reynolds that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more. (Dargis)

'24 HOURS ON CRAIGSLIST' (No rating, 82 minutes) Directed (kind of) and produced by Michael Ferris Gibson, a disorganized if watchable stroll through human desire as manifested on the popular Web site (three billion page views each month). (Dargis)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (R, 106 minutes) In this sequel to ''Underworld'' (2003), the writer and director Len Wiseman and the writer Danny McBride pick up the story of the vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) as they race to prevent the release of an imprisoned uber-werewolf. With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them, and a cinematographer who shoots everything through the same steel-blue filter, ''Underworld: Evolution'' is little more than a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)

Film Series

ANOTHER SPANISH CINEMA: FILMS IN CATALUNYA 1906-2006 (Through Feb. 14) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's retrospective of Catalan film begins tonight with Isabel Coixet's ''Secret Life of Words'' (2005), starring Sarah Polley, Julie Christie and Javier Camara.

Simone Bitton's ''Wall,'' about the Israeli-Palestinian security/separation fence, won a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival. Tahani Rached's ''Soraida, Woman of Palestine'' is about the everyday life of a Ramallah resident. ''Another Road Home,'' by the Israeli filmmaker Danae Elon, looks at Ms. Elon's relationship with the Muslim Palestinian man who was her caregiver. Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $10. (Gates)

FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Through Feb. 12) This year the theme of the Museum of the Moving Image and the New York Film Critics Circle's series is the experience of being a stranger in a strange land. This weekend's films are ''Zabriskie Point'' (1970), Michelangelo Antonioni's portrait of alienated American youth in the late 1960's, selected by J. Hoberman, and ''Stroszek'' (1977), Werner Herzog's drama about Europeans in Wisconsin, selected by Michael Atkinson.

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, M1 (Tonight) The Atlanta hip-hop group Arrested Development's decidedly preachy new-soul peaked too early to make it part of the rise of the ''Dirty South'' style, but it carried the kind of positive messages that characterized lots of early 1990's bohemian rap. M1 is half of the political rap group Dead Prez. 7:30, Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $25. (Laura Sinagra)

BABY DAYLINER (Tonight) Baby Dayliner is the stage name of Ethan Marunas, a keyboard-driven one-man band. He sets up percolating electropop patterns to back neo-cabaret songs that can be droll and cynical or stylishly heartsick. 7:30, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, between Rivington and Stanton Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 420-1466; $8. (Jon Pareles)

BLACK DICE, GANG GANG DANCE (Tomorrow) The experimental band Black Dice expands its palette of sharp noise to include ominous electronic glitches, warped meta-blues and churning tribal bursts. The outre, art-folk quartet Gang Gang Dance also plays. 8 p.m., Syrup Room, 100 Ingraham Street, at Knickerbocker Avenue, East Williamsburg Industrial Park, Brooklyn, (917) 608-2467; $10. (Sinagra)

BOBBY (BLUE) BLAND (Sunday) Bobby (Blue) Bland's voice is a cornerstone of Memphis soul singing. In tones that are velvety, humble and long-suffering, he begs for affection with suave melancholy and smoldering fury. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25. (Pareles)

BLUE OYSTER CULT (Tonight) When science fiction met heavy metal and lighthearted fetishism in Blue Oyster Cult songs of the 70's like ''Cities on Flame With Rock 'n' Roll,'' ''(Don't Fear) the Reaper,'' ''Godzilla'' and ''Dominance and Submission,'' it hardly mattered whether the band's original intentions were tongue-in-cheek. Its post-Zeppelin, pre-punk riffs and its wild-eyed lyrics still sound good. 6 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $27.50 and $32. (Pareles)

BLUES FALLIN' DOWN LIKE RAIN: THE MUSIC OF CHARLEY PATTON (Wednesday) This New York Guitar Festival tribute to the music of the Delta country blues master Charley Patton features John Hammond, Rory Block, Dave Tronzo, Toshi Reagon and Harry Manx. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3303; $35. (Sinagra)

BONGA'S VODOU DRUMS OF HAITI (Tomorrow) This group of drummers and rhythmic dancers led by Bonga Jean-Baptiste, a former member of the Haitian voodoo-rock band Boukman Eksperyans, performs in a more ritualistic, spiritually inspired Afro-Haitian style. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, at Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 218-6934; no cover. (Sinagra)

BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE (Tonight and tomorrow night) This Canadian collective makes heartbreak music that sounds like a fuzzy, drunken party. Some prefer its diffuse anthemic feints to the straight-up anthems of its countrymen Arcade Fire. Members have included the Stars' Evan Cranley, Metric's Emily Haines and the multitalented singer-songwriter Leslie Feist. 6, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $25 (sold out). (Sinagra)

EVAN DANDO (Tomorrow) After spending the late 1990's in exile, this alt-pop heartthrob has cleaned up his act and taken tentative steps back into the limelight with solo projects and some revisiting of old hits and matter-of-fact melodicism. 10 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; $15. (Sinagra)

DEERHOOF (Monday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors affection in equal parts for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop and outsider naif art like that of the Shaggs. Its latest material is more pacific than earlier work, which included an electronically augmented fractured fairy tale about a kidnapping milkman. 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $13 (sold out). (Sinagra)

BO DIDDLEY (Thursday) When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love?,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer. Behind them is a profound education in the blues. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $32.50 in advance, $35 at the door. (Pareles)

DR. DOG, SAM CHAMPION (Tonight) The lo-fi Philly band Dr. Dog plays likably shaggy rock. The local indie rockers Sam Champion harken back to the slacker ennui of 90's bands like Pavement. 9:30, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)

DUB NOMADS VS DR. ISRAEL & DREADTONE (Tomorrow) The reggae singer Dr. Israel makes dark dubs that introduce elements of jungle and hard rock. The Dub Nomads layer deep dub sonics over hard beats. 10 p.m., BPM, 237 Kent Avenue, between Grand and North First Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (no phone); $8. (Sinagra)

FIELD MUSIC (Tomorrow) One of the new British bands, Field Music sounds like a poppier version of the neo-post-punk garage music in vogue of late. 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $10. (Sinagra)

FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE (Tomorrow) Still underappreciated even after the 2002 fluke MTV smash hit ''Stacey's Mom,'' these 30-something New York City songwriters continue to write some of the best pure pop ditties and smartest yuppie satires around. 8:30 p.m., Allen Room at Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800;$30 to $55. (Sinagra)

ELY GUERRA (Wednesday) Ely Guerra is one of the most intriguing songwriters in Mexican rock. Ms. Guerra sings about passion: gazing at it from a distance, then plunging into the turbulence. Her songs incorporate rock, funk, electronica and the torchy emotion of Mexican pop in a shifting balance of poise and obsession. 8 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940 or (718) 965-9177; $18 in advance, $22 at the door. (Pareles)

ISAAC HAYES (Thursday) Isaac Hayes helped shape the Memphis sound at Stax in the 60's, capturing the churning urban agitation of the 70's with his funky ''Shaft'' soundtrack; he continues to contribute to current R & B projects. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800, $37.50 in advance, $40 at the door. (Sinagra)

BILLY JOEL (Thursday) The iconic piano man recently released a boxed set celebrating four decades of his music. From ''Just the Way You Are'' to ''Allentown,'' it's the trademark mix of real confidence and false bravado, in both his playing and his delivery, that keeps him compelling. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $54 (sold out) to $89.50. (Sinagra)

LEZ ZEPPELIN (Tonight) Strapping on the double-necked Gibson with attitude to burn, this all-girl quartet pays tribute to its swaggering namesake Led Zeppelin, ripping through the catalog with blazing accuracy. Of course, they also have their gender-bending way with macho metaphors about squeezed lemons and dripping honey. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; $15. (Sinagra)

JONI MITCHELL TRIBUTE (Wednesday) This tantalizingly diverse tribute to the folk-rock songwriter Joni Mitchell, a benefit for the Music for Youth Foundation, includes artists ranging from Bebel Gilberto and Bettye LaVette to the Eels and Joseph Arthur. 8 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30 to $225. (Sinagra)

MORRIS DAY AND THE TIME, SHARON JONES AND THE DAP KINGS (Tomorrow) Minneapolis's ''Jungle Love'' hit makers are still pumping their keyboard-based grooves, with the dapperly overdone Morris Day out front and his trusty ''valet'' Jerome Benton by his side. The stirring singer Sharon Jones coaxes joy and pain while the Dap Kings supply 60's soul grooves. 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $35. (Sinagra)

THE NATIONAL, CAGE, CELEBRATION, BEANS (Thursday) The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who turn out a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. A longtime fixture on the indie rap scene, Cage often recalls his fractured childhood and rough upbringing. Celebration's noisy rock is a vehicle for the vocalist Katrina Ford's guttural acrobatics. The rapid-fire rapper Beans is also on the bill. 7 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600; $20. (Sinagra)

THE PLASTIC CONSTELLATIONS (Tuesday) The Minneapolis rockers the Plastic Constellations play exuberant, metal-infused emo with vocals that harken back to shouty bands like Fugazi and At the Drive In. 6:30 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $8 in advance, $10 at the door.(Sinagra)

RAKIM (Monday) One of hip-hop's most commading MC's, Rakim did his best work with DJ Eric B. in the late 80's and early 90's, but his cool, confident flow is still one to beat. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)

TOSHI REAGON (Tonight and Tomorrow night) Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. 9, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Pareles)

WORLD/INFERNO FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY (Tonight) This cacophonous indie collective creates a kind of industrial mazurka fanfare. 11:30, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $10. (Sinagra)

Cabaret

Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

BABY JANE DEXTER (Tonight and tomorrow night) This booming pop-blues contralto may not be demure, but she is tasteful in a smart, regal, big-mama way, and she is astute in her choices of often obscure soul, blues and jazz songs that play to her contradictory mixture of the lusty and the philosophical. 7, Helen's, 169 Eighth Avenue, near 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-0609; $20 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Stephen Holden)

Andrea Marcovicci (Tonight and tomorrow night) In her spellbinding retrospective ''I'll Be Seeing You Love Songs of World War II,'' Ms. Marcovicci balances nostalgia for songs associated with ''the good war'' with acknowledgment of the real pain and sacrifice that inspired so many of them, providing a dusting of reality. 9 and 11:30, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 419-9331; $65 cover, with a required $60 prix-fixe dinner at the early shows; $20 minimum required for the late shows.

COLLEGIATE CHORALE (Monday) This company is eager to put itself on the map and keeps coming up with new ways to do it. Here's one: offer a couple of fine sopranos who seem underappreciated at the Met these days, Hei-Kyung Hong and Aprile Millo, in a Puccini one-acter (''Le Villi'') and the last act of that composer's final masterpiece (''Turandot'') with a new ending by Luciano Berio. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $25 to $155. (Anne Midgette)

'COSI FAN TUTTE' (Tomorrow) This is the ultimate ensemble opera and the Met's revival of its sunny and simple 1996 production this fall was an impressive effort from a young, attractive and gifted cast. ''Cosi'' has returned this month, with all but two members of that cast. The bright-voiced soprano Alexandra Deshorties takes the place of Barbara Frittoli as Fiordiligi. The engaging mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena again sings her sister, Dorabella. The lyric tenor Paul Groves, taking the place of Matthew Polenzani, and the robust baritone Mariusz Kwiecien (a star in the making) portray the young men who cruelly test the fidelity of the two sisters. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $220 tickets remaining. (Anthony Tommasini)

'DEAD MAN WALKING' (Tuesday) Jake Heggie's opera is based on a true story by Sister Helen Prejean.

'THE MERRY NIBELUNGS' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This Oscar Straus operetta spoofing Wagner's ''Ring'' is a famous sendup.

'RIGOLETTO' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) The soprano Anna Netrebko and the tenor Rolando Villazon, opera's hottest vocal couple of late, bring star appeal and impressive artistry to the Met's 1989 Otto Schenk production. With her dusky-toned and exciting voice, Ms. Netrebko gives an unusually emotional portrayal of Gilda. Mr. Villazon brings an ardent voice, Verdian style and virile energy to the Duke of Mantua. Placido Domingo, who knows a thing or two about the lead tenor role, conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out tomorrow; $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini)

'DIE ZAUBERFLOTE' (Tonight and Monday) Back after its winter break, the Metropolitan Opera was still working out the vacation kinks at its first production of Julie Taymor's pageant of a ''Die Zauberflote,'' and its cast of young Americans was not uniformly up to speed. No matter, evidently: the spectacle is undeniable, the performances will only get smoother as the run continues, and the production is popular enough to sell the house out. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; sold out, though returns may be available at the box office. (Midgette)

(Tommasini)

 Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SURFACE ATTRACTION: PAINTED FURNITURE FROM THE COLLECTION,' through March 26. The remarkable images, abstract patterns and floral motifs that flutter across the 30 or so tables, chairs, cabinets and blanket chests in this beautiful, convention-stretching show confirm that from the late 1600's to the late 1800's, quite a bit of American painting talent and ambition was channeled into the decoration of everyday wood objects. The combination of imagination and utility, of economic means and lush effects, defines the human desire for beauty as hardwired. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400.(Smith)

International Center of Photography: 'Che!: Revolution and Icon,' through Feb. 26. This is, in a sense, a one-image show, the image being Alberto Korda's famous 1960 head shot of Che (Ernesto Guevara), taken in Cuba. But the theme is the transformation that the portrait has undergone in the passage of 46 years, as Che's soulful likeness has migrated from political posters to album covers, T-shirts, paper currency, vodka ads and gallery art. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045. (Holland Cotter)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Felix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the human skull presented to her by Victor Hugo, the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc., her own accomplished sculptures and relics of lovers and American tours. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt,' through May 7. Egypt was no picnic 5,000 years ago. The average lifespan was about 40 years. Wild animals were ever present. Childbirth was perilous. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness was a shot in the dark. Doctors were priests. Medicine was a blend of science, religion and art. The 65 objects in this beautiful show functioned as all three. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Cotter)

* MET: ANTONELLO DA MESSINA, through March 5. This small, focused show presents the work of a Sicilian master (about 1430-1479) regarded as the greatest painter to emerge from southern Italy in the 15th century. His signature work, shown here, is ''The Virgin Annunciate'' (about 1475-76), depicting Mary as a young Sicilian girl at the moment of the Annunciation, when she is told by the angel Gabriel that she will bear Jesus. The genius of the work lies in the way a traditional icon has been imbued with the life force of a flesh-and-blood human being. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Smith)

EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)

ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'FROM BYZANTIUM TO MODERN GREECE: HELLENIC ART IN ADVERSITY, 1453-1830,' through May 6. This show is a busy, ambitious hodgepodge that sets out to present all aspects of the visual art in Greece during this period. The range spans wonderful early paintings and icons, like a panel by the youthful El Greco; examples of domestic crafts practiced by Greek women; jewelry and church ornaments; and maps and charts. 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212) 486-4448. (Glueck)

* P.S. 1: 'Peter Hujar,' through March 6. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans, and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084. (Cotter)

The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through April 16. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray, and artworks in various media relating to chess by Dorothea Tanning, Alberto Giacometti and John Cage, whose chessboard incorporates musical notation for a piano composition that you can hear on headphones. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Ken Johnson)

* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)

Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Raymond Pettibon,' through Feb. 19. If you are unfamiliar with the influential Mr. Pettibon's emotionally resonant mix of noirish cartooning and enigmatic literary verbiage, this show of works on paper and, for the first time, a low-tech animated video, serves as a good introduction. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. through Feb. 19.(Johnson)

* Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above). (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

The Hudson River School at the New-York Historical Society: Nature and the American Vision By the mid-19th century, the United States was a trans-Atlantic political power in search of a cultural profile. Hudson River School landscape painting was the answer: it presented America as the un-Europe. Europe had its Romantic ruins; America had its ultra-Romantic wilderness. Europe had antique; America had primeval. Europe told time in centuries; America told time in eons. It's all here to see in this display of a venerable local institution's permanent collection. New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, through Feb. 19. (Cotter)

Galleries: 57th Street

* 'Constructing Realities' See this conceptually ambitious exhibition for Andy Warhol's amazing, rarely seen 1965 film of an 83-year-old performer named Paul Swan who dances and recites poetry in exotic, Middle Eastern-style costumes with wonderfully un-self-conscious verve. A one-act play on video by Mike Kelley; videos transmitted from cell-phones for a project by Robert Whitman; a multiscreen video portrait of a man by Gary Hill; Stan Douglas's well-known film ''Der Sandemann''; and a selection of classic Diane Arbus photographs round out the show. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3293, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

* Maria Elena Gonzalez This excellent two-gallery show plays with the forms of Roman Catholic religious imagery and reliquaries that Ms. Gonzalez encountered during a yearlong stay in Rome, but translates both into highly personal post-Minimalist forms. The symbols of martyrdom at the Project become emblems of power; the clouded architectural sculptures at Knoedler look like reliquaries within reliquaries, which is one way to speak of the relationship of memory to art. The Project, 37 West 57th Street, third floor, (212) 688-1585, through Feb. 17, and Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through March 4. (Cotter)

Galleries: Chelsea

Johannes Atli Hinriksson: 'Mutiny' This young artist from Iceland makes intermittently funny, tedious, visually gripping and absurdly violent horror videos using small, clumsily cobbled-together puppets and sets. Featuring much spurting fake blood and other liquids, they could be the works of Napoleon Dynamite's demented cousin. Haswellediger, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 206-8955, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

* Warren Isensee Could this be Mr. Isensee's breakout show? His glowing grid, striped and concentric rectangle paintings play adroitly with conventions of Modernist abstraction and are almost hallucinogenically beautiful. Danese, 535 West 24th Street, (212) 223-2227, through Feb. 11. (Johnson)

Florian Maier-Aichen A German photographer who lives part of the time in Los Angeles and will appear in this year's Whitney Biennial, Mr. Maier-Aichen makes large landscapes in which the convergence of natural imagery and photographic and digital technologies confounds the supposed transparency of photography. His ideas are not new, but the best pictures, including distant nighttime views of Los Angeles and a red-toned aerial picture of mountains, are sumptuous and subtly surrealistic. 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121, through Feb. 25. (Johnson)

Tim Roda A Boschian madness seems to have descended upon the young family of three featured in grainy, low-tech black-and-white photographs staged by the father, 28 year-old Mr. Roda, in old barns and dank industrial spaces. Grotesque prosthetic limbs, Freudian visual puns, foolish ceremonies, cross-dressing and moods of dour absurdity and cosmic mystery recur in these comical and creepy, dreamlike tableaus. Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212) 807-9494, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

Stuart Rome This landscape photographer points his camera into the woods and comes up with subtly pantheistic pictures of extraordinary lucidity and absorbing complexity. Sepia, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444, through Feb. 11. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

Kim Levin: 'Notes and Itineraries, 1976 - 2004' The longtime art critic for The Village Voice is the subject of a fascinating retrospective that views her career, as well as the history of the New York art scene, through the lens of ephemera that she has accumulated over the past 25 years, including postcard announcements, news releases and handwritten exhibition lists. Ronald Feldman, 31 Mercer Street, (212) 226-3232, through Feb. 4. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

* 'THE DOWNTOWN SHOW: THE NEW YORK ART SCENE, 1974-1984' The real down-and-dirty Downtown art scene, when the East Village bloomed, punk and new wave rock assailed the ears, graffiti spread like kudzu, and heroin, along with extreme style, raged, is the subject of this wild and woolly show. It's a humongous time warp of more than 450 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs, videos, posters, ephemera and things in between by artists, writers, performers, musicians and maestros of mixed media, from a photograph of the transvestite Candy Darling as she posed on her death bed to a small, painted sculpture made of elephant dung by David Hammons. With so many clashing ideologies, points of view and attitudes toward art-making, this no-holds-barred hodgepodge generates the buzz and stridency of, say, Canal Street on payday. New York University, Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780; and Fales Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 988-2596, Greenwich Village; through April 1. (Glueck)

Brian DEwan and Leon DEwan: 'Dewanatron' Electronic musicians, eccentric inventors, sculptors and cousins, the Dewans create electronic sound-making machines housed in wall-mounted wooden containers that look like props for old sci-fi movies, or creations of a domestic hobbyist. Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144, through Jan 31. (Johnson)

* Anya Gallaccio: 'One Art' The viscerally poetic single work occupying Sculpture Center's spacious main gallery is a 50-foot-tall weeping cherry tree that was cut up and reassembled in the gallery, where it is held in place by steel cables and bolts. Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, at Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, through April 3. (Johnson)

'Humanitarians Not Heroes (Five-Alive)' This show presents offbeat promotional objects designed by various artists and issued by the exhibition's curator, the conceptualist Trong G. Nguyen, under the aegis of his own five-year-old organization called Humanitarians Not Heroes. They include ''Sound Capsule,'' a CD not to be played until a certain date in the future; T-shirts printed with birth and death dates of unspecified people; and fortune cookies containing sayings of George W. Bush. Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 645-2800, through Thursday.(Johnson)

'Zoo Story' A clay gorilla by Daisy Youngblood, a bronze she-wolf by Kiki Smith, a flock of concrete sheep by Francoise-Xavier Lalanne and works about animals by more than 20 other artists, including John Baldessari, Katharina Fritsch, Ross Bleckner and Rebecca Horn, turn the first floor of this sleek, three-story private museum into a diverting menagerie. Fisher Landau Center for Art, 38-27 30th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 937-0727, through June 12. (Johnson)

Last Chance

OSCAR BLUEMNER Known for his soulful, jewel-colored Cubist pictures of houses in semirural locales, Bluemner remains one of the most appealing of the American Modernists active between World Wars I and II. Barbara Mathes, 22 East 80th Street, Manhattan, (212) 570-4190; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, closes tomorrowthrough Jan. 28. (Smith)

Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock: 'Dialogue' It may be that Pollock could not have done what he did without the support of his wife, Lee Krasner, but he was nevertheless the better artist by far, as this revealing show of works from all phases of both their careers proves. Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 366-4774; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

* Met: 'FRA ANGELICO,' An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710; closes Sunday. (Smith)

* Guillaume Pinard: 'expresso' Surrealistic, darkly comical black ball-point pen drawings evoke a childlike mind under the influence of Gumby, the Muppets and Japanese anime, and an animated video follows the adventures of two eyeballs with arms and legs through shape-shifting landscapes. Team, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219; closes tomorrow. (Johnson)

* JAMES SIENA: NEW PAINTINGS AND GOUACHES Mr. Siena continues to push at painting's envelope by turning inward and working small, creating enamel-on-aluminum fields of synaptic, thin-skinned circuitry not much larger than the viewer's face, or Mr. Siena's own fevered brain. His latest efforts both diversify and perfect his slightly crazed, usually colorful linear patterns, forging links to traditions, disciplines and cultures far beyond Western painting. PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: The Voices Inside the Border but Outside the Margins

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The voices may leave a pleasurable tickle in your ears for a few days, possibly because most of us have never studied them closely before. They're the quiet murmurs of the city that usually form a dimly perceived backdrop for our own daily dramas.
 The lyrical sound of the woman in the subway that leaves you wondering about her background. The anxious tone radiating from that fellow -- Indian or Pakistani? -- who brushed past you on the street, imploring someone on a cellphone. The stream of hot gossip bubbling from the Latino girl at the post office, a comic aria courtesy of the Bronx.
Now, here they are before us, those strangers who pique our interest and pass by. They're singing their souls from the stage, drawing us out of our own circumscribed worlds and into theirs. And all inhabit the remarkable person of Sarah Jones, the gifted author and sole star of ''Bridge & Tunnel,'' which opened last night at the Helen Hayes Theater, bringing a refreshing taste of the outer boroughs to the heart of Broadway. 
 A substantial downtown hit two seasons ago, ''Bridge & Tunnel'' is Ms. Jones's sweet-spirited valentine to New York City, its polyglot citizens and the larger notion of an all-inclusive America, that ideal place where concepts like liberty, equality and opportunity have concrete meaning and are not just boilerplate phrases slapped around in stump speeches and news conferences.
 In 90 minutes of acutely observed portraiture gently tinted with humor, Ms. Jones plays more than a dozen men and women participating in an open-mike evening of poetry for immigrants, held at a friendly dive in ''beautiful South Queens,'' a step up from the Starbucks, where the sound of the espresso machine created irksome acoustical problems.
 Ms. Jones is Mohammed Ali (he's heard all the jokes), the genial host who is hopelessly proud of his awful sense of humor, antsy and eager in his ill-fitting jacket. She is Lorraine Levine, of Long Island, stooped with age into an S shape, eyes big as moons behind those magnifying lenses, proud to share her contribution, a brief lyric titled ''No, Really, Please, Don't Get Up.'' She is the Vietnamese-American Bao Viet Dinh, voice husky with attitude that's a few sizes too large, spitting out terse lines of verse that scorn stereotype: ''This is not an ode to Bruce Lee!''
 Ms. Jones, who was born in Baltimore, is an astonishing mimic with an uncanny ability to alter the texture, color and volume of her voice and even the shape of her body. Close your eyes and you would never imagine that the breathy chirp of that nervous but exhilarated 11-year-old girl could come from the same larynx unleashing those guttural expectorations from the old Russian guy. Open them again, and wonder at how this lanky actress seems to lose six inches when she slips into the persona of the cocky young African-American rapper, who looks like a giant tangerine in his oversize orange parka.
 These are technical skills that invite gasps of admiration, and deserve them. Admire, please. Gasp and applaud to your heart's content.
 Just don't downgrade Ms. Jones's talent to a mere gift for impressions, an actor's stunt. A natural affinity for precise impersonation can only be developed into a tool of artistic expression through hard work enriched with empathy for the complicated souls behind the colorful sounds. Proof that Ms. Jones has put her actorly gifts in service to something larger than self-display is found in her writing for these fully imagined characters, which is lively, compassionate, mildly sardonic and smart.
 Inevitably, some portraits are more freshly conceived than others, and delivered with more conviction. The performance-art parody from a Jamaican woman feels rote, for instance, and the Russian doesn't bring much to the party other than his status as the lone white guy. But the production, which has been smoothly directed by Tony Taccone, has gained in consistency since its Off Broadway run. 
 It also seems more steeped in unease about the current state of the Union than it was downtown. Mohammed's cellphone conversations with his wife about an impending and mysterious interview with the feds -- he immigrated from Pakistan in 1985 -- feel tenser and more pointed, the bad jokes taking on an air of desperation. ''Amina, please, why would they care about a poetry reading?,'' he asks. ''What, I am now hiding the limericks of mass destruction?''
 Mrs. Levine, a Polish-German-Lithuanian-American Jew, provides some perspective about today's climate of simmering anxiety about immigration. ''Listen, when my family came here -- from Eastern Europe -- they were saying the same thing about us immigrants that they say now about you.'' But she's a staunch booster of the American way of life, after a fashion. ''Here in America we have freedom to say what we want, be what we want, to decide what happens in our country,'' she says, adding, ''We even get to decide what happens in other people's countries.''
 Was that a cellphone, or did I just hear someone's PC alarm going off? Also among Ms. Jones's entertainingly odd men and women out are a Chinese-American mother of a lesbian daughter anguished at having to part with a girlfriend who lacks permanent residency, and a wheelchair-bound Mexican man who tells of his arduous journey north in search of economic advantages.
 In short, if multiculturalism is a dirty word to you, ''Bridge & Tunnel'' will probably give you hives. But Ms. Jones has closely studied the way all sorts of people order their thoughts, express their hopes and fears and tentatively try to fit the whole of their personalities into an inadequate new vocabulary. The stories of their struggles and anxieties have the uneven rhythms and shaggy shape of experience clumsily but feelingly put into unfamiliar words; they are never just anecdotes cut and trimmed to form political paper airplanes aimed at the audience.
 And in focusing on the immigrant experience, Ms. Jones is honoring anew, and embodying in theatrical form, the durable dream that keeps drawing immigrants to America, even in today's more fractious political climate and uncertain economy. It's a concept even the staunchest supporter of a strict immigration policy wouldn't dare to disavow, because it happens to be the subject of that popular performance piece that has been playing in New York Harbor for more than a century now.
 That one is also a solo show, starring a big green dame with a torch. Ms. Jones's ''Bridge & Tunnel'' is naturally somewhat smaller in scale, but it's a worthy sequel. A lot funnier, too.

HEADLINE: Kosovo Albanians Mourn Pro-Independence Leader

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
Kosovo's Albanian majority gathered by the tens of thousands on Thursday to bid farewell to their president in a proud and somber funeral ceremony that seemed to underscore their aspirations for independence. 
 After 16 years as the ethnic Albanian leader in the province, Ibrahim Rugova -- a veteran pacifist who struggled to gain independence for this disputed region but died of lung cancer last Saturday -- was given every honor the region could muster.
For six hours this city, the regional capital, was brought to a halt for a ceremony attended by four presidents and representatives from more than 40 countries. Stores and schools were closed, and the regional government announced a holiday. 
 Kosovo is still officially part of Serbia but has been administered by the United Nations since June 1999, when Serbian security forces, accused of committing atrocities against the Albanians, were forced to leave the province. Mr. Rugova died just as talks on the province's future status were about to begin. 
 But for many here on Thursday, there was little in the ceremony to suggest that it was taking place in a disputed province. There were few signs of the 17,000 or so peacekeepers who usually patrol the region. Instead, Kosovo's Protection Corps, defined by the United Nations as a civil disaster response unit but widely viewed by Albanians as the province's fledgling defense force, led the cortege. The armed guards, recruited from the ranks of Kosovo's now dispersed guerrilla army that fought the Serbian security forces during the conflict here from 1997 to 1999, walked slowly alongside the president's coffin as it was borne on a gun carriage, draped in flags. 
 ''He was the president of our state,'' said Zymer Kastrati, 80, who traveled by bus with 10 members of his family from Pec in eastern Kosovo. Mr. Rugova twice won the presidency of Kosovo's regional government, elected by the provincial legislature in 2002 and 2004. 
 While the United Nations has final authority here, the regional government has substantial say in areas like the economy, health, education and other social affairs. 
 Many Albanians traveled across Kosovo in freezing temperatures to attend the ceremony after four and half days of official mourning. Many were members of the Democratic League of Kosovo, the movement Mr. Rugova helped to form in the late 1980's as a counterweight to the rise of Serbian nationalism. Members of Kosovo's extensive exile communities flew in from as far as way as Australia and the United States. 
 Some said they came out of duty to the man they described as the father of their nation. 
 ''He was a very patient and peaceful man -- ideal qualities, since we Kosovars are a hot-blooded people,'' said Gresa Rexhepi, 16, a Pristina high school student. ''I'm sure his goal will be achieved very soon.''
 Dignitaries paid tribute to the president before he was laid to rest at a memorial site for former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The head of the United Nations mission in the province, Soren JessenPetersen, said President Rugova had ''remained dedicated exclusively to peaceful means.''
 ''His death is a great loss,'' Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said at the ceremony. ''It is one of the cruel ironies of history that he left at the moment he was most needed, the very moment he expected to provide leadership in helping to settle the future status of Kosovo.'' 
 Mr. Jessen-Petersen suggested that Mr. Rugova's desire for independence might yet become a reality, a suggestion echoed by diplomats who say negotiations are likely to lead to some kind of independent state. 
 ''President Rugova has left a void behind him, but he has also left a vision to guide Kosovo forward,'' Mr. Jessen-Petersen said. ''It is a vision whose fulfillment he did not live to see, but whose realization will be achieved through the unity and commitment of those who follow him.''
 But while the ceremony appeared to suggest that this region is on the verge of statehood, the underlying divisions were thinly disguised. Members of Kosovo's Serbian population were notably absent, as were representatives of the Serbian government. 
 A request by Serbia's president, Boris Tadic, to attend the funeral was rejected by Mr. Rugova's office because it reasserted Serbia's claim to the province. 
 President Tadic asked to be able to go to ''Kosovo, which is a part of Serbia's territorial integrity,'' and pay his respects. Subsequently, all but one of Kosovo's Serbian representatives declined to join the ceremony. 
 There were also reminders of the deep divisions running though Kosovo's Albanian population. Some war veterans, long critical of Mr. Rugova's advocacy of nonviolence during repression at the hands of Serbian security forces in Kosovo in the 1990's, condemned the government's decision to bury him at the Kosovo Liberation Army memorial site.

HEADLINE: Study Says 80% of New Orleans Blacks May Not Return 

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
New Orleans could lose as much as 80 percent of its black population if its most damaged neighborhoods are not rebuilt and if there is not significant government assistance to help poor people return, a detailed analysis by Brown University has concluded.
 Combining data from the 2000 census with federal damage assessment maps, the study provides a new level of specificity about Hurricane Katrina's effect on the city's worst-flooded areas, which were heavily populated by low-income black people. 
 Of the 354,000 people who lived in New Orleans neighborhoods where the subsequent damage was moderate to severe, 75 percent were black, 29 percent lived below the poverty line, more than 10 percent were unemployed, and more than half were renters, the study found. 
 The report's author, John R. Logan, concluded that as much as 80 percent of the city's black population might not return for several reasons: their neighborhoods would not be rebuilt, they would be unable to afford the relocation costs, or they would put down roots in other cities. 
 For similar reasons, as much as half of the city's white population might not return, Dr. Logan concluded. 
 ''The continuing question about the hurricane is this: Whose city will be rebuilt?'' Dr. Logan, a professor of sociology, writes in the report. 
 If the projections are realized, the New Orleans population will shrink to about 140,000 from its prehurricane level of 484,000, and the city, nearly 70 percent black before the storm, will become majority white.
 The study, financed by a grant from the National Science Foundation, was released Thursday, 10 days after the mayor of New Orleans, C. Ray Nagin, who is black, told an audience that ''this city will be a majority African-American city; it's the way God wants it to be.''
 Mr. Nagin's remark was widely viewed as an effort to address criticism of a proposal by his own rebuilding panel, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, that calls for a four-month building moratorium in heavily damaged areas. He said later that he had not meant to suggest that white people would not be encouraged to return.
 ''Certainly Mayor Nagin's comments reflected a concern on the ground about the future of the city,'' Dr. Logan said. ''My report shows that there is a basis for that concern.'' 
 The study coincides with growing uncertainty about what government assistance will be available for property owners and renters. Louisiana will receive $6.2 billion in federal block grants under an aid package approved by Congress in December, part of which will be used to help homeowners. But that will not be enough money to help all property owners in storm-damaged areas, Louisiana officials say. 
 Those officials have urged Congress to enact legislation proposed by Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, creating a corporation that would use bond proceeds to reimburse property owners for part of their mortgages, then redevelop the property. But the Bush administration has said it opposes the bill, out of concerns that it would be too expensive and would create a new government bureaucracy. 
 Asked Thursday about his opposition to the measure, President Bush told reporters that the $85 billion already allocated for Gulf Coast restoration was ''a good start.'' He added that he was concerned that Louisiana did not have a clear recovery plan in place. 
 But Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, a Democrat who has clashed frequently with the White House, said Mr. Baker's bill provided a clear plan.
 ''Administration officials do not understand the suffering of the people of Louisiana,'' Ms. Blanco said in a statement.
 Demographers are divided over the likelihood of a drastic shift in New Orleans's population. William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who has studied the hurricane's impact on the city, called Dr. Logan's projections ''a worst-case scenario that will come about only if these evacuees see that they have no voice in what is going on.'' 
 But Dr. Frey also said low-income evacuees might indeed begin to put down roots in cities like Houston or Dallas if they did not see movement toward reconstruction in the next six months. 
 Elliott B. Stonecipher, a political consultant and demographer from Shreveport, La., said that unless New Orleans built housing in flood-protected areas for low-income residents, and also provided support for poor people to relocate, chances were good that many low-income blacks would not return. 
 ''If they didn't have enough resources to get out before the storm,'' Mr. Stonecipher said, ''how can we expect them to have the wherewithal to return?''

HEADLINE: E-Waste@Large

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Royte. 
Elizabeth Royte is the author, most recently, of ''Garbage Land: On the Secret Trail of Trash.''

 BODY:
LAST week, Maine became the first state to require manufacturers of computer monitors and televisions to pay for their recycling and disposal. Washington, with a pending bill, may be next. That's progress, right? 
 Computer recycling sounds like an unmitigated good: it keeps hazardous components out of incinerators and landfills, which researchers at Carnegie Mellon University estimate already hold more than 60 million computers. And by reusing glass, plastic, aluminum and heavy metals (like lead, copper and mercury), recycling averts the energy use and pollution linked with mining and drilling for new materials.
But because recycling in the United States is expensive, hazardous and encumbered with environmental and safety regulations, many companies that collect e-waste simply ship it to underdeveloped nations. According to the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and the Basel Action Network, up to 80 percent of the material dropped off by well-meaning Americans at community recycling events ends up bundled for export. 
 Most of the stuff that goes overseas can't or won't be fixed and sold. Computer dealers in Lagos, Nigeria, for example, complain that up to 75 percent of the 400,000 units they receive each month from recyclers are junk. A 2002 documentary showed Chinese workers, including children, using hammers and chisels to pry copper and aluminum from computers, burning PVC-coated wires to get at copper and swirling acids in buckets to extract gold. 
 After stripping what they can, workers dump the computer carcasses and waste sludge in nearby fields or streams. Soil and water tests in the e-waste processing town of Guiyu, China, for instance, revealed levels of chromium, tin and barium hundreds of times higher than allowable in the United States. 
 It's easy to find American companies that call themselves computer recyclers, but it's hard to trace what they actually do. The government doesn't regulate these businesses, and the Environmental Protection Agency has no certification process for recyclers. There are dozens of e-waste bills being considered across the country, including one in New York City. Five states and 15 counties ban computer and television monitors from landfills. California, Maine, Maryland and Massachusetts have e-waste recycling programs in place, all financed by different mechanisms. 
 Even the electronics industry doesn't like this patchwork approach, but so far, no one has come up with anything better. Four e-waste bills are floating around the House and Senate: the biggest difference between them is whether consumers or manufacturers would pay for the programs. A strong argument holds that when producers must manage their own discards, they have a strong incentive to design equipment that's nontoxic and easy to recycle.
 The sooner Congress gets it together, the better. Electronic waste is now considered the fastest-growing segment of the municipal waste stream in the United States. The National Safety Council estimated in 2004 that by 2009, 250 million computers will have become obsolete. As awareness of the hazards of e-waste rises, more states will ban it from landfills. But keeping toxic trash from our dumps won't mean a thing if we don't forbid the export of hazardous material to countries without enforceable environmental regulations. 
 To halt this environmental injustice, in which we're all complicit, the federal government needs to restrict the use of hazardous materials in computers, require manufacturers to put in place recycling programs (it will be a lot cheaper and safer to recycle this stuff once the toxics are out) and ban hazardous waste exports. That may sound like a tall order, but that's no reason not to proceed: the European Union has already passed every one of these laws.

HEADLINE: Win-Win? Tell It To the Losers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
AMONG the business and political leaders who gather here each year for the World Economic Forum, there has long been broad agreement that globalization is good.
 But this year there is a growing doubt -- not in the validity of the message, but in whether it is losing believers among the broad populace of the world.
The organizers of the conference focused a large part of it on China and India, but in the corridors a much smaller country kept coming up. That was Bolivia, whose new president, Evo Morales, promised to ''end the colonial and neoliberal model.'' His election continued a recent leftist trend in Latin America. 
 ''Populism is sexy in many countries,'' said Ghassan Salame, a Lebanese political scientist who teaches at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. ''It somehow gives credibility back to politics, saying that politicians can change things. Otherwise, globalization is ruling the world.''
 Backers of globalization have long argued that it was ''win-win,'' with developed and developing economies both gaining from the process, even if there were some local losers whose jobs vanished.
 They still think that. But they worry that there are more losers than expected. ''On a microbasis, it is very difficult to feel the win-win,'' said Ben Verwaayen, the chief executive of BT, the former British Telecom, at a session on jobs.
 ''There is a reason why polls show declining trust in politicians, journalists and business leaders. They are the opinion leaders who have lost credibility,'' Mr. Verwaayen continued. ''Society feels very intuitively that something has changed, and we do not have the answer to it.''
 In a way, it is remarkable that these resentments are growing now, when world economic growth is strong. The growth of China, India and other Asian economies has not kept the United States from growing at a good rate. 
 But the growth is uneven, and many who felt successful in developed countries now feel threatened as pension plans are cut back and companies demand reductions in pay or benefits to avoid layoffs. 
 ''Those who cannot participate in the economic wealth have fears,'' the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said in a speech here. She warned of troubles ahead if a framework could not be found to allow all to profit.
 A set of polls released by the forum showed that nearly two-thirds of Davos attendees believe that the next generation will live in a more prosperous world, while fewer than half of the people interviewed around the world share that opinion. The general public was, however, more optimistic than the Davos crowd that the world would become safer.
 Perhaps those who resent globalization will remain powerless. But their ranks could swell if the world economy weakens.
 Lawrence H. Summers, the president of Harvard University and a co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, asserts that globalization will not be derailed.
 ''The tide of history continues to move toward more market organization,'' he told me. But, he added, ''For this to work out well, there must be more attention to local disintegration even as we work toward global integration.''
 Or people could just accept a world in which some are very wealthy and others provide services to them. Elaine L. Chao, the United States labor secretary, said the job outlook in the United States was bright for plumbers and electricians.
 And, speaking at the same section on jobs, David Arkless, a senior vice president of Manpower Inc., said that one profession likely to offer high pay in coming years is that of personal trainer.

Hamas a Surprise Winner In Palestinian Elections
The radical Islamic party Hamas scored an overwhelming and unexpected victory in Palestinian legislative elections, taking 76 out of the 132 seats, deposing the former ruling Fatah party, which won only 43 seats. The results give Hamas the right to form the next government, ending more than 40 years of domination by Fatah. A1

Hamas's victory threw President Bush and his aides on the defensive, complicating the administration's policy of trying to promote democracy as an antidote to the spread of terrorism in the Arab world. 
Mr. Bush said the results spoke to the failures of the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, to root out corruption, not to any flaws in the Bush administration's policy. A11

The elections were met with a mixture of jubilation and consternation in much of the Arab world, and for some it raised the concern that, in winning, Hamas would almost certainly have to change. A11

European leaders, whose countries are major financial donors to the Palestinian Authority, registered disquiet verging on hostility toward Hamas's triumph. A11

Strife at World Economic Forum
A magazine article calling on nations to boycott Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians has provoked a tempest at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, prompting the organizers to pull the magazine from its shelves and issue an apology. A11

U.S. and China Back Plan for Iran
President Bush and the Chinese government both declared their full support for a Russian proposal to allow Iran to run civilian nuclear facilities as long as Russia and international nuclear inspectors are in full control of the fuel. A3

Unmet Pledges to Rebuild Iraq
Because of unforeseen security costs, haphazard planning and shifting priorities, the American-financed reconstruction program in Iraq will not complete scores of projects that were promised to help rebuild the country, a federal oversight agency reported. A8

The American military said it had released five Iraqi women, half those held in its prisons, but said the release had been previously scheduled and was unrelated to demands made by the kidnappers of the American journalist Jill Carroll. A8

More Energy Woes for Georgia
Energy shortages struck Georgia anew as a wind storm toppled a major power transmission line and Russia's gas monopoly failed to restore the flow of natural gas to the country after pipelines were sabotaged last weekend, energy officials said. A4

Groups Protest U.N. Proposal
Human rights organizations and the Congressional Human Rights Caucus protested a decision by the United States to back a measure introduced by Iran denying two international gay rights groups a voice at the United Nations. A4

NATIONAL A14-21

Poll Finds Mixed Support For Domestic Spy Program
Americans are willing to tolerate eavesdropping without warrants to fight terrorism, but are concerned that the aggressive antiterrorism programs championed by the Bush administration are encroaching on civil liberties, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. A1

President Bush declared again that his administration's program for eavesdropping without warrants was well within existing law, and said efforts in Congress to write legislation expressly giving him authority for such a program were unnecessary and dangerous. A20

Lobbyist Inquiry Takes a Turn
The investigation into Jack Abramoff, the disgraced Republican lobbyist, took a new turn when the Justice Department said the chief prosecutor in the inquiry would step down next week because he had been nominated to a federal judgeship by President Bush. A21

Kerry Calls for Filibuster
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, left, called for a filibuster of the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. More than 60 senators have already vowed to support him, and the leaders of both parties said they expected to hold the full vote on Tuesday. A14

Officials Discover Drug Tunnel
Drug smugglers have dug one of the longest, most sophisticated tunnels discovered in recent years along the Mexican border, and the American and Mexican authorities have hauled nearly two tons of marijuana out of it since it was found, officials said. A14

HEADLINE: Bush and China Endorse Russia's Nuclear Plan for Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ELAINE SCIOLINO; William J. Broad contributed reporting from New York for this article, and Joseph Kahn from Beijing.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
President Bush and the Chinese government both declared their full support on Thursday for a Russian proposal to allow Iran to operate civilian nuclear facilities as long as Russia and international nuclear inspectors are in full control of the fuel. 
 Mr. Bush's explicit public endorsement puts all of the major powers on record supporting the proposal, even as most acknowledge that it is a significant concession to Iran and runs the risk that the country will drag out the negotiations while continuing to produce nuclear material. Yet officials say they believe it is the best face-saving strategy to pursue a negotiated settlement with Iran.
European and American officials familiar with the details of the offer that Russia made to Iran say that Iran would continue to be allowed to operate its nuclear plant at Isfahan, which converts raw uranium into a form that is ready to be enriched. That is a step that both Europe and the United States said last year that they could not allow -- and that was explicitly barred under the agreement between Iran and Europe in late 2004, because Iran could divert the uranium to secret enrichment facilities. Iran began operating the Isfahan plant again in August. 
 Mr. Bush did not discuss the details of the Russian offer. But American, European and Russian officials, who like others discussing the issue spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as interfering in the negotiations, said the offer would allow Iran to continue operations at the plant that turns yellowcake, a concentrated form of uranium ore, into uranium hexafluoride, a toxic material that centrifuges spin into fuel for reactors or bombs. 
 Critics of that concession say that it could send a signal to Iran that it no longer has to comply with all provisions of its November 2004 agreement with Europe. 
 ''A red line was crossed'' when Iran began producing the uranium last fall, said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonpartisan research group that follows developments in Iran. ''The Iranians got away with reopening the conversion facility, and now people have accepted it's never going to be shut again and have taken it off the table.''
 Mr. Bush made his statement embracing the Russian idea at a news conference on Thursday. He said, ''The Iranians have said, 'We want a weapon.' ''
 In fact, Iran has denied that it is pursuing a weapon, and in the afternoon, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, acknowledged that Mr. Bush had misspoken.
 ''He was referring to their behavior,'' Mr. McClellan said by telephone later. ''Our concern is their intention is to develop a nuclear weapon under the guise of a civilian program.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. Bush's slip may cement the perception among some members of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency that he has decided, at least in his own mind, that Iran is intent on building a weapon as fast as it can, a situation he has said repeatedly that he will not tolerate. Mr. Bush gave no hint on Thursday that he was thinking of military action, instead saying that ''we are working hard to continue the diplomacy necessary to send a focused message to the Iranian government, and that is: 'Your desires for a weapon are unacceptable.' ''
 Mr. Bush's statement came at a moment of heightened concern in Vienna, home of the agency, that if its board votes next week to send Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council, Iran might make good on its threat to limit cooperation with inspectors and begin full scale enrichment of uranium. North Korea threw out inspectors three years ago, and one senior American official said recently that ''the Iranians have looked closely at that model.''
 The Russian proposal lays out a complicated plan in which Iran would supply the uranium hexafluoride from Isfahan, shipping it to Russia for enrichment. Once enriched, the uranium would be shipped back to Iran's nuclear plant in Bushehr, which is being built by the Russians. 
 But huge questions remain, including the scale of the program, the degree of involvement of Iranian engineers and program's commercial viability. Moreover, just working out a deal this complex would take months or longer, experts say, at a time the administration fears the Iranians could surge ahead.
 In interviews, Russian and European officials said they believed the arrangements, while face-saving, made no economic or technological sense for Iran. Iran would have to pay for the enrichment, but its own scientists would not be allowed to work on the site. 
 Moreover, there are technical problems. Russian officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were in the middle of negotiations, said that the uranium gas produced at Isfahan was of inferior quality to what was produced in Russia. As a result, the Russians have no interest, they say, in buying any of its for their own use. 
 In an interview in Vienna on Wednesday, Gregory L. Schulte, the American ambassador to the atomic agency, said, ''There are those who would argue that conversion is not proliferation-significant because it does not produce weapons grade material, but from our perspective, conversion is another step forward to acquire enrichment capability. It has no economic purpose.''
 While China favored the Russian proposal, it also firmly opposed the use of sanctions. That comes as a disappointment to Washington, which this week sent a top official to persuade China's leaders that they should do far more.
 During a visit to Beijing by Ali Larijani, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Kong Quan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, praised Moscow's offer to enrich Iran's uranium in Russia and made clear that China will not support sanctions. ''We think the Russian proposal is a good attempt to break this stalemate,'' Mr. Kong said, adding, ''We oppose impulsively using sanctions or threats of sanctions to solve problems.''
 The Bush administration has not allowed its stated opposition to Iran's uranium conversion at Isfahan to block the Russian offer. ''This is dangerous, but it is minimally acceptable as long as they are not enriching,'' said Mark Fitzpatrick, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ''The Russian proposal is the last best chance of resolving this without an escalation.'' 

U.S. Comments on India Clarified
 India responded testily yesterday to American suggestions of a quid pro quo in its blossoming relations with the United States, with the Indian foreign secretary calling in the United States ambassador over his reported remarks about how India should vote next week on whether to refer the case of Iran's nuclear ambitions to the United Nations Security Council. 
 David C. Mulford, the American ambassador to India, had been quoted by the Press Trust of India news agency as saying that if India did not vote to refer Iran to the Security Council, it would be ''devastating'' to its chances of securing the nuclear deal with the United States. 
 The American Embassy later said that the comments had been taken ''out of context'' and released a full transcript. In it, Mr. Mulford first said that India would be expected to vote ''based on India's judgment of its own national interest.''
 He went on to say, ''that if they decide that they don't want to vote for this, our view is that the effect on members of Congress with regard to this civil nuclear initiative will be devastating.''

HEADLINE: HAMAS ROUTS RULING FACTION, CASTING PALL ON PEACE PROCESS

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
The radical Islamic party Hamas scored an overwhelming victory in Wednesday's Palestinian legislative elections, taking 76 out of 132 seats, deposing the former governing Fatah party, which won only 43 seats.
 The results, announced Thursday night, which give Hamas the right to form the next government, were likened by Palestinians to an earthquake or a tsunami. They ended more than 40 years of domination by Fatah, the political faction built by Yasir Arafat, which along with the Palestinian Authority was widely viewed by Palestinians as corrupt and ineffective.
 The shocking outcome put Hamas, considered a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and the European Union, in charge of the Palestinian political future, and put at least a temporary halt to efforts to restart peace talks. The balloting also made a mockery of the voter surveys released Wednesday night that indicated that Fatah would have the most seats and could retain control of the legislature and the cabinet.
 In a televised speech on Thursday night, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said he remained committed to negotiations with Israel. Mr. Abbas, who heads Fatah, but whose official status was not affected by the vote, suggested that future talks would be conducted through the Palestine Liberation Organization, which could bypass a Hamas-led government. 
 ''I am committed to implementing the program on which you elected me a year ago,'' he said. ''It is a program based on negotiations and peaceful settlement with Israel.''
 But Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister of Israel, issued a statement saying that talks were not possible now. ''The state of Israel will not negotiate with a Palestinian administration if even part of it is an armed terrorist organization calling for the destruction of the state of Israel,'' he said after an evening cabinet discussion of the election results.
 Even before the results were announced, the Fatah prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, who had warned Mr. Abbas against holding these elections, resigned, and cheering Hamas supporters raised their green flag over the parliament building. They celebrated throughout Gaza and the West Bank, holding victory marches in major cities. In Nablus, they hung enormous green banners on public buildings, while members of the group's military arm, the Qassam brigades, marched in uniforms with weapons, but did not wear their customary masks.
 In Ramallah, Ali Abu Shusha, 31, with a bright green Hamas banner on his taxi, exulted in the victory. ''Hamas was created by the people and belongs to the people,'' he said. ''I want Hamas to run the government -- it has clean hands, puts the poor before the rich and will resist the occupier.''
 In Gaza City, however, Kamilia Barghouti, 26, a waitress, said she was in shock. ''I'm worried about the way this victory will affect how I can dress in public, and even if it will affect where I can work,'' she said.
 The victory of Hamas represents an enormous test for the Palestinians, for the Western nations who pressed for this election and who provide millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians and for the Arab world, which is likely to be shaken by the victory of a militant Islamic party in the symbolic heart of the Muslim world. 
 But the results, seen more as a repudiation of Fatah than a declaration of war against Israel, will be a test for Hamas, which had seemed to want a more gradual entry into politics. The leader of Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, said proudly in Gaza, ''We are going to change every aspect, as regards the economy, industry, agriculture, as regards social aid, health, administration, education.'' But it will not be an easy transformation, and it will provoke political resistance from a largely secular society.
 While Hamas politicians said they would invite other parties, including Fatah, to join them in a government of national unity, key Fatah members like Jibril Rajoub and Mahmoud Dahlan made it clear that Fatah should not take part in a government dominated by Hamas. They argued that doing so would help Hamas by providing cover for the group as it struggles with the reality of governing. Fatah, they suggested, should go into opposition and let Hamas make its own mistakes and deal as best it can with the facts of Palestinian life and the Israeli occupation. The Fatah Central Committee voted Thursday night not to join a Hamas-led government.
 But it is also possible that some Fatah members with good relations with Hamas, like the Gazan legislator Ziad Abu Amr, who ran as an independent with Hamas support, and a former minister of national economy, Mazen Sinokrot, will agree to join Hamas in a cabinet that probably will be led by a non-Hamas prime minister.
 ''My advice to Abu Mazen and to Hamas is to think of serious power-sharing,'' Mr. Amr said, referring to Mr. Abbas. ''A partnership between Fatah and Hamas is necessary,'' he said. ''Hamas is going to be put to the test of being a practitioner and not simply an opposition. Politics will have to be taken into account at the expense of ideology.''
 While Mr. Abbas won praise for pressing ahead with these elections, the result is not what he wanted and is bound to weaken his position. He gambled, but with a smashing Hamas victory he is perceived to have lost and to bear some responsibility for failing to reform Fatah and the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Abbas has said that if he cannot carry out his policies, which include negotiations with Israel, he will quit.
 Israelis warned the world not to give in to wishful thinking and presume that Hamas will suddenly alter its goals. Israel and the world did not negotiate with Mr. Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization until it agreed to recognize the state of Israel in the late 1980's and disavow terrorism. Israeli politicians suggested that the process would have to begin all over again with Hamas.
 ''For Israelis, this is the definitive end of the illusion of a comprehensive peace,'' said Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalem Center, a policy research organization in Jerusalem. ''There is no more credible hope of Palestinian moderation. For Israelis, it will only confirm what the last five years of terror have taught them: that the war is not about settlements, but about Israel's right to exist.''
 The Palestinian Authority as a serious negotiating partner no longer exists for Israel, Mr. Halevi said. ''Now the era of the pretend peace process is also over,'' he said, and Israel will continue to act unilaterally to set its own borders, build the separation barrier between itself and the Palestinians and, in time, continue the process of unilateral withdrawal from more West Bank settlements -- so long as it can ensure that a Hamas-dominated Palestinian Authority will not use that territory to launch rocket or other attacks on Israel.
 ''There is now a broad consensus, that Israel will go ahead and build our borders to preserve Israel as a democratic Jewish state,'' said Ami Ayalon, a former director of Shin Bet now running for a seat with the Labor Party.
 The Hamas victory brings the group's support for armed attacks on Israel to the fore. Hamas said it entered politics ''to protect the resistance'' to Israeli occupation of Muslim land, so it is unlikely to heed Western appeals to disarm and recognize Israel, which Hamas in its charter promised to destroy.
 The most that successful Hamas candidates like Ahmad Mubarak would say Thursday is that if Israel pulled back to its 1967 boundaries, Hamas would consider ''a long-term truce.''
 Fadel Saleh, a Hamas politician from Ramallah, said that Hamas would concentrate ''on restoring our Palestinian home and rebuilding Palestinian society,'' leaving international relations to Mr. Abbas and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which does not include Hamas. But, he said, ''we want to remake the P.L.O. too based on this vote,'' he said. ''Hamas wants cooperation with all Palestinian parties and a national agreement on policy.''
 The death of Mr. Arafat took the lid off seething resentments of Fatah and the men Mr. Arafat brought back to the Palestinian territories from exile after the 1993 Oslo accords with Israel. Those accords set up the Palestinian Authority, and in the 10 years since the last legislative elections, in which Hamas refused to participate, one-party rule proved to be as corrupting among Palestinians as anywhere else.
 ''Corrupt authorities who have been in power for a long time are usually thrown out in free elections,'' said Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian analyst who teaches at Jerusalem's Al Quds University. ''After 40 years, it's almost natural. I hoped Fatah would get away with it, but didn't. That the opposition came from a radical Islamic group is unfortunate, but there was no other serious opposition.''
 Mr. Kuttab said that those who had preached democracy, from the Bush administration to the Israeli right, would have to decide if their values trumped their interests. ''If Hamas respects the rules of the democratic game, we have to let the winners win,'' he said. ''But now Hamas will have to face reality, and part of reality means dealing with Israel.''
 But even this process could take many months or years, he said, and the potential pitfalls were underscored Thursday when Palestinian security officials said a 9-year-old Palestinian girl was killed by Israeli gunfire near the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis, Agence France-Presse reported. The Israeli military said soldiers fired at a ''suspicious figure'' who was near Gaza's perimeter fence in the area. The military said it had no information that a young girl was hit, but were checking the report.
 Hamas is not likely to move against the security forces, at least for now. They are made up almost entirely of Fatah loyalists, and voted overwhelmingly for Fatah. Any Hamas effort to try to take over the security forces would almost certainly lead to clashes.
 Hisham Ahmed, a political scientist at Birzeit University who has written books about Hamas, called the vote ''an historic moment in every sense,'' but he emphasized that ''these results don't reflect the real size of Fatah and Hamas in the society,'' because they are distorted by anger at Fatah, preoccupation with internal issues and a complicated voting system. 
 If Mr. Abbas and the world handle the situation intelligently, Mr. Ahmed said, ''it could mark the beginning of the end of Hamas as an ideologically pure force and a beginning of a reformed Fatah.'' But if it is handled badly, he said, ''the radicalization of Palestinian society will continue.''
 According to the results, the Hamas list won 30 of 66 seats at the national level and 46 of 66 seats in constituencies. It did especially well in Gaza, but polled well throughout the West Bank, too. Fatah won 27 seats on the national level and only 16 in the constituencies. The leftist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine won three seats while another leftist list, Badil, won two seats. The Independent Palestine list, led by the presidential election runner-up, Mustafa Barghouti, won two seats, as did the Third Way list of the departing finance minister, Salam Fayyad and Hanan Ashrawi. Four other independents won in constituencies, including Mr. Amr. Among the Fatah casualties was Mr. Rajoub.

HEADLINE: MAYOR, IN SPEECH, URGES SWIFT PACE AT GROUND ZERO

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Winnie Hu contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg used the first State of the City speech of his new term yesterday to call for a drastic change in the World Trade Center development plan so the project can finally move forward. He also asked unions to accept changes to health insurance and pension benefits, whose costs, he said, ''have spiraled out of control.''
 In an address that set the stage for battle on several fronts, Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, called this ''a special moment for New York'' and laid out what he called ''the road to long-term strength, stability and success.''
The speech, coming after his impressive re-election victory in November, included a pledge by the mayor to fulfill his campaign promise to help low- and middle-income New Yorkers by embarking on the largest program to build housing in the city's history. 
 And Mr. Bloomberg promised to attack chronic poverty in three of the city's poorest neighborhoods -- Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and Melrose in the Bronx -- by enlisting the help of leading business figures, like Richard D. Parsons, the chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner.
 The address, the unofficial starting bell of the mayor's second term, laid out a broad agenda that his newly reordered team hopes will put City Hall on a more nimble footing.
 The administration has been consumed by recent crises, including a transit strike and a series of children's deaths that the police say came at the hands of abusive parents.
 Mr. Bloomberg's proposals to expedite development at the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center were delivered in some of his most forceful remarks, a departure from his generally hands-off approach during his first term. 
 Saying, ''We cannot allow the trade center to be a construction site for the next 15 years,'' Mr. Bloomberg proposed that the leaseholder, Larry Silverstein, give up control of two of the five building sites, in exchange for a reduction in his rent. (Mr. Silverstein holds a 99-year lease on the site, which is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.)
 That would allow officials to seek other developers to build towers on the site while Mr. Silverstein focuses on developing the Freedom Tower.
 ''We need this now to advance our economy and pay tribute to those who died there,'' the mayor said, ''not a decade and a half in the future when it fits a developer's financial plan.''
 Officials of the Port Authority have been pressuring Mr. Silverstein to accept a similar deal. In addition, the authority has signaled that it is amenable to the mayor's proposal that its headquarters, previously situated in the twin towers, be moved into one of the buildings Mr. Silverstein is being urged to relinquish, Towers 3 and 4.
 Mr. Bloomberg, speaking at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island, received ample applause throughout his comments on ground zero development. 
 But the hall, filled with elected officials, community leaders and labor officials, was notably silent when the mayor approached the uncomfortable subject of benefit plans for the municipal unions, though he did so in relatively bland terms.
 ''We will work with labor and legislative leaders on innovative pension modifications for future workers,'' the mayor said. 
 The vow, a month after a bitter transit strike that centered on that very issue, suggested that the mayor would make such demands a centerpiece of upcoming negotiations with the city's unions. 
 Despite his pledge to work with labor leaders, the remarks drew a forceful rebuttal from Randi Weingarten, the chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, who answered in the affirmative when asked if she took the mayor's comments as ''a declaration of war.''
 ''When the M.T.A. did it to the T.W.U. workers, it provoked a strike,'' Ms. Weingarten said, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's attempts to get Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union to accept less generous benefit packages in return for wage increases.
 ''So I'm very surprised that the mayor would throw out the health care premiums and pension reforms in a speech like this today, given what we've just lived through in a transit strike.''
 Ms. Weingarten, who also is president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city teachers' union, complained that neither the mayor nor any of his aides had alerted her that he would be calling for changes in pension and health care plans during his address, which she attended.
 Stu Loeser, Mr. Bloomberg's press secretary, said the mayor meant no slight and was seeking ''a partnership'' with the unions on the issue.
 And, as evidence that labor relations were healthy, Mr. Bloomberg's aides pointed to a statement from another labor leader, Dennis Rivera, head of 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East. 
 Mr. Rivera praised a considerably less controversial proposal that the mayor announced yesterday: to start a public-private task force ''that will attack chronic unemployment and poverty in the homes and neighborhoods where the need is greatest.''
 That proposal was one of several initiatives for the poor that the mayor spoke of in his address.
 He repeated his campaign pledge to have the city schools enroll eligible students for public health insurance when they enroll them in classes.
 He also introduced a plan to reduce the number of New Yorkers at risk for diabetes-related complications by 20 percent, starting with a plan to have public hospitals share the results of blood sugar tests with the city's health department.
 On education, the mayor said he would push ahead with plans to create additional elite high schools for the city's brightest students.
 He said he would greatly expand the number of schools that can operate with more autonomy from the Department of Education.
 And he introduced a program to develop a new training curriculum for new teachers.
 But the mayor said some of his education efforts, like the construction of new schools and the creation of new preschool programs, were being stymied by the state's failure to comply with a court order requiring billions more dollars in aid for the city's schools.
 ''We need the money now, and together we must continue fighting for it,'' he said.
 The line won loud applause, but it also highlighted just how much of the city's needs -- and how much of the mayor's agenda -- rely upon the cooperation and approval of Albany.
 Ground zero is controlled by the state. And two key parts of the campaign against illegal guns that Mr. Bloomberg unveiled yesterday require action from the State Legislature.
 The mayor called upon the Legislature to create a public database tracking the whereabouts of those convicted of gun crimes and to stiffen penalties for those caught with illegal firearms that are loaded.
 While such measures may prove popular among downstate legislators, it is unclear whether they can get support from the upstate Republicans who control the State Senate.
 The mayor's address won a warm reception from the new speaker of the City Council, Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat. ''There's a lot in that speech that we're going to be able to work hand in hand with the mayor on,'' Ms. Quinn said.
 Two other high-ranking Democrats who are occasional critics of the mayor, Representative Anthony D. Weiner and City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., praised the address.
 Mr. Thompson said, ''This is the strongest I've heard him; it's probably the best I've heard him.'' The comptroller, who won re-election in November with 92 percent of the vote, complimented the mayor for his vow to take on Albany and for his call for action at ground zero.
 Mr. Weiner, who sought the Democratic mayoral nomination last year, said, ''Admittedly there are a lot of things he said today that he can probably accomplish fairly easily, but the fact that he's also highlighted some things that require heavy lifting shows that he's going to be willing to expend some capital to do it.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Senses Opportunities In Health Care Savings Accounts 

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
When it comes to medical benefits, millions of Americans already have a health insurer. Soon, many will also have a debit card and a bank tied to their medical plan.
 Banks, credit unions and money management firms are now quietly positioning themselves to become central players in the business of health care, offering 401(k)-type accounts to cover future medical expenses.
 Bank of America, J. P. Morgan Chase, Fidelity Investments and hundreds of others are hoping to capitalize on the latest wrinkle in medical care paid by consumers: health savings accounts, which have been around since 2003 but are moving to the fore of the national agenda in anticipation of the State of the Union address on Tuesday. 
 These supercharged checking accounts, which must be linked to a high-deductible health insurance plan, allow consumers to invest their own money for current and future medical expenses and have it grow tax-free. 
 They are the centerpiece of President Bush's plans on health care, just as private accounts were offered as a Social Security fix. 
 Currently, only about three million Americans have signed up for the high-deductible insurance policy required for such accounts, up from slightly more than one million last March, according to findings released yesterday by America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group. It is not clear how many of those people have actually opened a linked account. Still, the number is expected to rise sharply over the next five years.
 By 2010, more than 15 million Americans, or about 10 percent of all those insured, will have a health savings account, according to an estimate by DiamondCluster International, a management consulting firm. 
 The average individual's account balance, it projects, will grow from $1,500 today to about $3,500 in 2010. Even if people pull out some or all of their money to pay their medical bills, the ballooning balances may mean that $75 billion or so in new money to manage will soon be at stake. 
 Banks and others are drawn by the promise of lucrative fees they can generate by offering consumers mutual funds and other investment vehicles as their account balances grow. Most also charge $50 to $75 to set up a health savings account, and they collect perhaps $40 or more each year in maintenance charges and service fees. 
 Not since the creation of the individual retirement account in the mid-1970's has such a potentially huge mountain of money landed in the lap of the financial services industry.
 ''Billions of dollars that used to be written in the form of checks with insurance companies' names on them would instead go to credit unions, banks, and long-term investment houses,'' said Dan Perrin, the publisher of H.S.A. Insider and executive director of the H.S.A. Coalition, a lobbying group backed by 70 small-business and medical industry groups as well as the American Bankers Association. ''You know America: you see a financial opportunity and it sets off a gold rush.''
 Two years ago, not a single major bank offered a health savings account. Only seven small banks had any sort of plan. Today, more than 300 financial services companies, including big banks, are taking deposits or will be soon. About 150 more are on the way. Some of the country's biggest health insurance providers have started their own banks.
 To be sure, health savings accounts will make up only a small fraction of earnings at a financial giant like Citigroup. But at a time when deposit growth has slowed and higher interest rates have hurt profits, they represent a steady stream of new income that is increasingly hard to find. Banks are betting that what the administration calls consumer-directed health care catches on.
 Supporters say that the discipline and marketing might of financial services giants could spur the adoption of consumer-directed care. Critics argue that the banking industry's involvement only bolsters their case: the accounts are more about wealth than health. 
 ''We already have a large number of retirement savings vehicles in the United States,'' said Jonathan Gruber, an economist and Treasury Department official in the Clinton administration. ''It is not clear why we need yet another tax break for savings for rich guys.'' 
 Corporations, of course, want relief from soaring health care costs, and have been steadily shifting more of the burden to their employees. Small businesses were among the first to offer health savings accounts to their employees. But over the last year or so, a number of big companies -- from Guidant to Wal-Mart Stores -- have started signing up.
 Health savings accounts are akin to the private accounts that were proposed to help overhaul Social Security. Much of Wall Street liked private retirement accounts, but their support was guarded because they feared a potential negative reaction. 
 Banking lobbyists have met with White House officials at least three times over the last year to discuss the rules governing health savings vehicles. But until recently, most have been shy about their interest in such plans. Now, they have established a lobbying group, the H.S.A. Council, and are spending millions of dollars to roll the plans out.
 The idea behind the accounts is simple: forced to pay out of pocket for medical care, Americans workers will spend health care dollars more wisely. The way it works is more complex. Americans under the age of 65 with a high-deductible health care plan can contribute tax-free to the new 401(k)-like account as much as $2,700 this year for individuals and $5,450 for families, or the amount of their deductible if it is less. Unlike health reimbursement plans, which were controlled by the employer, health savings accounts belong to employees even if they change jobs. 
 The money can be used to pay for medical, dental and vision expenses as well as a portion of qualified premiums for long-term-care insurance. 
 The rest can be invested in stocks, bonds and mutual funds -- and grow tax-free. That money would be available to pay for a broad range of health care expenses in the future, and would remain untaxed as long as it was spent on health care. At any time after age 65, money can be withdrawn for any reason without penalty, but the entire amount taken out would be taxed. 
 For wealthier people, the tax break could provide a generous incentive to build a nest egg for future health care; poorer people with smaller annual contributions could wind up spending all the money they put away during the year. 
 Geoff Dougall's accounting firm in Beaverton, Ore., is among the thousands of employers that have switched from a conventional health insurance plan to offering health savings account.
 ''We are very much talking about it as a savings vehicle,'' said Mr. Dougall, who is giving each of his employees $2,500 this year to cover the deductibles of their health insurance policies. 
 The savings accounts, in effect, give financial institutions a vital, but behind-the-scenes role in shaping the nation's health care system. 
 Banks hope to use their close ties with their customers to enter the health insurance market. For now, they collaborate with insurance providers as much as they compete. Health savings accounts must be opened in conjunction with a high-deductible health insurance plan. After choosing an insurance policy, the consumer must pick a bank.
 Even though the health plan and savings account are separate products, big banks and insurance companies pitch them together as an ''integrated solution'' and split the fees. Health insurers keep the premiums; banks retain the investment management fees and the debit card transaction fees. The two split the money earned for opening and maintaining the accounts.
 Health insurers, said David Josephs, J. P. Morgan's vice president for health care business development, ''are good at explaining benefits.''
 ''They are good at eligibility. They are good at enrollment. Managing risk. Contracting with doctors and hospitals. Banks are good at managing transactions. Managing deposits. Making investments.''
 ''As you look at consumer-directed health care,'' he added, ''it really requires both of those skill sets.''
 Even without the lucrative investment management fees, bank executives like Daniel Kelly, manager of H.S.A. services at U.S. Bancorp, say health savings accounts are attractive. Banks make money each time a customer swipes his debit card at a doctor's office. Payment processing alone could generate some $2.3 billion over the next five years, the DiamondCluster study estimates. 
 Some big medical plans have already entered the health saving account arena by starting their own bank.
 Four years ago, United Healthcare started Exante Financial Services, a Utah-based bank that allowed it to become the first company to offer its customers the high-deductible health insurance policies as well as savings accounts. In December, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said it was planning to charter a similar institution, Blue Healthcare Bank, an online bank.
 Executives at both companies say they are not being lured into the banking business by the prospects of wealth management; nor do they plan to offer traditional banking services and loans. 
 Instead, they say having both products under one roof will allow them to provide better customer service, like more smoothly processing transactions at doctors' offices or quickly resolving billing disputes. 
 ''This has nothing to do with an assets-under-management play,'' said John M. Prince, chief executive of Exante Financial Services. ''There will be huge falloff in people who are trying to play that role. Eighty percent of the money are assets that go right in and go right out.''
 Just a few years ago, the idea that the titans of health care and banking would be battling for business would have been nearly impossible to imagine.
 Even after the Bush administration began pushing for the creation of health savings accounts with the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, the banking industry mainly stayed on the sidelines. The American Banking Association lent its name to the H.S.A. Coalition lobbying group but did not contribute any money.
 Industry lobbyists viewed the idea as a health care issue; they raised questions about its prospects of passing as the 2004 presidential race heated up. Banking executives did not see the profit potential after an experiment with Medical Savings Accounts, aimed at small businesses, failed. 
 ''Put it this way, the impact of this law did not really become clear to them until after it passed,'' said Mr. Perrin, the H.S.A. Coalition director. Once they understood how the accounts worked, however, the big banks realized the next I.R.A. had landed at their feet.
 Now, some financial institutions are urging the Bush administration and Congress to raise the tax-deductible contribution limit to encourage consumers to put more money in their accounts -- a proposal that President Bush is expected to endorse in his State of the Union speech. 
 Banks are already champing at the bit. ''We happen to be in the camp that the H.S.A. is a second retirement account to be used for medical expenses,'' said Nancy Todor, an executive who will oversee health savings accounts when Citigroup introduces them this year.

HEADLINE: Kerry Urges Alito Filibuster, But His Reception Is Cool

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan 26 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts could not attend the Senate debate on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. on Thursday. He was in Davos, Switzerland, mingling with international business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum.
 But late Thursday afternoon, Mr. Kerry began calling fellow Democratic senators in a quixotic, last-minute effort for a filibuster to stop the nomination. 
Democrats cringed and Republicans jeered at the awkwardness of his gesture, which almost no one in the Senate expects to succeed.
 ''God bless John Kerry,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ''He just cinched this whole nomination. With Senator Kerry, it is Christmas every day.''
 Steve Schmidt, a White House spokesman working on the nomination, said Mr. Kerry's move ''says a lot less about Alito than it does about the Iowa primary in 2008,'' suggesting that Mr. Kerry, who lost the presidential race in 2004, was playing to his party's liberal base in a bid to recapture its nomination.
 Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, sounded almost apologetic about Mr. Kerry's statements.
 ''No one can complain on this matter that there hasn't been sufficient time to talk about Judge Alito, pro and con,'' Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor. ''I hope that this matter will be resolved without too much more talking.''
 Mr. Kerry's call for a filibuster, an effort to stop confirmation by refusing to close debate and hold a vote, was joined by his fellow Democratic senator from Massachusetts, Edward M. Kennedy. 
 Under Senate procedures, their objections blocked the Senate Democratic and Republican leaders from setting Tuesday as the date for a vote on confirmation. 
 Instead, the Senate will vote Monday on whether to close debate. Sixty votes are required for a full Senate vote on Judge Alito. More than 60 senators have already pledged to support him, and the leaders of both parties said they expected to hold the full vote on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Kerry offered an explanation for his position in a post on a liberal blog, the Daily Kos. 
 ''People can say all they want that 'elections have consequences,' '' he wrote. ''Trust me, more than anyone I understand that. But that seems like an awfully convoluted rationale for me to stay silent about Judge Alito's nomination.''
 Mr. Kerry was celebrated by leaders of the coalition of liberal groups opposing Judge Alito's nomination. 
 ''Senator John Kerry has called for a filibuster of the Alito nomination, heeding your calls to do everything possible to defeat it,'' People for the American Way cheered in an e-mail message to its supporters. 
 Mr. Kennedy said a filibuster might help focus attention on the nomination and give its opponents a last chance to sway the public and the Senate. 
 He acknowledged some ''divisions in the caucus'' over the advisability of a filibuster, but he said the effort had the support of a few others, including Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Durbin confirmed that he would vote against closing debate. 
 ''It is an uphill climb at this point,'' Mr. Kennedy said of a filibuster. ''But it is achievable.''
 Asked if Mr. Kerry's absence from the Senate would hinder their efforts, Mr. Kennedy said, ''We'll do the best we can and make a good fight of it.''
 Mr. Kerry has been rallying his supporters against the nomination for weeks in mass e-mail messages and on his Web site.
 And when the Democratic caucus met Wednesday to discuss the nomination, he gave an impassioned plea that the party should try to stage a filibuster even if it failed, people present said, speaking only if granted anonymity because the meeting was private. Some senators at the meeting said an unsuccessful filibuster would leave the party weakened for future battles. 
 Some said a messy and unsuccessful filibuster fight would distract from the Democratic focus on other issues like corruption in government and wiretapping by the Bush administration. 
 In the end the party leaders were not persuaded by Mr. Kerry's appeal.
 Judge Alito's confirmation was looking increasingly certain Thursday. Two more Democrats, Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, said they would break party ranks to vote for confirmation. 
 Mr. Byrd said his constituents had told him they were ''appalled'' by the harsh questioning Judge Alito received from the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearings, calling them ''an outrage and a disgrace.'' 
 With Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Byrd bring the number of Democrats pledging support for Judge Alito to three. The vote on confirmation is expected to hew closely to party lines. No Republicans have said they will vote against him. 
 Two Republican supporters of abortion rights, Senators Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, have not declared how they will vote.
 Shortly after 7 p.m., Mr. Kerry issued a statement saying, ''Judge Alito's confirmation would be an ideological coup on the Supreme Court.'' 
 ''The president has every right to nominate Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''It's our right and our responsibility to oppose him vigorously.''
 A few moments later, April Boyd, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kerry, sent a postscript saying that ''as things played out over the course of the day today'' he had decided to fly home. ''Kerry will be back in Washington tomorrow,'' Ms. Boyd said.

HEADLINE: As an Enron Trial Approaches, Residents Prefer to Focus on the Present 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
A big trial starts in federal court here on Monday, involving some very prominent executives who used to work for a very prominent company. Across the country, people will be following the case with great interest. 
 But in Houston, many residents prefer to focus on other things, like the resurgent economy, and city leaders wish outsiders would, too. The company, of course, is Enron, and the men who will be on trial are its former top executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, who face various charges in the scandal that led to the company's collapse and tarred this city's reputation four years ago.
''As of today, it's as if Enron had never happened,'' said Joan Johnson, president of the Hotel and Lodging Association of Greater Houston, echoing the sentiment of many Houstonians. Ms. Johnson said hotel occupancy was high, even though about 3,000 hotel rooms had been added downtown since Enron's collapse. 
 But as jury selection starts on Monday, residents here will have to relive the Enron debacle, with the possibility that the trial will drag on over several months. Already, hotels near the federal courthouse have been receiving a flow of out-of-town journalists, perhaps adding to the strength of the city's lodging industry. 
 In preparation for the trial, city officials are trying to accentuate the positive. The Greater Houston Partnership, a business association, raised the idea of coaching bellhops and other hotel workers on how to put Houston's best face forward in the downtown hotels, where many journalists will be staying. It rejected the proposal and instead backed a plan to post media contacts and Internet links in hotel lobbies, with the aim of planting ideas for positive stories.
 Have you heard, for example, that Bakersfield, Calif., has unhealthier air quality than Houston, or that Houston has 82 foreign consulates, the nation's third-largest consular corps? The partnership puts those tidbits and more at the disposal of visiting news media. 
 ''It was devastating for Houston to have its image portrayed as a bunch of corporate gunslingers during the first Enron go-around,'' said John F. Thrash, chief executive of eCorp, a family-owned energy concern, and the husband of Becca Cason Thrash, the hostess of Houston's most extravagant high-society gatherings. ''That is something we're striving to overcome.'' 
 It isn't just Enron. Some residents get the jitters over even the slightest negative publicity about Houston, its wildcatting business ethic, its no-zoning sprawl or its continuing battles with industrial pollution. This week there was an outcry over an oil-laden, caramel-colored fog that blanketed a poor neighborhood in the shadow of the city's largest refinery.
 Of course, Houston has taken numerous additional hits since Enron's collapse in late 2001, when the symbol of outrage became a question at a company meeting from an anonymous Enron employee to Mr. Lay, the company's embattled chairman: ''Are you on crack?'' 
 Thousands of well-paid Enron employees lost jobs, and the city's name was associated with schemes to hide losses from investors and destabilize the flow of electricity in California.
 Back then, Houston was also criticized for its freewheeling approach to business. That shows few signs of fading. While not experiencing a boom as incandescent as past expansions, Houston's economy is still growing steadily, driven by inexpensive real estate, climbing energy prices and a fast-growing population. 
 "We're fine now, but the impact at the time was huge," said John Flowers, who owns Kenneally's Irish Pub near the exclusive River Oaks neighborhood. He recalls the Enron executives who used to drop by his smoky establishment for pints of Guinness as "free-spending individuals who made more money than God." 
 The city's economy has grown for 35 consecutive months, according to a monthly survey of purchasing executives conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Houston. November, the most recent month for which statistics are available, was one of the strongest months in a decade, as demand rose for goods like plastic pipes and refined petroleum products.
 Houston's status as an inland transportation hub with a ship channel to the Gulf of Mexico has also provided a buffer against the demise of Enron. Aided in part by the diversion of cargo from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, revenue at the Port of Houston increased 13 percent last year and total tonnage grew by 9 percent, said H. Thomas Kornegay, executive director of the Port of Houston Authority.
 Furthermore, jobs are being created in the Houston economy. Employers added 42,500 jobs in 2005 and 24,100 in 2004, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. This follows heavy job losses in 2002 and 2003.
 Much of the job creation has been fueled by a growing service industry and a robust construction market expected to expand further this year, even as housing in other parts of the country loses steam amid deflation of the real estate bubble.
 ''If any other city lost the seventh-largest corporation in America, it would have had more impact,'' said Tilman J. Fertitta, chief executive of Landry's Restaurants, and one of a handful of Houston businessmen who have filled the void left by Mr. Lay's exit from the city's social scene.
 ''It's just a whole hell of a lot cheaper here than other cities,'' Mr. Fertitta, one of the largest holders of real estate in Houston and nearby Galveston, said in an interview. ''This is still an energy town but our prices have allowed us to become more diverse than in the 80's.''
 Relatively low home prices, with three-bedroom homes still widely available for less than $200,000, are luring developers to erect entirely new cities on the prairies and rice fields that make up much of Houston's outer fringe. Cheap land pushed housing starts to a record high in 2005, when they climbed 18 percent, to 48,000, according to Metrostudy, a real estate consulting firm.
 One new real estate venture, a planned community called Bridgeland that is being developed by General Growth Properties of Chicago, is projected to consist of 21,000 new homes over 10,000 acres, an area larger than Houston's entire existing inner core of skyscrapers, subdivisions and shopping districts.
 This project and others are a bet that Houston's population will continue to climb. The Houston-Galveston Area Council, which represents the eight-county Houston area, forecasts an increase to 8.8 million residents by 2035, from 5.3 million today. Much of the growth is driven by immigrants from Latin America, Africa and Asia, who come here legally or illegally and stay for the same reason that 150,000 survivors of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita relocated to Houston last year: a warm welcome.
 In contrast to other communities that have experienced successful movements against illegal immigrants, calls by anti-immigrant groups last year to start questioning residents about their citizenship status drew a chilly response from Mayor Bill White and police officials, who perceived such a measure as a diversion from preventing crime.
 And in a decision that raised eyebrows throughout Texas, The Dallas Morning News on Jan. 1 named Houston its ''2005 Texan of the Year.'' The city beat out the filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, the cyclist Lance Armstrong and Ronnie Earle, the prosecutor who helped engineer the indictment of Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican who represents Houston's southern suburbs.
 In an editorial that seemed a veiled criticism of political divisiveness in its hometown, The Morning News cited Houston's ''resilience, resourcefulness and good old Texas neighborliness on a scale that did the whole state proud.''
 ''The mountain came to Mohammed when Dallas tipped its hat at us that way,'' said Richard W. Murray, an influential pollster and political scientist at the University of Houston. ''We've come a long way since the boom 25 years ago, when people were raising cash with projections of $100 oil. No one's doing that now.''
 Instead, Mr. Murray pointed out, there is a new sobriety and even, perhaps, the beginning of a sense that the benefits from the city's modest economic expansion need to spread out more equitably. For instance, the Service Employees International Union last month unionized 4,700 janitors in Houston, in one of the most successful unionization drives in the South in recent decades. 
 Not surprisingly, the most vibrant area of Houston's economy these days is energy, which is starting to hire after years of job cuts; oil and gas companies account for roughly 50 percent of economic activity here, down from higher levels as other industry grows more prominent. 
 So it may be fitting, as Houston tries to put to rest its association with Enron's hard-charging chiefs, that the last of the city's larger-than-life wildcatters are fading away or facing their own legal problems. Red Adair, the oil well firefighter, and Michel T. Halbouty, the geologist who cut his teeth in the east Texas oil fields, both died recently. And federal agents arrested the oilman Oscar S. Wyatt, 81, at his home several weeks ago on charges of paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's regime.

HEADLINE: New Poll Finds Mixed Support For Wiretaps

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER; Marjorie Connelly, Marina Stefan and Megan Thee contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Americans are willing to tolerate eavesdropping without warrants to fight terrorism, but are concerned that the aggressive antiterrorism programs championed by the Bush administration are encroaching on civil liberties, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 In a sign that public opinion about the trade-offs between national security and individual rights is nuanced and remains highly unresolved, responses to questions about the administration's eavesdropping program varied significantly depending on how the questions were worded, underlining the importance of the effort by the White House this week to define the issue on its terms.
The poll, conducted as President Bush defended his surveillance program in the face of criticism from Democrats and some Republicans that it is illegal, found that Americans were willing to give the administration some latitude for its surveillance program if they believed it was intended to protect them. Fifty-three percent of the respondents said they supported eavesdropping without warrants ''in order to reduce the threat of terrorism.'' 
 The results suggest that Americans' view of the program depends in large part on whether they perceive it as a bulwark in the fight against terrorism, as Mr. Bush has sought to cast it, or as an unnecessary and unwarranted infringement on civil liberties, as critics have said. 
 In one striking finding, respondents overwhelmingly supported e-mail and telephone monitoring directed at ''Americans that the government is suspicious of;'' they overwhelmingly opposed the same kind of surveillance if it was aimed at ''ordinary Americans.''
 Mr. Bush, at a White House press conference yesterday, twice used the phrase ''terrorist surveillance program'' to describe an operation in which the administration has eavesdropped on telephone calls and other communications like e-mail that it says could involve operatives of Al Qaeda overseas talking to Americans. Critics say the administration could conduct such surveillance while still getting prior court approval, as spelled out in a 1978 law intended to guard against governmental abuses.
 The findings came in a poll conducted as Mr. Bush prepares to deliver his fifth State of the Union address on Tuesday. It found that Mr. Bush will face a nation that has grown sour on Washington and skeptical that he will be able to achieve significant progress in health care, the economy, the Iraq war and the cost of prescription drugs for older patients before he leaves office in three years.
 The poll also signaled concern for Republicans as they prepare to defend their control of the House and the Senate in midterm elections this November. Investigations into Congressional corruption are taking a toll as the elections approach: 61 percent of Americans now hold an unfavorable view of Congress, the highest in 10 years. 
 This finding holds particular peril for Republicans as the party that has been in charge. More than half of the respondents said they believed that most members of Congress would exchange votes for money or favors.
 Republicans were seen as more likely to be unduly influenced by lobbyists. And the Republican Party is now viewed unfavorably by 51 percent of the nation, its worst rating since Mr. Bush took office. By contrast, 53 percent said they held a favorable view of Democrats.
 The telephone poll was conducted with 1,229 adults, starting Friday and ending Wednesday. Its margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
 The poll found that Americans were to a large extent perplexed as they weighed conflicting forces: the need presented by Mr. Bush to take extraordinary action to fight terrorism, and a historical aversion to an overly intrusive government.
 The poll found that 53 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Bush's authorizing eavesdropping without prior court approval ''in order to reduce the threat of terrorism''; 46 percent disapproved. When the question was asked stripped of any mention of terrorism, 46 percent of those respondents approved, and 50 percent said they disapproved.
 At the same time, 64 percent said they were very or somewhat concerned about losing civil liberties as a result of antiterrorism measures put in place by Mr. Bush since the attacks of Sept. 11. And respondents were more likely to be concerned that the government would enact strong antiterrorism laws that excessively restrict civil liberties than they were that the government would fail to enact antiterrorism laws.
 The poll was conducted just as the White House commenced an elaborate campaign to defend the surveillance program, and thus may have been too early to offer a full measure of that campaign's effectiveness. There were no measurable changes in the poll findings from one day to the next. 
 The findings, and follow-up interviews with some participants, clearly suggest that Mr. Bush has an opportunity to make the dispute over the program play to his political advantage. He has been pointing to the threat of another terrorist attack to justify the eavesdropping program and is trying, for the third election in a row, to suggest that he and his party are more aggressive about protecting the nation than are Democrats. 
 ''Say they're targeting someone in Al Qaeda outside the country, and that person then calls someone in the United States about a plot or something really bad: I don't have a problem with that phone being monitored,'' Debbie Viebranz, 51, a Republican from Ohio, said in a follow-up interview. ''But I don't think they should do it for no reason.''
 Donnis Wells, 69, a Republican from Florence, Miss., said: ''I don't think civil liberties are the more important thing we need to handle right now. I think we need to protect our people.''
 Still, interviews reflected clear apprehension about the program. ''If there is a warrant and done by the courts, I would agree,'' said Robert Ray, 54, an independent from Kentucky. ''But they're trying to do it without using the courts. I just don't trust them.''
 In the poll, 70 percent of respondents said they would not be willing to support governmental monitoring of the communications of ''ordinary Americans''; 68 percent said they would be willing to support such monitoring of ''Americans the government is suspicious of.''
 Beyond surveillance, the poll found that Americans hold unfavorable views of the president and the Republican-controlled Congress as Mr. Bush prepares to give his State of the Union speech. Americans, while declaring themselves generally optimistic about the next three years under Mr. Bush, do not expect him to accomplish very much in that time.
 When Mr. Bush leaves office, respondents said, the deficit will be larger than it is today, the elderly will be being paying more for prescription drugs, and the economy and the health care system will be the same as today, or worse.
 Mr. Bush is viewed favorably by 42 percent of the respondents, statistically the same as in the last Times/CBS News poll, in early December, a lackluster rating that could hamper his ability to rally public opinion behind his agenda and push legislation through a divided Congress. Beyond that, nearly two-thirds of the country thinks the nation is on the wrong track, a level that has historically proved to be a matter of concern for a party in power.
 A majority said they were dissatisfied with the way Mr. Bush was managing the economy and the war in Iraq. Public approval for his handling of the campaign against terrorism, once one of his greatest political strengths, has rebounded somewhat from last fall, but remains well belowwhere it was for the first two years after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 Most strikingly, the poll found abundant evidence of public unhappiness with Congress. While it is risky to draw conclusions about Congressional elections from national measurements of discontent -- for example, more than half of all Americans said they were satisfied with the job their member of Congress was doing -- the findings underscored the tough electoral environment that has led some analysts to predict significant Republican losses this fall.
 The corruption investigations appear to account for a lot of the dissatisfaction. Nearly 80 percent of respondents said that the kind of influence-peddling revelations that have emerged in the investigation of the lobbyist Jack Abramoff reflected the ''way things work in Congress'' and were not isolated incidents. More than 50 percent said most members of Congress ''accept bribes or gifts that affect their votes.''
 ''It seems like the integrity of Congress members in the last few years has just gone to pot,'' said Donald Pertuis, 54, an independent voter from Hot Springs, Ark. Mr. Pertuis added: ''In the last 20 years, greed has accelerated. People expect more, I suppose, and want to work less.''

How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 20 through Jan. 25 with 1,229 adults throughout the United States. 
 The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike.
 Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. 
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, marital status, age and education. 
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. 
 In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Airlines Begin to Look Up, Cautiously

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
The domestic airline industry enters 2006 with a relatively brief window of opportunity to fix its finances. 
 By 2008, another bout of bruising competition could begin as significant numbers of new aircraft start arriving, potentially swelling the domestic fleet. That could end the current scarcity of domestic airline seats, which has allowed airlines to raise ticket prices and has kept planes flying about 80 percent full, a record high.
''All the windows and aisles and over half the middle seats in a six-across configuration are full,'' said Roger E. King, an analyst at Credit-Sights, an independent research firm. ''The airline industry has the potential to recoup billions of losses.'' Since 2000, the domestic industry has lost an estimated $42 billion.
 Over the next two years -- barring an economic downturn, further significant escalation of fuel prices, serious labor unrest or some travel panic tied to terrorism or disease -- most of the industry is expected to return to profitability. And should fuel prices decline significantly, the industry could report its largest profits ever. 
 Oil prices, however, have risen in recent weeks, to about $65 a barrel, giving airline executives pause. ''Fuel prices at 65 bucks aren't going to do it,'' said W. Douglas Parker, chief executive of the US Airways Group. ''In the mid-50's, the industry could actually be profitable.'' 
 The recent increase, Mr. Parker added, ''had a seriously dampening impact on expectations for 2006.'' 
 Executives are hoping for relief. ''There's no reason it should be at this price,'' said David G. Neeleman, chief executive of JetBlue Airways. Based on global supply and demand, Mr. Neeleman is convinced oil should be selling at about $40 a barrel. ''I think in the next year or two it's going to be back down there.'' Sooner would be much better for the industry, which is finally operating more efficiently.
 Higher ticket prices and fuller planes are a consequence of the strong economy and of a nearly 20 percent reduction in the fleet since June 30, 2001, among traditional hub-and-spoke carriers like American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, and United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation. Six big carriers have reduced their combined fleets by more than 700 planes, said John Heimlich, chief economist at the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group.
 So, even though travelers packed into planes will have much to grumble about during 2006 and 2007, that period is the airline industry's best chance to get its house in order.
 In anticipation of profits to come, Wall Street has already bid up the stocks of major airlines. Shares of US Airways, Continental Airlines and American have all roughly doubled in price since Sept. 29, 2005. 
 That day brought the initial trading of shares after the merger of US Airways with America West Airlines, a transaction that attracted badly needed capital to the industry and suggested that mergers among other major airlines -- essential to further reducing costs -- might be possible.
 In another sign of optimism, unsecured debt in the UAL Corporation that converts into stock upon United's expected exit from bankruptcy around Feb. 1, has been trading at three times the company's initial high-end estimate of the debt's value. That indicates that United shares, too, could trade higher upon issuance. 
 Some analysts are expecting ticket prices to rise through the first half of 2006. The number of seats available on scheduled domestic flights through this July is 4 percent below the figure a year earlier, said Mr. Heimlich, the trade group economist, giving airlines more reason to raise prices. 
 It remains to be seen how adroitly airlines will take advantage of this potential period of profits. Of course, they have already done much to streamline operations since 2000. Hub-and-spoke carriers have cut payrolls by 37 percent, or 160,000 people, Mr. Heimlich said. By changing work rules, the carriers have increased labor productivity by 30 percent. And by idling their least- efficient planes, airlines have lifted fuel efficiency by 18 percent.
 Still, Mr. Heimlich estimated, when all the 2005 results are in, cumulative airline losses since 2000 will total about $42 billion. And industry debt, including leases not carried on airline balance sheets, is a staggering $100 billion. ''The airlines remain slivers of equity on top of pillars of debt,'' said Mr. King, the analyst with CreditSights.
 Though ticket prices, by Mr. Heimlich's estimate, are only back up to 1988 levels, it seems certain that both business and leisure travelers will balk at some point if fares keep rising. Airlines need to find the price just beneath that level. ''All bets on an industry recovery are off if the discretionary consumer will not accept higher fares,'' Mr. King said.
 Maintaining higher fares could prove difficult as rising deliveries of new planes swell airline fleets later this decade. Deliveries from Boeing and Airbus fell by about one-third from 1999 to 2003, Mr. King estimated, as airlines deferred planes they had earlier ordered and manufacturers cut back production. Now, deliveries are rising again. And even with international routes absorbing most of the new planes, a surge of orders in 2005 could cause domestic capacity to rise more swiftly than demand for seats as early as 2008, undermining pricing.
 A huge potential source of savings for the industry would be a merger or two among major carriers. That would reduce corporate overhead and potentially allow for fewer domestic hubs, which are expensive to maintain. It is redundant, Mr. King said, to have major hubs in both Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C.; Philadelphia and Newark; Denver and Salt Lake City; Dallas and Houston.
 The value of hubs -- where travelers from smaller airports make connections -- is being steadily undermined by low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines and JetBlue, which fly point-to-point, often bypassing hubs.
 ''The odds are very high, probably 100 percent'' of at least one major merger proposal this year, Mr. King said. Mr. Heimlich agreed.
 Mr. King expects Asian routes held by United and Northwest Airlines, attractive because of that region's rapid growth, to drive merger activity. Northwest and Delta Air Lines each sought bankruptcy protection late last year and, in those proceedings, could adjust their costs and assets to make themselves more attractive to a partner, as US Airways did for America West.
 ''I think probably the most likely way those two companies emerge from bankruptcy is through consolidation,'' said Mr. Parker, the US Airways chief executive. ''Our merger has shown you can create a lot of value.'' He does not expect either Delta or Northwest to exit bankruptcy in 2006, however. 
 But officials at both Delta and Northwest said the carriers planned on completing their restructuring and emerging from bankruptcies as stand-alone airlines.

HEADLINE: Students Are Leaving the Politics Out of Economics

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Taking as a model the research techniques that Steven D. Levitt displays in his best-selling book, ''Freakonomics,'' graduate students in economics are focusing on small insights about the economy rather than broad theories that explain how the overall system works. In doing so, they are withdrawing in effect from political debate. 
 The broad-brush approach was a defining characteristic of the economists who were shaped by the Depression. The younger generation has tried to shun prescriptions that seek to cure the economy's ills. Instead, they cast economics as a scientific inquiry, using mathematical models, for example, to explore the economy without becoming advocates for one solution or another.
 Mathematical modeling tries to determine such things as rates of economic growth by plugging into computer models assumptions about inflation, hiring and the like. It is still the thrust of graduate training, but the students themselves are pushing for training in another form of exploration -- empirical research like that of Mr. Levitt, which relies on statistical evidence. 
 Mr. Levitt, a 38-year-old professor at the University of Chicago, analyzes data that seem to explain behavior -- why the crime rate has declined, for example -- and that is what a growing number of graduate students in economics want to do, according to a poll of 230 of them at seven prestigious universities. 
 ''They don't see themselves as having political persuasions,'' said David Colander, an economic historian at Middlebury College, who conducted the poll and a similar one in 1987. ''They see themselves as doing the best analytical-statistical work that can be done, better than in sociology and other social sciences. They are telling you what the options are, but not which option to choose.'' 
 Mr. Levitt says his research, for example, finds a strong correlation between legalized abortion and the decline in crime. Thirty-three years after Roe v. Wade, the population of unwanted, crime-prone young Americans has shrunk, he argues, and so has the crime rate. But does that mean Mr. Levitt favors choice?
 He demurs. ''As an economist, I am better than the typical person at figuring out whether abortion reduces crime,'' he said, ''but I am no better than anyone else at figuring out whether abortion is murder or whether a woman has an intrinsic right to control over her body.''
 The students, in their answers to the poll, applauded an education that teaches them to be researchers and to stay away from policy. The poll and its implications were debated in a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Boston this month, and in follow-up interviews. 
 What the discussion and interviews reveal is a distinct difference in the way economics is taught to undergraduates and graduate students.
 ''My undergraduate students are tremendously interested in public policy, and I teach it to them in principles of economics,'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist who served as chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and got into hot water with the administration by declaring that the outsourcing of jobs overseas was a form of free trade ultimately beneficial to the United States. 
 Back in the classroom, Mr. Mankiw explains to undergraduates why free trade is good policy. ''I am teaching the next generation of voters,'' he said. ''In graduate school, however, we are training the students to use the tools of economic research.'' 
 Those tools rarely tell the whole story. Mr. Levitt's explanation of the falling crime rate, for example, also factored in the rising prison population, but not the impact of television or culture or the aging of the baby boomers. The mathematical models plug rational behavior into their equations, but only some of the psychological quirks that behavioral economists increasingly catalog. 
 The modeling of trade dynamics usually assumes that countries rationally trade the goods and services that each produces most proficiently -- despite mounting evidence that trade in the 21st century is not so straightforward. Moreover, the models and the increasingly popular empirical research rarely acknowledge altruism as an incentive, although Adam Smith stressed its importance, in addition to self-interest. 
 Arjo Klamer also stresses the role of altruism. He trained in economics at Duke, taught at three universities in this country and then, discouraged by the drift of academic economics in the United States, returned to his native Netherlands, where he teaches the impact of culture on economic behavior at the University of Erasmus. 
 ''Altruism is an incentive for all sorts of behavior,'' said Mr. Klamer, who participated in the panel discussion in Boston, having worked with Mr. Colander on a similar poll of graduate students in 1987. ''Scientists cooperate with each other in their research,'' he noted as an example, ''and soldiers go to Iraq because they are willing to sacrifice their lives for a common good.'' 
 The latest poll involved graduate students at the University of Chicago, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Among its results were that 10 percent of the first-year students considered themselves politically conservative, but that percentage rose to 23 percent by the fourth or fifth year. Fifty percent considered economics the most scientific of the social sciences, almost double the percentage in 1987. Half embraced the assumption that behavior is essentially rational, the same percentage as before. And 30 percent said that empirical economics was very important, up from 16 percent in the 1987 poll. 
 ''More and more, 'freakonomics' is becoming mainstream economics,'' Mr. Colander said. ''That is the research that young economists see themselves as doing.'' 
 Mr. Levitt and his co-author, Stephen J. Dubner, a writer and noneconomist, correlated advertising slogans with real estate prices, for example, to determine which slogans are connected with higher sales prices. 
 In the same vein, two empirical economists -- Alan B. Krueger at Princeton and David Card, now at the University of California, Berkeley -- determined that a modest increase in the minimum wage did not discourage employment, and Jonathan Gruber at M.I.T. found a relationship between regular churchgoing and higher incomes. But they did not take the next step, from research to advocacy. 
 Explaining the reluctance to advocate, Mr. Colander said that the graduate students were better at mathematics than their counterparts 19 years ago, and that made them comfortable with this approach. 
 Graduate schools rarely offer courses in the history of economic thought, the poll showed, and fewer students than in the 1980's have read the works of the giants in their field -- Adam Smith, for example, or David Ricardo, Alfred Marshall and John Maynard Keynes. 
 These eminences painted the economy on a broad scale and were far more engaged than modern economists in political choice. ''Keynes looked out the window and talked to people, and that fed his psychological insights,'' Mr. Klamer said.
 Research, theory, anecdotal observation and policy prescriptions were much more intertwined. That was also true of recent Nobel laureates like Milton Friedman, Paul Samuelson, the late James Tobin and Robert Solow, all of them young people during the Depression -- drawn to economics, as Mr. Solow put it, to repair the world through government intervention in a private sector that could not repair itself.
 ''If you can control inflation this way,'' Mr. Solow said, describing a viewpoint that he considers too narrow, ''then the economy will go back on its own in reasonably good time to as good a set of conditions as its institutions will permit.'' 
 ''We have lost our optimism that the tools of economics can be used to manage the economy,'' Mr. Levitt said, ''and we have moved to a much more micro view of the world. We can tell you whether labor unions raise productivity or stifle innovation or raise wages, but we are reluctant to judge whether the tradeoffs are good or bad.''

HEADLINE: Nokia, Profit Down in Quarter,Will Buy Back More of Its Stock 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The cellphone maker Nokia reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit yesterday and said the prices of handsets might fall. The company, based in Espoo, Finland, said it planned to buy back 6.5 billion euros ($7.9 billion) more of its stock this year. 
 Net income declined to 1.07 billion euros, from 1.08 billion a year earlier. Revenue increased to 10.3 billion euros, from 9.46 billion euros, the chairman and chief executive, Jorma Ollila, said.
Mr. Ollila, 55, who is to step down on June 1, announced the company's biggest buyback, braking a decline in the stock price after the results were announced. In New York yesterday, the American depository receipts of Nokia fell 29 cents, to $18.20. 
 Nokia said handset prices, which dropped 11 percent last year, might fall further this quarter amid sales increases in emerging economies.
 The company, the largest cellphone maker, is trying to increase its overall sales and profit margins by attracting buyers in growing markets like India and China as well as selling advanced phones in Europe and the United States.
 Nokia said that it expected handset prices to be ''flat to slightly down sequentially'' this quarter, but that prices at the network unit would probably increase over those a year earlier. It predicted moderate growth in the wireless network market for all of 2006. 
 Nokia's market share was 34.2 percent last quarter, up from 33.6 percent a year earlier, according to Strategy Analytics of Boston. Among leading competitors, the market share of Motorola expanded to 18.3 percent from 16.2 percent, and that of Samsung of South Korea to 11.1 percent from 10.7 percent.

HEADLINE: In Chinatowns, All Sojourners Can Feel Hua

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
There is no consistent name for ''Chinatown'' in Chinese. Newspapers use one name, popular speech uses others. At the Canal Street subway station on Broadway the chosen translation is delicately pixeled together from colorful tiles: ''huabu.'' Hua means ''Chinese,'' but with a sense that transcends geography, independent of the nation of China. Bu means ''place'' or ''town.''
 The characters were not there when I was growing up on the amorphous border between Harlem and Columbia University, when my family made regular pilgrimages to Chinatown by subway, later replaced by weekly trips to Flushing, Queens, by car. At the Kam Man grocery store on Canal Street, my parents would treat us to Haw Flakes, sweet tangy disks that tasted like bits of hard Fruit Rollups. The ingredients were listed as ''haw'' and ''sugar,'' which left a generation of Chinese-American children wondering what exactly haw was. (It is the fruit of the hawthorne.) 
On Mott Street's open storefronts, my parents would pick through the bins of live crabs, sluggish but still menacing to a wide-eyed girl. And Chinatown was our source for paraphernalia for the Lunar New Year, which always arrived in a frenzy of smoky firecracker pops and chiming gongs. The firecrackers planned for this Sunday, celebrating the Year of the Dog, have been centralized by the city government to a controlled ceremony. 
 For all our trips down there, I never knew Chinatown was known as huabu until I saw the characters appear after the station renovation. Hua is the distilled essence of being Chinese, free of fissures caused by wars and colonization. You can be hua even if you hold a passport from Singapore, the United States or Peru. You can be hua even if you have never set foot in China and don't speak a word of Chinese. 
 Like many Asian professionals who came after the 1965 immigration reforms, my parents were liberated from the confines of working-class, Cantonese-speaking Chinatown by education and English. My family, like other Chinese who live abroad, are often called huaqiao, Chinese sojourners. The label sticks, as though one day we all might return, even generations later: pulled back by the tentacles of Chineseness.
 In the meantime, huaqiaos seek and create Chinatowns. Manhattan's Chinatown might not have been classy, but we got satisfaction in knowing we found better deals by braving the cramped streets. Haircuts were cheaper. The restaurants were yummier. Seamstresses were quicker. Chinatown was a bargain hunter's dream, a word-of-mouth economy before online ratings guides democratized shoppers' secrets. We went there for things you could get nowhere else in the city (like a white silk Chinese dress made for my sixth-grade graduation) as well as services that had no cultural basis, like film developing. My mom would hoard rolls of film and take them to a photo store at the base of Confucius Tower. Often spring or summer arrived before we saw pictures from Christmas. 
 American Chinatowns have been beacons since waves of anti-Chinese violence in the late 19th century drove Chinese workers out of California and into self-protective pockets across the country. Then, Chinatowns promised physical safety. Today they offer comfort for those who long for home. Fujianese restaurant workers who take on tens of thousands of dollars of debt to be smuggled to workplaces east of the Rocky Mountains flock to East Broadway on their days off. Suburban Chinese drive into Flushing for groceries. Homesick graduate students rent DVD's by the boxful. 
 I knew it was only a matter of time before my Chinese friend, Charlene, who had begun studies at Syracuse University in the fall, would come. Charlene is originally from the Chinese city of Xian. We had been students together at Beijing University, where I decided that ''Beryl'' (she was given this English name by a middle-school teacher) was out of date, and renamed her. 
 She called to say a group of Chinese Syracuse students were coming to New York City in January. Her roommate wanted to get a haircut at a salon on Mott Street. The officers of the Chinese student association wanted to go to Flushing to buy food for the Lunar New Year banquet. One classmate wanted preserved plum and dried cuttlefish snacks, which she could buy at Aji Ichiban, the Hong Kong chain. Charlene wanted to eat real Chinese food, not General Tso's chicken. 
 She was fixated on hotpot, a festive Chinese dining ritual where food is tossed into a pot of boiling water. 
 When we arrived at Canal Street, Charlene noticed the huabu markers on the station walls. I realized they were written in the traditional Chinese characters used in China before the Communists took over. New York's Chinatown predates the Communist government, and even the one before that. When Chinese first settled in the crooked intersection of Doyers, Pell and Mott Streets, an emperor still ruled.
 We browsed the cluttered vendors stalls on Canal Street. I found a hairclip I liked. ''How much?'' I asked. ''Three dollars,'' the vendor replied. As I reached for my money, Charlene smoothly stepped in. ''Can't you do a little better?'' she asked. I blushed. When I lived in China, I would put up fervent fights over half a yuan, 6 cents. Here, I had grown soft. He offered two for $5. I took it.
 Bargain hunters of all sorts still come to Chinatown: women looking for imitation designer handbags, lawyers and jurors from the nearby courthouses in search of a cheap, filling meal. One man asked us where he could get an ID. He had heard that this was the place to buy one. 
 Chinatown exudes density. It not only rivals Times Square as the most crowded pedestrian area in the city, but also is one of the most visually cluttered, greeting you with a jumble of fire escapes, colorful store signs and streams of tattered flags. Like many crowded Asian cities, Chinatown has mastered the art of the vertical, inspired by languages that can be written up and down, not just side to side.
 ''Why do Chinese like America?'' Charlene asked, rhetorically, as we were swept along by the crowds on Canal. ''Because you can drive and have a big house. But not in New York City. Here, it's just like in China. Why bother living here?'' 
 Chinatowns, she said, had a bad reputation in China: dirty. They are not the face that a rising China wants to present to the world. Having explored many Chinatowns, I am amused to report that perhaps only Japan, in Yokohama, had the discipline to create one that is both clean and expensive.
 But I take pride in the vibrancy of New York City's immigrant communities. You can spot a dying Chinatown: vestigial restaurants, but no doctors' offices, no barbershops, no funeral parlors, no businesses required by daily living. Outside New York and San Francisco, many urban Chinatowns have dwindled to Chinastreets, or even Chinablocks, as the population centers have shifted to the suburbs. Washington's Chinatown is superficially preserved: the storefronts, including Starbucks and Subway, must display Chinese names. The Hooters sign says ''Owl Restaurant'' in Chinese.
 In contrast, New York now has three Chinatowns -- one each for Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, though only the original can claim the name. In 1946, a small group of United Nations delegation members from the Nationalist Chinese government settled in Flushing, in what was then a largely white middle-class community. Since the 1980's, the neighborhood has flourished as the Chinatown for Mandarin speakers from Taiwan, Shanghai and northern China. More recently, Manhattan's working-class Chinese population has been squeezed down the N subway line, emerging on Eighth Avenue inSunset Park, Brooklyn, and in other satellite clusters farther out. 
 Manhattan's Chinatown has fought off the forces of urban decline. It has even grown, with a churn of immigrants that provides both fresh customers and new entrepreneurs. Starting in the late 1960's, Chinatown expanded as Little Italy and the Jewish community of the Lower East Side receded. Small reminders of the Italian presence peek out on the southern part of Mulberry Street. Chinatown's only park, where the elderly can be spotted doing tai chi or playing Chinese chess, is named after Columbus. The Antica Roma restaurant, renamed Asian Roma, offers dumplings along with spaghetti to the courthouse crowd.
 Today Chinatown is large enough to have two main arteries: Canal Street, the tourist-friendly thoroughfare that is still predominantly Cantonese, and East Broadway, which has become Main Street for Fujianese immigrants. East Broadway, Charlene agreed, looks like China -- from the stripped-down restaurants with folding tables to the vendors selling piles of snacks for long bus rides, to the signs unapologetically free of English. The center of Chinatown has shifted east, engulfing the Grand Street subway station. Perhaps one day it will get a huabu sign as well.
 Charlene, raised in the north, didn't want the southern Chinese food all around us. We could do better. She wanted hotpot. So after we bought some dried fungus and preserved fruit, we hopped on a small shuttle bus to Flushing. The buses, which charge $2.50 for a ride, don't run on a fixed schedule. They wait at the base of the Confucius Tower on Division Street and leave when they are full. 
 My parents chauffeured me to Flushing every Sunday for folk dance lessons, martial arts and Chinese chorus; it's where I learned to twirl silk ribbons and sing ''Doe, a deer'' in Mandarin. Equipped with widely available parking and easy highway access, it draws the professional Chinese who live in the suburbs. This was the Chinatown that Charlene and her friends had heard of, where they could shop in boutiques carrying stylish clothing and stop in at bubble tea cafes on the side streets. Her Syracuse classmates were even staying in Flushing. Instead of paying for a hotel, they bunked in one of the $60 rooms in private residences that are advertised in Chinese newspapers -- bed and breakfasts without the breakfast.
 For this rising class of Chinese-American professionals, Chinatown can be an uncomfortable echo of a time when Chinese immigrants were almost exclusively male laborers. 
 The geographic and class divides are visible. Flushing has many more Chinese bookstores and more men in suits. It is home to the World Journal, a national Chinese-language paper owned by a Taiwan media company, and to the Taiwan government's cultural offices. When I was a bridesmaid for a Chinese-American friend who was a medical student at Columbia, she hired a white limo to take us from her Washington Heights dorm room to the Flushing Mall to get our hair and makeup done before the wedding.
 Where Chinatown is shrouded in history, Flushing is bright and contemporary. The broad, flat cityscape of Queens is spiced up with the shiny metal-and-mirror aesthetic popular in industrial East Asia. ''In Chinatown, everything is right in front of you,'' Charlene said, putting her hand right in front of her face. ''In Flushing, you can breathe.''
 The street food is more northern and western Chinese. We bought Xinjiang-styled lamb kabobs on Main Street for $1. Charlene, raised in a city with a Muslim influence, quickly devoured them. ''Do you like America?'' we asked the vendor, who had come from the western Chinese city of Urumqi on the Silk Road. ''I like American money,'' he said. But he would never raise his kids here -- he doesn't like the values. Charlene, too, wants to return to China after graduate school. With its roaring expansion, the opportunities are better for her there, she said -- a philosophy opposite that of my parents, who had arrived a generation before.
 We trudged to Minni's Shabu Shabu, a hotpot restaurant off Main Street that is one of my mother's favorites for family occasions. Charlene ordered the thin slices of lamb, which she flash-cooked in the hot water; I ordered fish balls. It was definitely hotpot as an American experience, she observed. In China, everyone would use one big boiling pot, mixing their food together. Not here. ''Each person has their own hotpot,'' she said. She had been lectured on American individualism in college and smiled at this simple example. 
 Even so, the hotpot tasted authentic. It was the meal she had been waiting for for five months since coming to Syracuse. For both of us, it was a taste of home.

EAST BROADWAY (between Grand Street and St. James Place) has become the thoroughfare of the American Fujianese community. It's not as tourist-friendly as Canal Street, but it's a taste of China -- from the open-air vendors who sell snacks for long bus trips to the simple restaurants with folding tables.

MUSEUM OF CHINESE IN THE AMERICAS, 70 Mulberry Street, Suite 2. Now cramped in four rooms on the second-floor of an old school building, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas recently announced plans to expand to a 12,350-square-foot space at 147-150 Lafayette Street, to be designed by Maya Lin.

COLUMBUS PARK, Mulberry and Bayard Streets, is where people practice tai chi, and clusters of retired men play Chinese chess. It is also the site of the Lunar New Year Flower Market, today from noon to 10 p.m. and tomorrow, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

HEADLINE: Sundance, Now a Study In Paradox

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
A few nights ago, I was walking down Main Street with a critic from another publication who was reminiscing, as folks at film festivals are inclined to do after a long day of so-so movies, about the old days. As we elbowed our way through throngs of yahoos in ski parkas (''Dude, I just saw Jennifer Aniston!'') and choked on the exhaust fumes from idling S.U.V.'s, my friend evoked a long-ago time, a quarter-century distant, when Sundance was still known as the USA Film Festival, and Main Street was a quaint and quiet Old West thoroughfare. 
 Back then, he said, the festival was so eager for press attention that it would arrange to pick up visiting journalists at the Salt Lake City airport and drive them into the mountains for a monastic week or so of small, serious films, many unlikely to be seen anywhere else. 
He might as well have been harking back to the days of the silver mines. The small, serious movies are still here, some never to be seen again, though these days a great many -- the majority in the American dramatic and documentary sections -- are shot on high-definition video rather than on film. The setting is now a mobbed, sprawling, media-saturated mini-metropolis, complete with traffic jams and parking nightmares, shuttle buses as packed as Tokyo subway cars, overpriced restaurants with two-hour waits for a table and important people hammering on their Blackberry keypads in darkened movie theaters. In other words, to those of us parachuting in from New York or Los Angeles, it feels a lot like home. Even so, the friendliness of the locals, especially the volunteers who load us onto the buses and shepherd us through the lines into screenings, is positively shaming. 
 So no more complaints, and no more nostalgia. To appreciate the Sundance Film Festival, 10 days winding up Sunday, as it is, you must embrace its contradictions. Here, the most high-minded artistic and moral aspirations coexist with hype, corporate self-congratulation and a ravening hunger for money and attention. All the values and pathologies that define the movie industry, -- and perhaps American culture in general -- are concentrated into a bitter, dizzying espresso shot.
 To take one example (and speaking of coffee), Starbucks is one of the festival's many sponsors this year (as is The New York Times). It is also the target of a muckraking documentary called ''Black Gold,'' which looks at the poverty and exploitation of the workers and farmers who harvest and process the beans in Ethiopia used by Starbucks. That the festival feels free to program an indictment of one of its patrons is evidence of a healthy -- or at least an unavoidable -- paradox. Movies, documentary and otherwise, that deal with social inequality and economic injustice are a staple of the festival, whose underwriters and attendees are among the most affluent people and organizations in the world.
 Sometimes this convergence can yield surprising results. ''God Grew Tired of Us,'' directed by Christopher Quinn, is a documentary about a group of young men who fled civil war in southern Sudan and lived for years in a refugee camp in Kenya. The film follows a few of these ''lost boys'' to Pittsburgh and Syracuse, where they adjust to a life that is infinitely safer and more comfortable than what they had left, but hard in its own ways. After one screening, one of the film's subjects, John Bul Dou, whose calm resilience is at the heart of the film, talked about his efforts to raise money to help the thousands of lost boys still in Africa. A member of the audience handed him a check for $25,000. 
 Utah is among the most reliably Republican states in the union, which lends a certain piquancy to the fact that the surest way to elicit boos from a Sundance audience is to put George Bush's face on the screen. Al Gore was here, warmly received and celebrity-spotted at a few parties; Ralph Nader, meanwhile, was the subject of a probing and informative documentary called ''An Unreasonable Man.'' As ever, political subjects pervaded the documentary categories, nearly always addressed from a left-of-center perspective. It would be nice, if only for variety's sake, to encounter a pro-war or pro-death-penalty documentary here, but that seems unlikely. Some of the topics included the recent Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the unsettled state of the border between the United States and Mexico, the cruel vagaries of the criminal justice system and the sufferings of wounded soldiers returning from Iraq. 
 All matters much in need of illumination, from whatever angle. And, in any case, it is not such a bad thing for an event like this to have a point of view. Documentary filmmaking is, at the moment, a mode of argument, and it is possible to learn a great deal from films that forgo objectivity in favor of polemic. 
 ''The Death of the Electric Car,'' for instance, a work in progress by Chris Paine (shown out of competition), is a prosecutorial examination of the role of oil companies, the automobile industry and the Bush administration (them again) in stymieing the development of emission-free electric vehicles. The film does give some time to the other side, but its intentions are overtly activist, and its interviews with scientists, engineers, regulators and executives provoke as well as inform. 
 The Sundance audience, one of the most passionate I've ever encountered here, was certainly fired up by the story of a promising technology quashed, in the filmmaker's view, by greed and timidity. As the film chronicled General Motors's shutdown of its electric car line -- the company reclaimed every single vehicle it had sold, and destroyed almost all of them -- a woman behind me exclaimed, ''That's crazy!'' 
 But pointing the camera need not always involve pointing a finger. James Longley's ''Iraq in Fragments'' is the latest entry in the crowded field of documentaries from that war. It is also one of the best, partly because it is more concerned with exploring daily life and individual destinies than with articulating a position. The title has several meanings, referring both to Mr. Longley's collagist method and to the communal fractures that threaten the country's stability. It takes the form of a trilogy, with one section devoted to Sunnis, one to Shia and one to Kurds, but it also reminds us that we generalize about those groups at our peril. Whether you think the war is right or wrong, ''Iraq in Fragments'' is a necessary reminder of just how painful and complicated it is.
 Which brings us to another paradox, one not unique to Sundance. Film festivals are artificial ecosystems, sealed off from the rest of the world, in which you can encounter a new painful and complicated reality on screen every two hours. A good laugh can seem as rare as a parking space or a restaurant table, which may be why comedies attract inordinate attention, as well as big money. So far this year, the noteworthy deals have been Fox Searchlight's purchase of distribution rights for ''Little Miss Sunshine,'' Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris's crowd-pleasing family road farce starring Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette and Steve Carell, and Warner Independent's pickup of ''The Science of Sleep,'' Michel Gondry's whimsical, trilingual surrealist romance with Gael Garcia Bernal and Charlotte Gainsbourg.
 But in the American dramatic competition, trouble -- especially the trouble facing young people in small towns and tough neighborhoods -- predominates. The earnest, closely observed coming-of-age story is one of Sundance's defining genres, represented this year most notably by Dito Montiel's ''Guide to Recognizing Your Saints'' and So Yong Kim's ''In Between Days.''
 Mr. Montiel's film, his first, is both an autobiography -- the main character, played as a young man by Shia LaBeouf and in later life by Robert Downey Jr., is named Dito -- and a mostly successful attempt to breathe fresh life into the ''Mean Streets'' tradition of volatile neighborhood drama. The film succeeds not just because the material is so close to the director's heart, but also because his loose, fluid directing style and his easy way with actors make it feel lived in, rather than merely familiar. 
 ''In Between Days'' is a quieter film, a wisp of a story about a young Korean girl living in a wintry American city and trying to figure out her feelings about her best friend, a boy named Tran, and herself. Ms. Kim generates an extraordinary sense of intimacy without seeming invasive or prurient, and without insulting the audience or the character with too much explanation. It's a small, serious film that shows great promise and that may have a hard time being seen outside this festival. So maybe not much has changed, after all.

HEADLINE: With Big Dreams and a Big Heart, a Teacher Puts Faith in the Overlooked Students 

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Pat Conroy, who wrote ''The Great Santini'' and ''The Prince of Tides,'' spent 1969 on a remote South Carolina island teaching poor black children who could neither read nor write and spoke to one another in Gullah, a blend of Elizabethan English and African languages.
 The author chronicled his year of living primitively in an autobiographical novel, ''The Water Is Wide,'' long a favorite of teachers, which was made into a 1974 film, ''Conrack,'' starring Jon Voight. 
 CBS on Sunday plans to show a new version, a ''Hallmark Hall of Fame'' presentation starring Jeff Hephner as the young Pat Conroy and Alfre Woodard as Mrs. Brown, his teaching nemesis. Nothing has changed, except the audience. 
 A generation ago, ''The Water Is Wide'' was a heartwarming tale spiked with indignation over separate and unequal education in the rural South -- a feel-good movie as manifesto. Now it is a feel-good movie as nostalgia, a gauzy look back at a time when nature was untamed and ignorance unspoiled.
 On Yamacraw, the fictional name of Daufuskie Island, there are no television sets, boomboxes or video games filling the educational void. Island children are blank-slate innocents, so thirsty for attention and learning that they listen, awestruck, to a recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. They are raised in cultural isolation and subsistence living that is now mostly found in the third world and a few New Age cults in California. It is a disgrace softened by the romance of rarity.
 Not that the American public school system has improved so much in the last four decades. Programs like Teach for America attest to the economic and social disparities that still plague communities all over the country. It's not getting better fast: the No Child Left Behind improvements that President Bush campaigned on in 2000 were mostly left behind in the wake of Sept. 11 and the invasion of Iraq. 
 It is the real estate market that has changed: until the mid-1970's, only 100 or so people, descendants of slaves, lived on Daufuskie Island in a community as untouched and backward as the Appalachia that Walker Evans and James Agee documented during the Depression. Today, Daufuskie Island is a luxury resort area with swimming pools, condos and championship golf courses -- a rustic recreational annex to Hilton Head. 
 Crossing the river to Yamacraw by fishing boat, Mr. Conroy is greeted at the island schoolhouse by Mrs. Brown, a veteran teacher who believes in corporal punishment and what she calls ''the fundamentals of refinement.'' Before the new teacher arrives, Mrs. Brown bangs her ruler and tells the pupils to ''mind your manners, don't act your color.'' She welcomes Mr. Conroy to his new job ''overseas'' and warns him that the teaching there is ''missionary work.''
 In a way, it is. Mr. Conroy had originally hoped to join the Peace Corps, and ended up teaching instead. Seeing that Mrs. Brown's methods have not worked -- her students are cowed but uneducated -- he adopts a looser, ''To Sir, With Love'' approach: desks in a circle, walks on the beach and, when he realizes that his pupils cannot believe that astronauts landed on the moon, a field trip to Washington. At first, the island parents are hostile, but they gradually come to appreciate his more unorthodox, caring approach. 
 The young teacher is torn between two influences: his fiancee, a sweet-natured teacher, who nurtures his softer, touchy-feely side, and memories -- shown in flashback -- of his stern, goading father, a Marine Corps martinet. (That kind of abusive father was at the center of Mr. Conroy's coming-of-age novel, ''The Great Santini,'' played by Robert Duvall in the movie, and was also a recurring figure in ''The Prince of Tides.'') In this film, Mr. Conroy's memories of his tough-talking father are usually triggered by encounters with the head of the BeaufortCounty school district, the verbose and exacting Dr. Piedmont, played by Frank Langella with his customary sinister charm. 
 Mr. Langella has played villains for much of his career. Ms. Woodard is newer to the dark side -- first as a secretive neighbor on ''Desperate Housewives'' and now as an insecure, narrow-minded teacher whose tongue is as cutting as the strap she uses on her students. ''Some of you were born simple-minded; you know who you are,'' she tells her classroom. ''You have to work harder than your lazy, lazy friends.'' 
 Mr. Hephner, a newcomer, plays Mr. Conroy as a naive do-gooder who patiently endures the snubs of Mrs. Brown and school district officials. His character is less prickly and outraged than the one played by Mr. Voight 32 years ago. So is the film. Nothing really terrible happens on or off Yamacraw, and there is little dramatic tension -- not even when Mr. Conroy faces dismissal.
 This ''Water Is Wide'' has a Hallmark worldview: painful episodes of the past are cottoned by idyllic scenery and storybook sentiment. The movie is touching and pleasant, without ever breaking a sweat.

HEADLINE: Income Gap in New York Is Called Nation's Highest

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
New York continues to have the highest income disparity between rich and poor of any state, according to a new study by two national economic policy groups. 
 The average income of the richest fifth of New York State families is 8.1 times the average income of the poorest fifth, according to the study, which drew from census data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, two liberal research groups based in Washington.
Nationwide, families in the top fifth made 7.3 times more than those in the bottom fifth. While New York has been at the top of the income gap list for several years, it ranked 11th in the early 1980's, when the difference between the average income of the top and bottom fifths was 5.6 times. 
 New Jersey was ninth in income disparity, with a difference of 7.5 times, and Connecticut was 23rd, with a gap of 6.9 times.
 The average income of families in the top 20 percent in New York State was $130,431, compared with $16,076 for the bottom fifth, according to data in the report.
 From 1980-1982 to 2001-2003, the periods examined in the study, average incomes grew by 18.9 percent nationwide, or $2,664, for the poorest families and 58.5 percent, or $45,101, for families among the top fifth of income earners. 
 ''The biggest thing is the decline in wages for the low and moderate income people,'' said Elizabeth McNichol, an author of the report. ''Part of it is large periods of higher than average unemployment, globalization -- jobs going overseas -- the shift from manufacturing jobs to lower paying service sector jobs, immigration, the weakening of unions, and the fact that the federal minimum wage has been declining relative to inflation.''
 Added to that, an increase in investment income helped the rich get richer, the study said. 
 Tax policy played a role in the widening of the gap over the years, according to the study, which adjusted income for federal but not state taxes. On the state level, Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed another slate of personal income tax cuts and rebates, and more than half of the value of the package would go to the state's wealthiest 10 percent. 
 ''We've made taxes less progressive -- we've cut the top rate by more than half since the early 70's, and Pataki's proposing to cut it again,'' said Trudi Renwick, a senior economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute in Albany, a liberal group that collaborated in the income study and presented its own report on New York. 
 Ms. Renwick said increases in property taxes had been more damaging to the middle class than to the wealthy, but gave credit to Mr. Pataki for the state's version of the earned-income tax credit, a break for low income workers, calling it ''about the best in the country.''
 Among the groups' many prescriptions were raising the minimum wage, broadening unemployment insurance and realigning the tax burden away from the lower and middle classes -- notions conservatives tend to see as counterproductive. 
 E.J. McMahon, a budget expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute, attributed the large income imbalance to ''the large number of foreign immigrants in New York, who are largely poor, unskilled workers.''
 ''To me, the whole focus of this report is, in my view, totally misplaced,'' said Mr. McMahon, adding that the more important question was what was keeping workers from moving from one income strata to another. ''One barrier is education, or the lack of educational attainment, and that would imply that we need to focus on making schools better,'' he said. 
 Ms. Renwick cited a court order to pump billions into city schools, which Mr. Pataki is appealing.

HEADLINE: Group Led by Goldman to Pay $3.8 Billion for 10% of Bank

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Friday, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
An investment group that includes Goldman Sachs, Allianz of Germany and the American Express Company are expected to announce Friday that it will pay about $3.8 billion for a 10 percent stake in the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China's largest government-owned bank, according to people close to the deal. 
 Under the agreement, Goldman is expected to invest $2.58 billion in the bank, Allianz $1 billion and American Express $200 million.
 First reported in August as a $1 billion investment, the deal is one of several major foreign investments in China's massive banking system in the last six months as it undergoes revamping and the banks prepare to offer stock to the public. The China Construction Bank went public last year in Hong Kong. And the Bank of China is preparing for an initial offering some time this year. The Industrial & Commercial Bank of China could go public as soon as 2007.
 Many of the world's largest banks and financial institutions are now rushing into China to acquire stakes in banks, hoping to get a foothold in the fast-growing economy.
 A group led by Citigroup has emerged as the top bidder -- at $3 billion -- for about 85 percent of the Guangdong Development Bank. Bank of America is putting $3 billion into the China Construction Bank; investors led by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Merrill Lynch have put $3.1 billion into the Bank of China; and Temasek Holdings of Singapore has agreed to invest more than $4 billion. 
 Not long ago, China's biggest banks were burdened with billions of dollars in bad debt and some believed the entire system could collapse. But the government has stepped in to bailout many banks and restore confidence in the system.

HEADLINE: Bush Defends His Goal of Spreading Democracy to the Mideast 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
The sweeping victory of Hamas in the Palestinian elections threw President Bush and his aides on the defensive on Thursday, complicating the administration's policy of trying to promote democracy as an antidote to the spread of terrorism.
 Reacting uneasily to the Hamas triumph, Mr. Bush said the results spoke to the failures of President Mahmoud Abbas and the ''old guard'' of his Fatah faction to root out corruption and mismanagement, not to any flaws in the administration's policy of advocating democracy.
''There was a peaceful process as people went to the polls, and that's positive,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But what's also positive is that it's a wake-up call to the leadership. Obviously people were not happy with the status quo. The people are demanding honest government. The people want services.'' 
 But without criticizing the Palestinian people for choosing leaders who advocate the destruction of Israel, a tenet at the very core of Hamas's creed, he said that the United States would never tolerate such a policy. In the same fashion, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice noted that Palestinians want a negotiated peace settlement with Israel, according to opinion polls, but she repeated that this goal remained possible only if Hamas renounced its violent ways.
 Mr. Bush joined a chorus of world leaders -- including the so-called quartet of principal parties in the moribund peace process -- in calling on Hamas to renounce terrorism, disarm its militias and recognize the legitimacy of Israel now that it has won the elections. But his tone was less confrontational than invitational -- in effect, inviting Hamas to embrace reconciliation.
 For now, Mr. Bush called on President Abbas to stay in office and steer the Palestinian government on a moderate course.
 The Hamas victory was the fifth case recently of militants' winning significant gains through elections. They included the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hezbollah in Lebanon, a radical president in Iran, and Shiites backed by militias in Iraq.
 As these elections unfolded, there has been increasing criticism in some quarters -- notably among the self-described ''realists'' in foreign policy, many of them veterans of past Republican administrations -- that President Bush has naively pushed for democracy in countries without the civil society components to support it.
 ''The Hamas victory is a disillusioning result showing that democracy and American interests don't always coincide,'' said Nikolas K. Gvosdev, a Russia expert who is editor of The National Interest, a publication that echoes with debate about this subject.
 ''Given the weakness of Palestinian society, people should not have been surprised that this was the outcome,'' Mr. Gvosdev added. 
 Other critics, too, including some Arab leaders, say that the United States failed to do its part to shore up Mr. Abbas by wringing more concessions from Israel and doing more to revitalize the economy in the West Bank and Gaza.
 A senior State Department official said recently that the Bush administration, five years ago, inherited what he called the old model: that economic growth, the development of a middle class and the spread of education needed to come before democracy could take hold in troubled countries.
 ''But that's a story that we can no longer accept,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of rules prohibiting him from publicly explaining administration policy. ''First of all you're not getting economic growth in a lot of places. We now understand that getting greater political openness and democracy in the Arab world is essential to our security.''
 The problem faced by the administration on Thursday was how to coax Hamas into the mainstream. 
 The West has more tools than mere diplomatic pressure to influence Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. The authority, described by many as nearly bankrupt, has begun tapping its trust funds to pay daily expenses and is running a deficit that Israel calculates at more than $700 million a year.
 Europe and the United States provide most of the $1 billion in foreign assistance that goes to the Palestinians. But some of this money has already been cut back in protest of the Palestinian leadership's raising salaries and welfare benefits, which make up a major part of the Palestinian economy.
 American and European officials said they could not imagine outside aid continuing if there is a Hamas-led government that has not renounced violence or Hamas's commitment to destroying Israel.
 Many of the reactions from Western diplomats took on dramatic tones, characterizing Hamas as now facing a trial of identity.
 ''What Hamas faces is not only a political but an existential dilemma,'' said Terje Roed-Larsen, the former United Nations envoy in the Middle East, in an interview. ''They have built their identity on opposing elections and the institutions of the Palestinian Authority. Now they're the masters of the institutions they have been against.''
 Diplomats involved in the Middle East peace process known as the road map, the document that calls for reciprocal steps between Israelis and Palestinians toward creation of a Palestinian state, say that any immediate chances of reviving the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue are daunting if not impossible.
 The immediate question before the administration is not whether negotiations can be revived but whether Israel can be encouraged to carry out more unilateral withdrawals from the West Bank.
 As for dealing with Hamas, the Europeans are considered likely to see the problem differently, many diplomats say. Regarding both Hamas and Hezbollah, the Europeans have called for the West to use the template of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, when dealing with them.
 In other words, they say, talking to Hamas may help coax it toward eventual partnership in a peace negotiation. The problem, many diplomats and experts say, is that no one even pretends that there are truly separate wings of Hamas. Its armed forces and its political leaders are married to each other inextricably.

HEADLINE: Boycott Call Creates Fracas at Davos Forum 

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 26 

 BODY:
A magazine article calling on nations to boycott Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians has provoked a tempest at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting here, prompting the organizers to pull the magazines from the forum's shelves here and issue an apology. 
 The article, which appeared in Global Agenda, a magazine published by the forum and distributed to participants, carried the headline ''Boycott Israel.'' The author, Mazin Qumsiyeh, equated Israel's policies toward Palestinians with apartheid and said that countries should withdraw their investments and boycott Israel.
After a member raised questions about the article, the organizers removed the magazines from shelves at the conference center in this Alpine resort. The forum's executive director, Klaus Schwab, said the article should not have been published and had slipped through the editing process.
 ''There was an unacceptable failure in the editorial process, specifically an insufficiently short period for review of content, for which there is no excuse,'' Mr. Schwab said in a statement. ''The article is totally in contradiction to my own, and the forum's, mission and values.''
 The timing of the contretemps -- on the day that Hamas won a landslide victory in Palestinian elections -- was not lost on people here. The future of Israeli and Palestinian relations was high on the agenda on Thursday at this meeting of about 2,300 political figures, private groups and corporate executives.
 The article on Israel had drawn no response until Wednesday, when an American technology executive raised questions about its tone.
 ''I was shocked,'' said Rabbi Awraham S. Soetendorp, of the Jewish Institute for Human Values in the Netherlands, who was attending the forum. ''The issue that Zionism was equated with racism was so outrageous.''
 The publication of the article was a keen embarrassment for Mr. Schwab, who prides himself on fostering dialogue in troubled parts of the world.
 Mr. Schwab had hoped to organize a panel discussion this year between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. But the acting prime minister of Israel, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, declined invitations to come to Davos because of events at home.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke via satellite during a panel here, reaffirming the position of the United States that Hamas must renounce violence and recognize Israel's right to exist.
 Mr. Qumsiyeh, the author of the article, is an American citizen of Palestinian descent who frequently writes in support of Palestinian causes. In a telephone interview from New Jersey, he said he had been asked to submit the article by a staff writer at the magazine.
 ''Why is free speech not allowed?'' said Mr. Qumsiyeh, a geneticist. He said his article called for a nonviolent response to Israeli policy.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Slowed Sharply at End of 2005 

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Economic growth weakened unexpectedly in the fourth quarter of 2005, rising 1.1 percent, the slowest pace in three years, and clouding the immediate outlook for the economy, the government reported yesterday. 
 Consumer spending slowed abruptly as purchases of motor vehicles collapsed after automakers phased out the generous incentive programs that had lifted sales through the summer. As consumers cut back on spending, business investment also slowed as companies curtailed spending on cars and trucks. Military spending also fell unexpectedly, while a surging import bill put a drag on overall growth.
The intensity of the economic slowdown, which reduced yearly growth to 3.5 percent from 4.2 percent in 2004, surprised many forecasters. They had expected a sharp pickup in business investment in the final months of the year to take up some of the slack in consumer spending and had predicted an overall growth rate of 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 ''It is not so much surprising as baffling,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. 
 The weak economic data pleased investors, who pushed up the price of stocks in the expectation that the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making committee meets on Tuesday, might end its 18-month campaign to raise its benchmark interest rate -- now at 4.25 percent -- after it reaches 4.5 percent or 4.75 percent.
 ''The silver lining in this is that the Fed should look at this and realize that this economy is not overheating,'' said David Kelly, a senior economic adviser at Putnam Investments in Boston, the mutual fund manager. 
 Yet the abrupt slowdown fed into a bubbling debate over the nation's economic prospects as the housing market weakens and removes a core pillar supporting consumers' hearty spending. 
 Many economic analysts have been warning for months that the housing bubble will burst and lead to retrenchment as rising interest rates and the stalling of home sales put a dent in consumer spending.
 ''I believe it is a genuine slowdown,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, arguing that higher interest rates and expensive oil are taking the wind out of consumers' sails.
 Specifically, he argued, the auto sector will keep bogging the economy down because car companies have built up heavy inventories that they must unload.
 After setting records last summer, sales of existing homes, which make up 85 percent of the housing market, fell in each of the last three months as mortgage interest rates rose modestly. 
 New-home sales, a more volatile and less reliable indicator, increased 2.9 percent in December, to an annual pace of 1.27 million, after falling 9.2 percent in November, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Median prices, however, fell 3.4 percent, to $221,800 from a year ago.
 Yet even though the housing market has started to cool, most forecasters argued that the fourth quarter's slowdown is not the beginning of a deeper slide. As they took stock of the data, economists argued that the economic slump would prove fleeting, caused by factors that are unlikely to be repeated in the first quarter. 
 Some warned that the reading for growth in the fourth quarter was merely a preliminary estimate and could be revised upward -- especially business investment, which should be surging at this stage in the economic cycle, when profits are high and companies are hitting capacity constraints. Most expected consumer spending and business investment to rebound in the first half of the year as the downturn in auto sales ends. 
 ''The probability of a substantial upward revision is quite high,'' said Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services in Boston. ''Then growth should rebound in the first quarter back into the region of 4 percent.''
 Much of the current slowdown could be attributed to Detroit. ''It all boils down to the auto sector,'' said Daniel J. Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a business research group. ''Auto sales permeate everything in final demand.''
 Deep discounts on cars and trucks pumped sales by the three domestic automakers during the summer and early fall. But as the incentives expired and gasoline prices surged above $3 a gallon in some places in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, sales dropped precipitously. 
 In the fourth quarter of last year, final sales of motor vehicles fell 50.4 percent at an annual rate. Consumer spending on sport utility vehicles and other light trucks fell by 69 percent, at an annual rate, while business spending declined 19 percent. The effect on overall economic output was significant. Just the decline in consumer purchases of vehicles subtracted 2.06 percentage points from growth in the quarter.
 Other items also contributed to the decline, but analysts argued they would prove temporary. Military spending slumped, a surprising development during a war. 
 ''We are still trying to figure out where that came from,'' a Lehman Brothers economist, Joseph Abate, said. 
 Moreover, the surge in the price of oil led to a big jump in the nation's energy bill, contributing to a sharp rise in imports that put a drag on domestic output. 
 A buildup in business inventories provided a significant lift, 1.45 percentage points, to the economy. But if consumption remains weak, that additional stock of goods could force manufacturers to cut back on production in coming months.
 ''That's not sustainable growth,'' said Anthony Chan, chief economist at J. P. Morgan's private client services group.
 Still, though economists believe that the economy will rebound in the immediate future, there remains a deep-rooted concern about a downturn further down the road. 
 Mr. Shepherdson, for instance, forecast a 30 percent to 40 percent drop in the number of home sales by the end of the year, which would put a freeze on consumer spending. Mr. Barbera predicted economic growth this year would fall to about 2.4 percent. 
 Charles Dumas, the chief international economist at forecasting firm Lombard Street Research in London, said in a note to investors: ''It will take a miracle as fine as Mozart, 250 years old today and as fresh as new, to prevent a sharp U.S. slowdown in the second half of 2006, probably to nil growth'' by the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Plan to Retire, But Don't Let Numbers Rule 

BYLINE: By M.P. Dunleavey

 BODY:
EVERY time I read that many Americans are not saving enough for retirement, it makes me nervous, because I'm one of them. When I was younger I didn't set aside retirement money -- not a dime -- so I'm now playing catch-up. 
 This line of thought always leads down the rabbit hole to a series of other nerve-racking questions, starting with: How much will my savings amount to in 30 years and is it enough? 
Each day that question -- which preoccupies savers and nonsavers alike -- seems to take on a greater urgency. Aside from the fact that pension plans are evaporating right and left and Social Security is dwindling to a question mark, the notion of retirement itself is under reconstruction.
 That's not to say you can't aim for a quiet life of golf and volunteering in a small but culturally rich college town. But the buzz is that with longer life spans and better health care, we could all remain vigorously involved in our companies, families and communities well into our 90's -- at which time we will slow down and pursue some long-postponed ambition like hiking the Arctic.
 Throw in the mystery of future tax rates and the toll of inflation, and retirement planning begins to remind me of a surreal version of the old board game Clue. You are supposed to solve this big puzzle in a step-by-step fashion with practically no information -- until it's too late. 
 Take this one teensy factor in retirement planning: death. How are you supposed to save enough when you don't know how long ''enough'' is supposed to last? 
 Lee Eisenberg, a former editor of Esquire, just wrote a book about this preoccupation: ''The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life'' (Free Press, 2006). As Mr. Eisenberg is quick to point out, he is not a financial planner or an investment adviser. And, until the appendix, his book, a thought-provoking read, pretty much skirts the issue of how to calculate your nest egg.
 That is because Mr. Eisenberg thinks the obsession with having enough money in retirement obscures a far more important question: What kind of life are you going to live with that money?
 To be fair, he noted in an interview, most people are so busy juggling work and family, ''we don't have a lot of time to sit down on a yoga mat and meditate about what really matters to us.'' 
 Yet to plan financially without knowing what will engage and sustain you emotionally during those last years is to set yourself up for a bleak, if not broke, future.
 If anything is going to get people to take retirement seriously, Mr. Eisenberg said, it is reorienting the discussion: ''Maybe we don't need to be talking only about dollars and cents but engagement and fulfillment.''
 While I applaud any effort to shift the focus from material concerns alone, the allure of a more satisfying life may not spur anyone to save more. What will galvanize people like me to secure the future is a wallop of financial reality in the present. 
 In the experience of Bill Schultheis, a former investment adviser with Salomon Smith Barney and the author of ''The Coffeehouse Investor'' (Palouse, 2005), ''most people are reluctant to connect their retirement to their present financial decisions.'' 
 But it does not take long to link the dots if you take a few minutes to calculate even a rough estimate. Like most investing books, this one has a do-it-yourself chart (which I found easier than most). You can also search for retirement calculators online; www.dinkytown.com, www.choosetosave.org/ballpark or www.fool.com are good places to start.
 To one degree or another, these methods are flawed. You cannot control all the variables. There will always be too many unknowns. And these tools may spit out wildly different figures. But after spending less than 30 minutes trying three or four of them, I can testify to the baptismal power of being doused with some cold, hard numbers. Should I be saving more? Yes, about $2,000 a month more, when I average the results. That is a terrifying target. 
 But Mr. Schultheis, being from Seattle, takes a laid-back approach, saying you will save more with a sense of that bigger picture. And. hey, while you're at it, it wouldn't hurt to think about the quality of life those savings will let you enjoy.

HEADLINE: Major Indexes Bounce Back After Last Week's Tumble

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A new round of strong earnings reports sent stocks soaring for a second straight session yesterday as investors shrugged off surprisingly slow growth in the nation's gross domestic product. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average had a two-day gain of nearly 200 points, and the major indexes ended the week with solid gains.
 The Commerce Department's report on gross domestic product, which grew just 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, was seen as good news for interest rates, as investors believe that the Federal Reserve, which meets next week, will be hard pressed to continue raising rates with such slow growth. 
 And while a tempered economy could hurt corporate earnings down the road, the positive reports this week have buoyed enthusiasm for stocks, with the idea that while the United States economy slows, other markets like those in Japan and Germany continue to expand. 
 ''The rest of the world is actually growing, and that could bode really well for U.S. companies,'' said Matthew Smith, portfolio manager at Smith Affiliated Capital. ''And combined with the idea that the Fed is going to be done soon, that's what's getting the market going.'' 
 The advance in the United States followed a resurgence in Japanese stocks. The Tokyo exchange's benchmark index soared to a five-year high yesterday and wiped out its heavy losses of last week as investors responded to upbeat earnings from Sony and other companies. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 97.74 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,907.21, after gaining 99.73 points on Thursday. 
 Broader stock indicators also posted sharp gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 9.89 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,283.72, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 21.23 points, or 0.93 percent, to 2,304.23. 
 Bonds traded in a narrow range as investors digested the economic news, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury slipping to 4.51 percent from 4.52 percent late Thursday and the price, which moves in the opposite direction from the rate, rising 1/32, to 99 29/32. 
 The dollar rose against most major currencies, while gold prices were lower. 
 Persistent fears of increasing unrest in oil-producing regions sent crude oil futures sharply higher. A barrel of light crude oil ended at $67.76, up $1.50, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 ''You would think that oil, and the situation in the Middle East and Iran, would be a setback for stocks, but it really hasn't been,'' said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons. ''I just think the market was as happy as it could be to see that lower-than-expected G.D.P. number. It just hammers home to the Fed that the economy is slowing and they need to stop raising rates.'' 
 The Fed's Open Market Committee, which meets next week, is widely expected to increase the nation's benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point, to 4.5 percent, and then stop raising rates for a while, possibly the rest of the year. 
 The expectation of a halt to rate increases, in combination with strong earnings reports, sent stocks higher through the week, though the major indexes have yet to return to their highs of early January. 
 The major indexes tumbled more than 2 percent last week, but all three rebounded this week. The Dow climbed 2.2 percent, the S. & P. rose 1.8 percent and the Nasdaq gained 2.5 percent for the week. 
 On Friday, earnings were once again positive, helping the market overcome last week's disappointments. Microsoft climbed $1.29, to $27.79, after seeing its quarterly profits grow 5 percent for the quarter. The software company said new server products helped sales, and with a new Windows operating system coming later this year, Microsoft increased its full-year earnings outlook. 
 Procter & Gamble's quarterly earnings rose 29 percent, beating analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share. It added 92 cents, to $59.74. 
 In merger and acquisition news, Mittal Steel jumped $1.96, to $34.26, after it announced a surprise $22.8 billion acquisition offer for a European rival, Arcelor. 
 Pfizer received Food and Drug Administration approval for a drug intended to combat stomach and kidney cancers. Pfizer shares rose 94 cents, to $25.99. 
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.95 billion shares, compared with 2.07 billion traded on Thursday.

HEADLINE: What, You Got a Problem Paying $102.13 for 2 Tomatoes?

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
For nearly a decade it was Bob Hinde's job to monitor stores in Des Plaines, Ill., to assure that advertised prices agreed with those charged at the register. Now that he is retired, it is a much more personal endeavor.
 Three times in the last three months, Mr. Hinde says, he was overcharged at the grocery. In the first instance, it was an extra $1 on an $8.95 bottle of olive oil. In the second, a ''buy one, get one free'' discount for caramel dip did not show up. And, in the third, he was charged $102.13 for two tomatoes, bringing the bill to $180, well over what he would typically spend on groceries.
 ''I said to the cashier, Can this be right?'' Mr. Hinde recalled, noting that at that point he knew only the total. ''She assured us it was.''
 Mr. Hinde and his wife, Lorraine, isolated the mistake on the way to the car (the tomatoes should have been $2.13), returned to the store and got their money back. But, Mr. Hinde said, it illustrates the need for consumers to check their receipts. 
 Surveys indicate that consumers lose $1 billion to $2.5 billion each year because of scanner pricing errors. While many states and municipalities have enforcement officers who go to stores to check the accuracy between stated prices and what rings up at the register, it's up to consumers -- whether eating in a restaurant, buying groceries or items at drug stores -- to reconcile receipts as soon as they get them.
 ''The first thing we all have to do is become more aware,'' said Janet A. Jenkins, administrator of the division of trade and consumer protection for the state of Wisconsin.
 Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn of Illinois, who has proposed a law to prevent what he calls ''consumer scamming,'' cites two studies to support the need for the legislation. In one, researchers at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois-Chicago and at the University of California, Berkeley, found that Wal-Marts in four states committed pricing errors in excess of federal recommendations. 
 The study, commissioned by the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which has tried unsuccessfully to unionize Wal-Mart, found scanners rang up the wrong price for 6.4 percent of the items purchased for the survey in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan and for 8.3 percent of the items purchased in California. The errors were both higher and lower than the listed price.
 In another study, the Department of Consumer Services in Chicago found that at 78 percent of drugstores in the city, including three major chains, scanning errors occurred more than 2 percent of the time. The errors ranged from a nickel to $35.
 ''I think it's negligence on the stores' part; I don't think they assign employees to put the wrong prices out,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''There's a lack of paying attention. It's not a high priority for the retailers.''
 Nate Hurst, a Wal-Mart spokesman, called the studies ''paid attacks by our union critics.'' He noted that the studies themselves said the results should not be used to generalize about the price accuracy for Wal-Mart Stores nationwide. He said the company's last internal pricing audit revealed an error rate of 2.4 percent on a check of 15,791 items.
 Consumer Services surveyed scanner pricing accuracy in 1990, Mr. Quinn said, and found that 80 percent of the drugstores overcharged customers. It did another survey 12 years later, and the figure was still 80 percent.
 ''Our view is every company and retail firm should have somebody who is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the advertised prices,'' Mr. Quinn said.
 The proposed law in Illinois -- the Retail Consumer Protection Act of 2006 -- would establish fines of up to $5,000 for each price scanner incident and require every store to name one employee to verify that shelf prices and checkout prices are the same. If the mispriced item is under $3, the customer gets the item free. If the item is over $3, the customer pays the correct amount and gets $3 back -- in essence a $3 reward for being overcharged.
 The law, he said, is modeled after one in California, which has some of the most stringent regulations in the country when it comes to overcharging. On the federal level, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a nonregulatory agency responsible for weights and measures, along with the National Conference on Weights and Measures, a standards development organization made up of regulatory officials, business representatives, trade associations and consumer groups, created a handbook outlining inspection procedure for price verification. According to those guidelines, the retailer fails if more than 2 percent of the items tested ring up incorrectly.
 John Blair, a spokesman for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, noted that pricing errors were often made in favor of the consumer. A federal study in 1996 found an error rate of 4 percent when testing scanner devices, but more than half of those went in the consumer's favor. Another study two years later, found an error rate of 3 percent, with half of those benefiting the merchant.
 ''Many times when we find inaccuracies they kind of even out,'' Ms. Jenkins said. ''But that doesn't help the consumer who was overcharged.''
 While some states, including Wisconsin, rely on the federal provisions when monitoring , some, like California, allow for no mistakes.
 San Diego County has even gone beyond what's required by the state, initiating fees paid by businesses that use price scanners to cover the cost of three full-time inspectors who check scanning equipment. Merchants can be fined $100 for an error of a dollar or less and there is a sliding scale for inaccuracies above that.
 Kathleen Thuner, San Diego County agricultural commissioner and sealer of weights and measures, said her battle against overcharging began in 1984 when, as a young mother (and as director of weights and measures for one year), she was charged for a six-pack of baby formula when buying only one can.
 Ms. Thuner said in 2005 she levied $60,400 in penalties for scanner violations not counting the larger cases handled by the county district attorney's office, which included a $540,000 settlement in November with the parent company of Sports Authority and SportMart. The company took immediate steps to correct the problems that resulted in the overcharges, the district attorney said.
 Ms. Thuner says her office relies heavily on consumers who alert her office when overpricing occurs. 
 She said nearly 20 years of dealing with the issue has helped her to identify a few situations where consumers need to be particularly aware of the potential for overpricing:
 More mistakes are found during holidays like Christmas when sales volumes are at high levels.
 A significantly higher number of violations occur on sale items.
 Many mistakes occur when sales promise a percentage taken off at the register.
 ''Oftentimes, we have found the math is not done correctly in the computer,'' she said. 
 While most of the concrete information available about overcharging involves scanner machines that can be readily checked, consumer advocates said the problem could be found in a variety of areas.
 ''We've found -- and this is anecdotal -- that in some restaurants they'll charge you for something you didn't get, not charge you for something you did get or you might even get someone else's bill,'' said Linda Golodner, president of the National Consumers League.
 Consumers should be diligent about checking and be pushy if the price is not the one advertised , advocates say. Still, consumers often feel embarrassed or don'ttake the time to deal with mistakes, the advocates say, particularly if the mistakes are just a few cents.
 ''I shop with my husband,'' Ms. Thuner said. ''He unloads and I check the scanner. When I used to shop with my daughter, I taught her to write down the actual price and check it with the receipt.''
 The more items a person buys, experts note, the less likely they are to remember the price. 
 Ms. Golodner suggests shoppers take along advertisements with sale prices, jot down shelf prices or photograph them with camera cellphones and pay attention at the checkout stand to assure prices are ringing up correctly. She also suggests reviewing the register receipt before leaving the store and complaining at that time if necessary.
 ''I know we don't want to hold up people behind us, but I think it's critical for consumers to insist on their rights at the point of sale,'' said Ms. Jenkins of Wisconsin's consumer affairs office. ''So many of us will go home and say, 'Ah, I'm not going to make this call for 12 cents.' We tend to put it aside. But, by dealing with it, even though we might temporarily annoy people in line behind us, we're actually helping them.''

HEADLINE: Plan to End Darfur Violence Is Failing, Officials Say

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The broad strategy for ending the carnage in Darfur, Sudan, devised over the last two years by the United States, the United Nations and the European Union, is collapsing as the violence and chaos in the region seem to grow with every passing week, United Nations and Bush administration officials say. 
 After three years of bloodshed that has already claimed more than 200,000 lives, officials say they are struggling to devise an effective new strategy. 
''We're working very closely with our partners to see if we can turn this around,'' said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly.
 But the obstacles and complications are multiplying. 
 Peace talks have nearly halted after government and Darfur-rebel negotiators, in the latest round, showed an unwillingness to seriously discuss anything except sharing Sudan's oil wealth. A growing military conflict on the Sudan-Chad border in Darfur is further endangering hundreds of thousands of refugees living in camps there. One of the Sudanese president's latest positions, articulated in a published interview this month, is that the government-backed militias known to be behind most of the violence are actually a fictitious creation of the media and the United States Congress.
 ''The looming threat of complete lawlessness and anarchy draws nearer,'' Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, lamented earlier this month as he urged Western nations to do more. 
 The international response has been so ineffectual that ''people on the ground are just laughing,'' said Jan Pronk, the chief United Nations envoy in Sudan. 
 The primary element of the present approach to end the bloodshed has been the deployment of 7,000 African Union peacekeeping troops in Darfur, where they have tried without success to dampen the widespread brutality and banditry. In fact, these troops have become targets themselves. In recent months, five have been shot and killed, including one on Jan. 6.
 The United States and Europe have both declined to provide further financial support for the effort, and African Union leaders say money to conduct the operation will run out in March. The Bush administration continues to push Congress to provide more money, but Congress has twice rejected the request in recent months during budget debates.
 ''The funds are almost exhausted,'' Alpha Omar Konare, chairman of the African Union commission, said in a report last week. 
 The United Nations is considering deploying a larger force of its own peacekeeping troops to replace those of the African Union, but the discussions are at an early, preliminary stage. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed support for the idea this month. But the Sudanese government insists it will not accept United Nations forces on its territory, leaving Darfur and its surviving residents in limbo.
 What is more, Mr. Pronk said this week, the United Nations ''is not so eager'' to take on troop commitments. ''The U.N. has already reached its ceiling of commitments.'' 
 Neither he nor other officials were willing to predict how this predicament might be resolved. Meanwhile, ''Darfur is in a free fall,'' said John Prendergast, who was director of African affairs for the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. Now he is a senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit organization. 
 In recent months, American officials said they were placing most of their faith in the on-again, off-again peace talks that began 18 months ago. Salim Ahmed Salim, an African Union official mediating the talks, observed after the latest negotiating session collapsed without result last month that both sides had shown little more than ''deep distrust'' of each other. American and United Nations officials said the only topic that the sides showed any eagerness to discuss was ''wealth sharing.'' 
 Relief agencies administering the enormous task of feeding and caring for more than three million homeless Darfurians -- half the state's population -- have for many months tried to work in an environment rife with thugs, bandits, kidnappers and killers. Now, however, Sudan and Chad are building up forces and fighting skirmishes along their border in Darfur. 
 As a result, Mr. Pronk said he had ordered ''a significant reduction in the presence of U.N. staff, and restricted U.N. access in the affected areas.'' Camps holding hundreds of thousands of refugees lie on or near the border with Chad. But Mr. Pronk said relief agencies there were still providing essential services.
 The conflict in Darfur began in February 2003, when rebel groups attacked government positions, accusing the leaders in Khartoum of ignoring their region. The government struck back with a fury, enlisting local militias to massacre civilians and destroy entire villages.
 The world was slow to acknowledge the problem, but in September 2004, the Bush administration stated that the carnage constituted genocide. The African Union troops began slowly arriving in Darfur last year.
 So far, Mr. Prendergast added, Western nations ''have used an ostrich strategy, hoping with a wing and a prayer that the African Union forces would actually succeed. But they are finally acknowledging that it is not going to work.''
 Western leaders have all but given up on a key part of their strategy, trying to persuade Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, to disarm the militias that are responsible for a large part of the violence. The United States says his government continues to finance the militias, even though Sudanese officials claim to be working hard to bring peace to Darfur. A special United Nations committee said this month that the Sudanese government had ''abjectly failed to fulfill its commitment to identify, neutralize and disarm militia groups.''
 Mr. Bashir generally deflects questions on the Darfur violence when meeting with visiting American officials, and instead asks them to lift the economic embargo on Sudan, senior officials said. He also urges them to continue providing aid under the peace agreement that ended a 21-year civil war with the south -- the one bright spot in Sudan. 
 In a speech two weeks ago, Mr. Bashir called on the anti-government Darfur rebels to ''repent.'' Then, in an interview with a German newspaper two days later, he denied that the government-financed janjaweed militias existed. 
 On Jan. 12, Sudan's government news agency issued a statement about the interview, saying ''Field Marshall Bashir'' had offered the view that ''the U.S. Congress groups, which represent the Christian right and Zionist lobby, have a primarily hostile stance against Sudan and always try to incite this issue.''

HEADLINE: Georgia Signs Deal With Iran to Buy Natural Gas

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS; Andrew Kramer contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The government of Georgia said Friday that it had entered into a deal with Iran to purchase natural gas, potentially easing a heat and electricity shortage that has chilled Georgia's people and slowed its economy for a week. 
 Details of the arrangement, which could send Iranian gas through Azerbaijan to Georgia as soon as Sunday, were limited. Georgian officials declined to discuss the price for the new supply or whether transit fees would be paid to Azerbaijan.
Instead, they said it was a temporary agreement that diversified Georgia's sources of energy and would help end the crisis that began on Sunday when saboteurs destroyed gas pipelines and an electric power line that brought energy to the Caucasus nation. The anticipated Iranian supply of gas, two million cubic meters a day, would provide slightly less than half of Georgia's needs.
 ''This is a deal that is suitable for Georgia,'' George Arveladze, chief of staff to President Mikheil Saakashvili, said by telephone from Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. ''Bringing in the alternative source is what matters most, and the deal is good.''
 The announcement of the agreement came as Russia's effort to repair the damaged pipeline into Georgia continued to suffer delays, and as a Web site representing Islamic insurgent groups posted a message that claimed to be from the rebels saying they were not involved.
 Vladimir A. Ivanov, a spokesman for Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations, said about 10 yards of the pipeline had been found to have tiny fractures and would have to be replaced. ''If nothing else interferes, the first gas will be pumped on Sunday,'' he said. 
 Georgian energy supplies have been limited since the separate bombings on Sunday destroyed sections of the two Russian pipelines that brought all of Georgia's natural gas over the Caucasus ridge and downed a power line that brought in part of Georgia's electricity. 
 The problems intensified when Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, announced it could not send gas via an alternate route through Azerbaijan because it was having technical problems with a compressor. 
 Most of Georgia's households were left without gas as temperatures at night fell below 20 degrees. The crisis deepened on Thursday when high winds severed power lines carrying electricity from Georgia's hydropower dams, causing widespread blackouts. Aleko Khetaguri, Georgia's deputy energy minister, said repairs could take a week.
 Russia has blamed terrorists for the sabotage, noting that underground Islamic groups that collaborate with separatists in Chechnya are known to operate in the region. 
 The message on the Web site, however, denied involvement. The message, the authenticity of which could not be confirmed independently, suggested that the sabotage could have been carried out by Russia to punish Georgia for its pro-Western policies.

HEADLINE: New York Urges U.S. Inquiry in Mining Company's Indonesia Payment

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER and JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The New York City comptroller has charged that the American mining company Freeport-McMoRan knowingly made ''false or misleading'' statements about payments to the Indonesian military, and has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department to investigate.
 In separate letters to each agency, the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who is the investment adviser to the city's five pension funds, said that he believed the company might have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids American companies to bribe foreign officials.
He also told the securities commission that Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, which is based in New Orleans, might have filed false proxy statements in violation of the Securities Exchange Act. 
 Mr. Thompson said in the letters, dated Thursday, that he was asking for the investigations based on a report by The New York Times in December, which he said showed that Freeport had paid ''large sums of money directly into the personal bank accounts of a number of individual Indonesian Army officers.'' 
 Global Witness, a nonprofit human rights organization, had made similar allegations, Mr. Thompson wrote.
 Mr. Thompson's request came amid several other calls for investigations into Freeport's payments, including from Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who has long been concerned with corruption in the Indonesian military and its poor human rights record.
 Freeport documents obtained by The Times show that from 1998 through 2004 Freeport paid nearly $20 million to individual military and police officers and units in remote Papua Province, where Freeport runs the world's largest gold mine. 
 More than two dozen commanders, most of them from the army and the police, but also from the navy and the air force, received payments, according to the documents. Some officers were given monthly payments. Some amounted to over $100,000 in a year in a country where a general's annual salary is less than $10,000. 
 Freeport says the payments were ''ordinary business activities'' and were within American and Indonesian laws. ''The support and assistance for the military and police in Papua includes mitigating living costs and hardship elements of posting in Papua, better ensuring that legitimate security needs are provided to the company,'' it said in a written response to questions from The Times in December. 
 The New York City pension funds have in the past challenged Freeport's payments. Mr. Thompson wrote that after the funds filed shareholder resolutions in 2004 and 2005 calling for the company to cease the payments, Freeport told the S.E.C. that the payments were made to the Indonesian government as reimbursement for security services.
 In contending the money went to the government and not to individual officers, ''the statements amount to a knowingly misleading representation by Freeport,'' the comptroller said.
 In a telephone interview from New York on Friday, Mr. Thompson said, ''We had filed shareholder resolutions over the last three years, trying to get the company to account for their actions in payments to the military.'' In response, he said, the company ''tried to prevent us from moving forward with our resolutions.'' 
 In his letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Mr. Thompson said the funds were asking the department ''to undertake a formal review to determine if'' Freeport had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
 The funds, one of the largest public pension systems in the United States, own 590,350 shares of Freeport stock -- currently worth $37 million -- and the funds were concerned that ''possible illegal actions by company officials could have a negative impact on shareholder value,'' Mr. Thompson wrote. 
 Asked about the comptroller's letters, Stanley S. Arkin, a lawyer for Freeport, said that the company had nothing to add to what it had already said in its public disclosures. ''Our public findings are what our public findings are,'' he said. ''We do not comment on such things.'' 
 After the December article, the company posted a letter on its Web site saying the article and a subsequent editorial contained ''disturbing and provocative misstatements'' about its operations and that the article had ''ignored the practicalities of conducting business in a remote area.'' 
 The company acknowledged in a conference call with investors two weeks ago that it was under federal scrutiny regarding payments to the military. Executives said they were ''fully cooperating'' with ''informal inquiries from government agencies.''
 In a statement Friday in Washington, Senator Biden said investigations of the company were needed. ''Large payments by Freeport officials directly to individual Indonesian Army officers are highly irregular,'' Mr. Biden said. ''It is time for the Justice Department and the Congress thoroughly to investigate Freeport's business practices in Indonesia.'' 
 Mr. Biden said Freeport's conduct threatened to undermine the efforts of the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is considered a reformer, to clean up the army. 
 In Indonesia, Juwono Sudarsono, the civilian defense minister, told the Dow Jones news service that he had asked the inspector general of the defense forces to look into the payments. It was illegal, he said, under Indonesian law for foreign companies to pay soldiers. 
 A leading Indonesian politician and former presidential candidate, Amien Rais, in speeches and interviews with reporters, has called for Parliament to change Freeport's contract so that the Indonesian government receives what he called a more equal share of the mine's profits. 
 With gold prices recently surging to a 25-year high of more than $550 an ounce, Freeport said that its profits had more than doubled last quarter and that it would pay the Indonesian government some $1 billion in taxes for 2005.
 At the same time, by Freeport's own estimates, its mining operations will generate some six billion tons of waste in Papua before they are through, much of it dumped directly into what was once a pristine river system. Its waste disposal method, the company says, has been approved by provincial authorities.
 ''I saw where they had demolished a mountain forever, and instead left an ugly lake,'' Mr. Rais said in an interview of a visit he made to the mine. ''I felt humiliated as a son of Indonesia.'' 
 In Parliament, members of two separate committees said they would ask Freeport executives to answer questions about the company's payments to the military, its tax payments and the environmental damage around the mine site. 
 A member of the environment committee, Alvin Lie, said his panel would hold hearings in February to look at the environmental consequences of the gold mine on one of the world's most diverse ecosystems. 
 A member of the finance committee, Drajad Wibowo, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from an Australian university and was instrumental in uncovering a major Indonesian banking scandal, said he would ask the Ministry of Finance to explain to the panel Freeport's tax and royalty payments. 
 He suspected, he said, that Freeport was not paying enough taxes. ''When a mining company works in its own country it works under very transparent rules,'' Mr. Drajad said. ''Here it is in secret.''

HEADLINE: Carmaking Bites Bullet; Other Industries Dine Well 

BYLINE: By Mark A. Stein

 BODY:
SUMMING up the state of the broad economy, the nation's biggest manufacturers took radical steps this week to address their accelerating declines while entertainment and energy companies grew bigger, stronger and more profitable.
 Over all, robust corporate profits and receding concern about a political confrontation with Iran helped stocks to recover.

QUANTITY IS JOB 1 -- In a painful but long-anticipated acknowledgment that it has not been making cars many Americans want to buy, Ford said it would close as many as 14 factories and shed 30,000 jobs in North America over the next six years to reduce supply to match falling demand.
Ford said the factories to close included assembly plants in Michigan, Georgia and Missouri. It also plans to shut a transmission plant in Ohio and cut a shift at a plant in Ontario. 
 The company's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., announced the cuts after saying Ford lost $1 billion on North American sales in 2005. Adding in profits from sales abroad and its financing unit, Ford made $2 billion last year.
 As part of its turnaround plan, Ford said it planned to build a factory somewhere in North America to make small cars at a low cost. The company declined to say when or where the plant would be built, or whether it would employ unionized workers.

EXPENSIVE SALES -- The news was not much better at General Motors, which said that it lost $8.6 billion last year, including more than $5 billion on its North American automotive operations.
 The 2005 loss was G.M.'s largest since 1992, and was in contrast to a $2.8 billion profit in 2004. Anticipating a big loss, G.M. said in November that it would shed 30,000 jobs and close 12 factories, a foreshadowing of what was to come from Ford.
 DaimlerChrysler, which eliminated 26,000 jobs in an overhaul of its Chrysler Group several years ago and 8,500 jobs at its Mercedes unit last September, said this week it would shed another 6,000 positions.
 Toyota, by contrast, is expected to report that it made more money in its current fiscal year, which ends in March, than the $11 billion profit of the previous year. 

HAPPY ENDING -- Bringing down the curtain on a very public Hollywood feud, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Pixar Animation Studios for $7.4 billion in stock. Disney and Pixar had cooperated on a string of successful animated movies, including ''Toy Story'' and ''Finding Nemo,'' but fell out over how to split profits.
 Disney's new chief executive, Robert A. Iger, made reconciliation a priority because his company's animation unit has lagged others in computer animation. Pixar, which actually made the recent hits, is one of the most successful computer-animation studios.
 Pixar's chairman and chief executive, Stephen P. Jobs, will be Disney's largest shareholder after the transaction and will get a seat on its board.

COSTLY VICTORY -- After a two-month battle for control of Guidant, a maker of implantable medical devices, Boston Scientific appeared to have beaten its rival, Johnson & Johnson, with a $27.2 billion offer.
 Johnson & Johnson opened the bidding in 2004 by offering to buy Guidant for $25.4 billion, but reduced its bid to $21.5 billion last November after Guidant had to recall defective products. Boston Scientific then stepped in with an unsolicited $25 billion bid to frustrate its much bigger competitor.
 After another round of bidding, Johnson & Johnson threw in the towel.
 Federal regulators have warned Boston Scientific that its quality-control problems could delay the approval of products in the future.

ONE + ONE = ONE -- Having struggled to attract audiences and make profits on their own, the fifth- and sixth-biggest television networks agreed to merge. CBS said it would combine the best programs and strongest affiliates of its UPN network with the most popular programs and most-watched stations tied to the WB network of Warner Brothers studio.
 The new network, to be called CW, plans to offer 30 hours of programming a week to about 95 percent of the country when it begins broadcasting in September.
 Both WB and UPN will continue operating independently until September, when they will be formally shut.

PUMP IT UP -- Oil prices may have eased late last year, but they remained much higher than a year ago and oil company profits remained robust. ConocoPhillips said its fourth-quarter net jumped 50 percent, while Amerada Hess said its net rose 97 percent.
 High profits in the third quarter prompted bipartisan outrage in Congress, which held hearings on whether to impose a windfall tax on oil companies. No legislation has advanced.
 Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest oil company, is scheduled to report its earnings on Monday, Royal Dutch/Shell will do so on Thursday and British Petroleum on Feb. 7.

HEADLINE: HAMAS IS FACING A MONEY CRISIS; AID MAY BE CUT 

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Greg Myre contributed reporting from Gaza for this article, and Steven R. Weisman from Washington.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Hamas leaders, savoring their landslide victory in Palestinian elections, faced an array of threats on Friday: a huge government deficit, a likely cutoff of most aid, international ostracism and the rage of defeated and armed Fatah militants. 
 Of the many questions that the Hamas victory presents, the need to pay basic bills and salaries to Palestinians is perhaps the most pressing. The Palestinian Authority is functionally bankrupt, with a deficit of $69 million for January alone.
That will be an urgent question when the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, known as the quartet, meet in London on Monday to discuss the Palestinian vote, especially if, as some American officials fear, Hamas turns to Iran to make up some of the difference.
 ''They don't have enough to get through the end of the month,'' a knowledgeable Western diplomat said. ''The United States and the European Union both consider Hamas a terrorist organization, and we don't provide money to terrorist organizations or members of terrorist organizations.'' 
 In Washington, President Bush said ''aid packages won't go forward'' for the Palestinian Authority if Hamas did not renounce violence or its commitment to destroy Israel.
 ''That's their decision to make,'' he said on CBS News. ''But we won't be providing help to a government that wants to destroy our ally and friend.''
 Meanwhile, in the southern Gaza town of Khan Yunis, Hamas supporters clashed with Fatah gunmen and the Palestinian security forces in two separate incidents, leaving six people wounded, according to witnesses and medical workers. [Page A9.] 
 In Davos, Switzerland, James D. Wolfensohn, the quartet's envoy to the Middle East, spoke of the Palestinians' financial problems, saying there was not enough money to pay the salaries of 135,000 Palestinian civil servants, including some 58,000 members of the security forces, which he said could lead to further chaos.
 Because Hamas has not yet formed a government, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has asked American help to persuade the Persian Gulf countries to provide more aid now, and to ensure that Israel delivers the $40 million to $50 million owed to the Palestinian Authority from tax and customs receipts, which Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinians.
 Israel has made it clear that it will not deal with a Palestinian Authority run by Hamas and has said some of those who have won election are wanted for suspected involvement in anti-Israel violence. Most of them are in semi-seclusion, and fear arrest if they try to travel to Ramallah, the site of the Palestinian parliament in the West Bank.
 Also in Davos, Joseph Bachar, director general of Israel's Finance Ministry, raised the question of whether Israel would continue to transfer the tax and customs receipts to an authority run by Hamas, which does not recognize the existence of Israel.
 The departing Palestinian economy minister, Mazen Sinokrot, said the 135,000 civil servants were the main breadwinners for 30 percent of Palestinian families. ''If these salaries do not come in, this is a message for violence,'' he said.
 Israeli officials suggested that Ehud Olmert, Israel's acting prime minister, would agree to release this month's money anyway, since a Hamas government has not been formed, but questioned whether Israel would agree to give any money to Hamas in the future. ''We don't want to punish the Palestinian people,'' an official said. ''But we don't have any illusions about Hamas.''
 Mahmoud Zahar, a top Hamas official, said in an interview in Gaza that he was not worried about the lack of money from the West.
 ''All the money from Europe and American went into the pockets of corrupt men,'' Mr. Zahar said, citing Palestinian security chiefs as a leading example. ''The leaders of these services became multimillionaires. We are going to reform these services. This is our mission.'' 
 The current financial crunch has little to do with Hamas. The Palestinian Authority last summer broke its promises to the World Bank and the donor countries and significantly raised salaries to public employees, a number swollen by the effort to absorb armed young men into the security forces. All its $1 billion in revenues is now taken up by salaries, according to the World Bank, leaving an expected budget deficit for 2006 of $600 million to $700 million; only about $320 million of that would have been covered by foreign contributions from the United States, Europe and Arab countries.
 The plan assumed a Fatah victory in the elections and the formation of a new, more technocratic government. Donor countries and the World Bank were working on a restructuring program for the Palestinian Authority that would cover its large financial debt for the next few years in return for serious reforms and job-creation programs.
 But the victory by Hamas has exploded all those assumptions.
 Direct payments from the United States are banned by American law, and many European nations have said they will not continue to aid the Palestinian Authority until Hamas agrees to recognize Israel and disavow violence, which Hamas has said it will never do.
 American and European officials are also banned from talking to Hamas officials, elected or otherwise. Once a group is on the American terrorist list, as Hamas is, it is difficult to get off; it takes more than pledges or statements, a Western diplomat said.
 The development minister for the new German government, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, said Friday that German aid to the Palestinians depended on Hamas's renouncing violence and recognizing Israel.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to make a first official visit to the region next week, and her spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, said Friday: ''The recognition of Israel's right to security and to exist remains an irrevocable cornerstone of German foreign policy.'' Ms. Merkel will meet Mr. Abbas but no Hamas official.
 Hamas candidates and officials have played down the problem, saying they will appeal to the Arab and Muslim world, which already gives large amounts of aid to Hamas and its charitable and educational organizations -- some of which, Israel says, moves seamlessly to finance its military operations.
 Hamas already gets aid from Iran, Israeli and American officials say, and it is possible that Iran may be willing to provide larger sums to the Palestinian Authority. But Israeli and Western diplomats say Hamas, as a Palestinian branch of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood, could also be wary of becoming overly dependent on Shiite Iran.
 Former President Jimmy Carter, who led a team of election observers for the Palestinian voting, said in an interview on Friday that the United States and Europe should redirect their relief aid to United Nations organizations and nongovernmental organizations to skirt legal restrictions.
 ''The donor community can deal with it successfully,'' Mr. Carter said. ''I would hope the world community can collectively tide the Palestinians over.'' He urged support for what he said Mr. Wolfensohn was describing to him as a $500 million appeal.
 ''It may well be that Hamas can change,'' Mr. Carter said, remembering his presidency, when the Palestine Liberation Organization under Yasir Arafat finally agreed to recognize the existence of Israel and to forswear terrorism. ''It's a mistake to abandon optimism completely.''
 He urged Israel and the world: ''Don't drive the Palestinians away from rationality. Don't force them into assuming arms as the only way to achieve their legitimate goals. Give them some encouragement and the benefit of the doubt.''
 But it will be politically difficult to do that. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said he had spoken to the Europeans and Mr. Wolfensohn about the fiscal crunch. ''But the fact of the matter is, you cannot pour millions and hundreds of millions of dollars into a group that, in fact, calls for the destruction of an ally, or for any country, for that matter,'' Mr. Biden said.
 The Western diplomat said: ''We're discussing a lot of complicated questions. But even before the election, the Palestinian Authority's fiscal house was in disarray, with a huge deficit every month.''
 It will be worse still, he said, if the Israelis stop cash transfers and there is a halt in direct aid from the West and the World Bank.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about problems Hamas was facing even as it savored its victory in the Palestinian elections misstated the timing of the agreement by Yasir Arafat, the former Palestinian leader, to recognize the existence of Israel and to forswear terrorism. That development came in 1988, at the end of the Reagan administration, not during the Carter administration.

HEADLINE: Nike Has a New Rival in Developing Markets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, in an effort to raise money and its profile, the Indian national cricket team invited athletic footwear companies to bid on a five-year deal to outfit its 16 players. The announcement drew little attention outside India -- this was not, after all, a competition to dress LeBron James or Kobe Bryant -- but the eight-figure sponsorship bids certainly did.
 Reebok offered $26 million, only to be topped by a $28 million bid from its soon-to-be-sibling Adidas. In turn, Adidas was bested in dramatic fashion by a $44 million check from Nike. The cricket league's vice president, Lalit Modi, said the winning bid made the team the ''world's most valued brand in team sponsorship.''
Not bad for a sport played with wickets. 
 The sneaker wars, once fought on the basketball courts and football fields of the United States, are increasingly being waged on the track fields of China, the volleyball courts of Brazil and the soccer fields of Mexico, long overlooked markets filled with the fan base that footwear companies thrive on. From automobiles to airplanes to pharmaceuticals, more and more companies are moving their marketing machines to fertile developing countries to generate the growth they can no longer rely on in the United States and Europe.
 Nike remains the No. 1 seller of footwear and athletic apparel in the world, but the acquisition of Reebok by Adidas-Salomon, approved this week by Reebok shareholders and the European Union and expected to close next week, could throw up a considerable roadblock to the swoosh across Latin America and Asia.
 Nike's founder, Philip H. Knight, might have had that on his mind this week as he abruptly dismissed his successor as chief executive, William D. Perez. [Page C4.]
 Mr. Knight, in discussing the ouster, said that Nike was operating at 80 percent efficiency under Mr. Perez -- an awkward position to be in when its biggest rivals are ganging up on it. ''I did not see that getting any better,'' Mr. Knight said.
 While the famously competitive Mr. Knight made no mention of his rivals, John Shanley of the Susquehanna Financial Group said, ''There is no way they can overlook a threat this serious.''
 Adidas, the No. 2 footwear company, and Reebok, the No. 3 company, have proved to be nimble competitors. In China, for example, Adidas spent an estimated $80 million to secure the sponsorship of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing while Reebok has sewn up an endorsement, valued at $70 million, from Yao Ming, the Chinese basketball sensation. 
 In Japan, the second-biggest market for sporting goods after the United States, Adidas has just overtaken Nike in sales, a coup that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. 
 To be sure, Nike firmly dominates the athletic footwear business and is unlikely to lose its grip anytime soon. In the United States, where the sneaker market has remained flat for the last decade, it controls 36.3 percent of the market, compared with 21.1 percent for Adidas and Reebok combined, according to Sporting Goods Intelligence, a trade publication. But the gap is far narrower in the faster-growing international market, where Nike controls 30.9 percent of sales, compared with 28 percent for Adidas and Reebok combined. ''In every single region in the world, it is now a two-horse race between Nike and Adidas,'' said Jan Runau, a spokesman for Adidas.
 Analysts and executives agree that the biggest battle will unfold in China, the world's most populous country, where Nike, Reebok and Adidas are scrambling to nail down sponsorships, endorsements and store locations before the Olympics. 
 Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., has sponsored 21 Chinese sports federations and has endorsements from top Chinese athletes, including Lui Xiang and Xing Huina. Both won gold medals during the Summer Games in Athens: Mr. Lui in the 110-meter men's hurdling competition and Ms. Xing in the 10,000-meter women's race.
 It has even built a sprawling outdoor sports center, called Nike Beijing Park, which has soccer fields and basketball courts used by 5,000 children a day. 
 The company does not break out sales by country, but says it has been helped by the growth of a middle class in China that is willing to pay for $250 Limited Edition Zoom LeBron III sneakers; they sold out across the country in just two hours when introduced this year. 
 But Adidas, based in Germany, has also made strong inroads in China. Besides sponsoring the 2008 Olympics, the company has sponsored the country's women's World Cup soccer team, its football federation and its volleyball team.
 During a recent conference call with investors, the chief executive of Adidas, Herbert Hainer, said, ''I am absolutely convinced that Asia and especially China will be the growing force in the next few years'' for both Adidas and Reebok, which is based in Canton, Mass. 
 Nike has had less luck in Japan, a market that apparel and footwear companies covet because trend-setting Japanese consumers are highly influential across Asia. After dominating the footwear business there for years, Nike has begun to falter, missing trends and marketing opportunities, company executives said. Its chief financial officer, Don Blair, called Japan Nike's ''most significant and the most difficult'' market.
 That has opened the door for Adidas, which despite entering Japan only seven years ago now controls its footwear market. While Nike has struggled to excite finicky Japanese consumers, Adidas created a hit this year with the adiZero, a lightweight, thin-soled sneaker designed for Asian consumers. 
 Adidas credits much of its success to the sponsorship of the Japanese national soccer team during the 2002 World Cup competition, which resulted in a 30 percent sales increase. ''Adidas has really stuck it to them'' in Japan, said John G. Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence. 
 Nike has also experienced sluggish growth in France and England, where high unemployment and a weak economy are crimping consumer spending. Nike recently began pulling some products from chains like the footwear retailer Decathlon, saying the chain's tendency to deeply discount sneakers was hurting Nike's image as a premium product.
 ''We are not going to chase bad business,'' said Charlie Denson, president of the Nike brand.
 Nike's challenges in established markets explains, in part, why it is so eager to break into an emerging market like India, where the population tops one billion. Mr. Denson called the company's business in India ''the least developed of the big emerging markets,'' which include Russia, Brazil and China.
 Nike's $44 million bid for the sponsorship of the Indian cricket team -- $16 million higher than the next biggest offer -- ''shows that we obviously felt very strongly about India,'' Mr. Denson said. Cricket, he added, ''is the sport of choice in India and inspires a passion that exceeds everything else by tenfold.'' 
 And so far, it is Reebok, not Nike, that dominates the footwear market in India. Shoes for cricket, as it happens, are a top seller. (The Nike cricket team endorsement will put a swoosh on every player's jersey, but under an existing endorsement deal, six players will slap a Reebok sticker on their wickets. No one company owns the rights to the shoes.)
 The big question is whether Reebok and Adidas can do more than just challenge and even beat Nike in a handful of countries, but perhaps overtake it in global sales. ''The reality is that even together, they lack the clout of Nike,'' said Stephen A. Greyser, a professor who teaches sports marketing at the Harvard Business School.
 Nike executives privately argue, with some hope, that the merger could prove a tough fit, distracting employees at Adidas and Reebok at a time when they are trying to establish themselves in crucial developing markets. Unlike Nike's purchase of Converse, for example -- a relatively small retro fashion label -- the combination of Reebok and Adidas brings together two enormous worldwide brands that compete for the same athletic audience. 
 In an interview, Mr. Perez, the departing Nike chief executive, said Reebok and Adidas represented two very different cultures at corporations based in two different continents. ''This is going to be a tough acquisition for Adidas to pull off,'' he said. ''A lot of people may be underestimating the challenges associated with the merger.''

HEADLINE: Mittal Steel Makes Bid For a Rival

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS; Carter Dougherty contributed reporting from Bochum, Germany, for this article, and James Kanter from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
The biggest steel company in the world wants to get much bigger.
 Mittal Steel, whose founder, Lakshmi Mittal, has never been bashful about his global ambitions, shocked the industry on Friday with an unsolicited $22.8 billion bid for the world's second-biggest steel company, Arcelor.
A combination with Arcelor, itself the product of a merger of French, Spanish and Luxembourg companies in 2002, would create a steel giant with a leading position in the Americas, Europe and Africa and annual revenue of nearly $70 billion. 
 With 320,000 employees, the combined company would have over 100,000 more workers than United States Steel employed at its height. 
 The steel industry has been fragmented into lots of local players, which then became victims when local economies faltered. By creating a global player, Mr. Mittal, ranked the world's third-richest person, behind Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett, hopes to ride out those boom-and-bust cycles.
 ''This is a great opportunity for us to take the steel industry to the next level,'' Mr. Mittal said at a news conference in London. ''Our customers are becoming global; our suppliers are becoming global; everyone is looking for a stronger global player.'' 
 Because steel production continues to be dominated by local businesses, combining the two largest companies would probably not raise the same competition issues that it would in other industries. Together, Mittal and Arcelor would control just 10 percent of the total market, meaning that they would probably not have an immediate effect on global steel prices. Still, a combined company could become a stronger negotiator with raw materials suppliers and with customers.
 Arcelor's management did not share in Mr. Mittal's excitement. Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, said Friday that the deal had a ''hostile character.'' Its board members met in the afternoon to decide whether to try to counteract it, but did not issue a statement afterward. 
 With its bid of 18.6 billion euros, Mittal is offering Arcelor shareholders cash and stock worth 28.21 euros a share, a 27 percent premium over the company's closing price of 22.22 euros on the Euronext exchange in Paris on Thursday. 
 Arcelor's options are limited: Mittal's offer is contingent on receiving just 50 percent of Arcelor's shares, and Arcelor's shareholders are mainly institutions that are likely to have few qualms about swapping one share for the next, analysts said. 
 There is not another steel company large enough to make an obvious ''white knight,'' though Arcelor may try to do a deal of its own, which would make it too large to be swallowed by Mittal. 
 The markets reacted favorably to the offer. Arcelor's shares traded up 28.44 percent, to close at 28.54 euros on Friday on the Euronext exchange, as investors bet that the deal would go through and that Mittal Steel would be forced to raise its price. Shares of Mittal, with headquarters in Rotterdam and London, also rose on Friday in New York, closing at $34.26, up $1.96, or 6 percent. 
 If the deal does go through, Mittal Steel would sell Dofasco, a Canadian steelmaker that Arcelor recently agreed to buy, to ThyssenKrupp of Germany. Dofasco had been the target of a hotly contested bidding war between Arcelor and ThyssenKrupp, which Thyssen recently exited. 
 Mittal Steel estimated that it could achieve $1 billion in savings if it acquired Arcelor after cutting overlapping administrative and manufacturing units. Together, the companies would produce 115 million tons of steel a year, dwarfing their nearest competitor, Nippon Steel of Japan, which produces just over 30 million tons a year. 
 Mittal is offering four Mittal shares and 35.25 euros in cash for every five Arcelor shares, or about one-quarter of the price in cash. 
 Analysts and investors said the company would probably be forced to raise its price to win Arcelor, but might not be able to raise that much more money. Mittal is using a 5 billion euro bank loan from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to finance the deal, and will have $14 billion in debt if the deal goes through. 
 Ratings agencies warned on Friday that Mittal's ratings could be cut if it paid too much. Mittal is highly rated for the steel industry, said Fitch Ratings in a note, but ''there are numerous risks surrounding the acquisition plans, including the high likelihood the price will need to be raised.''
 Getting the deal done is a ''question of how much Mittal wants to push it,'' said Matt Watkins, an analyst with CRU Group, an independent research firm in London. 
 Mr. Mittal told journalists that he had tried at first to do a friendly deal, approaching Arcelor's chief executive, Guy Dolle, on Jan. 13 about the prospect, but was rebuffed. Mr. Dolle ''saw difficulties'' with the plan, Mr. Mittal said. Mr. Dolle canceled their next meeting, because he had won the Dofasco bid, and then did not return another call, Mr. Mittal said. 
 Still, Mr. Mittal and his son, Aditya Mittal, who is the company's chief financial officer, both said at the news conference that they would like Arcelor's management to become part of the new organization. The two executives also said that they would honor all of Arcelor's existing agreements with its subsidiaries and staff, and that there would be no plant closings. 
 If the deal goes through, the Mittal family would own 51 percent of Mittal Steel, down from 88 percent. 
 Other Mittal investors said they welcomed the deal. ''I'm very much in support of it,'' said the American financier Wilbur Ross, who sold his International Steel Group to Mittal Steel last year, and is now a shareholder and member of the board. ''The industrial logic of the deal is impeccable.'' 
 ThyssenKrupp's chief executive, Ekkehard Schulz, told surprised shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Bochum, Germany, that Mittal had agreed to sell Dofasco to it after all, if the merger goes through.
 Mr. Schulz said that after the announcement on Tuesday that Arcelor had won the Dofasco bid, Mr. Mittal called him to offer Dofasco for 68 Canadian dollars a share, provided Mittal takes control of Arcelor. The winning bid by Arcelor was 71 Canadian dollars. 
 Mr. Schulz said the deal would allow ThyssenKrupp to take ''this strategically meaningful step in an economically sensible framework.''
 Some French officials expressed some concern about Mittal's bid for Arcelor, in part because they said they received the news on Friday morning, with no prior warning. Arcelor employs many French workers and has deep roots in France.

HEADLINE: The Fed Speaks

BYLINE: By Steven Rattner. 
Steven Rattner is managing principal at the Quadrangle Group, a private investment firm.

 BODY:
BEN S. BERNANKE picks up the chairman's baton at the Federal Reserve next week to face an unusual paradox: thanks to the model stewardship of his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, monetary policy -- the heart of the Fed's activities -- is marching along in good order, while the rest of economic policy mostly begs for reshaping. Mediocre and inadequate policies outside the Fed's purview have resulted in huge budget and trade deficits, a nonexistent energy strategy, spiraling federal spending, looming pension and Medicare shortfalls, and a tax structure that has contributed to the greatest income inequality in the last half-century.
 More so than many past Fed chairmen, Mr. Greenspan opined on such matters and for much of his tenure, his impact outside of the Fed's pastures was pronounced: President Clinton's budget package, banking deregulation and the financial crises in Mexico and Asia were all managed with a strong helping hand from Mr. Greenspan. But since the arrival of the Bush administration in 2001, Mr. Greenspan has sometimes been less sensible (most notably, in his tortured backing of the Bush tax cuts) while his constructive thoughts have been largely ignored. 
Fed watchers sometimes grumble that Mr. Greenspan should have stuck to interest rates. Mr. Bernanke himself intimated in his confirmation hearings that he was likely to say less about non-monetary matters. That would be unfortunate. 
 The Fed chairman is the most important economic policymaker on the planet. Mr. Bernanke's credibility is further heightened by his impeccable academic credentials, previous service at the Federal Reserve and reputation for speaking directly. His unanimous recommendation from the Senate Banking Committee underscores the political capital and goodwill with which he arrives.
 Mr. Bernanke should use his influence. But to make the most of it, he must first show he can sustain Mr. Greenspan's extraordinary record on monetary matters. To that end, he should re-examine his pet philosophy of centering monetary policy on an inflation target.
 Mr. Greenspan has spoken out against this narrow approach, a cousin of the old method of setting a target for the size of the money supply (remember M-1?) that he abandoned in favor of basing interest rate decisions on a vast stew of variables, all analyzed in a quest for balance between steady growth and low inflation.
 Inflation targeting, which has been used with seeming success in Britain and several other prospering countries, may be a fine idea. But with job and productivity growth in the United States high and inflation low, why do we need to start experimenting?
 Even as Mr. Bernanke shows that he can manage monetary policy, he should begin to speak out on other issues, aiming particularly for those that bear on the Fed's effectiveness, like deficit control.
 Wise Fed chairmen, of course, never comment on interest rates and other sensitive matters. Nor do they issue streams of economic prognoses that are not much more likely to be accurate than those of other well-trained economists. 
 But warning about economic dangers should be fair game, particularly when using Fed policies would not be appropriate, as has been the case with recent asset bubbles -- high-flying stocks back in 2000; housing prices today. Mr. Bernanke should reemphasize the deficit's impact on interest rates and stress that its meaningful reduction requires both curbing spending and raising revenue through taxes or other means. In these matters, Mr. Bernanke's clear speaking can be put to good use.
 Greater transparency about the Fed's own actions would also increase Mr. Bernanke's credibility and influence. For starters, the Fed should release the economic forecasts prepared for meetings of its interest rate-setting body (a release that Mr. Bernanke has indicated he favors), clearly explain its interest rate decisions and provide more timely and illuminating summaries of its deliberations. 
 Because he lacks Mr. Greenspan's considerable political experience, Mr. Bernanke may seem at a disadvantage if he ventures beyond interest rates. But we are sorely in need of economic wisdom, and perhaps Americans (and the politicians who represent them) are ready to heed a fresh voice.

HEADLINE: The Power of Words

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
HOW best to describe the condition of the New York City real estate market? Is it ''cooling'' or ''melting down?'' Will there be a ''pause?'' A ''soft landing?'' A ''slow leak?'' Are you a ''bubble'' believer or of the ''frothy'' faith? 
 These and other buzzwords have been appearing in articles and rolling off the tongues of broadcasters. They are whirring around New York cocktail parties and being whispered in Wall Street elevators. It is the language of real estate. And real estate, as Pamela Liebman, chief executive and president of the Corcoran Group, put it, is ''part of the language of New York.''
It is a language at once glamorous and mundane, one that encompasses not only market catchphrases but scores of seductive adjectives that brokers use to describe properties. Yet as intangible as words are, they influence the decisions buyers, sellers and lenders make -- and those decisions can affect the market. As Jean-Paul Sartre said, ''Words are loaded pistols.'' A look at the most popular ones being bandied about nowadays may not reveal the future, but they reveal the pulse of the public. Its beat is a mix of fear, confusion and wishful thinking. 
 The yearning for a smooth transition from the surging market is seen in the increasingly frequent use in the last six months of the phrase ''soft landing.'' 
 ''Soft landing is everyone's big hope,'' said Paul JJ Payack, president of the Global Language Monitor (languagemonitor.com), which analyzes language trends and their impact on politics, culture and business. 
 Mr. Payack, who graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in comparative literature, calculated the popularity of some 36 buzzwords chosen by a reporter. He used his Predictive Quantities Indicator, or P.Q.I., an algorithm that tracks words and phrases in the media and on the Internet in relation to frequency, contextual usage and appearance in global media. It is a weighted index that takes into account year-to-year increases and acceleration in the last several months. 
 Among the market buzzwords he ranked, ''soft landing'' and ''pause'' had the highest P.Q.I.'s. They were ranked first and second respectively, while the more ominous sounding ''housing bubble'' ranked seventh. '' 'Pause' is another one of these hopeful things,'' Mr. Payack said. 
 (Mr. Payack can also verify that ''O.K.'' is the most frequently spoken word, that ''outside the mainstream'' was the top phrase of 2005 and that as of Jan. 26 at 10:59 a.m. Eastern time, the number of words in the English language was 986,120.)
 While Mr. Payack analyzed buzzwords used across the nation, the words are especially prevalent in New York, where residents routinely say that real estate is a topic second only to sex. And where there is extreme interest, there tends to be extreme language. 
 Historically, the New York City real estate market has been characterized by boom-or-bust buzzwords. ''If there isn't an exclamation point on a description then it's somehow incomplete,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. 
 That is in part because extremes make for juicer news stories, added Robin Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, in an e-mail message. ''A topic that in some sense is always around has to be goosed up a bit to make it exciting,'' she wrote, ''and hyperbole is one means toward that end.''
 While sexy and quotable, catchphrases can be misleading. ''A new language has entered the fray that is not entirely accurate,'' Mr. Miller said. For example, he said, most people think a ''cooling'' market means that prices are falling, when it is only the rate of appreciation that is declining. Another misconception concerns the word ''dumped,'' as in ''he was forced to dump his apartment.'' 
 ''The perception is the market is falling,'' Mr. Miller said, when ''in reality the apartment was worth more than it was a year ago. It was simply the list price outpaced the market.'' As for ''soft landing,'' Mr. Miller said it connotes downward motion (''because all I can think of is a plane landing'') when really ''what they mean is that we've gone up and reached a plateau as opposed to coming down the mountain,'' he said.
 It is because of such confusion and lack of nuance that Henry O. Pollakowski, the editor of the Journal of Housing Economics and the director of the Housing Affordability Initiative at the M.I.T. Center for Real Estate in Cambridge, Mass., does not use buzzwords. ''It gets out in very black and white measures,'' he said. '' 'Things are more affordable.' 'Things are less affordable.' And I'm like, 'Where and what are you talking about -- and for whom?' '' 
 Housing markets are local and how people talk about real estate depends on how they relate to it, he said, ''whether you're already an owner or whether you are trying to buy something or trying to buy something bigger or trying to rent. It's different for everybody.''
 A Google ranking of people's top five ''worries'' in October included ''housing bubble,'' along with ''bird flu,'' ''earthquake'' and hurricanes Wilma and Katrina. 
 ''No one really has a great sense of what's going on and that has added another layer of anxiety,'' Mr. Miller said. But he added that ''in all fairness I think it's much harder to articulate what's happening with the market right now.''
 ''There's no great catchphrase,'' he said. 
 But if there were, what might it be? Mr. Miller suggested ''normalized.'' Jeffrey Levine, the president of Douglaston Development in Queens, said it is misleading to refer to the current market as cooling or slowing because, until recently, the market was ''on steroids.''
 ''We are back to a healthy, reality-based market,'' he said. Ms. Liebman of Corcoran also calls the market ''healthy'' yet ''more challenging'' for brokers and sellers. She uses the word ''shift'' to describe the rebalance of power from sellers to buyers and ''disconnect'' to explain how sellers are still pricing as if it were the spring of 2005. 
 ''Disconnect,'' Ms. Liebman said, is ''a nice way to say some sellers are crazy because buyers are not paying.'' 
 In a press release this month, the National Association of Realtors wrote that ''the key word for the housing market in 2006 is balance.''
 Brokers are loath to use hyperbolic language to describe the market partly because they think the market is cyclical and partly because it is in their best interest to bulldoze fear. Steve Solomon, an executive vice president of the public relations firm Rubenstein Associates and head of its real estate group, said that ''professionals use words to soothe and to give hope and positive feelings about properties so there isn't as much anxiety.'' 
 So they engage in verbal firefighting. ''If prices are going down, we don't like to say that,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''It's 'prices are leveling off,' 'there's a pause in the market.' '' 
 These days, brokers frequently find themselves massaging market buzzwords, or the ''macro'' language of real estate, to make it more palatable. At the same time they are also busily tweaking the ''micro'' language of real estate -- the language used to describe properties -- to make it more alluring and meaningful. Some words are being phased out. Others are being used in fresh ways. As a result, a new micro lexicon is emerging, one that borrows from the art and fashion worlds and in which nearly every word implies affluence, exclusivity and limitlessness.
 The reigning buzzword of the micro language today is ''lifestyle.'' Ms. Liebman of Corcoran called it the biggest change in language in the last few years. ''We're not selling apartments,'' she said, ''we're selling a lifestyle.'' The word has tripled in usage since December 2004, Mr. Payack wrote in an e-mail message. 
 And where ''lifestyle'' is uttered, ''amenities,'' ''name architect'' and ''spa-bath'' tend to follow. The word ''designer,'' as in ''designer kitchen,'' is no longer a sufficient indicator of status. ''Everything's a designer kitchen now,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''You'd better say what designer.'' 
 The same is true of gyms. ''It's not just a gym,'' she said. ''It's a La Palestra gym.'' 
 Louise Sunshine, chairwoman emeritus of the Sunshine Group, takes the notion one step further. ''Fashion and art have definitely influenced my vocabulary in describing real estate today,'' she said, adding that it is a phenomenon that began three years ago. She calls the apartments by the architect Peter Marino at 170 East End Avenue ''Couture Homes,'' while the apartments at Cipriani Club Residences are ''pret-a-porter'' because they come ''ready to wear'' with linens, toasters, even toothbrushes.
 Laurie Zucker, a developer at the Manhattan Skyline Management Corporation, said the desire for tony apartments and amenities has been on the rise since Sept. 11, 2001. An essential component of such opulence is expansiveness. The phrase ''great room'' (used to describe a living room that is open to the kitchen as it would be in a suburban home) has been growing in popularity, Ms. Zucker said. 
 Janice Silver, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Bellmarc Realty, said ''oversized'' is showing up everywhere, from ''oversized bathtub'' to ''oversized closet.'' 
 The word is on ''everyone's lips,'' Mr. Payack said in his e-mail, and has more than 1.5 million real estate references to it in the media and on the Internet.
 Mr. Solomon of Rubenstein is fond of ''renaissance'' (''I try to stick that in whenever possible,'' he said) and ''resurgence'' (''People like to live in places that are on the upswing''). Another trend is using words that convey authenticity to express the mere feeling of authenticity. Take the word ''landmark.'' Mr. Solomon said it is now used both literally (as an official city designation) and figuratively (as in something that feels like a landmark even though it is not). Mr. Payack confirmed the trend, writing in an e-mail message that the use of the word is ''rising sharply.'' The same thing is occurring with the word ''historic,'' Mr. Solomon added. 
 Then there are words that were in vogue a few years ago, like ''cozy,'' but which have since been put out to pasture. ''Everyone knew it meant small,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''They figured it out.'' She now predicts the death of the word ''luxury,'' because it is overused. 
 So is ''spacious,'' according to Mr. Solomon. ''Now we've elevated it to 'grand,' '' he said, adding that 'spacious' was not special enough. ''Everyone had spacious apartments,'' he said. ''Grand has that ambience to it. It implies high ceilings and airy views.'' It has even become part of building names, Mr. Solomon said, like 225 Fifth Avenue, which was dubbed ''the Grand Madison,'' when it went on the market last year. Mr. Payack said ''grand'' has doubled in use around the country, while ''spacious'' is down 30 percent since December 2004.
 A decade ago newspapers and magazines were publishing articles about the rampant hyperbole in real estate listings, the vague adjectives (''fabulous''), cliches (''sun-drenched'') and euphemisms (''fixer upper''). The exaggeration was so widespread, complaining about real estate cliches became, well, cliche. 
 But puffery was reined in to some extent as brokers tried to win the trust and business of prospective clients in a highly competitive market. These days savvy buyers will not go to see a property unless the listing is sufficiently descriptive and has images online. 
 Indeed, the Internet has revolutionized the way properties are marketed, enabling buyers not only to view photographs but to take virtual tours. Yet photographs can be embellished, too. ''People are trying to enhance their photos,'' said Ms. Silver of Bellmarc. ''Now we have professional photographers and professional stagers and people who come in for lighting.'' 
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yet at the end of the day the building must ''live up to the words,'' Mr. Solomon said. Whether the market will do the same remains to be seen. For some, words are but white noise. ''People will always want to live in New York,'' Ms. Zucker said. ''It all averages out in the end.'' 
 Still, if you feel the market is too frothy for comfort, you can always retreat into your grand apartment, climb into your spa-bath and wait for a resurgence.

On Everyone's Lips
 What follows are some of the words used most frequently to describe the current market. They are listed according to a Predictive Quantities Indicator, or P.Q.I. ranking, developed by Paul JJ Payack, the president of the Global Language Monitor (languagemonitor.com), which analyzes language trends.

HEADLINE: When Service Cuts Lead to Rent Cuts

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
DISPUTES between landlords and tenants often arise when the landlord stops providing a service that a rent-regulated tenant has grown accustomed to. 
 Rent laws allow the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal to order a rent reduction when a landlord eliminates a ''required'' or ''essential'' service. But what is a required or essential service, and is there any difference between them?
Mary Ann Hallenborg, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that the term ''required services'' is used in the context of a rent-stabilized tenancy and the term ''essential services'' is used for rent-controlled tenants. 
 More important than the significance of the service itself, however, is when the service was first provided.
 In that context, Ms. Hallenborg said, a ''base date'' essential or required service is any service that was being provided at the time the apartment became subject to regulation or that was added thereafter and included in the rent.
 But how does a tenant determine his or her base-date services?
 ''Buildingwide services should be listed on a Initial Building Services Registration form posted in the lobby,'' she said.
 ''And an individual apartment's initial base date services should be spelled out on the Initial Apartment Registration Statement.'' 
 That document, Ms. Hallenborg said, can be obtained by filling out the housing division's Request for Access to Public Records and sending it to the agency. (The form is online at www.dhcr.state.ny.us. Click on ''Rent Administration'' and then ''Forms.'') 
 Ms. Hallenborg noted that while the initial registration forms will probably not include services added after the forms were filed, the basic rule is that any service a regulated tenant had at the inception of the tenancy -- or any provided thereafter and included in the rent -- is considered a base-date service.
 Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents landlords, said that if a landlord wants to modify, diminish or eliminate a base-date service, he must apply to the housing division for permission. 
 In some cases, the agency will grant permission without requiring a reduction in rent if the landlord can show that the service being eliminated will be compensated for in other ways. For example, changing a rarely used community party room into a fitness room has been allowed without a rent reduction.
 In other cases, however, when a base-date service is eliminated, the agency will order a rent reduction. 
 If a landlord fails to get permission to eliminate a base-date service, Mr. Belkin said, and a tenant complains, the agency can order a rent reduction and direct the landlord to restore the service. ''Generally, the reduction remains in place until a service is restored,'' Mr. Belkin said. 
 ''If he fails to restore the service, the D.H.C.R. may start imposing ever-increasing fines.'' 
 Mr. Belkin noted that there are a number of services that have been determined to be ''de minimis.'' For example, he said, replacing door-to-door distribution of mail with a central mailroom or removing sinks from laundry rooms will not result in a rent reduction.
 A list of de minimis services can be found on the agency's Web site. (Click on ''Rent Administration'' and navigate to ''Fact Sheet 37.'') 
 A tenant who wants to file a complaint seeking a rent reduction because of a reduction in services in an individual apartment should search the Web site for D.H.C.R. Form RA-81. For a complaint about a buildingwide reduction in services, use D.H.C.R. Form RA-84.
 Information and forms can also be obtained by calling the agency's Rent Info line; the telephone number is (718) 739-6400.

HEADLINE: On the Trail of Brownstones in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JEFF VANDAM

 BODY:
AS real estate scavengers have discovered in recent years, the brownstones of Brooklyn do not end with what is traditionally known as Brownstone Brooklyn. They have begun to look beyond the pricey borders of Carroll Gardens and Park Slope for stately 19th-century architecture, and they have found it and more in Sunset Park, a neighborhood where $1 million for such houses is more likely to be a price ceiling, not a floor. 
 Stretching south of Park Slope down to Bay Ridge, the neighborhood represents a diverse land of plenty. More and more people are moving from within the borough, and from Manhattan, into Sunset Park's rows of brick, limestone and brownstone houses that descend toward New York Harbor.
''We got a much bigger space for not much more than we sold our condo for in Park Slope,'' said Joe Reister, an academic adviser who bought a three-story brownstone on 45th Street with his wife, Shannon Laughlin, a year and a half ago. ''We did some work -- don't get me wrong,'' he said. ''But the outside looks like something out of Sesame Street.'' 
 The house cost $600,000, has a backyard and is a three-minute walk to the subway. And as the couple expect their first child very soon, the families they see everywhere give them confidence in the area. ''I see the neighborhood going nowhere but up,'' Mr. Reister said. ''And I'm comfortable in my neighborhood.''
 Mayra Ortiz, a broker at the Corcoran Group who has lived in Sunset Park for more than 20 years, said the change in the neighborhood since her arrival there has been drastic. ''I've seen it turn around, let me tell you,'' she said. ''It was a neighborhood that was very depressed -- it wasn't safe. But it's really changed so much, and there are people of a lot of different backgrounds moving in.''
 As construction of a large waterfront park on Piers 1 through 5 of the Bush Terminal is scheduled to begin this year and include recreational fields, bike paths and a scenic overlook, confidence in Sunset Park is higher than ever. And it is certainly welcoming -- groups of residents from China, Mexico, India and elsewhere have arrived, mixing a deep cultural soup.
 ''Our whole community is growing by the day,'' said Jeremy Laufer, district manager for Brooklyn's Community Board 7.

What You'll Find
 Estimates of Sunset Park's northern boundary can differ from resident to resident, with some people suggesting that South Park Slope extends beyond the Prospect Expressway. But there is no denying that the centerpiece of the neighborhood is Sunset Park, a 24.5-acre bluff of land with perhaps the widest views in Brooklyn. 
 The park is surrounded by attractive pale-brick row houses, and the streets nearby, especially in the middle 40's between Fourth and Sixth Avenues, offer intact lines of early-20th- and late-19th-century housing stock. 
 ''We're a block away from the park,'' said Elizabeth Norman, who bought a two-family limestone on 45th Street with her partner, Jane McAndrew, in April 2005 for $640,000. Ms. Norman, who works in city government, walks their dogs, Theo and Xerxes, up and down Fifth Avenue's shopping strip and feels more secure than she expected in an area in flux.
 ''Because it's very working class, there are always people out,'' she said. ''I've been surprised at how safe it is.''
 Sunset Park also includes the houses squeezed in between Green-Wood Cemetery and the Gowanus Expressway, known as Greenwood Heights. Forming a sort of residential panhandle, many houses there are clad in colorful if faded siding and are mixed in with commercial enterprises. Occasionally, lines of classic two-story row houses in tan brick can be found on such streets as 30th and 37th. 
 Elsewhere in the neighborhood, much of the housing east of Sixth and Seventh Avenues appears to have been built in the first half of the last century. Though most people consider the eastern boundary of the neighborhood to be Eighth Avenue, some locals insist that it stretches to Ninth, with a similar crop of turn-of-the-last-century houses. 
 Third Avenue, which runs below the noisy Gowanus Expressway, represents a residential cutoff of sorts -- it is lined with pornographic DVD stores and auto body shops, and on side streets to the west, commercial enterprises dominate.

What You'll Pay
 If buyers are looking for homes under $1 million, ''the answer is yes for a three-story house,'' said Tim Betancourt, co-owner of Park Slope's Betancourt & Associates Realty. ''If you're talking about four stories, it depends on the location.''
 In general, while some houses can still be found on the market in the $600,000 range, many now exceed that and the average falls more in the upper $700,000's and $800,000's. Well-preserved two- and three-family houses are in the $900,000's. 
 ''There's still quite a lot of demand,'' said Anita Luo, an agent at Fillmore Real Estate who specializes in sales east of Sixth Avenue. ''We still have people doing quick deals.''
 Two years ago, the first house Ms. Ortiz of Corcoran sold in the neighborhood closed for $470,000. The next house, a few months later, went for $500,000, and the next two were $640,000 and $650,000, respectively. Now the houses she has on the market are mostly in the $800,000 range and up. ''The sales prices have increased dramatically,'' she said. 
 In the Greenwood Heights area, sales are similarly strong, with most houses selling in the $850,000 to $950,000 range, according to Mr. Betancourt. ''They can be up to $1.1 million, depending on the quality of the house and the renovation,'' he said. His firm sold a renovated two-family frame house on 19th Street in September for $785,000.
 Monthly rents are reasonable, though those prices, too, have jumped up a bit as more newcomers arrive. One-bedrooms can still be found for around $1,000, and two-bedrooms generally start at $1,400.

What to Do
 Sunset Park has two thriving shopping strips -- one a vast Asian market, the other a Latin American smorgasbord. 
 Eighth Avenue is a heavily trafficked bazaar of noodle houses, fishmongers, fruit stands and butchers. Shoppers walk about hauling bright orange and yellow bags of produce as vendors of Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches sell their wares. On Fifth Avenue, the food extravaganza continues in the form of gorditas, tamales, tortas and tacos on practically every block. There are also a few grocery stores and the highly popular Costco wholesale market on Third Avenue.
 For recreation, there is always Sunset Park itself, with its views, its large playground, plenty of ball courts and a large pool. 
 For shopping that does not involve food, Ms. Norman and Ms. McAndrew often take a bus to Park Slope or Bay Ridge, both short rides away. 

The Schools
 Sunset Park does not have a high school, though the community has tried to establish one several times, according to Mr. Laufer of Community Board 7. The nearest alternative is the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology in Bay Ridge, beyond Sunset Park's southernmost border. There, average SAT scores on verbal and mathematics portions are 446 and 470, respectively, compared with statewide averages of 497 and 511. 
 There are seven elementary schools in the neighborhood, including the Magnet School for Leadership in the 21st Century, in Public School 172, at 825 Fourth Avenue. There, percentages of students meeting standards in English Language Arts and mathematics are 71 and 82.4 percent, respectively, versus city averages of 48.1 and 55 percent. The school gives priority to applications from students within its zone, and also takes students from outside.
 Few other schools in the area beat these test averages. Middle School 136, or Sunset Park Prep, is Sunset Park's middle school, where 40 percent of students in English Language Arts and 68.8 percent in math meet city and state standards, compared with 35.5 and 38.9 percent citywide. There is a parochial school, St. Agatha's School, which runs from prekindergarten through Grade 8, at 736 48th Street.

The History
 Sunset Park has always been home to immigrants. Development began in the mid-19th century, when Irish settlers began to arrive, to be followed a few decades later by Poles, Italians and Scandinavians. So many of the latter group moved in that there were areas known as Finntown and Little Norway. 
 Many residents worked on waterfront docks and nearby factories, bolstered by the construction of Bush Terminal in 1890. The Gowanus Expressway, completed in 1941, coupled with the Great Depression, helped push the neighborhood into economic decline, and soon homes were abandoned, only to be repopulated from the 1960's to present day by immigrants from nearly everywhere.

The Commute
 The neighborhood has two express subway stations: 36th Street, served by the D, M, N and R lines, and 59th Street, served by the N and R. According to New York City Transit, the rush-hour commute on the D to 34th Street in Manhattan from 36th Street takes 25 minutes; from 59th Street on the N to 57th Street in Manhattan, 36 minutes. The New York Water Taxi stops during rush hours at the Brooklyn Army Terminal, at 58th Street on the waterfront; a one-way trip is $6 and takes 15 minutes to Pier 11 at Wall Street. 

What We Like
 It is lovely to laze on Sunset Park's gently sloped lawn, taking in views of Manhattan, downtown Brooklyn, the Statue of Liberty and the water-tower-topped warehouses of Sunset Park itself.

What We'd Change
 Parking is occasionally scarce, some residents say, unless they opt for spaces on Third Avenue, where rough-and-tumble businesses and street corners can be imposing.

HEADLINE: Trade Ministers See Improved Atmosphere

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Trade ministers meeting here said yesterday that they detected a new willingness to work out the stubborn differences over reducing trade barriers in agricultural and industrial goods that have complicated negotiations for a global trade agreement. 
 The meetings, held on the sidelines of an elite business conference in this Alpine resort, did not yield any breakthroughs. But they improved the tenor of continuing talks toward a global agreement, which had deteriorated into sniping after the World Trade Organization's conference in Hong Kong last month.
''They all realize they have to stop digging their tactical, defensive holes,'' Pascal Lamy, the trade organization's director-general, said during a briefing after the session. ''It's a change in mind-set.''
 The European Union's trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, who had expressed pessimism about the likelihood of a deal earlier in the week, said there was now ''better mood music.''
 The ministers issued a four-page timetable of steps needed to complete the trade pact. The next deadline is April 30, for a pledge to agree on tariff reductions.
 The ministers must sign off on a full agreement by the end of the year to meet a schedule that enable President Bush to obtain rapid Congressional approval under ''fast-track'' authority that expires in mid-2007.
 Trade representatives from the United States, Europe, Brazil, and other countries met in one-on-one sessions to begin negotiating concessions. At a panel discussion afterward, they said they would make formal proposals together, rather than wait for one another to make the first move.
 ''You see people coming together'' behind the idea of concerted action, said the United States trade representative, Rob Portman. ''If the Doha round fails, we all have something to lose.''
 The current round of talks, which began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001, has progressed fitfully. In Hong Kong, ministers from 149 nations and customs territories agreed to eliminate subsidies of agricultural exports by 2013. But they deferred the politically fraught issue of tariffs.
 Hopes for even modest progress at this informal meeting seemed slim two days ago. Europe was at loggerheads with the United States and Brazil over demands that it lower tariffs on farm products. Mr. Portman said Washington viewed such concessions as crucial to any deal.
 While the ministers were uniformly more optimistic, there were signs that the goodwill could be short-lived. Toward the end of the panel discussion, Mr. Mandelson said Mr. Portman was fixated on agriculture, which, he said, accounts for only 3 percent of world trade.
 Later, Mr. Mandelson and the Brazilian foreign minister, Celso Amorim, clashed over agricultural tariffs. Mr. Amorim likened them to nuclear weapons, while Mr. Mandelson argued that removing them would hurt the poorest developing countries, because their farmers would not be competitive enough.

 By John C. Bogle. 
 260 pp. Yale University Press. $25.
If anyone still harbors the fantasy that the business scandals of the past few years were the handiwork of just a few bad apples, they should read John C. Bogle's ''Battle for the Soul of Capitalism.'' 
 Bogle has been a Wall Street insider for 50 years, the founder and long the chief executive of Vanguard in Philadelphia, one of the three or four largest mutual fund management groups in the nation. At Vanguard, he refused to charge the high annual fees that his competitors did. He was also among the first to offer investors index funds, at a time when most mutual fund managers were still claiming they could easily beat the market averages. (Index funds essentially duplicate the market averages, and have typically outperformed most of the pros over time.) 
 In this book, Bogle abhors what he sees as rampant cheating among his peers -- not only mutual fund managers but brokers, bankers, lawyers and accountants. It's not just a few bad apples, he says: ''I believe that the barrel itself -- the very structure that holds all those apples -- is bad.'' 
 Consider Jack Grubman. He may have been the best paid of the analysts who made fortunes partly if not largely based on conflicts of interest. But he was not alone. 
 Grubman earned $20 million in a single year in part by urging brokerage customers to buy the stocks of the corporations that his parent company, Citigroup, had as investment banking clients. When Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York State charged a wide swath of investment banks with similar conflicts of interest, however, 8 of the 10 largest companies on Wall Street decided they had better settle the suit. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, among others, gave back profits and paid penalties of $1.4 billion, and altered the inherent conflicts in their managerial policies as well. 
 Nor was it only a handful of notorious companies like Enron and WorldCom that, under the tutelage of the most prestigious lawyers, bankers and accountants in the business, overstated their profits. Bogle totes up about 60 major corporations that had to restate their earnings -- and this was not an inclusive list. Their stock market value equaled $3 trillion. That is ''an enormous part of the giant barrel of corporate capitalism,'' he writes. 
 Or take the mutual fund industry, which Bogle knows best and which angers him most. Leaders boasted how clean they were compared with their colleagues at the investment banks and brokerage firms. But the relentless Spitzer found that dozens of them were rewarding good customers with secret and highly lucrative trading favors. As for executive stock options, which tied compensation to the company's stock price and made so many businessmen extraordinarily rich, they encouraged managers to manipulate short-term earnings to prop up stock prices. 
 Many people are still reluctant to concede that abuse was so widespread, since what they fear most is an assault by government in the form of tougher regulations. Unsurprisingly, loud complaints are now being lodged by influential lobbyists in Washington about the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the only serious measure passed in the wake of the scandals to control business excess. And the tough-minded chairman of the Securites and Exchange Commission, William Donaldson, recently stepped down in the face of opposition from the White House and business interests. 
 Unfortunately, Bogle is less good at telling us how to fix the problems than he is at telling us what went wrong. He wants to believe that if we put the owners -- that is, the shareholders -- back in charge, most of the fraud, deceit and greed would dissipate like the morning mist. 
 Genuine shareholder democracy, he argues, would require chief executives to worry about the long-term health of the company, not the short-term fluctuations of stock prices. They would be far less tempted to manipulate earnings. In particular, if shareholders had appropriate voting power, the abuses associated with executive stock options could be reduced. Because shareholders do not have adequate voting rights, Bogle says, reform continues to be stymied. 
 But are shareholders inherently more ethical than corporate managers? Did they complain about ''short-termism'' when stock prices were at their heights in the late 1990's, or only after their stunning fall? Wouldn't they tolerate a little manipulation for a higher stock price? 
 It seems as if Bogle prefers to avoid the more obvious issue: that government looked the other way. Bogle acknowledges this lack of effective regulation, but he considers it a side issue. 
 The fact is that Washington has relaxed financial regulations under both Democratic and Republican administrations, opening the doors to conflicts of interest between brokers and investment bankers. In 1998, government, despite concerns, refused to separate consulting and auditing business. Although the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management nearly pushed the world's financial markets over the brink that same year, the government demanded no further disclosure of the well-concealed financing of the industry. 
 But the open and honest flow of information is the only true check on the manipulation of the markets. Government regulation and independent scrutiny are critical to the process. Such regulation is a public good, like education and the highway system. If it requires a little expense on the part of business now, it will make them more money in the long run. 
 Bogle should have pushed his fine analytical ability and strong moral sense farther. Still, we should be grateful that an insider like him is willing to elucidate the often murky and apparently deceptive workings of the Street. John Bogle has been making Wall Street a better place for decades. His book is yet another important contribution in an illustrious career.

HEADLINE: What Is a Living Wage?

 BODY:
Jon Gertner (Jan. 15) offered a hopeful blueprint for the future of the working poor in America (and perhaps for the future of the Democratic Party). Unfortunately, his account demonstrated the extent to which liberals arguing for higher minimum wages have solely -- and unwisely -- used arguments rooted in fairness rather than in economic theory. Working Americans need a raise because modern economies are primarily driven by consumption, and as John Maynard Keynes suggested three-quarters of a century ago, putting more money in the hands of the poor is an efficient way to promote economic growth because the poor spend a higher percentage of their income than the nonpoor. Thus while Democrats are correct to insist that higher wages are moral, they might also remind Republicans that higher wages promote economic growth that benefits everyone. 
 Interestingly, the one occasion on which this important idea appeared in Gertner's article -- obliquely -- was when Lee Culpepper, a Wal-Mart spokesman, said that the company's president supported raising the minimum wage because ''we think it would have a beneficial effect on our customers.''

HEADLINE: William Ivey Long Keeps His Clothes On

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel. 
Alex Witchel is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
On the night that the movie ''The Producers'' had its premiere at the Ziegfeld in New York, William Ivey Long, costume designer for both it and the hit Broadway show, sidestepped the red carpet and went quickly inside. Not that he could hide. A showgirl in a sleeveless gold lame dress immediately embraced him.
''The smallest waist in three counties!'' he cried, turning her side to side from her hips. ''You're not wearing any underwear.'' 
 ''You're telling me,'' she said, laughing, arms covered with goose pimples. It must have been 20 degrees outside. Turning to greet someone else, Long accidentally knocked the cap off the actor Ernie Sabella's head. ''It's only apparel,'' Sabella said graciously, picking it up. 
 Only? Apparel has been at the center of Long's universe since he made his first costume at age 6 -- an Elizabethan ruff that he sewed around his dog's neck. That was followed by a bonnet he whipped up from a pattern he traced around his hand. You would expect no less from a designer whose wit and inventiveness have consistently bolstered the standards of musical-theater glitz. In the recent Lincoln Center production of Stephen Sondheim's ''Frogs,'' for instance, Long gave the chorus girls in Hell headdresses that flamed up like cigarette lighters. 
 Long has been nominated for 10 Tony Awards and won 4 (''The Producers,'' ''Hairspray,'' ''Crazy for You,'' ''Nine''), and this week he will be inducted into the Theater Hall of Fame. To be eligible for that honor, a theater artist must have at least five significant Broadway credits in 25 years of work. At 58, Long has done 50 Broadway shows, a milestone he celebrated last spring with a party for 400 at the Boathouse in Central Park, given by Susan Stroman, the director of ''The Producers,'' Wendy Wasserstein, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright (''The Heidi Chronicles'') and a friend from Long's days at the Yale School of Drama, and Paul Rudnick, the playwright and screenwriter (''In and Out''), who once worked as Long's assistant. The invitation bore a quote from the critic John Simon's review of ''The Lady and the Clarinet,'' an Off Broadway play from 1983. ''William Ivey Long's costumes hover between taste and travesty,'' he wrote. So of course, Long invited him. And he came. 
 At the Ziegfeld, Long was stopped continually on the way to his seat, and he spent a good 20 minutes kissing everyone -- gay women, straight men -- smack on the lips. When people saw Long, it was if they were seeing dessert -- eyes widened, mouths opened, then they grabbed. He reciprocated in kind. ''Oh, goddess!'' was a frequent greeting, and not only to the women.
 But when he finally sat down, his tension was palpable. He hadn't yet seen the movie, which required 7,000 costumes (the show has 497 by comparison), and he didn't know what to expect. Though ''The Producers'' is only his fourth film, he has often ventured beyond Broadway. Until the tiger intervened, he costumed Siegfried and Roy at the Mirage in Las Vegas, where ''Hairspray'' will open at the Luxor next month; he has designed operas for Leonard Bernstein and ballets for Peter Martins, Paul Taylor and Twyla Tharp at New York City Ballet. He dressed Mick Jagger for the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels U.S. tour in 1989 and made the paper dresses in Bruce Weber's video of the Pet Shop Boys' ''I Get Along.'' Although the fashion line he tried to establish in 2003 failed, he continues to design for private clients, including Halle Berry, who wore one of his gowns to the 2002 Screen Actors Guild awards.
 Throughout the movie, Long sat at ramrod attention with his hands on his knees, and as soon as the lights came up, he bounded over three rows of seats to get to Stroman. They hugged as he congratulated her before leaving separately for the party at the Metropolitan Club. So? What did he think? He looked worried. ''I always want to redo something,'' he said. ''I saw every bra strap in captivity, or not in captivity, more to the point.'' 
 At the party, Long ignored the sumptuous buffet tables. ''I'm not here to eat; I'm here to say hello to people,'' he said. ''Let's go look in that fancy room.'' He first greeted Stroman's extended family, then Neil Simon, whose last four plays Long has designed costumes for, then producers of the show and of the movie ''The Producers.'' His campy exuberance was muted here. When it came to the grown-ups -- the people who could hire him -- Long dispensed a more burnished version of his Southern charm. That was, until he ran into Nathan Lane, holding court in a circle of admirers.
 ''Run!'' Lane shouted to Long when he saw me standing beside him, notebook in hand. ''When she wrote about me, I was the clown who cried, and you'll be the costumer who cried. 'Oh, poor William! Fourteen houses and no boyfriend!'''+ 
 No one laughed louder than Long, though the joke had its sting. When I asked him about it later, he shrugged. ''Nathan's talking about what he wants, not me,'' he said. It is indeed true that Long has never had a partner. The 14 houses are 12 houses; Long restores houses the way other people knit. There are two houses in the Berkshires, a brownstone in Chelsea, a farm in Pennsylvania and the rest in North Carolina: five houses in Seaboard, the tiny town where the Long family settled in 1676 and where Long is undertaking an elaborate program of what Rudnick calls ''rural renewal''; a historic house in coastal Rose Bay and another two in Manteo, on the Outer Banks, where Long is the production designer for ''The Lost Colony,'' an annual summer pageant about the first American settlers. 
 So, if not a boyfriend, what does he want? For starters, his appetite for work is insatiable. He converted an abandoned school in the Berkshires into a research archive for his own costumes as well as the historical clothing he collects (he lends these clothes to Off Broadway shows that could never afford to make them); he founded the nonprofit Eastern Seaboard Trust to encourage economic development there and has just completed a feasibility study with a grant from the state of North Carolina on how to create jobs. And most of his shows either preview out of town, sprout touring companies or both. ''Chicago'' alone has kept Long busy on Broadway and on the road for the last 10 years. 
 Highly caffeinated and in constant motion, he is rarely by himself. To enter the floating treehouse of Long's life, the tight camaraderie of his five-person staff, one of whom always travels with him, is a curious exercise. His flow of ideas is continuous -- when he speaks, someone always takes notes -- and his attention to detail is both meticulous and obsessive, whether it is finding the right trim for a dress or insisting that Seaboard fund-raising thank-you notes be postmarked only in Seaboard. Despite a certain amount of eye-rolling, the staff clearly adores him; most of them have been with him for years. 
 Long is also actively enamored of his family's exquisite 18th- and 19th-century furniture, much of which he has spent years restoring, and it fills his houses. (That's family the Southern way; every June, Long gives a Long family party, and 600 people attend.) Whenever a cousin doesn't want something, Long drives a truck down to rescue it. So no matter what city they are in, his houses feel vaguely the same. 
 That's all on the inside. To see Long race through a day on the outside, with his very big brain and even bigger personality, is to see someone for whom the world has clearly not been an easy place. No matter the activity -- whether professional or one of his endless good deeds -- he is there, then he's gone, like a comet, barely establishing a welcome he could possibly overstay. He seems mindful, always, to administer himself like a very strong spice, in dashes and sprinkles, only. The race ends back home, any home, surrounded by his books, his projects, his things, safe!
 He has a line that gets him laughs, though it is also apparently a lesson he learned early. ''Beauty is skin-deep,'' he likes to say. ''But ugly is to the bone.'' 
 It was Long's first day of work on the Las Vegas production of ''Hairspray,'' and his New York studio was packed with people. They filled the ground floor of his 1864 brownstone, and at the very back, he sat in the room he calls his sanctum. It is anchored by a drafting table of 18th-century American pine that he will only say was ''given by a dear friend.'' Long has friendships with scores of celebrities and prides himself on never mentioning their names in print. (I will instead: he was an usher at Caroline Kennedy's wedding to Edwin Schlossberg, and the table was a gift from the bride's mother.) 
 Long showed me his ''bible'' for ''Hairspray,'' an enormous notebook packed with photos of the show's 350 costumes, including shoes, bags, hats and earrings, and measurements of the cast. The undergarments that Harvey Fierstein wore on Broadway and will wear again in Vegas have the breasts and buttocks built into them.
 Though the contracts had not yet been signed, Long had already started researching ''The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,'' which will open on Broadway in May. Jerry Zaks, for whom Long has designed 24 productions, will direct, and David Schwimmer will star. Long often represents himself in business negotiations and drives a notoriously hard bargain for his services, with reason. Traditionally, men have been the set designers in the theater -- think architecture -- while women designed the clothes and were, unsurprisingly, paid less. The standard minimum fee for a show, Long says, is determined by the number of characters and costumes, whether it is a musical or a play and whether it requires contemporary or period dress. Most costume designers get the fee plus a flat payment for each week of a run. Long often gets the fee and a percentage of the weekly gross, both on Broadway and on the road.
 One producer who has worked with Long calls him ''brilliant and fastidious'' though said he is still smarting from the cost. But Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, which produced ''The Frogs'' and a number of other Long-designed shows, said: ''Most great designers I know are expensive. And William really gets in the trenches with the hems and the pins. It's not like all the assistants do it and he's standing off to the side wearing a beret.''
 Certainly in the last decade or so, Long's singular flair for color and good-natured glamour has jibed with the increased amount of spectacle on Broadway. But Zaks, whose work with Long includes both the 1992 Tony-Award-winning revival of ''Guys and Dolls'' and the 1991 Tony-Award-winning play ''Six Degrees of Separation,'' said: ''William always makes the play the most important thing. He never allows his style to upstage the material. And whether he's got a dollar to work with or unlimited funds, he's tirelessly inventive.''
 Leaving the bustle of the studio, Long led the way to the top floor of the house; the walls of his bedroom are covered in brocade, and he sleeps in his great-great-great grandparents' canopied mahogany bed, circa 1835. Across the hall is another sanctum with his great-grandmother's Chippendale chairs and walls of books organized by topic: fashion, men and uniforms, oversize folios, interiors, decorative arts and his favorite, architecture. When he can't sleep, he comes here, though when he's designing he gets inspiration from all over. One costume in ''Hairspray'' began its life as a pink plastic shower curtain in a discount store on 14th Street; another as a bedspread in the Garnet Hill catalog.
 Long, who saves his flights of fancy for his actors and their characters, has worn the same outfit for some 30 years now: navy blazer, white shirt, striped tie, khakis, black lace-up shoes. ''I have to wear a uniform,'' he said. ''If I were wearing something people commented on, it would be distracting. Everyone knows I am focused only on them.''
 He took a seat facing his four Tony Awards, displayed on the mantel of the fireplace. ''Let other people keep them in the bathroom,'' he said. ''I'm proud as hell.'' He will be inducted into the Hall of Fame by Stroman, and from the breathless way Long talks about her, you would think he was a starstruck fan; they've done nine Broadway shows together, including the musical ''Contact.'' But he takes nothing for granted, especially his friendships. And in the theater, where egos blaze at the most inopportune moments, he usually manages to remain above the fray. In 2003, when Mary Tyler Moore quit the Neil Simon play ''Rose's Dilemma'' late in previews after Simon criticized her performance, she stormed out of her dressing room as Long stood outside. What ever did he do?
 ''I made sure the understudy had clothes,'' he said evenly. ''The trick about the theater is at the end of the day you cannot take any of it personally. At the level at which I work with people, their great talent is paired with great insecurity. Self-doubt is literally the twin of self-confidence. And I have to be there for both.''
 Well, who's there for him when his twin takes over? ''With friends like mine, who needs a significant other?'' he said. ''I'm a bachelor in the old sense of the word, meaning I flirt, I have very many close relationships, but then I come home and like to read my book. In fact, I have escaped many complete breakdowns by calling up Paul Rudnick and making him listen. We both laugh because neither of us believes in shrinks. That's what friends are for. I guess I've lost some along the way, but since they're not here, I don't notice.''
 Long said he was ''a manic child'' who would fight with anyone, the ''toughest sissy on the block'' in Rock Hill, S.C. ''My mind still runs too fast,'' he said. ''If we get the wrong fabric or something is stitched the wrong way, I get so angry and so flummoxed that I start spelling my words, just to slow myself down. The kids downstairs know that's code for 'William's really nervous, nothing is personal.' My parents' favorite comment was: 'Billy, calm down and be yourself.' Which insulted me to the core because I was being myself. I have never stopped being myself. 'Billy, calm down and be someone else' is what they were trying to say.''
 At the very least, it would seem, he was theatrical from the start, living the first three years of his life in the stage-left dressing room of the amphitheater at the Raleigh Little Theater, where his father, William Ivey Long Sr., was the technical director (he later wrote plays) and his mother, Mary, acted and designed costumes. ''It was like a circus family,'' he said. ''I often say my parents left the farm to join the circus.''
 The Longs moved to a house after their second son, Robert, was born. (He is a theater architect based in Chapel Hill.) Their daughter, Laura, who still lives in Rock Hill, works with the Merry Pranksters, a theater company for the mentally challenged, which her mother helped found.
 Long assumed he would become a professor like his father and graduated from the College of William and Mary before taking a teaching fellowship at his parents' alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He spent three years there pursuing a Ph.D. in Renaissance art history. During that time he befriended Betty Smith, the author of ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' who had come South to teach playwriting. ''She saw me struggling with art history, and she could see that my heart wasn't in it,'' he said. Smith had studied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama and encouraged Long to apply as a designer. But when he was accepted, he was the only one who celebrated; his parents regarded his career change as quitting.
 ''It was so traumatic,'' he recalled. ''My father was a full professor at Winthrop University in South Carolina, where he founded the drama department, and my mother taught high-school drama for 21 years. They were very disappointed in me.''
 By the time Long graduated from Yale in 1975, he had been in college and graduate school for 10 years and had no idea how to look for a job. He moved into the Chelsea Hotel to be near one of his idols, the couturier Charles James, who lived there and for whom Long worked, unpaid, until James died in 1978. But he couldn't find work in the theater and had what he calls ''breakdowns'' for two years. ''When I came to New York, I was so scared that I would eat one banana and one yogurt a day, and I weighed 135 pounds,'' he said. ''So I arrived with the least amount of energy you could possibly have. I can only imagine now that here was this scarecrow person, lacking the kick and drive and the clawing that I have shown is the center of my work ethic ever since.''
 Long supported himself by designing dolls that Wasserstein and Rudnick sold for him. Finally, in 1978, the set designer Karen Schulz, his good friend from Yale, was hired to do ''The Inspector General'' on Broadway and recommended him to design costumes. He hasn't stopped since. In fact, one rap against him in the business -- especially among costume designers in search of work -- is that Long takes on too much. 
 ''That is totally true,'' he said. ''When I'm excited about a project, I'll take it even if I shouldn't. It's an addiction. Because when you turn jobs down, it's the worst. A great percentage of the time, the person who offered it to you will never offer you another job again. I'll sign that in blood. I have a real spiritual spook about it. You know how you relive things? I relive all those, and I'm still designing several shows I already designed because I don't think I got them right. Everyone liked 'Guys and Dolls,' but was it really right?'' (He won a Drama Desk Award for it.) ''I'm not saying I thought it was bad. But because it had so many possibilities, I'm constantly redesigning it.''
 Wow. Those must have been some parents. 
 ''They died in 1998, six weeks apart after being married for 52 years,'' Long said. ''It wasn't a great marriage, but they stayed together because, at the end of the day, they were best friends.''
 Was his being gay difficult for them? His expression was blank. ''It was never mentioned,'' he said. ''Though on her deathbed, we were in the hospice with the morphine pump, and my mother was answering questions to 'Jeopardy,' getting them right. And in between guessing the correct answer and the morphine pump, she would say, 'Oh, I still hope you find some nice girl and settle down and have children, because children are the greatest happiness in anyone's life.' Pump, pump. Not that this seared itself into my soul or anything. But there you have it.''
 As Long spoke, his eyes turned red and filled with tears while the rest of his face pretended not to notice. So the moment passed quickly. ''I'm guilty because I haven't made everyone happy and everything perfect,'' he said wearily. ''It's the same old story.''
 Maybe that's why he likes being with his family's furniture more than he liked being with his family. He smiled. ''No, actually I liked being with them. I'm just telling you there was some torture along the way. I think it's encouraging to have their things around. I have a great sense of history, which I learned from them. I think that's why in the South, you hold onto things. Because they remind you.''
 Seaboard, located in the northeastern corner of North Carolina, was originally called Concord, a farming community founded in the 17th century. The town was incorporated in 1877 and renamed Seaboard after the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. Its current population is 674. 
 ''What it really is, is ordinary,'' Long said during the 90-minute drive to Seaboard from Raleigh. ''For me the magic is it's where I'm from, therefore it's extraordinary.'' He moved here in 1997 (growing up he and his family spent holidays here), and in addition to restoring houses, he bought a building through the Seaboard Trust, where a health clinic opened last summer. On this trip, the trust was buying another building to house a pharmacy.
 But show business is never far away. In nearby Roanoke Rapids, Randy Parton, brother of Dolly, is among the partners planning to open Carolina Crossroads, an entertainment district, in April 2007. An aspiring Branson, Mo., it is to have live-performance theaters, movie theaters, restaurants, hotels and shops. Long arranged for the trust to buy the Seaboard School (formerly Grades 1-12, it closed for lack of students) and he is turning it into the Seaboard School of Fashion and Costume, with the help of the North Carolina State College of Textiles and College of Design. The school will make costumes for the new theaters and the Carolina Ballet in Raleigh. Long also plans to start a laundry and dry-cleaning facility in Seaboard to service the costumes and uniforms at Carolina Crossroads. These projects, he says, will bring 50 jobs to Seaboard to start.
 As he talked about his plan, he was so excited he could barely stay in his seat. ''North Carolina State has one of the most advanced textile programs in the country,'' he said. ''By having this market here, we will be unique as a training facility.''
 When we arrived at the Long family house, we got our sleeping assignments: I would stay there, Long would stay in his own house next door, the yellow house (pronounced ''YELL-uh''), and Brian Mear, who handles his finances, would stay in the staff house across the street.
 Not so fast. Long may be creating his own personal sequel to ''The Last Picture Show,'' but to me, this setup was ''In Cold Blood.'' Alone in a five-bedroom house in the middle of nowhere? 
 O.K. Mear would stay with me. The notion of inviting me to stay at his house never seemed to occur to Long, nor did he volunteer to stay with me. And by the way, with his love of history and tradition, why doesn't he live in the family house?
 Long, who was racing through the yellow house showing me his tiger maple furniture when I asked that question, stopped still. ''I've never slept there,'' he said, as if he hadn't realized it before. ''Maybe I don't want to give in and have a family.''
 Forget about avoiding intimacy -- he won't even share plumbing. Later, Paul Rudnick tried to give some context. ''I think to a certain extent that the world is William's significant other,'' he said. ''That's why the projects keep expanding. You wonder if there's a sadness or a lack there, but it's hard to imagine him being satisfied with one person, one Tony Award, one town. But he's not that old, so you never know. I would love to see who that match might be -- but they're probably buried at Westminster Abbey.''
 I ran around with Long for the rest of the afternoon, to the farm and all the houses. At the yellow house, he made coffee and stood still long enough to listen to the 17 messages on his answering machine. One was from a 98-year-old aunt, who said she wasn't up to seeing him during Christmas.
 Long shook his head. ''She's just feeling, that's all,'' he said, as if it were akin to the flu. ''That happens.''
 He cut camellias from the yard, arranged them in crystal vases, presided over a glorious buffet dinner at which the guests talked about the neighbors and actually said things like ''I'm not sure who his people were.'' After they left, a train whistled mournfully in the deadly silent night, and Mear or no Mear, I hardly slept a wink. I kept recalling a moment that afternoon when we returned from a spin through the local cemetery and Long mentioned that his mother was not buried there with his father. 
 ''Mother was buried at Manteo, where she was the queen,'' Long said. It turns out that for 10 years, Mary Long played Queen Elizabeth there in ''The Lost Colony,'' and that is where she preferred to spend eternity.
 ''Her opening line was 'Unto my people, greetings,''' her son said. ''That's what's on the tombstone.''
 Well, that explains a lot.
 The following week, back in New York, Robin Givens came to Long's house for her fitting. She was preparing to join the Broadway cast of ''Chicago'' this month, and six costumes needed to be made. 
 Seeing Long again after our trip to Seaboard was unexpectedly reassuring. His clothes were the same, the furniture felt like North Carolina and Mear and company were present and accounted for. The Long family treehouse at work.
 Givens is the first African-American to play Roxie, and since the clothes are variations on black negligees, Long had to make adjustments. ''It's all a game of playing peekaboo with the sheer and the lace, and the black is so dense,'' he said. ''The Roxies we've had never even had a suntan.''
 The original Roxie was Ann Reinking, on whom the clothes were built, a process Long says is all about defining the character. ''I try to come to the first meeting knowing just the written word,'' he said. ''Hopefully there's not a previous production or a movie, a previously owned vehicle, as I say, because I don't need to know that someone was wearing the red dress. Until the director shows me what way we're going, I don't need to start thinking, which is one of the hardest things, because how can you not start seeing the production as you're reading it? At the second meeting I can bring ideas, start my thumbnails and collages. By the third meeting the designs are almost ready, and I have a give-and-take with the actors.''
 Givens appeared first in a tiny dress with a plunging neckline, looking like a million bucks. Long, on his knees, reached up and pushed her breasts closer together before starting to pin. He touched her like a collector handling a vintage doll, with a sense of both worship and play. 
 The next costume was a dress that cut straight across her neck. ''You wear this dress in the opening scene when we don't know Roxie yet, so it makes sense to be covered up,'' Long told her. ''Later, in your solo, it should be totally revealing.'' That's where the plunging neckline comes in.
 When the fitting was over, Long and I returned to his upstairs sanctum. Even with the door closed, the sound of people on the stairs was loud and clear. With the boss out of commission all morning, the staff was growing frantic. But ever the gentleman, Long made a final go at trying to identify what makes him run.
 ''I tried being a New Yorker,'' he said, ''but in New York it's not a challenge to be accepted. I wanted to go someplace where they could be critical and I could say: 'Too bad, I belong here. I don't have to apologize for being strange because I'm from a long line of strange people who were here from the beginning of time and that's it.' And that's very comforting to me.''
 It also meant a great deal, he said, that his father lived long enough to see the family's roots re-established in Seaboard. 
 ''I felt my dad did not achieve his potential,'' Long said. ''He was a sensitive soul stuck in his time and place. He made this incredible leap from farm boy to playwright, though he was never able to make the leap to professional theater. That's one of the reasons I use his name. I learned my work ethic from both my parents. My God, did they work! That's why I think 'dilettante' is the word I fear most. It's why I try to be so thorough, why I work so hard. Whatever I do, I want it to be serious.'' 
 The footsteps were on the stairs again, and Long knew he had to go. He closed an oversize architecture book that lay on the table -- he had picked it out in the dark the night before when he couldn't sleep, an insomniac's game. ''I look at the pictures,'' he said, ''and of course, I read it too, and at the end, I start again. You learn by going over it.'' He seemed to hesitate as he brought it back to the shelf, as if he might stay. But he slid it into place, returned the Chippendale chairs to their usual station, side by side against the wall, and once he showed me out, closed the door softly, even tenderly, behind him.

 BODY:
The mission church is scarcely more than a shed with open sides. Rusty beams support a roof of corrugated metal, and a wooden lectern, unadorned, serves as the pulpit. No cross rises from the roof or hangs behind the lectern on the blue-painted cement wall; there is no cross anywhere. The house of worship is almost nothing. But it is too much for the missionary Rick Maples. ''I want this to be the last church,'' he said. ''This should be the last church built in this section of the valley.'' 
With needles nearly bone white, scrub borders the patch of cleared ground -- of coarse sand -- that surrounds the church. Cactuses, shoulder-high, grow beside spindly bushes throughout the valley, and the vines and stunted trees are studded with thorns. It is a place, this desiccated land in northern Kenya, where living requires severe tenacity. But it is also a valley of abundance. The country's famous game parks are far to the south, yet here miniature antelope leap over the scrub and monkeys idle at the edge of the Mapleses' backyard. A pair of leopards pranced across the yard one evening last year. At the top of the sporadic acacia trees, whose upper branches form a broad, flat, wispy canopy that looks too delicate to support anything heavier than birds, families of baboons move about, feeding on tiny buds. They seem to float on the flimsy treetops. 
 Rick, his wife, Carrie, and their two daughters, Meghan and Stephanie, moved to this mission outpost in September 2004. Once, their home was in Danville, Calif., an affluent suburb about 30 miles outside San Francisco. Their house ''cost a pile,'' Rick told me, remembering what he termed ''my other life,'' and Carrie recalled the sunken Jacuzzi and the high ceilings and the curved staircase that they draped with garlands at Christmastime. Rick, who is 43 and whose thick, gray crew cut and slightly round cheeks give him an air of constant buoyancy, was a salesman for a company that marketed combustion engines. Carrie, three years younger, with an angular face and a quieter voice that suggest a different, more private kind of resilience, was a nurse who spent most of her career working with pediatric cancer patients. ''We were really happy with our life,'' he said. ''We saw about 25 years ahead, and we were happy with what we saw.''
 We were talking at the dining table in their mission house, down the path from the church. Both house and church were built by the American missionaries whom the Mapleses have replaced. Shabby but serviceable, the small cinder-block house has running water from a tank that is mounted -- along with the church bell -- on a metal tower in the front yard. The refrigerator operates on kerosene. In California, the house might belong in a slum; here it is luxurious. It sits just outside Kurungu, a town in name only, near the edge of the desert, much closer to the Ethiopian border than to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, which is a 12-to-14-hour drive away, mostly on dirt roads. Kurungu's three or four shops, dim stalls of dusty shelves, rarely sell more than lard and tea leaves, sugar and salt. 
 The local tribe, the Samburu, are seminomadic herders of cattle and camels and goats. Scattered throughout the valley and surrounding mountains, they live in manyattas, settlements of huts, about four feet tall at the high points of their sloping roofs, covered in thatch and animal skins. A good portion of the Samburu diet -- perhaps most of it -- consists of milk and cow's blood, blood drained by cinching a rope tourniquet around the base of the cow's neck, then shooting an arrow into the side of the neck (without killing the animal) and letting the dark liquid spurt into a wooden tankard.
 Much of Africa, and certainly much of Kenya, one of the continent's most Westernized countries, hold a mix of the modern and the timeless. But around Kurungu, the modern seems to have barely penetrated. Their wooden bells clacking softly in the still air, the herds graze, tended by the Samburu, whose bodies are draped in wraps of brilliant cloth, whose necks and foreheads are resplendent in beads and burnished metal, whose hair is dyed with red ocher.
 To reach the Maples family, I'd flown from Nairobi in a plane hardly bigger than a toy; the pilot, Frank Toews, told me how, as a teenager outside Toronto, he dreamed of flying commercial planes but soon realized that the Lord desired something different. He's now one of 20 pilots in the air wing of the Africa Inland Mission, the century-old, primarily American organization, evangelical and nondenominational, that is known as AIM and that has sent Rick and Carrie to work among the Samburu. The hills below us turned from lush to tan, their jagged contours exposed. Soon Frank pointed out the dirt airstrip next to the Mapleses' house. The plane landed and took off again, and for about a week, other than the Mapleses' Land Rover, that was it for comings and goings of mechanical transport around Kurungu -- except for one morning, when another Land Rover jounced along the sand thoroughfare that runs past the airstrip and through the valley and beyond. It carried evangelists from somewhere to the south; they were headed off into the desert to translate the Bible into the language of another tribe.
 ''For us, this is home,'' Rick said confidently. Carrie agreed that this was where they belonged, by virtue of their calling to convert the Samburu. ''How do they know the truth,'' she paraphrased from the book of Romans, ''unless they are told the truth?'' In the long run, Rick said, he had his sights set not only on the area around Kurungu but throughout the territory of the tribe.
 Rick and Carrie's daughters didn't seem so sure that this was where they were meant to be. Stephanie, their ash-blond 4-year-old, started to cry right after Meghan said grace at dinner on my first night with the Mapleses a few months ago. ''I miss my friends,'' Stephanie said faintly, having just spent a rare weekend with the kids of a missionary family two hours' drive away. Her head still bowed following grace, her crying was all but tearless, and her voice remained almost mute as she reiterated her loneliness -- she came as close as a 4-year-old in a floral print shirt could to being a Stoic. She'd been scared a lot lately too, Carrie said, explaining Stephanie's weeping. The family's dog, Cooper, an irrepressible mutt, had been attacked and nearly blinded by a spitting cobra on the Mapleses' back porch. And Stephanie had been hearing about the two lions that had, over the past month, killed several donkeys and a camel close by. The pair of Samburu guards who keep watch over the house recently chased the lions from the low fence of the family's yard.
 Meghan, who is 12 and home-schooled, seemed even less sure than her little sister that Kurungu was where she should be. It wasn't that either girl lacked an intrepid spirit. Meghan proved her ability to adapt eight years earlier, when the Mapleses took on their first mission posting, a two-year assignment that they extended into six. That station, too, was in rural Kenya, near the country's western border, in a rain-forest town called Bonjoge. There Meghan picked up the tribal language, Kalenjin, and befriended a pair of slightly older sisters, trailing them around as they helped their mother fetch water and cook the staple dish, maize. But it was different in Kurungu, which is far more remote. Meghan was struggling with the language, and English wasn't a workable option here as it was in Bonjoge. And she was struggling even to find girls around her own age. When the family visited the valley, she saw none. It seemed they stayed up in the mountains, tending goats till it was time to be circumcised and married. ''Sometimes I think I can live without friends, I just don't know,'' she told me, her golden hair falling past the many layers of beaded necklaces -- orange and black, yellow and blue -- that encircled her throat and shoulders. AIM missionaries get a year of home assignment for every four years in the field. Meghan went to school back in California for about half of second and fifth grades, and there have been just two shorter trips home. The family's next stay in the States won't come until December 2007. She let only a hint of despair seep into her voice as she went on: ''I didn't really hear God talk to me telling me to be a missionary.''
 Her parents did. Rick and Carrie, whose Baptist church in California is deeply evangelical, spoke of receiving signs, affirmations that they were doing the right thing. Over the past century or more, Kenya has been a highly proselytized country; to go by the broad estimates of the U.S. State Department, 70 percent of Kenya's people now avow themselves Christian, with most of the rest divided between Islam and indigenous faiths. The Samburu, a tribe of about 150,000, worship their God, Ngai. Dispatched by a range of Christian agencies and representing a range of denominations, the missionaries strewn among the Samburu have made little progress. Religious statistics about the tribe are scarce; perhaps 2 to 9 percent are Christian. (Almost none are Muslim.) 
 Rick and Carrie talked about converting the Samburu in a new way. They envision developing what they call a Samburu-style church. They intend, gradually, to hold more and more Christian services not under a roof but under the acacia trees amid the manyattas. They want the sparsely attended church down the path from their house to be superseded. And they plan to teach the lessons of the Bible not through the preaching of written verses but through an emphasis on expansive storytelling that will fit with the Samburu's oral tradition. Rick said that the first lesson he had to impart, the first truth he had to instill in the people, was ''a sense of sin and separation from God'' -- a separation that could be reconciled only through Jesus. He drew from 1 Corinthians to capture the essence of his message: ''I give you Christ and Him crucified.'' 
 He and Carrie expect the truth to bring more than religious conversion. Once the people have accepted Jesus, they said, they hope to coax them to judge their traditions by the standards of the Gospel. In this way, they plan to inspire -- not impose, they stressed -- crucial elements of transformation in the culture. They want to elevate the lot of women, to end the ways women are treated as property. And they want to stop the rite of female circumcision, which Carrie and Meghan witnessed for the first time a few months before I arrived, the razoring out of the clitoris that is almost universally practiced among the Samburu. The Mapleses are in Kurungu, Rick said, because ''there is unbelievable need.''
 A sense of humanity's dire need -- need that is spiritual, need that is earthly -- impels a legion of American Christian missionaries out into the world. Around 120,000 are currently stationed abroad, according to Todd Johnson, director of the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts. The legion includes members of mainline and evangelical Protestant denominations; it includes Catholics and Mormons and members of the nondenominational megachurches flourishing throughout the United States. One-fourth, Johnson estimates, are spread over Africa, with another quarter in Latin America, a quarter in Europe, one-sixth in Asia and the rest cast over the islands of Oceania. The 120,000 accounts for only those committed to their distant posts for at least two years; short-term missionaries are harder to track. But, tallying only Protestants, the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College puts the number who served for between two weeks and a year in 2001 (the most recent figure available) at 346,000. Some Christian emissaries are driven solely to proselytize. Others limit themselves to good deeds, to embodying Christ's message without speaking it aloud. For some, Johnson told me, ''if you don't mention Jesus in every other sentence, there's something wrong.'' For others, ''just handing out a cup of water is enough.'' For most, the work involves both word and water.
 In Africa, the continent of greatest earthly need, I had come to know the work of missionaries fairly well before my trip to Kurungu. In Sierra Leone, I spent time with a missionary couple from Grand Rapids, Mich., who had raised their three children in a jungle village. Their work ranged from baptizing converts in a stream to building a gravity-fed system of pipes that would bring safe water to villagers ravaged by disease. In southern Sudan, a land where perhaps two million people were killed by almost a half-century of civil war even before the terrors of Darfur began, I watched a missionary from Vienna, Va., try to create peace between embattled southern clans as a first step toward ending the overarching war between north and south. He oversaw the construction of a huge white tent in the middle of an empty plain. Bargaining with freelance bush pilots, he arranged to fly clan commanders to his meeting ground, to assemble them under his tent. Several hundred ragged militiamen and child soldiers arrived on foot, running across the desolate landscape toward the white canvas. Then the missionary convened his peace conference. He preached gently from the Gospels, and the commanders spoke of the suffering of their people and pledged to quit their fratricidal attacks. If such gatherings could help bring unity and strength across the Christian and traditionalist south, and if his work could, in this way, compel the Muslim north into an accord, the spread of peace would be, the missionary told me, ''the most powerful statement of the efficacy of the Christian message.''
 He wasn't at all alone in the scale of his missionary ambition in Africa. Last year, Rick Warren, the California pastor whose books, ''The Purpose Driven Life'' and ''The Purpose Driven Church,'' have sold well over 20 million copies and whose Saddleback Valley Community Church has a weekly attendance of 23,000, declared Rwanda the world's ''first purpose-driven nation.'' The country would be a test target for his global plan to eradicate spiritual deprivation along with physical poverty and disease and illiteracy. ''God gets the most glory when you tackle the biggest giants,'' he told Christianity Today magazine. Last summer he sent an advance team of about 50 American evangelicals to meet with Rwandan leaders, and soon, he envisions, hundreds of short-term Saddleback missionaries will fan out across the nation, armed with kits of instruction and resources called ''church in a box'' and ''school in a box'' and ''clinic in a box'' that will help them to rescue the country.
 Missionary dreams in Africa have long been outsize. David Livingstone, the Scottish Protestant who first sailed to southern Africa in 1841, yearned both to Christianize vast regions of the continent and to eliminate the Arab slave trade. His explorations of the African interior may have been journeys of white arrogance and may have cleared a route for white imperialism, yet his best-selling travelogues stirred outrage at what he described: ''The many skeletons we have seen. . .must be attributed, directly or indirectly, to this trade of hell.'' Livingstone's expeditions helped to spark missionary interest in sub-Saharan Africa, and by the late 19th century, the Western missionary presence, which began with European naval explorations in the 15th century and which had been confined mostly to the coastlands, spread to the interior. Also during the 19th century, the Protestant missionary force increased until it more or less matched the Catholic deployment. Today, among American missionaries, Protestants far outnumber Catholics, Johnson says, and evangelicals have, since the 1960's, become the dominant strain.
 In 1900, around 10 percent of sub-Saharan Africans were Christian. Today the figure is about 70 percent, according to Johnson, with Christians defined as those who profess the faith, though their practice may involve a belief in traditional spirits. This tremendous conversion occurred not only because the missionaries moved inland but also because, more and more during the 20th century, they trained and entrusted African pastors to do the proselytizing. Gradually, African church leadership was encouraged -- or became inevitable. Meanwhile, the Scriptures were translated into tribal languages, and increasingly in the later part of the century, missionaries embraced a movement of ''contextualization'': adapting Christianity to local traditions so that, say, a ritual dance telling a story of victory in battle might be altered and included in Christian worship as a celebration of Christ's victory over death -- or so that, in the Mapleses' case, a church building might be replaced by the trees. These days, American missionaries tend to be keenly aware that, as Jonathan Bonk, executive director of the Overseas Ministries Study Center, told me, ''God doesn't speak one language'' and that Christian worship must take indigenous forms. Rick, who often carries a walking stick of blond wood as the Samburu do, is a kind of pioneer, not only because he has settled his family in a place so far afield but also because he would like to leave aspects of Western worship far behind.
 Even beyond conversion, and even beyond abolition, the impact of Western missionaries in Africa has often been immense. When peace was finally brokered between north and south in Sudan in January 2005, much of the credit went to evangelicals like Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son, who runs the mission organization Samaritan's Purse. He and his staff were well acquainted with the country's devastation, and one of his hospitals had been bombed repeatedly in the south. He put pressure on President Bush to make ending Sudan's conflagration a diplomatic priority.
 And when, in his 2003 State of the Union address, Bush called on Congress to devote $15 billion to battle H.I.V./AIDS, it was, in strong part, ''a consequence of evangelical concern for Africa,'' Timothy Shah, a political scientist and senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, told me. Shah explained that this concern was generated by missions. ''No evangelical church is too small that it doesn't have a significant portion of its budget and identity committed to missions,'' he said. From their outposts, missionaries send open ''prayer letters'' -- long updates about their lives and requests for prayer that will bless their work -- to the congregations that support them. At services and denominational conferences, returning missionaries deliver speeches about all they've seen. ''There's this organic process that keeps people informed that's rare in American life,'' Shah said.
 With a president who is acutely attentive to the agendas of evangelical Christians, he added, and with evangelicals making up a majority of the Americans who venture out on missions, this process of education, of information that runs from mission post to stateside congregation, has gained particular importance. ''The evangelicals' increasing influence on foreign policy is the elephant in the room,'' he told me. ''It means more focus on a continent that otherwise gets forgotten. You have a politically significant constituency behind humanitarian concerns in Africa in a way that hasn't been the case in many, many years.'' Shah spoke, too, about the influence of individual mission leaders like Graham and Warren, who recently addressed the Council on Foreign Relations, and like Andrew Natsios, a former vice president of the huge Christian outreach organization World Vision U.S., who served, from the first months of the Bush presidency until a few weeks ago, as the head of the Agency for International Development, the government's division for foreign aid. 
 None of this means that most missionaries, or even most evangelical missionaries, see themselves as policy advocates. The Mapleses certainly don't. In Kurungu, they rarely talk of world affairs. Their devotion -- to meeting the ''unbelievable need'' of the people -- is personal, local, solitary. Yet it is also one tiny part of a powerful religiously driven interaction between America and Africa. And if the Mapleses have their way, their work will transfigure the lives of the Samburu. In a prayer letter last July, e-mailed to the States by satellite phone, Rick and Carrie wrote about the circumcision of Samburu girls: ''Everything is cut away that would give them sexual pleasure, all without the aid of anesthetic during the procedure or painkillers afterward. As terrible as it is, it is so ingrained in the culture that all the girls welcome it. Without circumcision, they would never be married.''
 ''Oh,'' the letter ended, in agony for the tribe, ''how desperately they need Jesus.''
 ' 'Two warriors are here, Dad,'' Meghan said one morning. We had just finished breakfast -- cereal bought, like almost all the family's food, on trips to Nairobi made every several weeks, sometimes every three months. Meghan's voice was casual; ''warrior'' and its Samburu equivalent, moran, are words she uses often. 
 Rick went out the back door to talk with the moran, young men who'd been initiated as herders of the Samburu's most-prized animals, their cattle, and as soldiers if another tribe chose to attack. (No assaults have come against the Samburu for several years, but the pastoralists of northern Kenya have a long, ongoing history of violent rivalries, and a few months earlier, about 60 miles east of Kurungu, a raid by one herding clan upon another left more than 70 people shot or hacked to death.) In wraps of red and blue, the two moran stood in the Mapleses' yard, leaning slightly on long staffs of pale wood that they held to their sides at identical 45-degree angles. Their bodies were nearly as slender as the staffs.
 In the Samburu that he'd learned to speak, haltingly, since arriving in Kurungu, Rick gleaned that an elder in the moran's settlement had fallen ill. Rick was soon navigating the Land Rover along vaguely defined trails through the scrub, with the moran in the back seat. At their manyatta, the old man, too weak to stand, was hoisted into the back of the Land Rover. The nearest clinic, a few spare, clean rooms of concrete, with Kenyan nurses but no doctor, is in the town of South Horr, a half-hour from Kurungu. The clinic is run by a mission of Italian Catholics.
 These are the kinds of things that occupy part of Rick and Carrie's days. They drive a crippled girl to be examined by an AIM missionary doctor two hours away. They haul water from their well, in dozens of jerrycans, to manyattas whose sources of water have vanished in recent drought. Rick repairs Samburu machetes with his welding torch.
 And because they do these things, the Mapleses are appreciated around Kurungu, Andrea Lekalayo said. Andrea, who learned his English at the Catholic mission's primary school in South Horr, is a young elder; he'd just passed on from being a moran. He led a crew of moran, adorned with beads and with plastic flowers, in digging a drainage ditch for the mission airstrip. Rick and Carrie paid each man about $2 a day -- undoubtedly another reason they were appreciated, in this place with almost no cash economy. 
 The Mapleses were liked too, the moran said, with Andrea translating, for trying to learn their language. They were liked for spending time with the people, for asking lots of questions, for trying to understand their culture, for attending their ceremonies. ''Rick,'' Andrea said, laughing, ''he is almost a Samburu.'' At break time, the ditch diggers sat on the Mapleses' back porch as Meghan served them tea. 
 But few around Kurungu seemed much interested in their religion. The Samburu faith is monotheistic. It holds its own sacred history in which, I was told, humankind had once been linked to Ngai by a ladder made of leather. Ages ago, a Samburu man, enraged by the death of his herd, cut the ladder, and ever since the people have been disconnected from their deity. Yet when the Samburu spoke to me about Ngai, they evoked not a divinity that is abstract and removed but one that is, though invisible, close at hand, especially on the steep mountains that bound the valley, and most especially on a particular set of ridges and rocky peaks known collectively as Mount Nyiru. This, the tribe's most hallowed mountain, about 9,000 feet high, rises immediately to the west of Kurungu. It looms over the family's backyard. Ngai is up there, taking care of his people. He had granted the Samburu the knowledge of how to survive on cow's blood, Andrea and his crew said. And he was forgiving when the people did wrong. He had placed a spring at the spot where the leather ladder had been cut. The Samburu told me that their religion makes no prediction of a messiah. They didn't seem to feel the need for one.
 ''Lord,'' Carrie said, offering grace over lunch one afternoon, before the family set out for a manyatta, where they would deliver jerrycans of water and hold church in the open air, ''we pray that the people today thirst not only for water but for your word, Lord.''
 It was Carrie who first came to Africa, who was shown the first signs that they were meant to be full-time missionaries. She and Rick grew up in California churches. As teenagers, they went on brief foreign missions: Carrie to Mexico, Rick to Mexico and New Guinea. After they met, dated for about three years of sexual abstinence and married, they talked sometimes about becoming missionaries when they retired -- talk that was safe, Carrie recounted; the prospect was too far in the future to be real. Then, in 1996, a colleague in nursing invited her along on a three-week mission to a hospital that AIM runs just outside Nairobi. Right away, she wanted badly to go, but worried that neither her husband nor her boss would allow her. ''I thought it could never happen,'' she said. That was when she received two early signs: Rick told her that he would take care of Meghan, and the head nurse agreed to adjust her schedule. 
 Carrie flew off to Kenya to help an American surgeon, a career missionary who operated on children with polio or terrible burns that had twisted their limbs or left their hands contracted and useless. She saw them after their operations with feet that were straight, with fingers that could hold her own. Returning home, she longed to be back in Kenya full time, and without telling Rick, she wrote to AIM for information. She filled out the application in secret, showing it to her husband only when he confided that he, too, had been ''convicted.'' He recognized his desire one day at work, when he and his colleagues were chatting about what they would do if they ever won the lottery. His own answer, he said, had stunned him: he would quit his job and go as a missionary to Africa.
 AIM requires its 850 long-term missionaries (about 550 of them American, 150 of them British and most of the rest from Canada, Australia and South Africa) to pass through interviews and written psychological tests, and to raise their own financing before they head off for the field. Like many American mission organizations, AIM serves as an administrative body; it supplies no financial support. This system may not give missionaries a great sense of economic security, but it promotes the feeling, as Rick put it, that ''we're living on faith; we have faith that God will provide for our needs.'' From four California churches where they or their families were members, and from about 50 individual donors, Rick and Carrie collected the money AIM said they needed before setting out. (An AIM family in Kenya needs about $50,000 per year to cover everything from living expenses to insurance to administrative costs.) They collected it without any trouble and took this to be another sign. When they put their Danville house on the market, it sold within a day -- yet another sign. ''There were so many green lights,'' Carrie remembered.
 Reaching Kenya in 1998, they intended to stay two years; they would move back home when Meghan had to start first grade. In the rain-forest town of Bonjoge, Rick started a Christian secondary school, and Carrie was the school nurse. She steered away from clinic work, partly because she was dispirited by the fatalism that seemed to pervade Kenyan health care; she focused mostly on Meghan's home-schooling. And Meghan embraced her new life so readily that it was, Rick said, ''the grace of God'' -- another sign. So they extended their commitment to AIM for four more years and looked to move someplace even more isolated when that term was over. Now, in Kurungu, Rick talked about the clear indications that he and his family were doing God's will: ''I have found satisfaction in a place that my culture'' -- American culture -- ''says should not be satisfying to me. My experience backs up my faith. Everything has gone miraculously well here. We've thrived. Meghan has thrived. All of that leads us to believe that we're on the right track.''
 With this certainty, soon after Carrie said her prayer about thirst, the family drove off to bring church to a manyatta. Richard Losieku Lesamaja, the mission's Samburu pastor, rode with them. Seven years ago, he was hired by the AIM missionaries, the Beverlys, who preceded the Mapleses. The son of Samburu Christians, Richard was educated through eighth grade at the Catholic mission school in South Horr. The Beverlys employed him to preach on Sundays at their shedlike church. The Mapleses still have Richard hold weekly services for the 20 or 30 Samburu, almost all of them women and young children, who gather under the corrugated roof. On the previous Sunday when I attended, they listened to Richard, who wore blue slacks and beleaguered sneakers, preach in Samburu from Paul's teaching in 2 Corinthians: ''Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?. . .Therefore come out from them and be separate.''
 But the congregation hadn't been growing, so Rick and Carrie began driving Richard out to preach in the manyattas. Eventually, when Rick learned the language well enough, and when he learned enough about the culture, he said he planned to do some preaching himself and, much more important, to devise Samburu-style versions of Christian stories and lessons. He had yet to define any specifics for this cultural transposition of Christianity. He was determined to go slowly, to understand the Samburu first, then to proceed. But he imagined a team of Samburu Christian leaders, armed with the teachings he would design, starting a series of worship groups throughout the area. Each group might have 12 Samburu and would spawn, in turn, three new leaders, who would create new groups of their own. ''It will be a geometrical instead of a linear growth pattern,'' Rick, whose college minor was math, said. The expansion would be exponential. In the meantime, though, Rick and Carrie relied on Richard.
 It was hard to tell how happy Richard was in his work. He told me that he wanted to study at a Bible college, probably in Nairobi, but that he didn't have the fees. ''I don't like to disturb,'' he said, explaining why he hadn't asked the Beverlys or the Mapleses for help with tuition. ''It has been seven years, and so far they are quiet.''
 Yet he dutifully preached where the Mapleses drove him, preached from his worn Bible with the red covers. Its text was in Masai; he translated, as he read, into Samburu. It wasn't hard for him; the languages, like the tribes, are closely related. But it was hard to attract listeners, as hard outdoors in the manyattas as it was in the mission church. And in the manyattas even fewer men gathered, often none at all. The moran were off somewhere, unseen, and the older men tended to lounge under the best acacia tree, the one whose spindles provided the best semblance of shade. 
 At the cluster of huts we visited after Carrie's prayer, 12 or so women sat on the dirt in front of Richard. Carrie, in a long denim skirt, joined them. From the Land Rover Rick brought out a rope swing. He knotted it to a tree a hundred yards from Richard, and he and Meghan and Stephanie played with the young children so that the mothers could focus on Richard's sermon. This was Rick and Carrie's program for conversion, for now.
 Rick predicted it would be different when his plan got under way. Men, women, children all would be gradually drawn in; all would come to know the facts of humanity's fall and its division from God. All would come to know that, as Rick said, ''Jesus was the perfect lamb'' who ''became sin for us,'' who relinquished his life in the ultimate ''blood sacrifice'' and who was the only way for humankind to connect with God again.
 In the manyattas spread below the ridges of the Samburu's sacred mountain, with the miniature congregations of women gazing stone-faced as Richard preached, and with the men playing bau, a game of pebbles on a wooden board, in the spotty shade, it was easy to see Rick's prediction as far-fetched to the point of pure impossibility. But at the same time, it wasn't hard to think that his wishes would be realized. The Mapleses' patience, which could be mistaken for passivity, was strategic. It seemed to blend with the expanses of arid land and the timelessness of Samburu life; it seemed almost like a cover. And all the while the Mapleses were gaining trust and gathering knowledge so that they would prevail in an area where other missionaries had made little headway. 
 So much of the rest of Kenya had been Christianized -- and back near the beginning of that long process came the handful of missionaries who founded AIM in 1895. Their endeavor must have seemed far more futile than Rick and Carrie's did now. A little more than a year after arriving in the British-ruled territory that is now Kenya, AIM's leader died of malaria. The rest of his small team died of disease or left soon after. Yet their vision won out. Wasn't it likely that the Samburu, isolated within a converted nation, would eventually surrender?
 At a Manyatta where the Mapleses took Richard to preach each week, Meghan watched the circumcision. Most Samburu girls have the cutting done just before their weddings, which often come when they are young teenagers. Others have their clitorises excised as part of a Samburu ceremony initiating and circumcising boys and young men as moran -- older sisters must be cut before their brothers can become warriors. Since moving to Kurungu, Carrie and Meghan had been invited to attend the circumcisions of three girls. Twice they stood outside the hut. But once, they were invited inside along with a short-term missionary, a female college student named Quinn, who was visiting the family from North Carolina. It was dawn at the manyatta, the sun just starting to illuminate the face of Mount Nyiru that rises above the settlement. Inside the hut, the girl was naked except for ceremonial leather sandals made by her father. 
 ''Today,'' Meghan wrote in her diary, with the potted daisy on its blue cover, ''I saw something I don't think I will ever forget. I saw a girl get mutilated. Her name was Santo. A 13-year-old girl having something awful done. Quinn got the 'privilege' of holding her leg. There was a lady holding her back very tightly! The circumciser had Santo adjust herself so many times in the process. I was able to see a little. I saw the circumciser literally sawing off the part with a razor blade. Santo was brave and did not really cry. She eventually was on her back almost crying. She had tears in her eyes. Later that day I saw her sitting up, smiling. This is something I don't understand. It seems so painful. There is no good thing done through the process, yet people seem to like it so much. I will just have to pray that God helps me to understand it and if he wants me to stop it I will pray for courage.''
 Sometimes when Rick and Carrie discussed their mission in Kurungu, it seemed they were devoted almost exclusively to conversion, that the spiritual work, the work of the word, was almost all, and that addressing earthly needs mattered, to them, very little. Good deeds, though part of the calling, were problematic. Rick and Carrie didn't want to come anywhere close to selling Christianity with trips to the clinic or jerrycans of water. They spoke about liking the Samburu's self-reliance because it relieved them of having to provide things that would taint their religious mission. But then they would talk about female circumcision. ''It's a spiritual issue, it's a public-health issue, it's a human rights issue,'' Rick declared, emphasizing that the body is God's temple and to mar it, a sin. As the three of us sat at their dining table, he and Carrie laid out a long-term plan both to end the rite and to raise the status of Samburu women. ''Once people have accepted the Lord, we'll talk about how God created sex and ordained sex, that sex is to be enjoyed,'' Rick said. ''It is a gift to a man and a woman who are married, and to take away God's gift of pleasure is not right.'' During my time in Kurungu, we discussed sex much more often and openly than I'd expected. ''Most people,'' Rick explained, ''think evangelicals are anti-sex. It's a fallacy that's picked up from our stance against premarital sex. Within the context of marriage, sex is not only for procreation, it's for pleasure.''
 ''The role of women -- there are going to be some tough issues,'' Carrie said. She mentioned the way young Samburu girls are married off to elderly men, and the way a wife is passed to her husband's brother, or to another man in the family when the husband dies. She also recalled a wedding they attended: when Carrie asked the groom -- a young man who occasionally worked for the family -- what the name of his bride was, he didn't know. ''The woman is not a doormat,'' Carrie summed up the message they would instill, and listed the biblical heroines and Gospel teachings that would inspire the Samburu to change. 
 There were, for the Mapleses, limits to how high women should be elevated. Both Rick and Carrie told me that it would ''sit strange'' for women to hold the highest positions in any church, whether Kenyan or American. Still, amid the Samburu culture, the Mapleses could seem to be not only Christian crusaders but also bold and progressive social activists, champions of female emancipation and sexual fulfillment.
 But what sacrifice might their work require from the two girls closest to them? Rick and Carrie saw their mission with the Samburu taking years and years, and while Stephanie had just begun asking to be dropped off to play with the small children of one of the Mapleses' guards, Meghan wasn't sure how long she could endure her isolation in Kurungu. We talked one day in the little round outbuilding that serves as her schoolroom. Maps -- of Africa, of the world -- were taped to the walls. A white-painted bookcase held ''The Red Badge of Courage'' and ''To Kill a Mockingbird.'' It held the same series of history books that my kids, who are close to Meghan's age, used in a secular private school in Brooklyn. And it held a science textbook called ''Exploring Creation With General Science,'' which urged its readers to ''remember to give glory to the One who authored nature.'' A lone table stood beneath a small window, and there, in a patch of light, Meghan sat for a few hours each morning, side by side with her mother to study most of her subjects, and with her father to learn math.
 And Rick was right. She was thriving: getting a high five from her father as she fielded his geometry questions; smiling with her mother over their mutual uncertainty about obscure points of grammar; and learning, every time she bounded, in her confident way, out of her house, more about the world than my expensively schooled kids could begin to imagine.
 But Rick and Carrie knew as well that she was struggling. After their last home leave, after she went to public school near Danville for half of fifth grade, when it was time to return to her African life she ''cried and cried and begged not to come back,'' Carrie said. Rick acknowledged that he had been -- and still was -- concerned. ''But we wanted to give God the opportunity to work with us in the rough times.''
 With her long blond hair and layers of beads, with her face that held Carrie's angles and Rick's frequent smile, Meghan told me, ''I'm pretty much a typical kid.'' She talked about shopping for clothes at the mall back in California. She talked about how she thought longingly of the dances and proms and middle- and high-school graduations that she would miss over the coming years. She talked about her mixed feelings over the likelihood that another AIM family, with kids around her age, would be sent to join them, to live in Kurungu. She'd had glimpses of missionaries who lived not at all as the Mapleses did but in large, insular mission stations, where the children spent most of their time with other mission kids. She didn't want a life even slightly like that. Full of energy and interest, she wanted to be forced out into the culture, no matter how alien she felt. Yet she couldn't help wishing for the other family's arrival.
 ''Sometimes I have these breakdowns,'' she said, making an agonized sound. Quickly, she recovered: ''I feel really, really blessed.'' Then she talked about the hall lockers her friends from fifth grade were given as they moved up to middle school without her, and about the Samburu language that, after more than a year of trying, she worried she could not learn. She'd learned Kalenjin and a fair amount of Swahili, but despaired that she might not have enough room within her brain or strength to learn one more language.
 ''It seems like there's not any girls my age,'' she went on. ''Most of them are off in the bush.'' She'd developed a crush, though, on a young moran. ''But I wonder about what would happen -- I'm one to think ahead, people might laugh at that, but that's the way I am -- if it was serious. If we got married, would we have a Samburu wedding? What continent would we live on? I don't know what would happen. He would want to go this way and I would want to go that way.''
 Thriving; cut off; confused and frightened by the prospect of spending the months and years of her growing up in a place that was not hers -- ''I'm praying,'' she said, ''that something's going to happen to make me feel that I'm where I should be.'' 
 As the American missionary presence in Africa gained strength in the early 20th century, Protestant missionaries began working to end female circumcision. In Kenya, AIM was prominent within the campaign, which stirred sometimes violent resistance among Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu. In 1930, an AIM missionary was murdered in her bed; by some accounts, her killers circumcised her. The Kikuyu fight to protect the ritual, which many saw as essential to their culture, helped to spur their struggle against colonial rule and led, in part, to the warfare -- filled with atrocities on both sides -- that eventually drove the British from Kenya.
 Yet the campaign has had a legacy of some success. Unicef estimates that 32 percent of Kenyan women have been circumcised. National law now forbids the circumcision of any girl younger than 17 and allows it, after that, only by the woman's choice. Still, the law goes unenforced; among tribes like the Samburu, few families abide by it.
 The Mapleses can't be sure that even Samburu women want an end to the practice. The men, who explain the cutting as a way to keep their wives faithful, certainly don't. Carrie has scarcely raised the issue with the women. She told me she had broached the subject only once, with her housekeeper, who let out a sound of horror at learning that Carrie was uncircumcised. (Though I managed to find a female translator, my own conversation on the topic with three women wasn't exactly freewheeling: they smiled and gave their repeated approval. ''It is Samburu,'' they said. ''It is tradition.'') But in the attendance of women at their services, Rick and Carrie see a hint that the women feel oppressed by their traditions and that they yearn for change.
 It was almost impossible, as an outsider, not to think about the state of the Samburu women the way Rick and Carrie do. It was almost impossible not to wish for transformation. Yet it was hard for me not to wonder how much change the culture could, or should, bear. For it was hard to miss what the Samburu have. All across Africa, I had heard cries of desperation, cries for Western rescue. But even in a season of drought, with the threat that livestock would start to die, I heard nothing like this from the Samburu.
 The people seemed, as much as the people of any culture can, satisfied with their lives. Their satisfaction was expressed not only in the pleas they didn't make but also in the praise they gave themselves. They talked about communal land, shared among the tribe's herds, and about communal lives. ''In your home,'' one man, who had returned to Kurungu for a break from his job as a policeman in Nairobi, explained to me, ''you say, this is my bed. If a Samburu walks from here all the way through the mountains, any place he sees a hut, the mat inside will be his. To share, to sleep next to the others. There is always a place. We don't have, this is my bed.''
 For simple dearth, for lack of modern ease, no village in Sierra Leone or Sudan, Liberia or Congo surpasses existence in Kurungu. Yet abjection didn't suffuse the air. The cramped, dark huts; the brilliant clothes and beads; the clack of the wooden animal bells -- this was life as the Samburu had long lived it. 
 ''Yes,'' Rick said, when I asked if he worried that the reverberations of the spiritual and earthly changes he desired might disrupt or even destroy the entire culture. ''We're trying to minimize that danger.'' The Samburu, he said, would see their communal values reflected in the message of the Gospels, so that Christianity would bring not only transformation but also affirmation. ''But I won't argue against the fact that I'm using my truth to affect Samburu culture.'' 
 And when I asked, Rick and Carrie said that they felt ''a huge concern'' about race: they didn't want to be the great white missionaries bringing the great savior to the black man. (Inevitably, though, this old image hovers behind American mission work on the continent. Probably fewer than 450 of the American missionaries in Africa are African-American, according to Jim Sutherland, director of the Reconciliation Ministries Network.) Rick spoke about developing -- and leaving behind when he and his family are gone from Kurungu -- Samburu mission leadership, Samburu ''ownership'' of the Christian faith. 
 On my last day with the Mapleses, Rick and Meghan and I set out with Andrea and another Samburu, Lemarakwe Lepulelei, to climb one of the faces of Mount Nyiru. We started in the predawn darkness and made our way up as the light rose. Baboons chortled and barked. Lemarakwe pointed out white specks in the distance, a herd of cattle being led by moran in search of any bit of pasture they could find. He told about plumes of steam that sometimes rose from one of the peaks above us for long periods, steam that was a sign of Ngai. 
 We reached a high knob by late morning. Lemarakwe's home was here, a few slanting huts, the ground between them covered completely in goat dung. The wind blew fiercely, unblocked; we could see in all directions: to Lake Turkana, the biggest desert lake in the world, and to all the ridges of the sacred mountain. Rick stood gazing toward the farthest ridge, the farthest peak. He stood at a precipice, and with his brush of gray hair and narrowed blue eyes he looked almost as fierce and unstoppable as the wind. I could hear, in my mind, a question he asked as we talked a few days earlier: ''Is there such a thing as truth with a capital T?'' For him, the answer was plain. Now he said that every week he wanted to make long climbs like this, to learn the paths and pastures and peaks, to know the herders' routes and the cliffside dwellings, to know Nyiru itself. He didn't want his mission limited to the manyattas in the valley. He would bring the Truth up into the mountain.

HEADLINE: The Fed Signals a Zig (Or a Zag) 

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve signaled the beginning of the end of its long run of raising interest rates when it indicated earlier this month that further increases would depend more and more on concrete evidence of inflationary pressure. As Fed policy makers prepare to meet this week, Wall Street is wondering whether the end of the end is at hand. 
 Anthony Karydakis, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, thinks not. Another increase in the federal funds rate on Tuesday, to 4.5 percent, ''is a foregone conclusion,'' he said, but he anticipates little conclusion of any kind in the message accompanying the move.
''I would expect it to be relatively wide open to all possibilities down the road,'' Mr. Karydakis said. Referring to Ben S. Bernanke, who is to replace Alan Greenspan at the Fed's helm, he said that ''they wouldn't want to tie the incoming chairman's hands to a particular policy; they will want to give the new guy a clean slate.''
 The economy will travel a very short distance down that road before Fed officials get an important sign of its health: the January jobs report, due Friday. Mr. Karydakis warns that net creation of significantly more jobs than the 248,000 forecast in a Bloomberg News poll of economists may prompt selling in stock and bond markets.
 The number would have to undershoot by a much bigger margin -- say, 70,000 below the consensus -- to lift stocks and bonds, he said. Job growth has been so strong that it will take a great deal to persuade investors that it is abating, he explained.
 ''We have been seeing steadily growing signs that labor markets are beginning to tighten, and the Fed has acknowledged that,'' Mr. Karydakis said. If job creation continues to be robust, keeping the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent or moving it a tick lower, he said, ''the economy will start bumping up against capacity constraints.''
 That could persuade the Fed to raise rates once or even twice more after this week, he said. ''They're getting closer to the end of the cycle,'' he said, ''but I don't think this move will be the end.''

DATA WATCH -- Other economic reports this week include measures of December personal income and spending, due Monday. The Bloomberg poll anticipates increases of 0.4 percent in income and 0.7 percent in spending.
 On Tuesday, the Conference Board will report its reading of January consumer confidence. A climb in that measure, to 104.7 from 103.6 in December, is expected.

HEADLINE: 10 Enron Players: Where They Landed After the Fall

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
KENNETH L. LAY and his second in command, Jeffrey K. Skilling, were the public faces of Enron, painting a rosy picture of strong profits and healthy businesses. But as the facts began to tumble out, in the fall of 2001, the company swiftly collapsed, taking with it the fortunes and retirement savings of thousands of employees. 
 Tomorrow is the first day of the trial of Mr. Lay, who as founder and chairman is accused of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, and Mr. Skilling, his chief executive, who faces dozens of counts, including fraud, conspiracy and insider trading.
While they are probably the best known of the Enron characters, there were many others who played supporting roles. Some have admitted to helping artificially increase profits and hide losses and debts. Others tried to blow the whistle on the deceptions. 
 Some have moved on to other jobs and new chapters in their lives, while others continue to spend their days mired in their legal fights.
 Here are 10 of the major figures and where they are now. 

Lou Lung Pai
A Big Stock Seller, With a Taste for Glitter
 Lou Lung Pai headed several divisions at Enron, including Enron Energy Services, which sold contracts to provide natural gas and electricity to companies for long periods. Born in Nanjing, China, he emigrated with his parents to the United States when he was 2. He earned a master's degree in economics at the University of Maryland and worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission before joining Enron in 1986.
 Regarded by colleagues as prickly, Mr. Pai (pronounced ''pie'') was also known for running up large bills on the company expense account at strip clubs. His affair with an exotic dancer ended his marriage in 1999, and he sold most of his Enron shares to settle the divorce. Mr. Pai's take, more than $271 million, is the largest of any former Enron employee and has made him the target of several shareholder lawsuits. 
 Mr. Pai, who resigned from the company six months before it filed for bankruptcy protection, has been questioned by federal prosecutors and S.E.C. investigators but has not been charged with wrongdoing. Through his lawyers, he has said he was not involved in promoting Enron stock and denies knowledge of any illegal, off-the-books accounting. His name appears on a list of potential witnesses for the defense in the trial of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling. 
 Mr. Pai married the woman with whom he had the affair, and they live with their daughter in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, where they also have a stable for breeding and training dressage horses. Until he sold it last year, Mr. Pai owned a 77,500-acre ranch in southern Colorado, which was the subject of several lawsuits over access and grazing rights. KATE MURPHY

HEADLINE: An Earthbound Outsider As Commercial Developer

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
RESIDENTIAL real estate in New York sometimes seems as if it is dominated by high-profile women. But in commercial real estate, women hardly take center stage. The biggest players are men, and often they are from real estate families that have been around for many decades. 
 In this environment, Veronica W. Hackett is quite an exception. Seven years ago, she was a co-founder of the Clarett Group, a development company that now has 35 employees. As a developer, she acknowledges, she is in a small group of women. ''I'm very visible,'' said Ms. Hackett, 60. ''There aren't many female developers, and not very many who do the sort of scale that we have been able to do.''
Ms. Hackett observed that being a woman in the industry has been a far smaller handicap -- ''I'm very conscious of a double standard, but I never felt it held me back'' -- than not bearing a well-known real estate surname like Rudin or Resnick. ''As an outsider trying to break in, it's the equivalent of a glass ceiling,'' she said. 
 She goes by the somewhat androgynous nickname Ronne, though her regal-sounding given name, Veronica, seems more appropriate. Swathed in elegant green silk at a recent power-networking reception before the annual banquet of the Real Estate Board of New York, she did not work the room so much as hold court, with poise and grace, amid the swirl of tuxedos.
 The company has developed apartment buildings encompassing 600,000 square feet since its inception in 1999, with an additional 1.6 million on the way. Completed are three luxury rental buildings and one condominium building in Manhattan. Three more Manhattan condo projects are in the works -- Chelsea House at 130 West 19th Street, Sky House at 11 East 29th Street, and Place 57 at 207 East 57th Street -- and a fourth is in the planning stages in Brooklyn.
 Last year, The Real Deal, a real estate trade publication, named Clarett the 15th-largest developer in Manhattan, based on units completed since 2000 and units in the immediate pipeline. But Ms. Hackett takes pains to distinguish herself from the ''stereotype of real estate developers being deal junkies.'' Though Clarett recently expanded its operations to Washington, D.C., and Southern California, where she is doing a large rental and retail development on a resurgent stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, she plans to initiate only about two new projects a year in each market.
 Ms. Hackett approaches her work much like downhill skiing, which she took up at the age of 50. ''I'm not into speed; I've never been a daredevil,'' said Ms. Hackett, who dons a helmet on the slopes and sticks to medium-challenging runs. ''I don't want to break my leg. People who do a bunch of jumping are out of their minds to me.''
 But, as she and others are quick to point out, she is no shrinking violet. ''She spends a lot of time identifying the risks, vetting them and mitigating them,'' said Steven A. Kohn, president of the Sonnenblick-Goldman Company, a financing adviser of Clarett. ''But she's not afraid of them.''
 The eldest of seven children, Ms. Hackett had an upper-middle-class life growing up in Vero Beach, Fla., where she said social lives tended to revolve around Friday night football. An avid but not great athlete herself, ''I was the girl in high school who could understand what the referee was signaling at the football game,'' she said.
 In the mid-1960's, she attended the College of Notre Dame of Maryland, where she quickly abandoned her math major as ''too theoretical.'' Thinking of becoming a lawyer, she majored in economics and history instead. She spent her first postgraduate year in a desk job as an economic analyst for the C.I.A., tracking Vietnam troop movements and rice shipments. 
 Growing bored after a year, she moved to New York and worked as an administrative assistant to the head of corporate finance in the investment banking division of a small brokerage house. At night, she earned her M.B.A. at New York University.
 Over the next dozen or so years, she worked as part of the first wave of women to learn the finance ropes in the real estate divisions of Citibank and Chemical Bank. (''Knowing a lot about sports served me very well in my early days,'' she said.)
 In 1983, with 13 years of finance experience, she became a top executive at the Park Tower Realty Corporation, a small but prominent developer of office space and the original designated developer of the Times Square redevelopment district. She handled financing, leasing and marketing and met her future business partner, Neil Klarfeld, who ran construction and property management. 
 She quit amid the recession of the early 90's and an ever-more-grueling international travel schedule that ate into her time with her son, Geoff, then 10. She took two jobs over the next several years that kept her closer to home even as her marriage to an investment banker disintegrated.
 A lunch with a friend and her former colleague, Mr. Klarfeld, changed her career course. The mutual friend ''looked at us and said, 'What are you guys doing?' '' Ms. Hackett recalled. '' 'You love working together; you spent all those years working for someone else; you should be working together.' '' 
 The name Clarett evolved from Mr. Klarfeld's fondness for wine and a combination of their two surnames. In their new business, established in 1999, Ms. Hackett was ''the outside person'' handling marketing, sales and the financial relationships. Until he died of cancer in 2004 at age 60 -- ''a horrible loss,'' Ms. Hackett said repeatedly -- Mr. Klarfeld handled construction issues, and each partner had a hand in design. Neither was wealthy, however. That forced them to think creatively about how to finance their capital-intensive business. 
 ''Most real estate projects are financed deal by deal,'' she said. ''We didn't want to be in the business of doing just one development a year. If we really wanted to be in development, we needed a capital partner that would do multiple projects with us.''
 A investment fund managed by Fidelity Investments financed the first rental project, and Post Properties, a real estate investment trust based in Atlanta, financed the next two. Then Clarett entered into a joint venture with Prudential, forming Clarett Capital, which buys the sites, does the design work and then brings in other partners -- like the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group -- on a deal-by-deal basis. 
 Her pragmatic approach to financing is reflected in other contexts, large and small.
 On her desk sits a designer stainless steel bowl given to her by her second husband, an entrepreneurial scientist whom she married two years ago. It contains an assortment of good-for-you chocolate bars called CocoaVia as well as disposable chargers for her cellphone and BlackBerry. (Her infrequent use of cellphones ensures that they are often lifeless when needed.) 
 For her own company, she prefers to sublease space because the rent is cheaper than leasing directly, leaving Clarett more to pay out in bonuses. The company is in its second office, with 8,000 square feet, at 15 East 26th Street, and will soon jump to 12,000 square feet in its third sublet, in the same Madison Square Park neighborhood. 
 Currently, about 40 percent of Clarett's profits go to its executives. In this way, Ms. Hackett hopes to perpetuate a ''nonfamily family'' atmosphere in a segment of the real estate industry dominated by generations of inherited wealth, in which it can be difficult for outsiders to advance. 
 Ms. Hackett's formula as a developer often involves finding sites in transitional neighborhoods like the area above the Upper West Side, in the low 100's, and East 29th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues and gently ''value engineering'' the project into the solidly black.
 The decidedly earthbound developer exhibited a bit of fatigue with the hyperbole of promoting residential real estate. These days, she said: ''Everything is iconic. We're branding architects in the same way that Godiva branded chocolate 20 years ago.'' It's becoming increasingly difficult to create the next new thing, she observed. 
 Instead, she concentrates on creating high-end kitchens and bathrooms, and using original artwork in handrails, planters, window etchings and lobbies. She tries, she said, to make design decisions that have a big payoff. On the roof of the Chelsea House development, for example, deciding whether to make a private garden for one or two apartments, or a rooftop garden for everybody, she took the populist approach.
 Now everyone can get some sun in the grass.

HEADLINE: Unions Pay Dearly for Success

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
WANT to hear some good news for the labor movement? The percentage of American workers who are union members remained almost steady in the private sector last year. 
 The bad news is that the figure stood at 7.8 percent -- less than a third of the rate of the early 1970's.
Even worse for labor, the rate of unionization has further to fall, according to most labor economists and experts in industrial relations. ''In the immediate future, unions will carry on shriveling in the private sector,'' said Richard Freeman, a professor of economics at Harvard. 
 While union leaders attribute the weakness to everything from insufficient organizing vigor to a hostile political environment, unions, in a way, are victims of their own success. They have obtained better wage and benefit packages for workers, and in an increasingly competitive business world, that is working against them. Businesses in some competitive industries cannot afford unions. 
 In the United States, unions may have done their job only too well. Last year, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector workers who were members of unions typically made 23.1 percent more per week than their nonunion colleagues, up from a 22.4 percent premium in 2004.
 In a recent study, David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth, and Alex Bryson, a researcher at the Policy Studies Institute in Britain, found that this wage premium was higher in the United States than in most other big industrial countries -- including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Britain and New Zealand. 
 This success is coming at a steep price. The high premium, Mr. Bryson said, ''could well be why management is particularly anti-union in the U.S.''
 Pressured by increasing competition from producers in cheap labor markets like China and nonunion rivals at home, businesses are resisting unions with an increasing fervor. Union organizing has plummeted. 
 The number of representation elections in American workplaces has declined sharply. And the share of these elections won by unions is down to about half, from more than 70 percent in the 1950's. And even as employment in nonunion businesses has grown, union jobs have disappeared. Companies either moved them overseas or, overwhelmed by competition, eliminated the work entirely. 
 ''The more competitive a market the more limited is unions' bargaining power and ability to organize,'' said Barry T. Hirsch, a professor of economics at Trinity University in San Antonio. ''Unions raise wages and so reduce profits. This is less and less feasible the more competitive the environment.'' 
 Consider the ailing auto industry. In the past two months, the top two American automakers announced plans to cut some 60,000 jobs, most of them union positions. That's roughly the number of nonunion jobs created in the American transplants of the German, Japanese and Korean car companies who are dining quite nicely at the expense of the American companies once known as the Big Three, and at a table that used to be their exclusive domain. 
 While the auto sector remains heavily unionized, relative to other businesses, this dynamic helped to drive down union penetration in the industry to around 30 percent in 2004 from about 60 percent 20 years ago. Competition has ravaged unions in other sectors. Trucking de-unionized after the industry was deregulated in the 1970's -- prompting a stampede of nonunion owner-operators into the market. Unionization in the steel industry has dropped by half in the past 20 years as the big integrated steel mills have come under pressure from foreign steelmakers and nonunion domestic minimills.
 The central problem for unions stems from a core strategy: to organize all the businesses serving a given market, and thus avoid putting unionized companies at a disadvantage relative to their competition. ''One of unions' most fundamental jobs is to take wages and benefits out of competition,'' said Bruce S. Raynor, the general president of Unite Here, the union of workers in the textile and hotel industries. While this strategy worked well when a few industrial giants had a virtual lock on the nation's consumers, it started to fall apart as deregulation and trade liberalization took hold in the 1970's, ushering in an era of more intense competition in business.
 ''Regulation in many cases put a floor under competition,'' said Ruth Milkman, director of the Institute of Industrial Relations at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''In a way it made unionization possible by eliminating cutthroat competition. In manufacturing what's changed is international competition.''
 Despite the long odds, unions still have potential pockets of growth. In the public sector, where there is little competition, unionization rates remain at more than 35 percent. Mr. Bryson said that even in the private sector, there were still industries in which competition was modest and corporations could raise prices without fear of losing markets to rivals. On economic grounds, these industries would seem prime candidates for union expansion.
 What kind of businesses are we talking about? Hospitals would be one place to look. Energy companies would be another. Or why not an even bigger prize? Perhaps the labor movement should forget about cars and focus instead on a company that has crushed much of its competition: Wal-Mart.

HEADLINE: Reconstruction Revisited

BYLINE: By JAMES GOODMAN. 
James Goodman, a professor of history at Rutgers University, Newark, is the author of ''Stories of Scottsboro'' and ''Blackout.''

 BODY:
FOREVER FREE
 The Story of Emancipation
 and Reconstruction.
 By Eric Foner.
 Illustrations edited and 
 with commentary by Joshua Brown.
 268 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50.
ERIC FONER wrote ''Forever Free'' to combat what he calls our ''sheer ignorance'' of the 15 years between the Emancipation Proclamation and the withdrawal of the last federal troops from the South in 1877. Yet when it comes to those years, ignorance is progress, a step in the right direction. 
 What could be worse than ignorance? 
 Horrible history: the distortions, misinformation and myths that passed for ''the facts of Reconstruction'' for nearly a century after 1877. In that history, Lincoln's magnanimous plan for reunion died with him, as power-hungry, South-hating Radical Republicans in Congress rolled over Andrew Johnson and set out to punish the South for the war. 
 What followed was a ''tragic era'' of military occupation, corrupt state governments, heavy taxation, wasteful spending and, worst of all, ''Negro rule'': the enfranchising of ignorant, gullible, bestial black men. All seemed lost, until the Ku Klux Klan arose and expelled the carpetbaggers, dragged the scalawags back to the white side of the color line and put the former slaves in their place. Home rule was restored, the South redeemed. 
 That's not a caricature. That was Reconstruction at our finest universities (nowhere more than at Columbia, where Foner now holds an endowed chair) and it was Reconstruction in popular novels, histories and films, most notably D. W. Griffith's repugnant classic, ''The Birth of a Nation.'' Woodrow Wilson, a political scientist and Princeton professor before he became president, viewed the film in the White House. It is ''like writing history with lightning,'' he said, ''and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.''
 It was terrible, but not true -- as African-Americans knew. ''One fact and one alone explains the attitude of most recent writers toward Reconstruction,'' W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in a blistering critique in 1935: ''they cannot conceive Negroes as men.'' Du Bois saw Reconstruction as a noble effort to establish genuine democracy in the South. His white contemporaries ignored him, but a generation later his sources and insights contributed mightily to a new history, a history that has been elaborated and refined but remains the standard one today.
 ''Forever Free'' will not supersede ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877,'' the grand synthesis Foner published in 1988. His new book is aimed at readers basically unfamiliar with American history. For their benefit, he opens with a short account of slavery and emancipation. He then turns to the struggle to determine the meaning of freedom and the character of American democracy after the war. ''The vast economic and political power of the South's white elite hung in the balance,'' he writes. So did the ''lives and dreams'' of four million former slaves.
 Landowners and merchants wanted laborers to plant and pick their cotton -- on terms as close to those of slavery as they could get. Freedmen and women wanted land of their own. They also wanted schools, churches, equality before the law and the franchise. They didn't get land. But by the early 1870's, they had achieved a measure of economic autonomy, and the legal and political tools -- especially the Civil Rights Acts and the 14th and 15th Amendments -- necessary to protect it. Black men voted, served on juries and held local, state and national office. ''For a brief moment, the country experimented with genuine interracial democracy,'' Foner writes. But it wasn't easy or pretty, and it provoked a ferocious reaction. In the face of fraud and terror, the freedmen's white allies, north and south, abandoned them.
 In his last two chapters, with the uninitiated again in mind, Foner traces the lines of race and politics that run from Reconstruction to the age of segregation to the civil rights movement to our own time. And throughout, the history lesson is enhanced by Foner's collaboration with Joshua Brown, a social historian and cartoonist. Brown selected the book's ''illustrations'' (scores of drawings, engravings, paintings, photographs and cartoons), and he wrote six short ''visual essays.'' Those essays, set among Foner's chapters, vividly show how images -- a Republican buying one black man's vote, Klansmen lynching another -- are never merely illustrations of historical experience. They are another dimension of that experience.
 ''Forever Free'' is a good book: passionate, lucid, concise without being light. But will it be a match for ignorance? The old history took hold when Northerners concluded that the freedmen and women were as hopeless as white Southerners said they were; their fate was best left in white Southern hands. Through decades of lynching, segregation, disfranchisement, debt peonage, heightened prejudice and abject poverty, history justified inaction by demonstrating that federal interference only made race matters worse.
 The new history took hold in the 1960's, during the civil rights movement and Lyndon Johnson's ''Great Society,'' when many Americans came to believe that the government had an obligation to join the struggle for equality, and that they had a huge stake in the outcome of that struggle. 
 Four decades and untold political abuse later, our federal government is again held in low esteem. Many wonder if it is even competent to do what it used to do best: wage war. I would like to think that the prejudice at the heart of the old history of Reconstruction would prevent its revival. But as long as Americans continue to see government simply as a problem, we won't know much, or care, about Reconstruction.

HEADLINE: The New Corporate Outsourcing

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
IN the 1930's, the titans of industry tried to smother Social Security, maintaining that it would, as a gentleman from the Ohio Chamber of Commerce harrumphed to a Congressional committee, ''permanently weaken the fiber of the American people.'' Three decades later, when Medicare and Medicaid were being considered, business again took up arms, warning of the doomsday of socialized medicine.
 These days, don't expect to hear such talk in many corporate boardrooms.
Under pressure from foreign competitors with lower labor costs, big companies have become more willing to pare away workers' health care and pensions, abandoning an informal social contract that existed for much of the 20th century. To do so without stirring the ire of the rank and file, companies have essentially tried to turn the responsibility for some of these benefits over to the government. Whether by default or design, government is stepping into the breach. 
 Medicare's new prescription drug benefit, one of the most significant expansions in the program since its creation, has been a boon to companies eager to trim soaring drug costs for retirees. Airlines, auto-parts manufacturers and other besieged industries are jettisoning pension plans, forcing a federal agency to finance them, a bailout that carries echoes of the savings-and-loan debacle of the 1980's.
 In low-wage industries like retailing and fast food, companies have increasingly been able to sidestep demands for health coverage in part because some workers qualify for Medicaid, an antipoverty program once only for the poorest but now easier to obtain in many states.
 Over time, Big Business has learned how to love Big Government. Or at least some of it.
 ''This is certainly a huge shift from the days when corporations lined up in an unbroken column to decry these programs as a threat to the American way,'' said Jacob Hacker, a political science professor at Yale and author of ''The Divided Welfare State.''
 Of course, corporate America is not exactly throwing in its lot with those who champion generous spending on housing, schools or other causes dear to liberals. Business typically distrusts expansive government and fears that more social programs spell more taxes. But it is also willing to accept help in easing labor costs, aid that, depending on your point of view, is either prudent government assistance or brazen corporate welfare. 
 After Social Security was created, many companies not only learned to live with it, but realized that these benefits could help offset the cost of private pension plans, which businesses had begun to create to encourage a stable work force after World War II.
 The combination of private pensions and Social Security, and later health insurance, was the basis for a social compact among industry, labor and government: companies lured and kept skilled workers by offering long-term benefits. Employees in turn pledged their loyalty. But in reaching these agreements with unions, companies also set a trap for themselves by pushing many of their costs into the future.
 Today, it should not be surprising that a major supporter of the Medicare drug benefit is the Employers' Coalition on Medicare, made up of companies like Caterpillar and Goodyear and trade groups like the National Association of Manufacturers, which was once antagonistic to such benefits. When the drug plan was approved in 2003, the companies were promised billions of dollars in subsidies. 
 Some want government to go further. 
 The chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, has urged Washington to be ''more proactive on health care.'' The automotive company, which posted a huge loss last week and is trying to avoid bankruptcy, pays $1,500 in health care costs for each car it makes, while some competitors pay as little as $200.
 ''The big irony in the health care area is that actually American business would be better off if there were a national health insurance system like Canada's,'' said Theda Skocpol, a Harvard dean who was an informal adviser on social policy to the Clinton administration. ''Costs would be easier to keep down and there would be more flexibility. Workers wouldn't be keeping their jobs to keep their health benefits.''
 That is not necessarily a common belief in the corporate world. Small- and medium-size businesses tend to be hostile to entitlements because they usually do not have union workers with costly benefits. Some large companies, like those in technology, are in the same boat. (Whether the American people would want Canada's health care system is a question for another day.) 
 This schism is also reflected in Congress. Big Business was once a staunch partner of Republicans who favored less spending, taxation and regulation, but its evolving stance toward supporting entitlements has roiled its relations with the party.
 Some of these strains are playing out in the contest for majority leader among House Republicans. The front-runner, Roy Blunt of Missouri, who helped spearhead the fight for the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, supports a more free-spending party in line with the demands of business. 
 An insurgent, John Shadegg of Arizona, was one of the few Republicans to vote against the benefit, and supports old-school austerity.
 ''You used to have a balance, where you had labor on one side and business on the other,'' said Michael D. Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research group in Washington that favors reducing entitlements. ''You are not seeing that anymore. The people who are legitimately for smaller government have lost one of their natural allies.''
 The Shadegg faction typifies a kind of simmering reaction to the skyrocketing cost of entitlements. These Republicans are certainly not antibusiness, but they are also not eager to use federal money to rescue companies struggling with labor costs.
 At the same time, the Bush administration, while voicing no regrets about the prescription drug benefit, is cracking down on distressed companies that default on their pension plans and make the government take on the burden.
 In state capitals, however, there has been a different kind of counterattack, represented by a measure approved in Maryland this month requiring Wal-Mart to spend more on health care. Some state officials across the nation, warily eyeing enormous Medicaid costs, are accusing companies like Wal-Mart of using the program as a crutch to keep their costs low.
 AT this point, federal and state governments may have no choice but to fend off demands for more assistance. Without major tax increases or borrowing, it is going to be difficult to sustain current obligations for entitlements, let alone take on new ones, beyond the Medicare drug benefit.
 ''My view is that that was the last hurrah, and that from here on in, we are going to try to hold on to what we have got,'' said Donald W. Moran, a health care consultant and former senior budget official in the Reagan administration. ''In part, that is because the fiscal dynamics of this really stink. Thirty years out, absent some major change, this thing is going to be a bomb.''

HEADLINE: The Golden Years: Travels, Hobbies and a New Job, Too

BYLINE: By ANNA BERNASEK

 BODY:
BARBARA RICE, a former high school teacher in Pittsburgh, never gave retirement much thought -- except when she dreamed of how nice it would be not to have to wake up at 5:30 a.m. every day. Then, after 30 years at the same school, she accepted an early-retirement package and suddenly found herself able to do whatever she wanted.
 That was five years ago. Today, at 57, Mrs. Rice is back at work, not as a teacher but as a bookseller on the floor of a local Borders store. ''I don't need the income,'' she said, ''I call it a hobby job.'' And she has no plans to stop working. ''The concept of sitting in a rocking chair and retiring just doesn't exist anymore,'' she said.
While many retirees are still focused on leisure activities, a growing number are returning to the work force. A recent study by Putnam Investments estimated that seven million previously retired people, or about 10 percent of the work force over the age of 40, are now back at work or looking for jobs. 
 And among those, the number of older retirees returning to work is growing quickly. Today, nearly one-fourth of all people in the 65-to-74 age group hold jobs, compared with just one in six just two decades earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Putnam's study found that the number of workers in the 65-to-74 group grew three times as fast as the overall work force last year.
 Mrs. Rice is one of the fortunate ones: she went back to work because she wanted to. But many Americans find that they have to work in their retirement years to pay the bills. In the Putnam survey, about one-third of those returning to work said they needed the additional income to survive financially. 
 According to Alicia H. Munnell, an economist at Boston College, recent economic research generally indicates that about half of baby boomers are not saving enough to maintain their current living standards in retirement -- unless, of course, they supplement their income by taking jobs.
 Americans are living longer, but every extra year of life, as well as every medical advance, comes at a cost. At the same time, many companies have shifted from direct-benefit pension plans, in which they provide reliable pensions to long-term employees, to 401(k) plans that generally give the employees the responsibility for saving and investing for retirement.
 Over all, according to Sarah E. Rix, a senior policy adviser at AARP, only 46 percent of working Americans aged 25 to 64, including part-time and full-time employees, participated in some kind of retirement plan in 2004.
 Even 401(k) participants may not be putting away enough for their old age. The average 401(k) holds only $39,600, according to Brightwork Partners, a financial services research group in Stamford, Conn. 
 Adrianna Ward, a former pension analyst at AON, the insurance group in Baltimore, knew that she would have to keep working when she retired from the company seven years ago. Ms. Ward, 74, works more than 20 hours a week at Douglas Memorial Federal Credit Union. ''I'm a heart patient, and I take all kinds of medicine that I have to pay for,'' she said. ''I'm still able to function well so I work to pay for the medication.''
 Ms. Ward had done volunteer work at the credit union even before she retired. ''I'm not sure what I would have done if I couldn't have worked here,'' she said. ''The people in my age bracket, the ones who were teachers or state employees, have good benefits and don't have to work. I worked in the private sector.'' 
 Like many older Americans, she depends primarily on Social Security. Her Social Security payment is $914 a month. She also receives $288 a month from her pension. (The average Social Security payment for last November was $879.30; the maximum benefit was $2,053, or less than $25,000 a year.) 
 Currently, 9.8 percent of Americans who are 65 or over live in poverty, according to the Census Bureau, which has set the poverty threshold at just over $9,000 a year for a single person over 65. That is about 3.6 million people. An additional 6.7 percent, or 2.3 million, live in financial stress, defined by the Census Bureau as having income up to 25 percent above the poverty line. 
 ''A major reason for financial stress is that many of the people over 65 are living only on Social Security benefits and living well over 80 years,'' said Ms. Rix at AARP. 
 Yet the future of those Social Security benefits may also be uncertain. According to government estimates, over the next 75 years the Social Security trust fund faces a shortfall of about $4 trillion in today's dollars. Worse, the shortfall associated with Medicare over the same period is estimated at around $30 trillion.
 With all the uncertainty surrounding financial resources for retirement, few people can be sure which camp they will fall into: those who need to work, or those who don't. Investment losses and cuts in pension benefits have hurt retirees in the past and are likely to do so in the future. 
 Many big companies, such as Verizon, Hewlett-Packard, Sears and Motorola, have frozen pension plans for many employees recently, saying they cannot afford them. When a company freezes a pension plan, employees stop accruing further benefits under it and many are left to shoulder the additional burden themselves.
 William J. Szykula of Clarkston, Mich., a former lawyer for the Kmart Corporation who left last year after 27 years of service, is facing this problem. In January 1996, Kmart froze its pension plan and offered an alternative 401(k) retirement savings vehicle. As a result, Mr. Szykula's pension did not realize the old plan's potential. ''I imagined I'd be more comfortable,'' he said.
 Mr. Szykula, who is married and has two grown sons, left Kmart in July when his position moved to Illinois because of the merger of Kmart and Sears. It was a point at which Mr. Szykula, at 63, might have retired. Instead, he started doing project work for Kelly Services, the global staffing company. ''Right now I'm not looking ahead to retirement,'' he said. ''I plan to be around for a while. I consider myself in excellent health, and I want to have enough money over the long haul to sustain myself.'' 
 While his decision to work is motivated partly by a desire to stay active, he said, it also matters to his finances. ''As long as I have a stream of income I can forestall tapping into other resources,'' he said.
 While he says he enjoys working at Kelly Services and receives assignments to do legal work for many Fortune 500 companies, he would much rather be in a permanent job. But at 63, he said, he has found it almost impossible to land one. 
 If a shortage of younger workers emerges, as many demographers expect, the job market may readily absorb more older people. But for now, finding a full-time job later in life can be difficult. 
 The experience of people now working in retirement can offer valuable clues for those who come next. One important lesson is that the often-heard advice -- to save for retirement -- may not be enough. Making sure you still have marketable skills as you age may be just as crucial.

HEADLINE: Once a Lone Star, Now Part of a Crowd

BYLINE: By BOB KNOLL

 BODY:
WHEN Dodge began selling its first Dakota as a 1987 model, it hit a void in the marketplace that quickly turned into a sweet spot. Larger than the compact trucks of the time, but not as brutish as the Big Three's full-size haulers, the Dakota created a niche -- the midsize pickup -- that it kept to itself for nearly 20 years.
 As the Dakota thrived -- annual sales have topped 100,000 since the early 90's -- and Americans lost interest in smaller trucks, other automakers started to take notice. Except for the lingering, outdated Ford Ranger-Mazda B-Series twins, all the compact models have been replaced with midsize pickups: the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, the Nissan Frontier and the Toyota Tacoma. Even Honda entered the midsize truck market with its S.U.V.-based Ridgeline.
The Dakota received its second thorough redesign last year, and it remains the biggest of the midsize breed. Its wheelbase is longer than its rivals' and its overall length is some 10 inches greater. 
 The Dakota's bragging rights now come down to its powertrain: unlike other midsize trucks, it offers V-8 power -- and from not just one V-8, but two. It should be noted, however, that even the strongest Dakota engine, with 250 horsepower, is surpassed by the Frontier's 265-horsepower V-6. 
 Remember when all pickups had two doors? Dodge has dropped the base two-door version and now offers two models with four doors. The Club Cab has small rear-hinged back doors that interlock with the full-size front doors. The rear doors open up to a junior-size passenger area with two tiny fold-up seats. 
 The Quad Cab has four conventional doors and a roomy back seat that can handle three adults. The rear seats fold up to expose useful storage compartments underneath.
 Either configuration is offered in three trim levels -- the base ST, the midrange SLT and the fancy Laramie -- and all versions are the same length. Thus, it's the cargo bed that varies: the Club Cab's bed is 6-foot-6 and the Quad Cab's is 5-foot-4.
 The standard engine in all Dakotas is a 3.7-liter V-6 rated at 210 horsepower. Optional engines are a 4.7-liter V-8 with 230 horsepower, which takes regular gasoline, and a ''high output'' 4.7-liter (on SLT or Laramie models) rated at 250 on premium fuel. 
 A six-speed manual transmission is standard with the V-6 and the regular V-8 but is not available with the high-output V-8. A four-speed automatic is offered with the V-6 and a five-speed with the V-8's. 
 Unlike its rivals, Dodge offers a choice of four-wheel-drive systems; both have a low gear range for severe duty. The basic system has settings for two-wheel drive; four-wheel drive with a locked center differential; and a low range. Its four-wheel settings should not be used on dry pavement. 
 The other system, optional on SLT's and Laramies, substitutes a full-time all-wheel-drive setting for rear drive. It, too, has high and low four-wheel settings.
 Strangely, for a truck with so much upscale content, the standard braking system includes rear drums with an antilock feature only at the rear. Four-wheel antilock brakes are a $495 option. 
 Mitsubishi is now selling a version of the Dakota called the Raider. It has the same mechanical components except it does not offer the high-output V-8.
 The lowest-price Dakota is the 4x2 ST Club Cab at $19,435. My test truck was a Quad Cab V-8 4x4 with Laramie trim. Currently, this model lists for $30,235 including the shipping charge. The sticker price was $33,715 including options that many buyers will want: $525 for towing equipment; $495 for four-wheel antilock brakes; $495 for side curtain air bags; $785 for the 230-horse V-8 and $75 for the 5-speed automatic; $790 for 17-inch wheels and tires.
 Like most trucks, however, Dakotas have been selling at large discounts to the sticker. Edmunds.com says that trucks like my test model are actually selling, on average, for $28,551. That figure includes a cash rebate of $2,500 that is due to expire this week; an extension or other incentives are likely.
 The test truck carried a fuel economy rating of 15 m.p.g. in town and 20 on the highway. I averaged 12.5 m.p.g., though the hopelessly optimistic built-in trip computer came up with 15.1 m.p.g. 
 The 230-horsepower V-8 had plenty of response, especially in first gear, and seemed smoother and quieter than the V-6's in competing trucks. Still, the engine felt less powerful than the Toyota and Nissan V-6's.
 This 4x4 Dakota rode better than I expected both on the highway and on secondary roads, but it still had too much of the rubbery shake you feel in the full-size Dodge Ram. And some might complain that the ride was a bit too soft and undercontrolled for a truck.
 The brakes felt good all around, with smooth pedal action and adequate stopping power. 
 The Quad Cab's interior felt spacious and open. Nissan claims to have more room in its Frontier Crew Cab, but that truck feels smaller because the view from its cab is more restricted, especially to the rear corners. Helping the view were the Dakota's ladder-style rear head restraints; you can see through their slots.
 The front seats were roomy and comfortable and there was a large center console. The split rear seat was also comfortable -- vastly better than the nearly uninhabitable jump seats in the Club Cab. The rear seats in all Dakotas fold up in one easy motion to store against the rear cabin wall. Shared with the Frontier, this arrangement is the best of any pickup, in my view.
 Truck interiors are looking and feeling much better, and the Dakota's reflects this trend. The plastics generally fit well and the colors were compatible. The center of the dash, housing the climate controls, stereo and air outlets, was finished in an attractive silver color. 
 The climate and audio controls were clear, logical and mostly well designed. But the Sirius Satellite Radio option in my test truck reduced the dial readouts to tiny numbers, and the clock assumed secondary status when the radio was on.
 Nissan, Toyota and Honda have all raised the bar in cargo box construction by coating their beds with composites that help to prevent dents, dings and scratches. They have also added tie-downs for cargo.
 The Dakota does not have these features, though it offers a plastic bed liner for $245.
 Safety features include multistage driver and front passenger air bags and optional side-curtain air bags that protect both front and rear outboard occupants. Seat-mounted side air bags are not available, but these tend to be less important in trucks, where passengers sit higher.
 Recent crash tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Dakota Club Cab the highest rating -- five stars -- in front and side crash tests. (The rear seat was not tested for side impact.) 
 The Quad Cab received five stars for the driver and four stars for the front passenger in front-crash tests. Strangely, the rear seat of the Quab Cab was not tested for side impacts even though it is popular as a five-passenger vehicle. The government works in mysterious ways.
 As a group, all the midsize pickups are significantly improved from the models that came before. But as they are getting larger, in both size and ability, they no longer seem quite so sensible. Their dimensions now rival those of full-size trucks, their prices are about as high and they are nearly as thirsty.
 The Dakota has some strong attributes. I'd rate it as quieter and more comfortable than the Frontier and Tacoma, with a V-8 engine that is smoother than their V-6's. The Quad Cab has a roomy and comfortable interior and, along with the Frontier, the best rear seat design. 
 But the Dakota's fuel economy is disappointing. The cargo box needs to be upgraded for more durability and versatility. 
 In overall desirability, I would still rank the Frontier as the standout among conventional body-on-frame midsize pickups. The unconventional, carlike Honda Ridgeline, which has received a number of awards, is certainly the class innovator.
 The Dakota makes a strong showing, but for a truck that created an entire new market, it no longer feels very fresh, new or innovative. 

INSIDE TRACK: Better, but falling behind.

HEADLINE: Seeking a Sense of Place

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL 

 BODY:
OLD-TIMERS call the junction of Marlton Pike and Haddonfield Road the Race Track Circle, but it has been several years since there has been a racetrack or a circle there.
 Of course, in a town like Cherry Hill -- without much of a history, or without much of anything else except farmland until the end of World War II, for that matter -- the bar for tradition is fairly low. In the years since then, however, Cherry Hill, an archetypal postwar American suburb, has more than made up for lost time.
With the former Garden State Park racetrack about to be transformed into a huge residential and commercial development, this sprawling suburb of about 70,000 is likely to cement its place as the economic hub of the region and surpass Camden as the largest city in South Jersey.
 Still, it is an odd kind of place, this ultimate suburb in Camden County, with no downtown, no main street, no center of gravity. Some are hoping that will all change. 
 These days, a Tyvek-covered structure is rising at what was once the Race Track Circle, and by next year the construction material will be hidden and a tower rising above it -- reminiscent of the green-and-white thoroughbred lookout that stood nearby at Garden State Park -- will overlook shoppers going to Wegmans supermarket and Home Depot.
 ''It was a blank slate, 223 acres that we and the township had the chance to develop in any way,'' said Richard Fernicola, vice president of M & M Realty, one of a consortium of developers of the site. ''I can't think of another project of this size and dimension in New Jersey, New York or, frankly, anywhere in the East.''
 When the project is completed in about three years, the half-billion-dollar Garden State Park development will have 608 luxury condominiums, 1,100 other apartments and town houses and a mixture of supermarkets, big-box stores and what is termed a town center, with several blocks of shops and restaurants.
 In addition, there will be offices, parks, fountains, ball fields, a community center and space on which to build an elementary school if needed. The streets will have names evoking some of the horses that for 60 years raced at one of the most elegant tracks in America.
 ''It will all be visually stunning,'' Mr. Fernicola said. ''The Wegmans will be brick, stately. The Home Depot will be brick. You don't see that anymore.''
 As Mayor Bernard Platt put it: ''This is the centerpiece, a new town rising to keep our town vibrant. I see nothing but good things ahead.''

Willy-Nilly Zoning
 Interestingly, the Garden State Park development -- with its pretensions of establishing a main street here once and for all -- lies along Route 70, which has historically passed for the township's main drag. Informally known as Marlton Pike, Route 70 essentially splits the 23.4-square-mile township in half and was the site of the original township hall and a mile-long warren of smaller shops built in the 1950's and 1960's.
 In what could be seen as a sign of the times, that town hall was demolished in the 1960's and is now the site of McDonald's. Spreading out from there along Route 70 came the typical suburban strip-shopping centers and low-rise office buildings -- a blueprint for willy-nilly zoning that nearby towns did not seem to learn from.
 As Richard Harris, director of the Senator Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs at Rutgers-Camden, put it: ''The core concept of smart growth, that sort of thing, there just isn't a lot of it in South Jersey.''
 For decades, Cherry Hill has long been pluck and vigor, flourishing even as many nearby second-ring towns like Pennsauken and Delran faltered. And assuming that the Garden State Park development will be a success, Cherry Hill is anticipating a surge in interest from corporations and businesses seeking to redevelop their sites.
 Already one landmark hotel, the Rickshaw Inn, a flamboyant pagodalike structure with a gold-leaf roof, has been demolished, replaced by a Mercedes-Benz dealership. Subaru of America already has its headquarters on the site of what was the Latin Casino, an oversize nightclub that attracted a steady stream of headline acts long before the first blackjack hand was dealt in an Atlantic City casino. And Commerce Bancorp, one of the nation's fastest-growing banks, has its headquarters where an electrical store once stood.
 ''Cherry Hill has always had a lot of things going for it,'' said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, who is a chief economist for Commerce. ''It is at a confluence of highways. It is only 15 minutes from Center City, Philadelphia. It had a good mix of homes and commercial properties and it was an entertainment center. It's hard to say that a suburb is the center of an area, but Cherry Hill would be as close to it as any place in the country.''

Middle-Class Melting Pot
 Since the 1960's, when Cherry Hill began developing in earnest, it has prided itself on being a middle-class melting pot, although in the process some poorer black enclaves gave way to the ranch houses and split-levels built for Jewish, Irish and Italian transplants from Camden and Philadelphia. But there were and still are a substantial number of black and Asian residents. Census figures from 2000 show that the township, whose median family income is $61,000, is 84.7 percent white, 4.5 percent black and 8.9 Asian.
 Modern Cherry Hill was essentially founded by Eugene Mori, a quirky and energetic entrepreneur whose story is as mythic and marvelous as that of any American pioneer.
 Mr. Mori got his start selling milk door to door in his native Vineland. With the profits from that business, he opened one of the first car dealerships in South Jersey. And to get credit for his buyers, he opened a bank and an insurance company.
 But his dreams went far beyond the confines of Vineland, and when, near the end of the Depression, New Jersey decided to expand horse racing in the state, Mr. Mori persuaded the power brokers in North Jersey to let him have the rights to a South Jersey license. He bought up the biggest plot of land near Philadelphia, a farm just east of Pennsauken in a vacant expanse known as Delaware Township.
 As he was planning to build a glorious track of steel, glass and stone, Pearl Harbor was attacked and those materials were off-limits because of rationing. Despite moratoriums on building, Mr. Mori secured a permit to finish his clubhouse -- as long as it was made of wood. 
 In the spring of 1942, he was ready to go, but by then gasoline and rubber were also being rationed, so Mr. Mori commandeered trains and horse-drawn carriages to bring his patrons from Philadelphia and Haddonfield. The glorious success of Garden State Park made Mr. Mori another fortune, so he bought up acres of land along the nearby highways, including a tract known as Cherry Hill farm.
 When the war was over, Mr. Mori persuaded RCA to build its new national service headquarters on the back end of that farmland, and, in part to house visiting executives, he built the Cherry Hill Inn on the front. By the early 1960's two showmen, Dave Dushoff and Dallas Gerson, moved their spectacular nightclub, the Latin Casino, from Philadelphia to Delaware Township, and show business luminaries regularly stayed at the inn.
 To house the RCA engineers and their families, Mr. Mori built the Cherry Hill apartments near the plant and, in the tree groves just beyond, the upscale housing development Cherry Hill Estates, where stars like Frankie Avalon and Al Martino moved from their roots across the river in South Philadelphia. 
 Then, after buying what was known as the Collins farm, across Route 38, he persuaded several Philadelphia retailers to help build one of the first indoor shopping centers on the East Coast, the Cherry Hill Mall. 

The Name Game
 The mall opened on Oct. 10, 1961, a spectacular success that drew busloads of shoppers from as far away as Virginia and Massachusetts. A month later, under pressure from the United States Postal Service to change the name of the township to distinguish it from two other Delawares in the state, the municipal government took up suggestions at its monthly meeting. 
 ''It's Deltown!'' the weekly Delaware Township News crowed in a headline about the decision on a new name. Well, not after Mr. Mori interceded. He had too much tied up in the name Cherry Hill. By early 1962, he had completed his mission: staid and rural Delaware Township was transformed into brash and ultra-suburban Cherry Hill.
 ''While it has been wonderful, Cherry Hill was not all that well planned in the early days,'' said Mayor Platt, who owns a funeral business in Cherry Hill and has lived there since moving from Philadelphia in 1966. ''The towns around, like Haddonfield and Moorestown, had downtowns. Cherry Hill, unless you count the mall, never did. We attracted residents and businesses differently.''
 Cherry Hill tried to appeal to the middle class primarily by providing the best public schools it could.
 ''It was fortuitous that the first wave of suburban residents had a large contingent of those RCA engineers, who insisted on good schools, while maybe other towns weren't quite so concerned,'' said John O'Breza, the principal at Cherry Hill High School East, one of two high schools in the township. He has been a teacher or administrator in the system since 1968.
 Still, some experts say that calling Cherry Hill a center of the region, the same way a city might be, could be a stretch.
 ''It is a retail center, with the mall, particularly, but in the suburbs, municipal boundaries don't mean all that much in business,'' said Mr. Harris, of Rutgers. ''If you drive along Interstate 295 or Routes 38 or 73 or 70 around Cherry Hill, you will go into another municipality, but there will be socioeconomic sameness.''
 Moreover, measuring the relative importance of Cherry Hill on the basis of population is a bit misleading in New Jersey, which has few large cities.
 ''If you take the biggest six cities in the state, they only make up something like 10 percent of the population, which is the smallest percentage in the country,'' said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. ''In New York City alone, there are 8 million of the 20 million people in the state. I'm not sure you would call Cherry Hill an economic locomotive like that, but to the extent that it is central in a suburban area in a suburban state, it is clearly representative of the area at large.''
 Vernon Hill would add an exclamation point to that. 
 In 1980, Mr. Hill put the headquarters of Commerce Bancorp in Cherry Hill when it was just another local bank. These days Mr. Hill, the chief executive of a company with 13,000 employees in 9 states, said he would not think of being anywhere else.
 ''It's always had a vibrant business community, and, at least, I think, Cherry Hill is the center of a big, big market,'' he said. ''For me, it is the key place to be.''
 In its early days, Cherry Hill thrived as an entertainment center, especially with Philadelphia's restrictive blue laws, which forbade the sale of liquor on Sunday. The Latin Casino, with its 3,000-seat showroom, brought in Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, the Supremes and Sammy Davis Jr.
 Other smaller nightspots prospered on the overflow, like the Hawaiian Cottage, with the roof above its entrance shaped like a huge pineapple; Irv Morrow's Hideaway, which was one of the first to bring in African-American soul and blues singers to the area; and the Camden County Music Fair, a tent-topped stop on the summer-stock circuit.
 The racetrack was the big engine, sometimes attracting as many as 40,000 fans on a big day, like the Memorial Day running of the Garden State Stakes, for several years the richest race in the country. But once the casinos opened in Atlantic City, the lure of betting on the horses diminished. In 1977 the track burned to the ground; it was revived in 1985, only to close for good in 2001.

Revealing a Secret
 Today, Mayor Platt says, the development of Garden State Park has the town looking in many directions for what to do next. To that end, he established the Cherry Hill Business Partnership in an effort to make it easier for businesses to navigate township regulations and permits as well as to attract new businesses.
 Ari Messinger, who is in charge of the partnership, said: ''It's something big cities do. We should be doing it, too.''
 Still, N. John Amato, the township's longest-serving councilman, who was first elected in 1983, said that one of Cherry Hill's secrets was that it has acted like a small town.
 ''You can't solve everyone's problem, but at least you can listen to them,'' said Mr. Amato, who makes it a point to be at the counter of Ponzio's Diner, a Cherry Hill landmark that opened in 1964, from 7:30 to 8:15 every weekday morning before heading off to work as a school administrator in Camden. ''Whether it is traffic from the new development or taxes or whatever, look, sometimes you just say, 'It can't be done.' What they really want is just an answer back.
 ''Keep being around and having your phone number listed in the book. That's how you make a town thrive.''

HEADLINE: CD Sings A Car's Praises

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

DATELINE: EATONTOWN 

 BODY:
LONG before Steve Levin sold cars, he worked at his family's hotel in Lakewood. After he was discharged from the Navy, he found himself at another hotel, only this time in Hawaii.
 There, while working 14-hour days and earning only $300 a month at the Outrigger, Mr. Levin decided there had to be a better way to make a living. He became a car salesman at a dealership in Hawaii, and he was good at it. A job became a career.
 After four years in Hawaii, he moved back to New Jersey in 1972 and has spent the years since then in automobile sales. 
 Mr. Levin began to question how cars were sold -- often with a hurried pitch on a test drive around the parking lot. Most cars, he believes, are sold on price, not value.
 So the entrepreneur inside him reasoned: What if a customized compact disc could be played during a test drive that would tout many of the features of a car, not just those the sales representative could remember? 
 The result is Motormouth, a set of about 100 CD's that will be introduced at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention next month in Orlando, Fla.
 Mr. Levin has high hopes for his product. ''I want to revolutionize the way we sell cars in this country,'' he said.
 At first, the CD's, recorded by professional announcers, will be sold only to dealers. Mr. Levin would not say how much they cost, but sample tracks can be heard at www.motormouthinfo.com. 
 In 2004, Mr. Levin started writing descriptions of Chevrolet models, but has since branched out to other manufacturers. His scripts now number more than 1,000 pages. 
 He has already found customers in several states, including the Pine Belt Automotive Group, which owns several dealerships near his home in Eatontown. 
 ''We're a little bit different in a world where everything is similar,'' said Ernie Marino, the operations manager at Pine Belt.
 Mr. Levin, 58, is emphatic that he is not marketing a set of CD's as much as he is marketing a concept --or at least updating it. Because of the high turnover at car dealerships, salesmen and saleswomen often do not get to know their product well enough to sell it better. The national dealers' association says that, on average, nearly half of a dealer's employees leave in a given year. So the training process is constant. 
 Paul Taylor, the association's chief economist, said of sales tools like Motormouth: ''It's good for the dealers, and it's good for the customers. It allows the salespeople to use their time in a more qualitative way than just going over the basics.''
 The eight-minute CD's list 80 to 100 features, although customers will probably remember only the few that are important to them. 
 Dealers can use the CD set as an instructional aid for new hires. ''It's a good training tool,'' said Mr. Marino of the Pine Belt Group. ''We use it for the novice salespeople. They can take a car out on their own and listen to it. And it's something different for the customer. A salesperson doesn't hit 100 percent of the items.''
 For the dealers, a selling point for the CD's is that they can be used over and over. In contrast, bringing in a sales consultant for a pep talk for the sales staff is a expensive one-time proposition. And once a sales representative leaves the dealership, whatever expertise the consultant imparted goes, too. 
 Mr. Levin's wife, Carol, thought up the Motormouth name for the CD series after she and her husband had batted around the idea for a while. ''I did not name the product after my wife.'' Mr. Levin said, laughing. And Mrs. Levin says that she did not name it after him, either.

HEADLINE: Creating the Nation's Largest Utility Company

BYLINE: By SUSAN WARNER

DATELINE: MARLTON 

 BODY:
THE energy market came down hard on Rene Batoff this month when her bill for natural gas jumped from $39.41 to $82.99. 
 Last summer, it was gasoline, which she complained was ''just out of sight.''
 Now Ms. Batoff, a widow and retiree in Marlton who worked for the federal government, is concerned that her electric bill from Public Service Electric and Gas will be next to rise.
 ''It all just seems to be going up and up,'' she said. ''It's the big conglomerates that are doing it.'' 
 When it comes to electricity, it does not get bigger than the proposed acquisition of the parent company of P.S.E.&G., the Public Service Enterprise Group of Newark, which currently serves 2.1 million electric customers and 1.7 million gas customers in the state. The suitor is the Exelon Corporation of Chicago. 
 More than a year ago, Exelon proposed a $12 billion buyout of P.S.E.&G., which would create the nation's largest utility company, with $79 billion in asserts and a service area encompassing 18 million residents in Illinois, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
 Exelon officials say the combined utility will be more efficient than P.S.E.&G., particularly when it comes to generating nuclear power, and as a result will be able to hold down future rate increases.
 But most consumer advocates say that the merger will reduce competition and drive up rates. Moreover, they have raised concerns that Exelon will cut costs, leading to potential safety problems at its nuclear plants, close a valued corporate headquarters in New Jersey that will result in the loss of jobs, and lessen the ability of state officials to regulate the energy industry.
 ''I am concerned about rates going up and service going down,'' said Leslie McKeon of Teaneck, who attended a public hearing on the merger in Hackensack last year -- one of five that were held. ''It's called 'Public Service,' not 'Profit-Making Utility.' There's nothing to suggest to me that an outfit in Chicago has anything to offer me.''
 Despite these concerns, shareholders of both companies and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have already approved the proposed merger. The final say now lies with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, which has not turned down a merger in 20 years.
 In addition to the public hearings, testimony was presented earlier this month to Richard McGill, an administrative law judge in Newark, and he is expected to hear five more days of testimony next month, after which he will offer an initial opinion. Ultimately, the board has said, it will make its decision in May, although a negotiated settlement could come at any time.
 ''The merger could result in Exelon being able to exert market power in both gas and electric, which could lead to higher rates,'' said Seema Singh, New Jersey's ratepayer advocate, who is opposed to the merger.
 A consultant to the Board of Public Utilities testified before Judge McGill that if the merger were approved, electricity costs in the state could go up by as much as $2.3 billion a year.
 As Steven Goldenberg, a lawyer representing P.S.E.&G.'s large commercial customers, including pharmaceutical companies and grocery chains, said: ''The numbers are staggering. This would create the largest utility company in the country in an area that is already paying among the highest prices for energy in the country. It's a bad combination.''
 But Exelon, to make the proposal more politically palatable, has offered $120 million in rate concessions over three or four years and has suggested the merger could lead to savings of $40 million a year that would be passed on to ratepayers. The company has also offered to spin off 6,600 megawatts of electricity -- of a total capacity of 52,000 megawatts -- to other energy companies. On average, one megawatt can power 800 homes in New Jersey at a given time.
 John W. Rowe, Exelon's chairman, president and chief executive, said he was confident that opponents of the merger would eventually agree to a settlement and implied that his company could offer additional sweeteners to its $120 million offer. ''We want to do this transaction,'' he said. ''We want people in New Jersey to be happy with this transaction.''

The Nuclear Angle
 Mr. Rowe said the driving force behind the merger was Exelon's desire to own all four of New Jersey's nuclear reactors, which have been plagued by safety problems, and insisted that the combined company could operate the plants more safely and efficiently than P.S.E.&G. currently does.
 With 17 reactors generating 20 percent of all nuclear power in the United States, Exelon is already the nation's largest operator of nuclear power plants. A subsidiary of Exelon already owns and operates the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in Lacey Township, the nation's oldest, which opened in 1969. 
 Exelon and P.S.E.&G. jointly own two reactors at Peach Bottom in Pennsylvania and two reactors in New Jersey, Salem I and Salem II on the Delaware River in Lower Alloways Creek, in Salem County. And for the last year, Exelon has had a contract with P.S.E.&G. to manage the adjoining Hope Creek station. If the merger is completed, Exelon would have full control of all four reactors in New Jersey, which together provide about half the state's electricity. 
 P.S.E.&G.'s nuclear power operations have had problems for more than a decade. In the 1990's, the Salem reactors were shut down for two years because of maintenance problems. In 2004, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission took on additional oversight of the Salem County plants and stepped up the monitoring of them after consultants found a number of problems, including a leaky generator, unreliable controls on a reactor and workers who feared that reporting problems would lead to retaliation. 
 Then, earlier this month, the federal regulatory agency announced that it would increase monitoring at Oyster Creek after an incident last summer in which an accumulation of sea grass blocked a water intake for 60 minutes before managers declared an ''unusual event.'' Agency rules say that declaration should be made after 15 minutes.
 In the face of these problems, Mr. Rowe said Exelon had the management skills to prevent future incidents and earn an additional $500 million to $1 billion over the next 10 years from the state's nuclear plants. He said the company had made nuclear power its specialty after regulators found serious problems at its plants in Illinois in the late 1990's.
 ''The nuclear power business is a terribly demanding one and seems to work best if you have a big fleet and committed teams of people who can work on it all day, every day,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''We have a team of people with a common playbook and a common passion for the work. They literally eat, sleep and drink their work. They get paid a lot of money, and they know that keeping the regulators content with the safety and the management of the plants is the be-all and end-all of their lives.''
 He pointed out with pride that the company took only 25 days to refuel Salem I in November, 10 days faster than scheduled and 4 days faster than the world record held by a plant in Spain.

What Opponents Say
 Nonetheless, opponents of the merger say they are concerned that Exelon's efficiency may come at the expense of safety. 
 ''We're not thrilled with P.S.E.&G. because they have done a lousy job of running the plants,'' said Norman Cohen, the coordinator of Unplug Salem, a citizens' group opposed to nuclear power generation at Salem, ''but we oppose the merger because in order for Exelon to make money, they're going to have to fire people, and this is on top of an already weakened safety-conscious environment.'' 
 But the biggest issue in the merger is whether the newly formed company -- which would dominate the energy market in New Jersey -- would be so large that it could charge whatever the traffic would bear and drive up rates in New Jersey and surrounding states tied into the same power grid.
 To address concerns that Exelon would have too much control over the state's power generation market, the company has already promised to sell off plants generating 4,000 megawatts of power to other companies. In addition, it said it would conduct what it called a ''virtual divestiture'' of 2,600 megawatts of its nuclear capacity by selling it to third parties, something Mr. Rowe acknowledged was a novel idea presented for the first time to federal energy regulators.
 E. James Ferland, the chairman, president and chief executive of P.S.E.&G., said the plan to sell off some power capacity should satisfy concerns about the combined company's market domination, and he, like Mr. Rowe, seemed open to compromise. ''In the end, we believe our proposal will comfortably address these concerns,'' Mr. Ferland said. ''If it doesn't, we may have to look at proposing adjustments.''
 As for virtual divestiture, Suzanne Leta, an advocate with the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group who testified against the merger before Judge McGill, said it fell far short of an actual divestiture. ''The problem is it doesn't really reduce the amount of control over the electricity source that Exelon would have,'' she said. ''They still own the plant. They're still making money from selling the electricity.''
 She says that a combined Exelon and P.S.E.&G. would affect consumers far beyond New Jersey. ''This merger would have a tremendous impact on our state, not only because P.S.E.&G. serves half of New Jersey's residents, but also because it will really affect competition in our regional electricity grid,'' she said.
 Relying on the Board of Public Utilities' estimate of a $2.3 billion rate increase as a result of the merger, Ms. Leta calculated that the average New Jersey customer would see a $45-a-month increase in the cost of electricity. Combined with an average $28-a-month increase in gas rates approved by the board this winter, the average utility bill would go up $876 a year, according to her figures.
 But Mr. Rowe said the larger company would be in a better position to build new power plants, increasing the amount of electricity on the grid and keeping rates stable. He said that P.S.E.&G. had been carrying too much debt to make that possible. ''It was handicapped,'' he said.
 The Board of Public Utilities says it will weigh the effect of the merger on customer satisfaction, reliability of service and employment in New Jersey.
 Ms. Leta contends that P.S.E.&G., which has 10,000 employees, has better rapport with customers than Exelon. ''P.S.E.&G. has a good record,'' she said, ''but Exelon's record in Illinois and Pennsylvania is not so hot.''
 Mr. Rowe agreed, at least in part. While he said that Exelon had some advantages in computer technology and in hiring women and minorities, he conceded that P.S.E.&G.'s overall record was superior to Exelon's. ''We're trying to learn from their book,'' he said.
 If the merger is approved, it would mean the end of independence for P.S.E.&G., which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2003. Its forerunner, the Public Service Corporation, was formed from the merger of 400 small companies in New Jersey, and by the 1930's it was a major utility with 100 subsidiaries in the East, Midwest and South. For much of its history, the company operated streetcars, ferries across the Hudson River and elevators that pulled horse carts up the Palisades. In 1980, it sold its transportation holdings to New Jersey Transit.
 Mr. Ferland emphasized that Exelon planned to keep the headquarters of P.S.E.&G. in Newark, although if the merger went through, the headquarters of the combined company would be in Chicago and the management of P.S.E.&G.'s nuclear operations would be folded into Exelon's nuclear division in Pennsylvania.

Prospects for the Future
 Mr. Cohen of Unplug Salem said he would miss the utility. ''P.S.E.&G., for all its faults, is a local New Jersey company, and we, as watchdogs, were able to communicate with the different nuclear officers at Salem and talk about our concerns,'' he said. ''Now we're dealing with a huge company, whose headquarters is in Illinois, that has chosen not to communicate with us.''
 When the merger was first proposed, Exelon said it planned to trim 1,500 jobs from the combined companies, and Mr. Ferland said that since then, retirement incentives and a freeze on hiring had brought unemployment down by a total of 800 jobs.
 ''Nobody likes to eliminate jobs,'' he said, ''but I doubt the customers of our companies would want us to keep employees on the payroll that we don't need to provide high levels of service.''
 While the Board of Public Utilities has yet to rule on the merger, it has issued an order that Exelon and P.S.E.&G. must prove that the deal will not harm New Jersey and that it will actually benefit utility customers. That standard has been used in some telecommunications mergers, but this is the first time it has been used in a utility case.
 Despite nearly three weeks of hearings and contentious arguments, Mr. Rowe said he was betting that a settlement would be worked out. Mark Sadeghian, a utility analyst at Morningstar, the mutual-fund research company, agreed. ''Odds are it's going to happen,'' he said. 
 And while Ms. Singh, the ratepayer advocate, remains opposed to the merger, she outlined possible concessions, including the elimination of $70 million in severance payments for the top 35 officials at P.S.E.&G. and a demand that the utility's 16 walk-in centers throughout the state remain open for at least 10 years.
 Still, Mr. Goldenberg, the lawyer representing P.S.E.&G.'s large commercial customers, said he was not sure there would be a settlement this time. ''This one is different,'' he said. ''They have not proven their case. We believe there's no basis for the B.P.U. to rule favorably for them.''
 And this time, he said, the stakes are huge.
 ''The big picture of all of this is we're creating a market structure that will survive our entire adult life,'' he said. ''If we get it wrong, the potential impact on the economy and customers of all sizes could be dramatic.''
 As for Ms. Batoff, the utility customer in Marlton, she said big companies usually get what they want and she suspects her future electric bills may come by way of Chicago. ''I always feel that if they're going to do it, they're just going to do it,'' she said. ''After that, we'll just have to see what happens.''

HEADLINE: Insight, at Last, on Immigration

 BODY:
Ignorance is the death of good public policy. Conscientious elected officials know this all too well; it is their job to immerse themslves in budget projections, environmental-impact statements and cost-benefit analyses.
 That is one reason why it is irksome, though not terribly surprising, that an issue that has consumed many parts of the country in recent years -- illegal immigration -- has simmered largely within an information vacuum.
Particularly in the New York suburbs, where so much attention has been focused on day laborers from Latin America, the discourse has been a frustrating battle of generalities wrapped in a fog of abstraction. Those who consider day laborers a menace tend to become worked up over aesthetics (crowds of guys at the 7-Eleven are a visual blight) and political philosophy (to witness a truly intense discussion of citizenship, national sovereignty and property rights, attend a town-hall meeting on day laborers sometime). 
 Those who speak up for day laborers often fall back on general appeals to compassion and an instinctive sympathy for the hard-working little guy. But nobody, except for members of advocacy groups and maybe a few committed cops, bothers to get to know many day laborers, who know their place in this economy and society: underground. 
 Last week, however, brought news of a good first start toward a better understanding of the day-laborer phenomenon. University researchers released the first nationwide study of day laborers, based on interviews with 2,660 workers at 264 hiring sites in 20 states and the District of Columbia. 
 The study affirmed that day labor is an entrenched national trend, and that three-fourths of day laborers are here illegally. While that is not surprising, the researchers also said they were disturbed at how treacherous the occupation was -- that the prevalence of wage violations was ''incredibly high'' and that dangerous job conditions were rampant. More than half of those surveyed said they had been cheated out of wages in the previous two months, and 60 percent said they had lost a week or more of work because of injuries.
 The study suggested that day labor was only a temporary rung on the economic ladder; 44 percent of those surveyed said they had been day laborers for less than a year, while only 26 percent had been day laborers for more than three years. Though some localities responded to day laborers by cracking down on contractors, the study showed that slightly more laborers had been hired by homeowners than by contractors -- 49 percent to 43 percent. 
 It is interesting to note that the researchers interviewed only workers who gathered at hiring sites. Unfortunately, our region does not have very many of these. Some local governments and citizens have fought hard to keep them from opening. Yet the study is solid evidence that providing hiring sites for day laborers is more than just the decent thing to do. It is also a way to bring structure to an ad hoc phenomenon that has long been defined by furtiveness and chaos. Bringing day laborers out of the fringes will make it easier to enforce labor laws, dampen public anger and hasten the arrival of sensible solutions. 
 Lacking a sound federal response to illegal immigration, we are left with small-bore crackdowns, like the unconscionable jailing of eight men in Brewster this month for the crime of playing soccer in a schoolyard. Such aggressive actions may feel satisfying, but they don't add up to anything comprehensive or smart.
 We welcome a contrarian effort announced recently by Mayor David Kapell of Greenport, a little village on the eastern tip of Long Island's North Fork. Struck by the sight of hundreds of Latino worshipers at a recent Christmas Mass, he decided to conduct a census of everyone who lives in his village, whatever their legal status, so that services and resources could be directed accordingly.
 It is a sign of decency and leadership to show concern for how the other half lives. Or one-fourth. Or three-eighths. Whatever it is, it's important to know.

HEADLINE: Seinfeld It Ain't

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
IT was about halfway through a comedy show at the East Village bar Rififi when an image of Hitler appeared on a screen in front of the audience, 50 or so young people packed in a small back room on a recent Thursday night.
 ''He was the most evil dictator the world had ever seen,'' a narrator declared in the melodramatic tone of a movie trailer voice-over. A picture of Andrew Dice Clay flashed on the screen. ''He was the most offensive comedian the world had ever seen,'' the narrator said.
Image of Hitler: ''He performed crimes against humanity that until then the world had deemed unfathomable.'' Image of Mr. Clay: ''He told dirty nursery rhymes that shocked a nation.''
 ''Hitler; Dice,'' the narrator continued as the two images morphed. ''The two most important people of the 20th century are about to combine as one. This summer Andrew Dice Clay is -- Adolph Dice Hitler Clay!'' 
 At that point Brett Gelman, a 29-year-old comedian from Brooklyn, bounded onto the stage wearing a studded black leather vest and pompadour, as favored by Mr. Clay, and a Hitler moustache. He regaled his audience with a monologue that combined the thoughts of Hitler with the tough-guy, streets-of-Brooklyn accent of Mr. Clay.
 ''You know Eva's always in my ear about how come we don't make love no more,'' Mr. Gelman said, cocking his head and puffing on a fake cigarette, Dice-style. '' 'It's Poland this and Paris that. Why don't you make love to me?' ''
 ''Shut up!'' Mr. Gelman barked. ''I'm conquerin' Europe over here!''
 There's a decent chance that Mr. Gelman's over-the-top Hitler bit wouldn't play well among the tourists at Manhattan's traditional stand-up clubs, places like Caroline's and Stand-Up New York, a universe where Seinfeldian observational humor still reigns and the only costumes comedians wear are jeans and T-shirts. But among the young comedy fans who frequent Rififi, Mr. Gelman's gag was an unqualified hit, and he left the 10-foot-by-10-foot stage to a rousing ovation.
 Bars and back rooms in the East Village and Lower East Side are overflowing these days with the likes of Adolf Dice Hitler Clay: not spoofs of Nazis necessarily, but rather a wave of young and creative comics who are branching out from straight stand-up to eccentric sketch and character-based humor that owes more to ''Da Ali G Show'' than to George Carlin. They may not have created an entirely new form of humor, but collectively they form a cohesive and happening new comedy scene downtown, one with an urbane sensibility and a vibe that is different from the established stand-up joints. The rooms are small. Shows are cheap, or free. And there is almost never a two-drink minimum. 
 ''It's a really prolific time right now,'' said Jim Kozloff, the director of talent and creative development at VH1, which has employed a number of comics Mr. Kozloff scouted on the downtown scene. ''All of a sudden there's this great new crop of funny, articulate, smart, quick comedic talent that's coming to the forefront downtown.'' 
 In an effort to get a bead on the new scene -- participants call it downtown comedy or alternative comedy or, if they're feeling especially wordy, downtown alternative comedy -- I embarked on a seven-day downtown comedy binge last week, timed to include Jan. 24, a day a British researcher recently deemed the most depressing of the year, because of the convergence of holiday bills, dim sunlight and broken New Year's resolutions. 
 All told, the binge involved eight shows and cost a whopping $18, not including beer and taxis, and the laughs were nonstop, thanks to a menagerie of bizarre characters invented for the stage. 
 At a Thursday night gig called simply ''Thursday'' at Rififi, the youthful comedian Nick Kroll played a hypochondriac 55-year-old Upper West Side widower, nursing a martini garnished with a Vienna sausage, which he called a ''sausage on the beach.'' At a free weekly variety show, ''The Giant Tuesday Night of Amazing Inventions,'' Andres du Bouchet M.C.'d in the character of Francisco Guglioni -- six-time entertainer of the year from the little-known nation of Boliviguay -- and wielded an invention he called the Recordilator, which looked suspiciously like a calculator affixed to foam pool noodle. 
 There was a satire of a Christian music duo, a Nascar-loving septic tank cleaner from North Carolina named Louis Harken who had come to New York to pursue his dream of becoming a slam poet, and a character named Stanley Hope, an inspirational speaker whose claim to fame was surviving 22 suicide attempts, including a leap in front of a subway train -- at the Transit Museum. 
 ''You're paying five bucks,'' Mr. Kroll said after his show. ''We can take some chances.''
 For comedians, the emergence of the alternative scene has brought a welcome surprise: packed houses. Mr. du Bouchet, 34, who works as a secretary at a bank in the daytime and who creates his weekly show in e-mail exchanges with his fellow cast members, said he used to play to five people. Last Tuesday it was standing room only. 
 ''I've been doing comedy in New York for eight years, and I've never seen the scene as popular as it is now,'' he said.
 It's unclear whether downtown comedy is thriving as a result of logistical and economic changes in the local comedy scene, or some broader cultural need these days for laughs. The presence and growth in the city of the Comedy Central and VH1 cable channels have given comedy writers a way to support themselves without hitting the road full time, and many regulars on the circuit write for ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central and for the David Letterman and Conan O'Brien shows on the networks.
 But Mr. Gelman, who plays the Dice-Hitler character, said he thought there was a parallel between the political situation today and the post-Vietnam years that produced the often absurd character-based humor of John Belushi and Steve Martin.
 ''The world is pretty messed up,'' Mr. Gelman said. ''People are pretty frustrated and they like to see people letting out their frustrations in an unbridled way. As far as making people feel less depressed, that in and of itself is a political act.''
 Any attempt to define the term alternative comedy was doomed, Mr. du Bouchet said before his Tuesday night show, but he gave it a shot anyway. 
 ''Alternative is a catchall phrase for 'not stand-up,' '' he said.
 Aziz Ansari, 22 and an up-and-coming comic on the scene, elaborated. ''The alternative rooms give you an outlet to explore something other than straight stand-up,'' he said. ''You can do characters. I can bring a girl on stage that I got rejected by and interview her, or do a PowerPoint presentation or show a short film. The nature of the venues allows you to experiment.'' 
 The original inspiration for the downtown scene is the Upright Citizens Brigade, the Chelsea improv theater that for the last 10 years has churned out and educated legions of improvisational comics, along with several ''Saturday Night Live'' cast members including Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch.
 For years, though, there were few other places for these comics to perform. Then in 2002 two aspiring comedians, Bobby Tisdale and Eugene Mirman, decided to start ''Invite Them Up,'' a show they named after their habit of having parties on the rooftop of their Ludlow Street apartment building. The idea, said Mr. Tisdale -- an exuberant 35-year-old from small-town North Carolina who speaks with a twang-- was to have an intimate comedy show more akin to an improv night at the Upright Citizens Brigade than a traditional stand-up club.
 ''Our goal was to have a show where you could be very experimental and where the audience knew what was going on and accepted it,'' Mr. Tisdale said, adding that there was but one requirement: do something new each week.
 The show gradually built an audience, and spawned similar gigs. Sometime in 2004, Mr. Tisdale said, he noticed that small shows were popping up all over the place: a Friday night show called ''Hot Tub'' at the People's Improve Theater in Chelsea; various shows at Mo Pitkin's, including an all-women's comedy show called ''Chicks & Giggles''; Mr. Ansari is the host of a regular Monday show at the Upright Citizens Brigade called ''Crash Test''; Mr. Kroll, in addition to ''Thursday,'' serves as host of the monthly variety show ''Bar Mitzvah Disco.'' 
 Because the shows are mostly free and comedy zealots can afford to traipse from show to show, audiences can bond with the characters they are seeing regularly, adding an intimacy that is hard to come by in the constant churn of stand-up clubs. 
 The downtown scene now even has its own Boswell, in the form of a blog, www.theApiary.org, which tracks shows, comedians and comedy-world gossip. 
 In the week of nightly shows I encountered only one comic twice. Only a couple bombed, but the crowds were so forgiving, it hardly mattered; there are apparently no hecklers on the alternative comedy circuit. That doesn't stop the comedians from occasionally making fun of the crowd. 
 At Mr. du Bouchet's show, a character known as the Downtown Hipster Vampire Alternative Comic appeared onstage wearing expensive-looking denim, a Ramones T-shirt and a set of plastic vampire choppers. As he mumbled through intentionally lifeless jokes about MySpace.com, the Strokes and Evite etiquette -- ''I have E.R.A.: Evite response anxiety,'' the comic intoned. ''When I get an Evite, I never know if it's cool to respond or not.'' -- Mr. du Bouchet declared that Hipster Vampire Comic ''will suck the life out of any show.'' The crowd, many in expensive denim and rocker T-shirts, went along with the gag. 
 For all the eccentric character-based comedy, there were still plenty of straight-ahead laughs as well, a few of which are even fit for a family newspaper. Erin Foley, a comedian at Hot Tub, riffed on the most depressing book she'd ever seen: ''Vegan Cooking for One.''
 ''No meat, no eggs, no friends,'' Ms. Foley said. 
 At the same show Josh Comers, who has written jokes for ''The Late Late Show,'' told the crowd: ''My roommate's gay, but I'm not. Unless I'm short on rent.'' 
 At ''Thursday,'' Liam McEneaney explained his reasons for pursuing romance in Internet chat rooms: ''I was tired of women rejecting me for the way I looked. I wanted them to reject me for who I really am.''
 And at ''Invite Them Up,'' Demetri Martin, who recently began doing occasional comedy segments on ''The Daily Show,'' gave the audience advice on how to speed-read autobiographies. ''I just go to the 'about the author' section,'' he said. 
 Yuks notwithstanding, perhaps the most uplifting aspect of a weeklong midwinter comedy binge was the pleasure of seeing dozens of people so enthusiastic about their work that they were willing to practically give it away. That could change. As the crowd moseyed out of his Tuesday night variety show, Mr. du Bouchet said he could see himself selling tickets someday. 
 ''I bet we could charge five bucks,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Detroit in Party Gear

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
WITH its neon-tinged, Art Decolike facade, velvet rope and immaculately manicured young women in low-slung jeans waiting outside, Bleu Room Experience here in the heart of downtown would be right at home on South Beach in Miami. True, it is about 40 degrees outside, and a few abandoned skyscrapers loom like hooded muggers within blocks in either direction. But Bleu Room is not alone. 
 In the last five years the lights have begun to shine once again in the former no-man's land of downtown. And when some of the nation's most conspicuous consumers of Cristal champagne and Chloe handbags descend on the Motor City this week for the prelude to the Super Bowl next Sunday, they may be surprised to learn that yes indeed, there is life after dark in Detroit.
From their hotel rooms at the Renaissance Center, guests will be able to walk safely the few short blocks to Bricktown, the old warehouse district and home to spirited old-time bars like the Detroiter on Beaubien Street or Jacoby's German Biergarten. A few blocks in the other direction will take them to the upscale clubs and restaurants of the financial district. 
 ''Detroit's earned a real hardcore image, with the murders and crime and everything, but it's also not as bad as what people think,'' said Mitchell Jaworski, an owner of Bleu Room. Nightlife, he said, has blossomed since the extreme years of the early 90's, when it consisted largely of some Irish bars, a few rough-and-tumble hip-hop clubs and a lot of illegal raves in condemned buildings. ''There's still the craziness, but there's also a whole other part of Detroit that people don't understand,'' he said.
 When Bleu Room opened in 2001, it was one of the first outposts of cool to spring up among the boarded windows of the once-bustling commercial district around Grand Circus Park. Now, in the wake of ambitious downtown redevelopment schemes, there are moody martini lounges, opulent nightclubs and casinos, rock clubs, and restaurants serving everything from fusion to upscale soul food within walking distance of Ford Field, the new football stadium where the Super Bowl will be held.
 While many new nightspots in Detroit seem to be trying to import a sense of glamour from more cosmopolitan cities, Bleu Room preserves a sense of Motor City grit, maybe even a little good-natured sleaze. On a recent Saturday night a svelte young blond bartender wearing a T-shirt and a pink bikini bottom climbed atop the bar and shimmied lasciviously as visiting D.J.'s from Berlin, lured by the city's reputation as a capital of techno music, laid down a rib-rattling jackhammer beat. Both Lizzie Grubman and Tommy Lee plan to give parties there next week.
 Nearby on Woodward Avenue stands Oslo, an aggressively minimalist sushi restaurant that opened in 2004, featuring a chef from Tokyo, a staff clad in black and a chic dungeonlike nightclub in the basement. Young people with a bent for vintage wash down river eel sushi with $15 cold sake to a Kraftwerk soundtrack. 
 If lower Woodward is the locus of hip, then the financial district near the Cobo convention center along the Detroit River is the focus of moneyed flashiness. The elegant and funky Congress Lounge, which has backlighted alabaster walls and bamboo shoots in silver vases, opened two years ago on Congress Street. It is already a favored destination for the pretty people who like to be seen by equally pretty people as they settle into their cedar-plank salmon.
 Envy, which opened in 2000 and features a 20-foot waterfall and a shimmering brushed stainless-steel bar, lies a block away on Larned Street. The club has a dance floor downstairs and a V.I.P. room upstairs that has reeled in, according to the club's owners, celebrities like Kid Rock and Eminem.
 Last week the crowd was diverse and affluent, and the dance floor was filled with fashionably dressed young Detroiters of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent who at one point launched into a rousing version of the dabka -- the traditional Arabic wedding line dance -- while Peter Arabo, an owner, mixed Arabic-inflected blend techno from the D.J. booth above the stage.
 The splashiest new entrant to the nightclub field is the Elysium Lounge, and anyone willing to shell out $200 to $600 on Friday will have the pleasure of enjoying its sizable dance floors and undulating LED light wall as a guest of P. Diddy. The $2 million space features five V.I.P. rooms, with bottle service ''recommended.'' Grey Goose will run you $300 a pop. 
 Proud locals are hoping the coming week will shatter some stereotypes of Detroit as a ghost town felled by urban blight. ''You will never find a place like this,'' said Kristin Abel, 25, who grew up in the wealthy suburb of Grosse Pointe and returned to Detroit after graduating from Smith College in Massachusetts. ''It's got its own flavor. New York is great, don't get me wrong, but Detroit, there is something more raw about it that I really, really adore.''
 Much of the city's nightlife is driven by suburbanites like Ms. Abel, who pile into their S.U.V.'s and drive in from Grosse Pointe and Bloomfield Hills on the weekends. Music is another big draw, and the locals love to talk about the city's proud place in music history (a safer topic than the automobile industry these days). 
 ''I mean, it's Motown,'' explained Aaron Lada, 24, a supervisor for United Parcel Service and a fan of electronic dance music who lives in suburban Westland and often comes downtown to hear music. ''It's pretty fantastic, a lot of the stuff that goes on downtown. You hear the word vibe thrown around a lot. The vibe here is immense. Nobody wants any drama. Everyone wants to have fun, party, have a good time, meet new people -- and do it again next weekend.''
 Major acts like Sheryl Crow and B. B. King play the opulent Fox Theater on Woodward, and for rowdier fare there's the venerable, if gritty, rock club, St. Andrew's Hall, a converted Catholic school gymnasium where local garage rockers like the White Stripes have added to the city's storied musical legacy. 
 One recent Friday the staff at Flood's Bar and Grille, a high-end soul food restaurant in Bricktown, had scarcely launched into the evening's dinner service when the patrons, some accessorized by fedoras and pocket squares, started filling the dance floor -- and any other available floor space -- to do the electric slide as the house D.J. dropped ''Knee Deep'' by George Clinton, a funk hero in Detroit, onto the turntable. 
 Still, except for the game, some Super Bowl week visitors who are staying in the affluent outskirts may never venture south of Eight Mile Road, the dividing line between city and suburbs. Others may remain holed up in the vast, futuristic Renaissance Center, observing the city from the Coach Insignia over $44 Porterhouse steak 70 stories above the ground.
 These unadventurous souls will miss the distinctive scene deep within the 313 area code. Passing those remaining empty storefronts and skyscrapers downtown to get to a place like Elysium, there is a lingering sense of melancholy, but also one of titillation, a bit like what one feels in East Berlin: it is not exactly lovely, and it's been battered and bruised, but the wellsprings of bourgeois abandon that are emerging on the other side of the hard times are exhilarating to experience, if simply for the unlikeliness that they exist there at all. 
 Or as Sean Davis, an owner of Elysium, put it, ''It's not the most beautiful city, but it is one of the most fun.''

HEADLINE: Entering the Year of the Wedding

BYLINE: By JENNIFER TUNG

 BODY:
WOMEN wishing to marry might try to hurry the process along, slyly dropping hints about rings or blatantly pressuring boyfriends to pop the question. But not Jennifer Chung. 
 Ms. Chung, who is Chinese-American, held off her wedding plans until just the right moment so she could get married in the Year of the Dog, which begins today, the first day of Chinese New Year.
Her reasoning was based on luck, not logistics. Ms. Chung, 29, an account supervisor at Gigante Vaz Partners, an advertising agency in New York, considers the Year of the Dog to be an auspicious one for weddings. Last year, the Year of the Rooster, was thought to be particularly unlucky for marriages. 
 The reason many Chinese (and half-Chinese) couples are choosing Dog wedding dates over Rooster ones traces back to the solar calendar. The Year of the Rooster, which began on Feb. 9, 2005, and ended yesterday, did not contain a lichun, or beginning of spring. (Lichun usually falls on Feb. 4, the halfway point between the winter and summer solstices.) A year without a lichun is called a ''widow year'' or ''blind year,'' explained Theodora Lau, the author of ''The Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes'' (HarperCollins, 2005). ''The thinking is that if you get married in a blind year, you didn't look at what you were doing, and you could get divorced next year.''
 Many couples, both tradition-minded and modern, took notice, postponing wedding plans last year. (According to articles in the Asian press, would-be brides and bridegrooms in China shunned the Rooster in large numbers, often leaving wedding-related businesses there with empty reception halls.)
 The Year of the Dog, which will end Feb. 17, 2007, will span two lichun, Ms. Lau said. ''It's very lucky to see spring in the beginning of the year and in the end. A lot of people would love to get married in a double-spring year.'' 
 In late 2004 Ms. Chung's mother first mentioned the significance of the calendar to her daughter. ''It stuck in my mind,'' Ms. Chung recalled. She then relayed the concern to her boyfriend, Jay Wilkins, who had already asked Ms. Chung's parents for her hand in marriage. Fortunately he was on board for a Year of the Dog wedding. They'll walk the aisle in March.
 Ms. Lau said this phenomenon, which occurs every five years, has long drawn couples to the altar. ''Ancient matchmakers would tell parents who were paying for the weddings, 'This is a lucky, prosperous year.' '' she said. ''It was a way to draw in business.''
 It still is. Albert Chu, manager of the Golden Bridge Restaurant in Chinatown in New York, says ''the two springtimes'' ought to create a surge in wedding banquets. ''We've had a lot of calls asking to reserve the party room,'' he said. 
 Johnson Lau, owner of Highlight Studio Wedding Center, a Chinatown wedding planner, said his business has recovered from the 20 percent dip in bookings he experienced last year. ''We've already booked 50 for this coming year,'' he said.
 For other Chinese-American fiancees, marrying in the Year of the Dog is not as clear a choice as it might seem. Peggy Pei-Yi Hwan, 32, a research analyst at Standard & Poor's in New York, is also planning a Year of the Dog wedding. Upon reflection, a Rooster date would have been cause for some concern. ''My family is superstitious, and I've inherited that to an extent,'' she said. ''Part of me is relieved that I'm not getting married in a year that is considered bad luck.'' 
 She and her fiance, Geordie Hebard, settled on a March wedding, but once a date was determined, the couple was unexpectedly whipsawed by another cultural and religious issue: Lent.
 ''We had a hard time finding someone who would marry us,'' said Ms. Hwan, who was raised as a Protestant. ''It's considered a sacred time, so a lot of conservative Episcopalian ministers won't perform the service.'' The couple has secured a willing officiant for their March 4 ceremony, luckily.

HEADLINE: Hospital Land

BYLINE: By JIM RASENBERGER. 
Jim Rasenberger, the author of ''High Steel: The Daring Men Who Built the World's Greatest Skyline,'' is writing a book about America in the early 20th century.

 BODY:
ON a recent bright afternoon, New Yorkers blithely courted medical disaster at every turn. In Central Park, joggers with iPods bashed away their knee cartilage, risking futures of orthopedic reconstruction and tinnitus. Farther east, a middle-aged man gobbled a hot dog on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 68th Street -- conveniently en route to New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell's department of cardiology -- while the happy-hour crowd assembled at a bar on First Avenue to sip alcohol (hepatology) and smoke on the sidewalk (pulmonary oncology), apparently indifferent to the looming mass of Hospital Land just a block away.
 Hospital Land: no term better captures the vast medical domain that rises along the eastern edge of Manhattan, lying parallel to the Upper East Side but not quite of it. There, within an area running roughly from 62nd to 72nd Streets, and from First Avenue to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, are gathered five world-renowned institutions -- New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for Special Surgery -- all devoted to the study and practice of healing. 
Each of the five is a formidable entity in its own right; collectively, they cover more than 20 contiguous blocks, occupy many millions of square feet of real estate, and compose one of the most remarkable medical communities in the world.
 To enter the blocks of ''bedpan alley,'' as the area is locally known, is to discover a part of the city where ambulettes are as common as taxis, wheelchairs are more common than strollers, and the usual New York fashion palette of grays and blacks is overwhelmed by the sky-blues and aqua-greens of hospital scrubs. Even the trash is a little different here: a surgical cap tossed into a tangle of ivy, a latex glove draped neatly over a bike rack.
 Perhaps the most remarkable fact about this medi-tropolis, though, is how dimly it registers in the minds of most New Yorkers. Even among those who live nearby, it was, until recently, pretty much out of sight and out of mind.
 ''It was honestly never a big part of my life,'' said Judi Squire, a three-decade resident of the neighborhood who serves as co-chairwoman of the 10021 Community Coalition, a group seeking to limit local hospital development. ''Certainly there were lots of doctors and nurses in the area, and ambulances speeding down 70th Street, but the hospitals were always something over there to the east, on York. It was all very far away.''
 That is no longer the case. Much to the dismay of Ms. Squire and other residents, the institutions along York are undergoing a significant expansion that began several years ago and shows no sign of abating. Four of the five institutions are either engaged in or are about to begin significant building projects. Although some of the new construction is on land already occupied by hospital properties, much of it is farther to the west, encroaching on blocks well beyond the hospitals' traditional boundaries. ''Now,'' Ms. Squire said, ''I don't even know where it ends.'' 
 Where it ends, she and others fear, will be in the fatal transformation of their neighborhood into a canyon of medical commerce. ''Our beautiful neighborhood is going to be a nightmare,'' said Marlene Yokel, another resident, voicing the gloom that has settled over many who live in the area.
 To apply Elisabeth Kubler-Ross's five stages of grief, it would be fair to say that denial is no longer an option for these residents, but that acceptance is still a long way off. Which leaves anger, bargaining and depression.

One Hospital Leads to Another
 If the current expansion seems to cast the medical institutions as brazen interlopers, the fact is that their roots run deep in the neighborhood, all the way back to the turn of the last century, when York Avenue was still Avenue A and the tract where Rockefeller University stands was a last patch of scrubby farmland in an otherwise industrial neighborhood. Goats and cows grazed on the grasses on a bluff above the East River. On the riverfront blocks to the north, known years earlier as Jones's Woods, stood a large brewery and a lumberyard. The neighborhood to the immediate west was inhabited by working-class families, many of them immigrants from Eastern Europe -- ''30,000 Bohemians,'' as The New York Times estimated in 1908.
 The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was the first to arrive, after buying the land in 1903. The next year, workers began blasting away outcroppings of Manhattan schist, leveling the landscape and setting the excavated stone into three-foot-thick walls along the edge of Exterior Street (now the F.D.R. Drive). 
 For more than two decades, the Institute (later renamed Rockefeller University) stood alone on its bluff above the river, enjoying its growing reputation as the country's premier biomedical research center. Then, in the 1920's, the governors of New York Hospital, allied with Cornell Medical School, set their sights on land to the immediate north of Rockefeller's grounds, drawn by its proximity to the great institution. 
 Nobody would have suggested that the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, with its dazzling white walls and soaring Gothic arches, was anything but a boon to the neighborhood when it opened in 1932. Describing the new hospital as ''indisputably exhilarating,'' The New Yorker magazine declared that ''coming upon these buildings from the sordid streets around the bridge, dominated by the gasworks, is like leaving a dirty third-class railway carriage and suddenly beholding the ice-fields and the summit of a glacier.'' 
 The same could not be said of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's building, which opened in 1939, after a move from a castlelike dwelling on West 106th Street. The new structure was architecturally dreary, but the hospital, already the oldest and most prestigious cancer center in the country, added luster to the neighborhood nonetheless.
 The last to arrive was the Hospital for Special Surgery, another of the city's oldest and finest when it moved to its site along the East River in 1955. This was, at least for the moment, the final piece in the crazy quilt of medical institutions.
 From the start, the growth of the hospitals has been sporadic but inexorable. NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center (as the hospital came to be called after a 1998 merger) long ago replaced its breezy courtyards with infill. Memorial Sloan-Kettering added several structures to its own superblock between 67th and 68th Streets. Rockefeller University extensively developed the southern portion of its grounds with residential and laboratory towers. 
 But as the institutions grew, they mainly grew inward, keeping to their original footprints while linking together in an informal campus. In some cases, they were linked literally by a system of underground tunnels, still used today to transport patients and equipment under York Avenue. In the 1970's, the city granted Rockefeller University, New York Hospital and the Hospital for Special Surgery air rights to build large additions over the F.D.R. Drive -- a deal that prompted much local complaining at the time -- but even then the hospitals remained far to the east and largely self-contained. 
 So it remained for years, hospitals and residents coexisting in relative harmony, each growing more prosperous; the hospitals by virtue of their reputations, the residents by virtue of rising real estate values. Ms. Squire remembers jogging near the hospitals and counting herself lucky to live so close to such great medical facilities. ''I always liked having the hospitals there,'' she said. ''At least, I never minded them.'' But that was before the arrival of what she calls ''the monstrosity.''

The Dark Tower
 The ''monstrosity'' is Memorial Sloan-Kettering's nearly completed 23-story research lab building on 68th Street between First and York Avenues. This tower has become the lightning rod of the neighborhood, figuratively and probably literally. Though not the first of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's westerly forays into the neighborhood -- that came in 2001 with the Sidney Kimmel Center for Prostate and Urologic Cancer -- this tower is significantly larger than anything built by any of the institutions in recent years, and has stirred up emotions commensurate with its size.
 For hospital administrators, the need for the building was dictated by Memorial Sloan-Kettering's core mission: to control and cure cancer. ''I think quite frankly the big prompter was the final analysis of the genome, which provided all manner of targets and new research opportunities in the cancer field,'' said John Gunn, the cancer center's executive vice president. ''Since that's what we do, and we were pretty well full up, we had to move.''
 To erect such a large building in a neighborhood zoned for residential development, the hospital obtained a variance from the City Planning Commission. Like churches, universities and other so-called community facilities, hospitals are entitled to such variances on the assumption that they improve life in their neighborhoods. 
 Local activists insisted from the start that Memorial Sloan-Kettering's tower did not in fact qualify as a hospital, since the building will be used for biomedical research, not care and treatment of patients. To some, the potential hazards of biological and chemical work that will go on inside the building gave extra urgency to the fight to block it.
 Adding insult to injury, many in the community, even those who ultimately supported Memorial Sloan-Kettering's right to build, perceived arrogance and inflexibility on the part of the cancer center -- ''an attitude of we're Memorial Sloan-Kettering and you're not,'' as Charles Warren, president of Community Board 8, put it.
 ''I think they made a mistake in doing that,'' Mr. Warren said.
 No offense was intended, Mr. Gunn countered: ''The arrogance was more not realizing how we might be coming across. We're extremely proud of what we do here, and we perhaps fell short in thinking other people would feel equally proud. We went on the assumption: 'Oh, we've been here 60 or 70 years. The community knows us. Many of them have been treated here, and they understand how important the work we do is.' Not all of them did.''
 After more than a dozen fractious community board meetings, and eventual approval of the project by the City Council, the case landed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. In March 2004, a judge ruled in favor of the hospital, and construction proceeded. The building will open next year.
 Though this particular battle is over, the wounds are far from healed. Indeed, no sooner had the construction dust settled on East 68th Street than Memorial Sloan-Kettering announced plans to close the Beekman Theater at Second Avenue and 66th Street and replace it with a breast cancer treatment and imaging center. The Beekman, built in 1952, was one of the city's last single-screen theaters and a much-loved neighborhood institution. News of its demise made the pages of The Hollywood Reporter and ricocheted across Internet message boards, as cinema buffs urged one another to defeat the hospital's plans. But these exhortations proved futile. The hospital has nearly completed demolition work on the site, and will begin construction in March.
 The hospital is philosophical about such disputes. ''We don't want to go out of our way to be a pain with the community,'' Mr. Gunn said. ''To the extent there are issues, we'd just as soon work them out. But every once in a while, they're going to be things we can't back off of.''

Lost: The Human Scale
 That Memorial Sloan-Kettering should have become the bogeyman of development is ironic given that until a few years ago, it was the institution that had expanded least of all. And the cancer center is hardly alone in expanding now. Weill Medical College of Cornell University is completing a new center for ambulatory care and medical education at York Avenue and 70th Street. The Hospital for Special Surgery is about to build a new extension over the F.D.R. Drive. Most notably, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital will soon begin tearing down a block of handsome row houses on First Avenue, between 71st and 72nd Streets, to build a 19-story building to house employees and medical offices. 
 A stroll along First Avenue reveals what is to be lost there. The old row houses look recently evacuated and forlorn. The names of former occupants are still listed on the panels next to the buzzers. Blinds and curtains hang in some windows. Downstairs, the windows are painted over. Gone are a restaurant, a health food store and the barbershop where Ms. Squire's brother got his hair cut for 20 years. 
 Ron Shiffman, former director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development in Brooklyn and a former member of the City Planning Commission, says he thinks that the toll taken on neighborhoods by large-scale institutional development may seem elusive, but is very real.
 ''You can't quantify it, but you can talk about it in qualitative ways,'' Mr. Shiffman said. ''What's lost are connections, social networks, the places where people hang out. The neighborhood dance studio, the place you send your kid for art class. These things that create a sense of community.'' 
 Easier to quantify are the gains: the jobs, the revenue provided to local business by increased traffic, the neighborhood's economic vitality. To Barry Schneider, a member of Community Board 8 and president of the East 60's Neighborhood Association, this vitality is precisely what he likes about the area, and why he supports hospital development. ''Take a look around you,'' he said. ''This is not an enclave in Chappaqua. This is a vibrant, multiuse neighborhood.'' 
 An unavoidable reality is that health care institutions are increasingly important to the city's economic well-being. According to the office of New York State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, the health care industry accounted for an astonishing 370,500 jobs in New York City last year, more than 10 percent of the total, and has proved to be the city's most consistent job engine. 
 It's true that as operating costs rise, many smaller area hospitals are struggling financially, even shutting down. But when they do, they drive patients to larger, more prosperous hospitals, like the institutions along York Avenue. This, along with the fact that both Memorial Sloan-Kettering and Weill Medical College of Cornell University are in the middle of ambitious fund drives -- with Sloan-Kettering seeking $1 billion and Weill Cornell seeking $750 million -- makes it reasonable to assume that more expansion lies ahead.

Construction, Demolition, Death
 The drama near York Avenue is a story that plays itself out across the city every day in ways large and small -- and has done so for centuries. It's a variation of the theme Henry James fretted over in ''The American Scene'' a century ago, when he cursed the ''monsters of the market''-- skyscrapers -- that he found towering over the steeple of Trinity Church, ruining the view he had long cherished.
 The city continually walks a fine line between the past and present, between fustiness and heedlessness. ''It's the balance that's important,'' said Mr. Shiffman, of the Pratt Center. ''How do we make sure that we don't completely erase the past but we don't fear embracing the future?'' 
 In the end, maybe the reason New Yorkers can get so exercised about the dry and intricate subject of land use is that it combines our two greatest sources of anxiety: real estate and mortality. The changing of the city alerts us to our own transience, all the more urgently when the new shadow across the window is cast by a hospital. It's a reminder that not even New Yorkers get to be fit, fabulous and 29 forever.
 The good news is that great institutions like those in Hospital Land can deliver us, at least briefly, from the very mortality they force us to contemplate, providing the surgically enhanced knees, the repaired heart, the state-of-art treatment we might someday require, and thereby allow us to return to our lives and worry about more important things, like the hideous new building going up around the corner.

HEADLINE: On the Road to Arbitration

 BODY:
More than a week has passed since the membership of the public transit workers union threw New York's millions of riders another curveball -- just one month after the December strike -- and narrowly voted down the pact its leaders had negotiated. Talks have not resumed. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state-run body that runs the subway and bus system, has put another offer on the table, a decidedly downgraded version of the rejected pact. Not surprisingly, the union leadership rejected it. More significantly, the M.T.A. petitioned to take the talks to binding arbitration. That's a drastic move, but unless the two parties start talking soon, it might be the best way to avoid the unacceptable, if remote, possibility of another walkout. 
 Binding arbitration should be unattractive to both sides. It puts everyone's fate in the hands of a third party. That could be especially bad for the union because its members would be deprived of extras negotiated in the unapproved contract, including large pension rebates. 
 For binding arbitration to happen, a state labor board must determine that bargaining is at an impasse. Before that leap, though, mediators -- who worked some subtle magic to help bring about the first agreement -- should be given every opportunity to rekindle negotiations on the new offer. 
 Roger Toussaint, the blue-collar union leader, and Peter Kalikow, the well-tailored white-collar M.T.A. chairman, are likely never to have a ''walk in the woods'' kind of relationship, where great differences might be worked out over a cordial give and take. A mediator's nudge to the table could, however, at least get a dialogue started. What's needed now is a reworked contract offer that can be sent back to the membership for a vote, and soon.
 It's too bad the union cannot take another vote on the first agreement. No doubt many of the ''no'' votes were cast in protest -- against Mr. Toussaint's leadership, against management, and against the M.T.A. and its record of fiscal mismanagement. 
 But the contract was a good one, with raises better than the rate of inflation, continued retirement at age 55 -- even for new hires -- and sweeteners: a payment totaling some $130 million to members who overpaid into the pension plan, as well as improved health benefits for retirees. The rub was the requirement that employees contribute 1.5 percent toward health insurance. But while there may be a better formula, the contributions are necessary, and a bargain. Most private sector employees pay much more.
 The current M.T.A. offer preserves the pay increases totaling 10.9 percent. But it reverts to an earlier demand that new workers contribute 6 percent into their pension plan, triple the rate for workers already on the rolls. There would be no pension rebates and no paid holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. The union interpreted the offer as a slap. More likely, it is a strategic starting point for consideration by an arbitrator. Union leaders will have their opportunity to make demands, too, before a binding settlement can be mandated.
 As the reality of binding arbitration settles in, workers may feel less inclined to spurn an amended offer. The union's sharp internal divisions led to a razor-thin margin on the contract vote: nearly 22,500 votes were cast (of some 33,000 union members), and the agreement lost by just 7 votes. Though Mr. Toussaint blamed hard-core dissidents, there is an undeniable schism that could endanger the approval of any future contract put to a vote. 
 Mr. Toussaint, who in earlier days was a dissident himself, must achieve a workable peace with the rebels and do a better job of explaining the perils ahead if a contract cannot be brought to a member vote. 
 The M.T.A., meanwhile, should take the temperature of its workers, who may only feel further frustration if they are denied a final say on their contract. Binding arbitration may ultimately be necessary, but only as a true last resort.

HEADLINE: Extreme Makeover: Nassau

BYLINE: By Bruce Katz and Robert Puentes. 
Bruce Katz is a vice president of the Brookings Institution and director of its Metropolitan Policy Program. Robert Puentes is a fellow at the program.

 BODY:
LIKE some television reality show, Nassau County, home to Levittown and other pioneering suburban developments, is in for a supreme makeover in the coming decade. The county's plans for the so-called Nassau Hub, which stretches from EAB Plaza to Roosevelt Field and encompasses the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum site in Uniondale, represent one of the boldest efforts anywhere for reinventing the outdated form of development that is the American suburb.
 Yet this makeover will not come easy. Because of the usual controversies over scale and scope, Nassau's vision for stronger downtowns, diverse neighborhoods, next-generation housing, open space and expanded public transit will be difficult to achieve. (Already, the county executive, Thomas Suozzi, has put off a decision that was expected this month on which of the four coliseum site proposals he will approve.) 
The brutal fact, however, is that Nassau County and many other older, inner-ring ''first'' suburbs built after the end of World War II have little choice economically and physically if they want to survive and thrive.
 Currently, many first suburbs, which are collectively home to about 20 percent of the nation's population, are struggling to attract and retain younger residents. Meanwhile, many of these suburbs share an economic and physical landscape that is unsustainable: low densities, a car-dependent culture and housing restricted to single-family residences. 
 Nassau reflects these realities. And the question for Nassau residents is this: Do you want a future of higher taxes, lower services and a noncompetitive economy? Because that is what the county faces unless it can reverse decades of stagnation and begin to attract and retain entry-level workers.
 Once one of the nation's fastest-growing areas, Nassau is now down to about 1.33 million people, according to the 2000 census, about 95,000 below its population peak in 1970. The number of elderly residents is more than twice what it was in 1960, while the number of children has fallen sharply.
 In addition to these challenging demographic trends, the tax rate in Nassau remains very high; Nassau is tied with Suffolk for having the second-highest tax rate in the state. And because of restrictive land use regulations coupled with close proximity to New York City, Nassau joins places like Westchester, New Jersey's Bergen and Fairfield in Connecticut as counties with some of the most expensive housing in the nation. The average housing value in each of these counties is more than double the national average. 
 No wonder young residents are fleeing these places in search of housing that is affordable. (In Nassau, the median house price is more than $400,000. That's nearly five times the average income, and housing experts recommend 2.5 times as the limit for affordability.) 
 For first suburbs like those in Nassau to flourish, they need to reinvent themselves.
 At a minimum, they should focus on plans that identify important pockets and corridors of urbanity where they can encourage growth. By substantially increasing densities in appropriate places, first suburbs can create an environment where transit and greater housing options thrive.
 Arlington County in Virginia, just outside Washington, provides a clear illustration for how a first suburb can regenerate itself and remain healthy and vital, yet preserve its suburban style. Arlington has concentrated development along its Metro rail system in a way that avoids many of the problems of conventional suburban growth. For instance, Arlington's Metro riders generally walk to the stations, averting the traffic jams that result when commuters' only choice is to park and ride. 
 And despite the costs that additional development brings, Arlington's classic suburban neighborhoods have been well served by this urban experiment. For instance, the increase in tax-generating properties means that a third of the county's real estate revenue comes from just 8 percent of its land area. Arlington's tax rate is the lowest in the region.
 Arlington is not alone in remaking itself for high value growth. Lakewood, Colo.; Washington's King County; and Dallas County in Texas have all embraced transit-oriented development as a means to economic prosperity and quality communities.
 Interested civic, corporate and political leaders in Nassau should drive south down Interstate 95 to Arlington. There they will see firsthand the tangible benefits that can accrue to a place that embraces a plan for remaking itself and sticks to it. Critics will note that Arlington is not a cluster of local jurisdictions, as is the case in Nassau. But that is precisely why a countywide vision is so important.
 Remaking first suburbs will not happen overnight. It will require a new generation of government and business leaders who are willing to risk political and private capital. It will also demand a rethinking of obsolete, outdated suburban attitudes toward density, urbanity and diversity.
 So the message to Nassau: you have no time to waste. Pick a proposal for the coliseum site, embrace the new vision and get the Hub and Nassau moving again.

HEADLINE: House Costs Are Driving An Exodus

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN and FAIZA AKHTAR

 BODY:
SUZANNE WHALEN grew up on Long Island, and she knows the script: Buy a house in the best school district you can afford and pay the price of extra stress, long hours at work and endless traffic until the children graduate.
 But because she had a telecommuting job, which meant she could live anywhere, Ms. Whalen and her husband, Andrew, rewrote the second act. Last year, they sold their house in Farmingdale and moved to Bradenton, Fla., near Tampa Bay. Mr. Whalen is now staying home with their young daughter. Their property taxes have dropped from $7,000 to about $6,100, and they pay no state income tax.
 ''We have a bigger home and better life here in Florida than we could have ever had on Long Island,'' Ms. Whalen said. ''The taxes alone have made it impossible for any young family to have a good life in New York.''
 A quest for affordable housing is drawing greater numbers of young people, families and empty nesters from the suburbs surrounding New York City and casting them out to destinations near and far, according to an analysis of migration data by The New York Times. 
 The Whalens are part of one of the fastest-growing segments: the exodus to central Florida. Nearly 9,000 taxpayers from Long Island followed that path in 2004, a 33 percent increase over 1996. But the new emigres are also choosing destinations in gentrifying neighborhoods in the city, exurban communities in Pennsylvania and upstate, and boomtowns in other parts of the Sun Belt.
 ''I do think a lot of this movement -- to Florida and the exurbs -- reflects, in part, a 'housing affordability' movement, or what I have sometimes termed a 'middle class flight,' '' William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said in an e-mail message. ''They'll move as far out as eastern Pennsylvania or northern Connecticut. But many are probably looking at Sun Belt markets, including central Florida, Georgia, North Carolina.''
 Not that there is any danger that Long Island will empty out. Thousands of people are still following the traditional migratory paths, from New York City to Long Island and other inner-ring suburbs like Westchester County and northeastern New Jersey. And, of course, many continue to have children when they arrive, so the Island's population is not declining.
 But more people leave than arrive. The net emigration from Long Island was nearly 9,000 households in 2004, the most recent year for which figures are available.
 A number of patterns emerge from the analysis, which examined Internal Revenue Service data on taxpayers whose addresses changed from one county to another between tax years over the past decade.
 Increasing numbers of Long Island's young people and empty nesters are emigrating to Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The number of households that moved from the Island to the Bronx in 2004 was 48 percent higher than in 1996. 
 Middle-class flight from older suburbs to more distant communities is accelerating. On Long Island, that once meant a move from Nassau to Suffolk. Today, much of the Island's exurban migration may be occurring from western to eastern Suffolk, and thus would not be evident in the county-to-county statistics. What the statistics do show is a fast-increasing flow of migration from Long Island to exurbs in upstate New York, to Berks and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania, to Hunterdon County in western New Jersey and to Litchfield County in Connecticut. 
 Increasing numbers of taxpayers are leaving the region entirely, bound for more-affordable suburbs and cities across the country, especially in central and northern Florida. The rate of migration from Long Island to Lake County, north of Orlando, has tripled since 1996. These migrants are not predominantly retirees; moves from Long Island to traditional coastal retirement destinations like St. Petersburg, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach have declined.
 ''There seems to be a widening-out of the traditional city population (young people, minorities and immigrants), while suburbia moves further out,'' Dr. Frey wrote. ''Pricey inner suburbs are spreading to mid-New Jersey and Connecticut, and affordable suburbs for young families are populating areas that had not previously been considered in New York's orbit.''
 Alfred Cammisa, who grew up on Long Island, tried for years to follow the suburban canons, raising a young family in rental apartments in Babylon because house prices were so high. Five years ago he gave up and moved his wife, Felicia, and their three children to Monroe, N.Y., in Orange County, 42 miles north of Times Square. 
 ''We needed to think outside the box and find a place where schools were good and our quality of life could improve,'' he said. ''Long Island is not the same place it used to be when I was growing up. The houses are unaffordable, the taxes are too high, and the traffic stinks.''
 The Cammisas were part of an early wave of exurban movers that have grown into a tide. Five hundred taxpayers moved to Orange County from Long Island last year, up from 348 in 1996, a 44 percent increase. 
 The I.R.S. data show that people who move to the exurbs tend to have families. They report adjusted gross incomes that are lower than the Island average of $72,000 -- for example, those moving from Long Island to Monroe County, Pa., had an average income of $61,000.
 ''It seems to me that there is a definite trend toward moving to the outer exurbs among families from all over the New York region,'' Dr. Frey wrote. ''They appear to be low-income families at the early stage of the life cycle.''
 The trend toward the exurbs has been noted by demographers for some time. The I.R.S. data confirm that new subdivisions in remote areas are not filling up just with city people, but also with a stream from the older suburbs.
 ''Starter homes for today's young New Yorkers aren't in close-in Levittown (as in earlier generations) but really far out,'' Dr. Frey wrote.
 There is also a growing migration to the city from Long Island. The I.R.S. data show that these people tend to have smaller households than those who are migrating to other destinations. Demographers say they mainly come from two categories: the grown children of suburbia (single young adults) and the people who have completed the job of raising them (empty nesters).
 Describing this second group, James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Affairs at Rutgers University, said: ''They may have originally come from the boroughs to suburbia. Now they want to go back to where there are more activities, and Manhattan is too expensive.'' 
 Migration from the suburbs to Manhattan itself is indeed declining: the figure was about 8 percent lower in 2004 than in 1996. But the number of people heading to the outer boroughs from Long Island is growing. In 2004, emigration to Brooklyn, for instance, was 30 percent greater than in 1996. And the growth of Bronx migration has been especially steep, up nearly 50 percent in the same period. 
 ''We get some people who normally would be going to Harlem or Park Slope or Prospect Heights, and have found those places to be too expensive,'' said Glen Calderon, a real estate agent who sells property in the South Bronx. 
 Young adults have always tended to move away from their suburban roots and then return later with families. But today's 20- and 30-somethings are finding affordable suburban residences ever more elusive.
 Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Association, said: ''Many of them are single or newly married, they work in New York City or on the Island, and they're moving to Queens and Brooklyn for lower-cost housing.'' 
 ''These are children who grew up in suburbia, but they can't afford to stay on Long Island because they can't afford our housing,'' Dr. Kamer said. She noted that only 19 percent of all houses and apartments in Nassau and Suffolk are rentals, a much smaller proportion than in the city and lower even than most other suburban counties.
 The I.R.S. data show that households with incomes well below the Island average are moving out of the metropolitan area entirely. Demographers say these are mainly young families seeking a better mix of income, cost of living and climate, and their most popular destinations are in central Florida.
 The trail from New York to Florida was blazed by retirees, of course, and that flow continues, though the specific destinations are changing. Migration to St. Petersburg, a notable destination for Long Island taxpayers, generally retirees, fell by 11 percent from 1996 to 2004. But the flow to Tampa, just across the bay, rose 135 percent.
 Other Sun Belt destinations are also gaining popularity -- for instance, the areas around Las Vegas and Charlotte, N.C., each got one-third more new taxpayers from Long Island in 2004 than in 1996. But Florida remains a favorite, perhaps because it is perceived to have become friendlier to New Yorkers.
 ''There have been so many immigrants from the Northeast over the years, mainly retirees, that they brought the Northeast with them,'' said Dean Hughes of Rutgers. ''Central Florida has been reinvented as the Northeast without snow.'' 
 The economy there is strong, even if incomes are not as large. ''Florida is now a very diversified economy,'' he added. ''It's not too different from the Northeast economy. The jobs don't pay as well, but the cost of living is so much cheaper.''
 That contrast in living costs can be especially stark for suburban New Yorkers, who are among the leading contributors to central Florida's population. The top three non-Florida counties contributing residents to Tampa in 2004 were Queens; Cook County, Ill. (Chicago); and Suffolk.
 ''The 'new' New York-to-Florida migration is not just old-timers, but younger and middle-age families to central Florida,'' Dr. Frey wrote. ''These, along with movers to other Sun Belt suburbs, represent a new, extended version of suburbanization -- people in quest of a suburban lifestyle who cannot afford the suburbs within the New York area or deal with the long commute to the exurbs.''
 Linda Robinson, who bought a house in Tampa, had a hard time winning over her 15-year-old twins about the move from Elmont, where they had grown up. But with proceeds from sale of her Cape Cod house on the Island, the family was able to buy a sprawling 4,200-square-foot house, and some of the twins' friends have now also relocated to Tampa. 
 ''Everything is clean, the food is fresher,'' said Ms. Robinson, a nurse. ''And if you move there with a couple of dollars in your pocket, then you can live like royalty.''

HEADLINE: When Nimby Extends Offshore

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
DO they have to be there?
 The mounting opposition to proposals for an offshore ''wind farm'' of 40 giant turbines to supplement Long Island's electricity supply has less to do with the technology itself than with the planned location: a few miles off Jones Beach.
In fact, many critics of the plan agree with its proponents that Long Island needs renewable sources of electricity to reduce its dependence on power plants burning fossil fuels, and that with oil and gas prices so high, wind turbines may yet become economically viable and environmentally benign.
 But they're ugly, say opponents, led by a group called the Jones Beach Ad Hoc Committee. The turbines, with fan blades that would sweep to 443 feet above sea level at their highest point, would be an intrusive blight on the jewels of the Island's recreational and tourist attractions, its ocean beaches, where millions of people flock for sun, surf and unfettered ocean views, they say. 
 Sentiment among South Shore residents ran heavily against the project at two public forums attended by representatives of the project's sponsors, the Long Island Power Authority and FPL Energy, a major developer of wind energy projects that is part of an energy conglomerate once known as Florida Power and Light. 
 More than 300 people turned out for the most recent forum, held in Massapequa on Jan. 19. Opposition leaders said they hoped to organize more forums in other South Shore towns in coming weeks. 
 A similar story is playing out in Massachusetts, where a large offshore wind farm proposed for Nantucket Sound has attracted growing opposition, much of it from people who ordinarily favor development of renewable energy, like the Kennedy family. By all means develop wind energy, these opponents say, but do it somewhere else.
 The question then becomes, where?
 Could Long Island's wind project be built someplace less aesthetically objectionable -- say, the Babylon town landfill, or Plum Island, or someplace far enough out to sea to be invisible from shore? 
 The first thing a wind energy project needs is wind, steady and moderately strong. The turbines provide no power in a calm, of course, or when winds exceed about 50 miles an hour, for safety reasons. They need average winds of at least 18 miles an hour to be productive enough to be worth building, LIPA officials say, and reach peak output at about 30 miles an hour.
 The winds on the Long Island Sound are too light and variable, they say, and many suggested sites on land do not make the meteorological cut, either, including most of Plum Island. 
 Wind turbines also need a lot of room. The blades are almost 180 feet long and sweep around a central mechanism 260 feet above the ground or water. They must be placed far enough apart not to interfere with one another. Daniel Zaweski, the power authority's wind-turbine project manager, said that building the proposed 40-turbine project on land would require about 1,600 open, contiguous acres of land. 
 No such site is available on the Island, he said, except in the protected core of the Long Island pine barrens, a state preserve. 
 The spinning turbine blades are a potential hazard to anything in flight, so they must be kept away from the approaches to airports and from flyways of migratory birds. 
 That factor has kept wind turbines off Plum Island before. According to Larry Orluskie, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which now controls the 740-acre island, the government considered placing several smaller wind turbines on the island in 1998 to help power the animal disease laboratory there. The plan was abandoned because of the threat to migratory birds. 
 Mr. Orluskie said that any talk of a commercial-scale wind farm on Plum Island was premature and that it remained closed to the public and to any development other than the lab.
 The 212-foot-high Babylon town landfill, another alternative site some opponents mention, also appears to be ruled out. Vanessa Baird-Streeter, a spokeswoman for the town, said that the Federal Aviation Administration found the landfill to be too close to Republic Airport for tall structures like the turbines to be built there. 
 Getting the wind power to customers is another issue, with distance an important factor in the cost. Mr. Zaweski of the power authority said that dozens of miles of major transmission line upgrades would be needed to connect turbines on, say, Plum Island or Gardiners Island with Long Island's power grid. 
 Attaching wind turbines to existing tall structures on the Island, like cellular phone towers or the Jones Beach tower, would also run afoul of engineering or aesthetic constraints, engineers and utility executives said.
 That leaves the waters off the South Shore as the only practical place to put the turbines, power authority officials say.
 Under the LIPA-FPL proposal, the nearest turbine to shore would be 3.6 miles out in the ocean, visible from the beach in much of Nassau and western Suffolk. Each turbine tower would rest on a single piling about 18 feet in diameter, sunk between 70 and 120 feet into the ocean floor. A nine-mile transmission line would connect the wind farm to a substation in the Amityville-Massapequa area.
 Moving the turbines farther offshore would diminish their visual impact and give them even better wind conditions. But Mr. Zaweski said that it would also put them in major shipping lanes, where they are not allowed for safety reasons, or in water deeper than 100 feet, where the cost to build them and connect them to shore would be prohibitively high. 
 Still, project opponents said the power authority was rushing ahead with the project, which would be the nation's first offshore wind farm, even as new technology that would make it economically feasible to place the turbines out of sight of land was advancing. 
 FPL, which is completing its design for the project, would build the turbines and sell their output, up to about 3.6 megawatts per turbine in ideal weather, to the power authority under a 20-year contract. The average output of 140 megawatts would be enough to power about 44,000 homes.
 The power authority and FPL hope to complete construction in 2008; the cost has yet to be determined, but is sure to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
 A federal law enacted in August shifted responsibility for licensing offshore wind turbines to the Minerals Management Service, an agency of the Interior Department, from the Army Corps of Engineers. The agency also reviews applications for offshore oil platforms. 
 Though the agency is expected to speed up the approval process, it is still devising guidelines for evaluating wind turbine projects, including the LIPA-FPL project and the other major proposal before it, the 130-turbine complex planned for a 24-square-mile area of Nantucket Sound and known as Cape Wind. 
 LIPA said its project would also require state permits. 
 In Massachusetts, Senator Edward M. Kennedy; his nephew Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is an environmental lawyer and professor at Pace University Law School; and many Cape Cod residents have spoken out against Cape Wind. 
 The younger Mr. Kennedy has said that private energy companies should no more put wind turbines in Nantucket Sound than in Yosemite National Park. Mr. Kennedy said he had no position on wind turbines off Jones Beach. 
 Opponents of the Long Island project say the same logic Mr. Kennedy applied to Cape Wind should apply to Jones Beach. They argue that the cost would be too high and the power yield too small to justify the visual desecration of a national treasure. 
 They also say the computer images LIPA and FPL have displayed understate how large the turbines will loom in the view from shore. 
 Philip Healey of Massapequa, a co-chairman of Save Jones Beach, said LIPA was ''playing on the fact that people don't really understand distance over the open water.'' Though the turbines would be more than three miles out, ''the horizon is 11 to 12 miles,'' he said. ''People think three miles is far away, but over the open ocean, it's right in front of you.''
 Still, the project has broad support among environmental groups, and adamant backing from LIPA's chairman, Richard M. Kessel.
 Mr. Kessel, who lives in Merrick, said he believed there was strong public support, even on the South Shore, for a project that would begin to wean Long Island off fossil fuels. 
 ''We have got to start somewhere,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''And if we can't put these up, it signals we are going to continue to be captives to the oil barons. I understand that there is an aesthetic issue, but there are pros and cons to whatever we do.'' 
 Opponents of the turbines said it was inconsistent for environmental groups to oppose the Broadwater Energy plan for a $700 million floating natural gas plant in the Long Island Sound but support the wind turbines.
 ''They don't want to industrialize the sound, but they're in favor of industrializing the ocean,'' said Richard Schary of North Bellmore, who is opposed to the turbines. ''And if they were trying to pick the worst place on Long Island to site these things, they've done it. You are ruining Jones Beach and it's known all over the world, it's our most famous landmark.''
 Wendy Gibson, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which operates Jones Beach, said in an e-mail message that the state would ''certainly assess the potential impact'' of the project on the beach, which was added last year to the National Register of Historic Places. But she said that her office supported development of renewable energy and had not joined in objections to the plan. 
 Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment in Farmingdale, rejected the comparison between the Broadwater project and the wind turbines. 
 ''One blows up, one doesn't,'' she said. ''One is a terrorist risk, and the other isn't. One gives us clean, safe, domestically produced energy, the other gives us dirty, dangerous foreign energy once again.''
 The wind project faces opposition on other grounds besides the view from the beach. Wally D'Amato, the president of the Nassau Shores Association in Massapequa and an opponent of the turbines, questioned whether they were a wise energy investment given their cost. 
 ''They don't make sense,'' Mr. D'Amato said. ''If anything, we have to get started with the solar again.''
 But Gordian Raacke, the executive director of Renewable Energy Long Island, a Bridgehampton advocacy group, said solar energy, while promising, held little immediate prospect of matching wind power on a large scale. 
 ''Solar panels are great,'' he said, adding that his home was one of about 600 on the Island equipped with solar installations. ''But given their relatively high cost, we won't see 44,000 homes equipped with solar panels by 2008.'' 
 Mr. Raacke noted that use of wind energy was growing rapidly around the world, and that several European nations had made great strides in using it. Denmark gets almost one-fifth of its national electricity supply from wind, and turbines have become a common sight in Mr. Raacke's native Germany, which produces more than 16,000 megawatts of wind power, one-third of the world total. 
 Opponents warn that the 40-turbine LIPA-FPL project may be just the first of many that would eventually line the whole South Shore. ''This could be the beginning of the end for our shoreline,'' said Mr. Schary of North Bellmore. 
 But Mr. Kessel said LIPA had no plans now for more turbines. ''That's for a future LIPA to look at,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Insight, at Last, on Immigration

 BODY:
Ignorance is the death of good public policy. Conscientious elected officials know this all too well; it is their job to wallow in budget projections, environmental-impact statements and cost-benefit analyses. That is why it is irksome, though not terribly surprising, that an issue that has consumed many parts of the country in recent years -- illegal immigration -- has simmered largely within an information vacuum.
 Particularly in the New York suburbs, where so much attention has been focused on day laborers from Latin America, the discourse has been a frustrating battle of generalities wrapped in a fog of abstraction. Those who consider day laborers a menace tend to become worked up over aesthetics (crowds of guys at the 7-Eleven are a visual blight) and political philosophy (to witness a truly intense discussion of citizenship, national sovereignty and property rights, attend a town-hall meeting on day laborers sometime). 
Those who speak up for day laborers often fall back on general appeals to compassion and an instinctive sympathy for the hard-working little guy. But nobody, except for members of advocacy groups and maybe a few committed cops, bothers to get to know many day laborers, who know their place in this economy and society: underground. 
 Last week, however, brought news of a good first start toward a better understanding of the day-laborer phenomenon. University researchers released the first nationwide study of day laborers, based on interviews with 2,660 workers at 264 hiring sites in 20 states and the District of Columbia. 
 The study affirmed that day labor is an entrenched national trend, and that three-fourths of day laborers are here illegally. While that is not surprising, the researchers also said they were disturbed at how treacherous the occupation was -- that the prevalence of wage violations was ''incredibly high'' and that dangerous job conditions were rampant. More than half of those surveyed said they had been cheated out of wages in the previous two months, and 60 percent said they had lost a week or more of work because of injuries.
 The study suggested that day labor was only a temporary rung on the economic ladder; 44 percent of those surveyed said they had been day laborers for less than a year, while only 26 percent had been day laborers for more than three years. Though some localities have responded to day laborers by cracking down on contractors, the study found that slightly more laborers had been hired by homeowners than by contractors -- 49 percent to 43 percent.
 It is interesting to note that the researchers interviewed only workers who gathered at hiring sites. Unfortunately, Long Island -- particularly Suffolk County -- does not have very many of these. Yet the study is solid evidence that providing hiring sites for day laborers is more than just the decent thing to do. It is also a way to bring structure and organization to an ad hoc phenomenon that has long been defined by furtiveness and chaos. Bringing the day laborers out of the fringes will make it easier to enforce labor laws, dampen public anger and hasten the arrival of sensible solutions.
 In that spirit, we welcome a path-breaking effort announced recently by Mayor David Kapell of Greenport. Struck by the sight of hundreds of Latino worshipers at a recent Christmas Mass, he decided to conduct a census of everyone who lives in his village, whatever their legal status, so that village services and resources could be directed accordingly. It is a sign of decency and leadership to show concern for how the other half lives. Or one-fourth. Or three-eighths. Whatever it is, it's important to know.

HEADLINE: Housing Prices Are Driving An Exodus

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN and JANE GORDON

 BODY:
ARTHUR DALLAS grew up in the Bronx, but left many years ago for the same reasons many others do.
 ''My wife and I decided to raise a family, and the school situation in the Bronx was impossible,'' said Mr. Dallas, a former police officer. They bought a home in Rye and put the kids through school. Even after a separation 15 years ago, he stayed in suburbia, taking an apartment in Stamford.
But the numbers stopped adding up, and Mr. Dallas, 65, decided his long experiment with suburban life should end. He left Fairfield County for a two-family home he built on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx in 2004, where the rent from a tenant helps pay the mortgage.
 ''I found the cost of living in southern Connecticut to be very high,'' he said. ''The school situation hasn't changed, but that doesn't affect me at all now, because my children are adults.'' 
 A quest for affordable housing is drawing greater numbers of young people, families and empty nesters from the suburbs surrounding New York City and casting them out to destinations near and far, a New York Times review of migration data shows. 
 Mr. Dallas is part of a fast-growing segment that is moving to the outer boroughs of New York City. Nearly 1,000 Connecticut taxpayers left for the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens in 2004, a 60 percent increase over 1996. But the new emigres are also choosing destinations in upstate New York and in other communities in Connecticut, as well as boomtowns in central Florida and other parts of the Sun Belt.
 ''I do think a lot of this movement -- to Florida and to the exurbs -- reflects, in part, a 'housing affordability' movement, or what I have sometimes termed a 'middle-class flight,' '' Prof. William Frey, a University of Michigan demographer, said in an e-mail message. ''They'll move as far out as eastern Pennsylvania or northern Connecticut. But many are probably looking at Sun Belt markets, including central Florida, Georgia, North Carolina.''
 Not that there is any danger that Fairfield will empty out. Thousands are still following the traditional migratory paths from New York City to southwest Connecticut and to other inner-ring suburbs like Westchester and northern New Jersey. Fairfield, in fact, is a growing destination for movers from closer-in suburbs such as Westchester. And, of course, many continue to have children when they arrive, so the population is not declining.
 But more people leave than arrive, even with the growing influx from Westchester, and that figure is rising. The net emigration from Fairfield was more than 4,000 households in 2004, up from about 3,000 in 1996.
 A review of Internal Revenue Service data on taxpayers who move from one county to another between tax years shows the following pattern from 1996 to 2004, the most recent years available:
 Increasing numbers of Fairfield County's young people and empty nesters are emigrating to Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The number of households that moved from the county to the Bronx in 2004 was 133 percent higher than in 1996.
 Middle-class flight from older suburbs to exurbs is accelerating. Much of this exurban migration from Fairfield goes to Litchfield and New Haven. 
 Increasing numbers of taxpayers are leaving for more-affordable suburbs and cities across the country, especially in central and northern Florida. The rate of migration from Fairfield to Osceola County, south of Orlando, has doubled since 1996. Many of these new Florida migrants are not retirees. Moves from Fairfield to traditional coastal retirement destinations like Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach have not increased.
 Professor Frey wrote: ''There seems to be a widening out of the traditional city population (young people, minorities and immigrants) while suburbia moves further out. Pricey inner suburbs are spreading to mid-New Jersey and Connecticut, and affordable suburbs for young families are populating areas that had not previously been considered in New York's orbit.''
 Mr. Dallas is part of a growing wave of suburbanites moving within city boundaries. The I.R.S. data show that these people tend to have smaller families than migrants to other destinations, and demographers said they are either the grown-up children of suburbia, or empty nesters.
 ''They may have originally come from the boroughs to suburbia,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Affairs at Rutgers University. ''Now they want to go back to where there are more activities, and Manhattan is too expensive.'' 
 Emigration from Fairfield to Manhattan has always existed, and it continues, but it is declining, down about 4 percent in 2004 compared with 1996. But the number heading to the outer boroughs, while smaller, is growing. Emigration to Brooklyn increased by more than 50 percent.
 ''We get some people who normally would be going to Harlem or Park Slope or Prospect Heights, and have found those places to be too expensive,'' said Glen Calderon, a real estate agent who sells property in the South Bronx. 
 This wave is also likely to contain a lot of grown-up suburban children. Although this group has always tended to leave after college and return later with families, the 20- and 30-somethings of today are finding affordable suburban residences ever more elusive.
 ''It's outrageous to pay those kind of taxes to live in the suburbs if you don't have kids in the schools,'' said Dayna Basile, who grew up in Westchester but recently bought a house in the Bronx. She has two children who are not yet school age. ''I don't know what I'll do when they're older,'' she added.
 Because of school issues, most families are heading away from the city, and there is an income curve: The lower the income, the farther the move. The I.R.S. data show that people who move to exurban destinations report adjusted gross incomes that are lower than average; for those moving from Fairfield to New Haven County, for instance, the average income was $53,000, compared to $101,000 for households that stayed in the county in 2004. 
 ''We have attracted a higher wage base of people that can afford homes here,'' said Joseph McGee, vice president for public policy of the Business Council of Fairfield County. ''But in the middle group, they are forced to move out to less expensive areas. They are moving to New Haven, mainly the Naugatuck Valley. They're living further out and putting more pressure on the transportation system.'' 
 The exurban trend has been noted by demographers for some time, and the I.R.S. data confirm that it isn't just city people who are filling the new subdivisions in more remote areas, but also a stream from the older suburbs.
 ''It seems to me that there is a definite trend toward moving to the outer exurbs among families from all over the New York region,'' Professor Frey wrote. ''Starter homes for today's young New Yorkers aren't in close-in Levittown (as in earlier generations) but really far out.''
 ''Far out'' increasingly means leaving the region entirely, especially for families who can't afford even an exurban move. As the I.R.S. data show, families leaving the metropolitan area tend to have lower incomes than either those who stay or those who move farther out. Demographers said these are young families looking for a better mix of income, cost of living and climate. The most popular destinations are in central Florida. 
 The trail from New York to Florida was blazed by retirees, and that flow continues. Palm Beach, Miami and Fort Lauderdale continue to get thousands of migrants each year, but more and more it is enhanced by families. The flow from Connecticut to St. Petersburg, a destination for Fairfield taxpayers with small families -- retirees -- has fallen by 31 percent. But the flow to Tampa, just next door, is up 108 percent.
 ''There have been so many immigrants from the Northeast over the years, mainly retirees, that they brought the Northeast with them,'' said Mr. Hughes, the Rutgers professor. ''Central Florida has been reinvented as the Northeast without snow.'' 
 The economy is good, even if incomes are not as large. 
 ''Florida is now a very diversified economy,'' he added. ''It's not too different from the Northeast economy. The jobs don't pay as well, but the cost of living is so much cheaper.''
 That contrast in living costs can be especially stark for suburban New Yorkers, who are among the leading contributors to central Florida's population. The top three non-Florida counties contributing residents to Tampa in 2004 were Queens, N.Y.; Cook County, Ill., and Suffolk, N.Y.
 ''The 'new' New York-to-Florida migration is not just old-timers, but younger and middle-age families to central Florida,'' Professor Frey said. ''These along with movers to other Sun Belt suburbs represent a new, extended version of suburbanization -- people in quest of a suburban lifestyle who cannot afford the suburbs within the New York area, or deal with the long commute to the exurbs.''

(Photo by Dith Pran/The New York Times)Chart/Map: ''Leaving Fairfield County''As Fairfield County housing gets more expensive, families that cannot afford homes or want to live more cheaply are moving farther out to exurban counties in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, extending the reach of traditional suburbs.

HEADLINE: Don't Make Me Laugh. Not Yet.

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
MANY naturally irreverent people, who embrace dark humor for its pain-relieving qualities, have asked themselves when Americans will be ready for Sept. 11 jokes. ''The People Next Door,'' now at the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, answers that question: not quite yet.
 At one point in this uneven but often intriguing comic drama by Henry Adam, a Scottish-born playwright, the lead character, named Nigel Brunswick (Manu Narayan), is approached by a police officer (Christopher Innvar), about helping the authorities find his half-brother, a suspected terrorist who may have been involved with the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. 
 Nigel, a permanently unemployed, possibly mentally-ill half-Pakistani, half-English pothead who spends his days blissfully lying around his dingy London apartment, responds by saying, ''I saw the video, man,'' and acting out what he saw. 
 Mr. Narayan could probably get away with just extending his arms and pretending to be an airplane flying into a building. But when he cowers in fear, imitating victims and witnesses, he and the director, Evan Yionoulis, have gone too far for 2006 audiences. Nigel's behavior is completely in character, so this is a brave theatrical decision, but we are many years away from ''Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?'' territory.
 Much of ''The People Next Door'' is like that, alternating between the genuinely effective and the unfortunately simplistic, daring to aim for uncharted territory and just missing.
 Ms. Yionoulis, the director, has said that one of the play's themes is community and the transformation of friends into family. The only other characters are Mrs. McCallum (Marcia Jean Kurtz), an elderly widow who lives upstairs from Nigel, and Marco (James Miles), a teenage boy who lives nearby with his mother, a prostitute who beats him. 
 Mrs. Mac, as she is known, is disappointingly stereotypical, talking to a photograph of her dead husband, Harry, and seeming to live in some decade long before this one. Ms. Kurtz has done fine work elsewhere, but she can't pull much out of this characterization. When an actress's finest moment is having her apartment blown up, she is not in the role of a lifetime. As for Marco, he and his problems seem to exist only to be helped and solved by Nigel.
 There are several funny exchanges between Nigel and Phil the cop, including a discussion of Cartier versus Carter watches and the revelation of Nigel's lifelong unawareness of daylight saving time. The play really picks up near the end of Act I, around the time Phil tells Nigel about the police department's current position on the war against drugs: ''We've pretty much given up.''
 But Phil is a problem character. Actors have to develop an understanding of and sympathy for a character's behavior, but Mr. Innvar and Ms. Yionoulis may have made Phil too likable. It is very easy to get the character all wrong, in terms of the kind of human being he is, if not his specific intentions.
 The play, with a different cast and director, was part of the Brits Off Broadway festival in New York last spring. It continues to evolve.
 ''The People Next Door'' is at the Yale Repertory Theater, 1120 Chapel Street, New Haven, through Feb. 4. Information: (203) 432-1234 or go to www.yalerep.org.

HEADLINE: What Americans Worry About Most

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Dollars and Sense,'' by David Brooks (column, Jan. 26): 
 I agree that Americans are more concerned about social threats like divorce, teenage pregnancy and poor early childhood education than economic threats like globalization, outsourcing and corporate power.
 What I fail to understand -- and get no insight on from Mr. Brooks's column -- is why a majority of Americans also seem disinclined to invest tax dollars in programs aimed at helping people avoid these social ills.
Conservative government rides to power by raising these social fears, and then offers virtually no solutions to the problems.
 The conservatives' message remains ''it's not government's job to fix it.'' I don't understand why voters seem more concerned about paying less in taxes than about addressing the evils we all fear.
 Democrats would do well to move beyond merely decrying the problems to offering ways to invest in public-private partnerships that actually do something about them.

Pitching Values To Democrats As a Way to Win
 In ''Remapping the Cultural Debate'' in The American Prospect, Garance Franke-Ruta looks at studies by the opinion research firm American Environics suggesting that Democrats should sometimes set aside policies in favor of values. 
 How does the Democratic Party, whose most essential economic ideas were forged in the crucibles of the worst of times, develop an agenda for a post-scarcity society? 
The growing conflation of the economic and the cultural in the minds of voters has been a cause of great perplexity for thinkers who have long seen the two realms as distinct, and the cultural realm as the secondary concern of unserious men who don't know where their self-interest lies. 
 American voters have taken shelter under the various wings of conservative traditionalism because there has been no one on the Democratic side in recent years to defend traditional, sensible middle-class values against the onslaught of the new nihilistic, macho, libertarian lawlessness unleashed by an economy that pits every man against his fellows. Yet in private conversations, progressives recognize that there is a need to do something about broad social changes that they, too, find objectionable. The American Environics data provide the critical missing link that should allow progressives to reach out more confidently to voters who share with them common values and concerns about the direction of the nation.

God Save Amadeus
 Music lovers around the world weighed in on Mozart in appreciation of his birth 250 years ago Friday. Only Stephen Brown, writing in The Times Literary Supplement in London, compared him to a Sex Pistol. 
 It is true that one doesn't normally speak of Mozart and Sid Vicious in the same breath, but they do have this in common: primitivism. Rock 'n' roll began as a primitivist movement, and it renews itself with mini-primitivisms, of which punk is just one example. To see Mozart as a primitivist is a little harder, since his style is so identified with the civilized and the rational, things we think of as anti-primitive, and yet the Classical movement in music, like its companion neo-Classicism in art, owed everything to the primitivist desire to begin anew by stripping away the false and inessential. 
 Primitivism can take many forms, as many as there are ways of jettisoning excess baggage in an effort to get back to basics. The problem is to identify the infamy that must be suppressed, and then to find the way to crush it. Doubt everything until you are left with irreducible truths, and then build logically and deductively from those axioms, constructing a new order as you would construct a proof in geometry. For Descartes, it was ''Cogito, ergo sum''; for Beethoven, dah-dah-dah-dum.

The top climate scientist at NASA says the Bush administration has tried to stop him from speaking out since he gave a lecture last month calling for prompt reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming.
 The scientist, James E. Hansen, longtime director of the agency's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview that officials at NASA headquarters had ordered the public affairs staff to review his coming lectures, papers, postings on the Goddard Web site and requests for interviews from journalists.
Dr. Hansen said he would ignore the restrictions. ''They feel their job is to be this censor of information going out to the public,'' he said. 
 Dean Acosta, deputy assistant administrator for public affairs at the space agency, said there was no effort to silence Dr. Hansen. ''That's not the way we operate here at NASA,'' Mr. Acosta said. ''We promote openness and we speak with the facts.'' 
 He said the restrictions on Dr. Hansen applied to all National Aeronautics and Space Administration personnel. He added that government scientists were free to discuss scientific findings, but that policy statements should be left to policy makers and appointed spokesmen.
 Mr. Acosta said other reasons for requiring press officers to review interview requests were to have an orderly flow of information out of a sprawling agency and to avoid surprises. ''This is not about any individual or any issue like global warming,'' he said. ''It's about coordination.''
 Dr. Hansen strongly disagreed with this characterization, saying such procedures had already prevented the public from fully grasping recent findings about climate change that point to risks ahead. 
 ''Communicating with the public seems to be essential,'' he said, ''because public concern is probably the only thing capable of overcoming the special interests that have obfuscated the topic.''
 Dr. Hansen, 63, a physicist who joined the space agency in 1967, directs efforts to simulate the global climate on computers at the Goddard Institute in Morningside Heights in Manhattan.
 Since 1988, he has been issuing public warnings about the long-term threat from heat-trapping emissions, dominated by carbon dioxide, that are an unavoidable byproduct of burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. He has had run-ins with politicians or their appointees in various administrations, including budget watchers in the first Bush administration and Vice President Al Gore. 
 In 2001, Dr. Hansen was invited twice to brief Vice President Dick Cheney and other cabinet members on climate change. White House officials were interested in his findings showing that cleaning up soot, which also warms the atmosphere, was an effective and far easier first step than curbing carbon dioxide.
 He fell out of favor with the White House in 2004 after giving a speech at the University of Iowa before the presidential election, in which he complained that government climate scientists were being muzzled and said he planned to vote for Senator John Kerry. 
 But Dr. Hansen said that nothing in 30 years equaled the push made since early December to keep him from publicly discussing what he says are clear-cut dangers from further delay in curbing carbon dioxide. 
 In several interviews with The New York Times in recent days, Dr. Hansen said it would be irresponsible not to speak out, particularly because NASA's mission statement includes the phrase ''to understand and protect our home planet.''
 He said he was particularly incensed that the directives had come through telephone conversations and not through formal channels, leaving no significant trails of documents. 
 Dr. Hansen's supervisor, Franco Einaudi, said there had been no official ''order or pressure to say shut Jim up.'' But Dr. Einaudi added, ''That doesn't mean I like this kind of pressure being applied.''
 The fresh efforts to quiet him, Dr. Hansen said, began in a series of calls after a lecture he gave on Dec. 6 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. In the talk, he said that significant emission cuts could be achieved with existing technologies, particularly in the case of motor vehicles, and that without leadership by the United States, climate change would eventually leave the earth ''a different planet.'' 
 The administration's policy is to use voluntary measures to slow, but not reverse, the growth of emissions.
 After that speech and the release of data by Dr. Hansen on Dec. 15 showing that 2005 was probably the warmest year in at least a century, officials at the headquarters of the space agency repeatedly phoned public affairs officers, who relayed the warning to Dr. Hansen that there would be ''dire consequences'' if such statements continued, those officers and Dr. Hansen said in interviews. 
 Among the restrictions, according to Dr. Hansen and an internal draft memorandum he provided to The Times, was that his supervisors could stand in for him in any news media interviews.
 Mr. Acosta said the calls and meetings with Goddard press officers were not to introduce restrictions, but to review existing rules. He said Dr. Hansen had continued to speak frequently with the news media.
 But Dr. Hansen and some of his colleagues said interviews were canceled as a result. 
 In one call, George Deutsch, a recently appointed public affairs officer at NASA headquarters, rejected a request from a producer at National Public Radio to interview Dr. Hansen, said Leslie McCarthy, a public affairs officer responsible for the Goddard Institute. 
 Citing handwritten notes taken during the conversation, Ms. McCarthy said Mr. Deutsch called N.P.R. ''the most liberal'' media outlet in the country. She said that in that call and others, Mr. Deutsch said his job was ''to make the president look good'' and that as a White House appointee that might be Mr. Deutsch's priority. 
 But she added: ''I'm a career civil servant and Jim Hansen is a scientist. That's not our job. That's not our mission. The inference was that Hansen was disloyal.''
 Normally, Ms. McCarthy would not be free to describe such conversations to the news media, but she agreed to an interview after Mr. Acosta, at NASA headquarters, told The Times that she would not face any retribution for doing so.
 Mr. Acosta, Mr. Deutsch's supervisor, said that when Mr. Deutsch was asked about the conversations, he flatly denied saying anything of the sort. Mr. Deutsch referred all interview requests to Mr. Acosta.
 Ms. McCarthy, when told of the response, said: ''Why am I going to go out of my way to make this up and back up Jim Hansen? I don't have a dog in this race. And what does Hansen have to gain?'' 
 Mr. Acosta said that for the moment he had no way of judging who was telling the truth. Several colleagues of both Ms. McCarthy and Dr. Hansen said Ms. McCarthy's statements were consistent with what she told them when the conversations occurred. 
 ''He's not trying to create a war over this,'' said Larry D. Travis, an astronomer who is Dr. Hansen's deputy at Goddard, ''but really feels very strongly that this is an obligation we have as federal scientists, to inform the public.''
 Dr. Travis said he walked into Ms. McCarthy's office in mid-December at the end of one of the calls from Mr. Deutsch demanding that Dr. Hansen be better controlled. 
 In an interview on Friday, Ralph J. Cicerone, an atmospheric chemist and the president of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's leading independent scientific body, praised Dr. Hansen's scientific contributions and said he had always seemed to describe his public statements clearly as his personal views.
 ''He really is one of the most productive and creative scientists in the world,'' Dr. Cicerone said. ''I've heard Hansen speak many times and I've read many of his papers, starting in the late 70's. Every single time, in writing or when I've heard him speak, he's always clear that he's speaking for himself, not for NASA or the administration, whichever administration it's been.''
 The fight between Dr. Hansen and administration officials echoes other recent disputes. At climate laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for example, many scientists who routinely took calls from reporters five years ago can now do so only if the interview is approved by administration officials in Washington, and then only if a public affairs officer is present or on the phone.
 Where scientists' points of view on climate policy align with those of the administration, however, there are few signs of restrictions on extracurricular lectures or writing. 
 One example is Indur M. Goklany, assistant director of science and technology policy in the policy office of the Interior Department. For years, Dr. Goklany, an electrical engineer by training, has written in papers and books that it may be better not to force cuts in greenhouse gases because the added prosperity from unfettered economic activity would allow countries to exploit benefits of warming and adapt to problems. 
 In an e-mail exchange on Friday, Dr. Goklany said that in the Clinton administration he was shifted to nonclimate-related work, but added that he had never had to stop his outside writing, as long as he identified the views as his own. 
 ''One reason why I still continue to do the extracurricular stuff,'' he wrote, ''is because one doesn't have to get clearance for what I plan on saying or writing.''
