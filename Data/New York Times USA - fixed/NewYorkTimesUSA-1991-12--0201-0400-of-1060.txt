HEADLINE: Bush Orders Quicker Expenditure Of $9.7 Billion to Aid Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
President Bush issued orders today to speed up the spending of $9.7 billion of Federal money in an effort to kick life into the nation's listless economy.
The announcement followed months of assertions by Democrats and some Republicans that Mr. Bush was neglecting the nation's economic problems. 
 Some economists welcomed Mr. Bush's action as a modest step in the right direction. Others said the accelerated spending would have a small effect in a nation that produces goods and services worth more than $5 trillion a year.
The $9.7 billion, already appropriated by Congress, will be spent within the next four months rather than later in 1992, as originally planned, the White House said.
 
Loans and Construction Money
 The money is earmarked for uses like rural housing loans, farm loans, conservation programs, construction of sewage treatment plants, construction of runways at airports and payments to military contractors. "We're also considering additional spending accelerations that may be possible," the President said at a news conference today.
Moreover, Mr. Bush said, "I intend to propose a new package of programs that will stimulate growth in the economy for both the short and the long terms." He declined to give details today, saying he would announce the proposals in his State of the Union Message next month.
Mr. Bush said the accelerated spending of $9.7 billion would provide a "shot in the arm" for the economy. But Rudolph G. Penner, who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1983 to 1987, said, "A small amount like that would clearly not have a lot of economic effect."
Mr. Penner said the acceleration of spending "won't do any harm and might do a very little bit of good in creating some momentum for an economic recovery that doesn't have much momentum."
In annual appropriations for Federal agencies, Congress makes money available for a specific fiscal year. The President and his budget director have some discretion in apportioning the money over the course of the year. To stimulate the economy, Mr. Bush said he was ordering the "earliest possible expenditure" of the $9.7 billion.
 
'Steps in the Right Direction'
 Irwin L. Kellner, senior vice president and chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, in New York, said: "The steps announced by the President today are steps in the right direction. I would call for an even bolder program in which the Government hires unemployed construction workers and puts them to work on highways, bridges, tunnels and water and sewer systems. Once you hire an unemployed person, that person will spend every dollar you give them."
The biggest item in the list of accounts designated for accelerated spending is $3 billion in grants to states for construction of sewage treatment plants. The list also includes $1.9 billion for airport construction and $1.9 billion in loans to help farmers purchase and operate farms.
The Pentagon expects to speed up the spending of $1 billion by signing military contracts sooner than planned and by paying contractors more promptly.
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said that despite Mr. Bush's action, there would probably be a lag in the actual use of some of the $9.7 billion. For example, he said, after the Federal Government makes money available, the sponsors of a construction project may still need to sign contracts, obtain permits or get approval from local environmental protection officials. So the accelerated disbursement of money may mean that the project begins nine months, rather than 12 months, from now.
Moreover, Mr. Reischauer said, because of harsh weather in many parts of the country, it is usually difficult to start construction of highways and other projects in the winter months.
Paul Craig Roberts, a supply-side economist who served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1981 and 1982, said the accelerated spending might help some Government contractors. "But then again," he said, "it could have a bad impact if people are looking for decisive action and see a warmed-over New Deal approach."

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Rose 1.9% in October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Orders for American manufactured goods rose by 1.9 percent in October, the Government said today in a report that left analysts generally unimpressed.
The Commerce Department said orders for durable and nondurable goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted $242.12 billion in October, as a huge surge in demand for military hardware offset weakness in areas like automobiles. 
 But without the big rise in military orders, total orders would have actually been up by a smaller amount in October, six-tenths of a percent.
The 1.9 percent rise was the first since July, but it failed to make up for declines of 2.3 percent in September and 2 percent in August.
 
Weak Consumer Spending
 Manufacturing had been one of the few bright spots in the economy earlier in the year, as order books filled up and factories rehired workers.
But consumers have since failed to respond with increased spending, especially for big-ticket items like cars.
Analysts said they expected further setbacks in orders in the months ahead, and they said that would translate into further production cutbacks and layoffs.
The manufacturing weakness is one of the reasons many analysts are raising the odds that the fragile recovery will topple back into a full-fledged recession.
"Manufacturing generally leads the country out of recession and is one of the major sources of growth, and that is clearly not happening this time," said Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional Financial Associates, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
 
Growing Concerns
 John Silvia, an economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said concern was growing that the overall economy would begin shrinking again in the final three months of the year.
He said business inventories had risen rapidly in the third quarter and unless those were reduced by strong holiday sales, American industry would be forced to cut back on production in the coming months.
That, Mr. Silvia added, would translate into further declines in the gross domestic product.
The report on manufacturing orders said demand for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, climbed by 3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $123.75 billion in October. The figure was essentially unchanged from an advance report a week ago.
Orders for nondurable goods climbed by seven-tenths of a percent, to $118.37 billion, after a drop of one-tenth of a percent the previous month.
Much of the strength in October came in demand for military hardware, which shot up 55.5 percent after having fallen 48.9 percent the previous month.
Orders for transportation equipment posted the biggest increase during the month, rising by 12 percent, to $32.9 billion.
But the rise came from higher demand for military aircraft, ships and tanks. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell, as the auto industry continued to experience weak sales.
Shipments of factory orders, a gauge of current production, rose by 1.1 percent, to $244.9 billion. It was the seventh straight increase, putting shipments at their highest level since November 1990.

Posts Are Consolidated At American National

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

 BODY:
The American National Can Company announced yesterday that Jean-Pierre Ergas, chief executive since 1989, had been named to the additional post of chairman.
As producer of cans for Coca-Cola, toothpaste tubes for Colgate-Palmolve, bottles for Oil of Olay and other products, the $4.7-billion-a-year company says it is the world's largest maker of beverage cans and plastic-based tubes. 
 Mr. Ergas, 52, replaces Jean Gandois, who will remain as chairman of the parent company, the Pechiney Group of France, a state-owned packaging and metals concern.
"It was a natural step to take," Mr. Ergas said. "It was the plan all along." He added that Mr. Gandois no longer needed to be chairman "of both mother and daughter companies."
"My close personal involvement is no longer necessary," Mr. Gandois said in a statement.
American National Can was formed in 1987 in a merger of the American Can Company and the National Can Company. It was purchased by Pechiney a year later.
Sales volume this year is expected to grow by 3.5 percent, to $4.7 billion, which Mr. Ergas called "not too bad in this economy." He predicted above average growth in 1992.
Under Mr. Ergas's direction, American National Can has taken advantage of Pechiney's expertise in metallurgy by marketing a fluted can that is easier to grip.
Of the approximately 90 million beverage cans that will be produced in the United States this year, 500 million, or less than 1 percent, are fluted. American National produced about 25 million cans this year.
Mr. Ergas is also supervising the company's international expansion in Europe, with operations scheduled to open in Barcelona, Spain and Dunkirk, France.
When Mr. Ergas arrived at American National in 1989, he stressed his personal commitment to the company by moving to Chicago from Paris and putting his children into local schools.
"To be successful in the United States, you have to be a strong professional and a good citizen," he said yesterday. He is still a French citizen.

Rates Rise Ahead of New Jobs Data

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Interest rates rose slightly yesterday in quiet trading as investors and securities dealers digested new issues and waited for today's report on November employment to provide new clues to future rate changes.
Many analyts expect a weak employment report to be the catalyst for another move by the Federal Reserve to push short-term rates lower. 
Although long-term bond yields are unusually high compared to short-term rates, two of the nation's largest corporations -- A.T.& T. and General Motors -- have decided that conditions are favorable for large new long-term issues.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company offered $676 million of 40-year debentures with a yield of 8.65 percent yesterday, while G.M. plans to offer $1 billion of preferred stock with a yield of 9.125 percent today.
 
First Sale Since 1986
 The A.T.& T. sale was its first public offering of long-term debt since 1986. It was handled by Morgan Stanley & Company, which offered the 8 5/8 percent debentures at 99.716. A.T.& T. intends to use proceeds of the sale to redeem 8 3/4 percent debentures due in 2000, which it issued in 1970.
"We thought interest rates were favorable at current levels, and we did not want to wait until later in the year when it can be more difficult to sell large issues," said Peter M. Sperling, a director of corporate finance in the treasurer's office at A.T.& T.
The General Motors preferred stock has no maturity but is protected from early retirement by the company for seven years rather than five as initially planned. Merrill Lynch & Company handled the issue.
 
$500 Million G.E. Issue
 Other large corporate offerings yesterday included a $500 million issue of two-year notes by the General Electric Company with a yield of 5.91 percent through underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody & Company.
A Merrill Lynch group also offered $100 million of 10-year notes for the Republic New York Corporation with a 7.95 percent yield.
While securities dealers in the corporate market were distributing new offerings and planning for several more corporate issues before the holidays, dealers of Treasury securities said trading and investor demand were quiet in advance of the Commerce Department's November employment report to be issued today.
 
Jobs Decline Expected
 Many economists expect the report to show a decline of about 30,000 workers in non-farm payrolls -- another sign that the economic recovery that began in the spring is slowing. That decline in jobs would be far less than the monthly average decline of 200,000 workers during the October 1990 to April 1991 recessionary period, but many economists expect it will be large enough to cause the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy another notch and push short-term interest rates lower.
Prices of Treasury bonds were little changed, with the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rising by about 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 bond, to 100 7/8 to yield 7.84 percent.
Among shorter-term note issues, which offer lower yields but less risk of loss when interest rates begin rising, the 5 1/2 percent Treasury issue due in November 1993 was offered at 100 14/32, down 3/32, to yield 5.27 percent. The 6 1/2 percent Treasury notes due in 1996 were offered at 100 24/32, down 5/32, to yield 6.32 percent.
 
Growth in Money Supply
 Although the Fed's moves to reduce interest rates earlier this year have not prevented the economy from stalling, there are signs that the Fed has succeeded in stimulating faster growth in the nation's money supply -- a precursor, some economists say, to a stronger economy.
Including a $2.1 billion increase in the M-2 money supply measure for the week ended Nov. 25, the money supply measure is now within its 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent growth target for the year. Earlier this month, it was below the growth target.
Although recent Fed moves to lower short-term interst rates have not brought long-term bond yields much below the levels reached in February, some analysts still foresee lower bond yields as investors buy longer issues in order to earn a yields.
"Another Fed easing move could help the bond market, if Fed officials do a better job educating the market and explaining that inflation will remain low," said Victor Chang, president of the VC Management Company, an economic advisory firm. "Earlier this year, the Fed overemphasized the inflationary threat, and that has led to unrealistic fears among long-term bond investors."
Another idea for lowering long -erm rates -- reducing the amount of new bonds issued by the Treasury -- is under consideration, the Secretary of the Treausry, Nicholas F. Brady, said yesterday. He noted, however, that the Treasury already did most of its borrowing in the short-term markets, and that 30-year bonds accounted for only about 7.5 percent of net new Treasury borrowings.

HEADLINE: Chrysler to Pay Bonuses To 19,000 of Its Workers

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, financially the weakest of the Big Three, said today that it would pay holiday bonuses to 19,000 white-collar workers. The bonus amounts to $600 for most workers, meaning an outlay for Chrysler of almost $12 million.
The decision comes less than a week after the General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker, elected to forgo bonuses for its 107,000 salaried employees. The Ford Motor Company said today that it had decided to forgo a bonus, which would have been paid in the spring. Ford did not pay its bonus last spring either. 
 Lee Sechler, a Chrysler spokesman, said, "We decided to pay because of the many sacrifices made by the salaried group." Mr. Sechler said that over the last few years, cost-cutting measures that had reduced salaried benefits had also been hard on workers.
"As the staff gets smaller, the work load doesn't get any smaller," Mr. Sechler said. Chrysler's securities are rated the lowest among the Big Three, making it difficult to borrow money or sell debt securities. But the auto maker is hopeful that several new models set to make their debut in 1992 and an uptick in the economy might bail it out.
 
Salaried Workers' Bonus
 The bonus for salaried workers was first paid last year, following a new contract by the United Automobile Workers that provided for a similar amount for all hourly workers.
Like G.M., Chrysler had asked the union to consider forgoing the bonus this year in light of the deep losses being suffered by the industry and persistent weak demand for vehicles. The union said no to both auto makers. Auto makers have typically kept parity between wage and benefit increases for salaried and hourly workers to prevent low morale or provide inroads for futher union organization efforts.
Since the first of the year Chrysler has lost $892 million, G.M. has lost $2.2 billion and Ford has lost $1.78 billion. Among the belt-tightening measures have been dividend cuts, worker buyouts and price concessions from suppliers. At each auto maker the top few thousand executives are normally eligible for large annual bonuses, which may constitute half of annual compensation. But last year, and probably this year, bonus-eligible executives are not being paid bonuses.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 22.58, to 2,889.09, As Trading Volume Falls

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed lower yesterday, with a growing number of investors taking to the sidelines ahead of today's November employment numbers. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 22.58 points, to finish at 2,889.09.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 166.4 million, compared with 187.9 million on Wednesday. Losing issues outpaced gainers by 1,037 to 619. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell by 2.68, to 377.39, while the Big Board composite slipped 1.17, to 208.96. In American Stock Exchange trading, the composite was down 0.52, to 371.80.
 
Small Stocks Slip Too
 In over-the-counter trading the Nasdaq index was down 1.25 points, to 534.03, and the Russell 2,000 index, a barometer of small company issues slipped 0.60 points, to finish at 177.23.
Harry W. Laubsher, a senior vice president and market analyst for Tucker Anthony Inc., said: "Whenever you have investors moving to the sidelines, you always open the market up to increased volatility. If recent support levels can hold, then a 5 to 10 percent rally should occur and carry over into January. An employment number taken more positively than negatively could begin the rally early, but if it is taken adversely, the market could move quickly to test the support level of 2,850 on the Dow."
Wall Street stocks were mixed in early trading, and with few buyers participating the market moved lower. A 1.9 percent increase in factory orders for October, compared with a forecast of 1.5 percent, had little impact.
 
Awaiting Unemployment Data
 Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst for Marion Bass Securities, said the employment numbers scheduled for release today would be significant, because the market is more focused on the economy than on interest rates. As a result stocks are not likely to rally if the Federal Reserve Board eases interest rates after the jobs data are released.
Blue chip issues fell throughout the trading session, with futures related program selling contributing to yesterday's decline. Birinyi Associates, a research firm which tracks program trades tracked eight sell programs and one buy program yesterday. The combined impact pulled the Dow lower by 29.97 points.
Boeing stock rose 3/4, to 42 1/8 after declining the previous day. Analysts said the previous day's decline was an overreaction by the market to comments by the company's chief executive, Frank Shrontz, that Boeing would not be able to sustain planned production levels if the airliner market did not improve.
 
Recommendation Improved
 Genetics Institutes, a biopharmaceutical company, rose 1, to 38 1/4, as Robert S. Kupor, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, adjusted his rating on the company to a "trading buy" from a "hold."
Shares of Lotus Development rose 2, to 20 3/4, in active trading after an announcement that it plans to cut costs aggressively. The computer software company said it would trim its work force by almost 10 percent and exert tighter controls on discretionary spending.
Richard R. Stover an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons said his rating change on Upjohn, to "hold," from a "buy," was purely a precautionary move ahead of next week's meeting of a European regulatory committee regarding Upjohn's Halcion, a drug for insomnia. The stock closed down 1 5/8, to finish at 38 3/8.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Chief of Lukens Quits Before Planned Date

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Lukens Inc., a big steelmaker embroiled in a two-month-old strike, said yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, William R. Wilson, resigned six months before his previously announced retirement date.
His duties will be assumed by R. William Van Sant, who has been president and chief operating officer since October. 
 The company had announced Mr. Van Sant's promotion months ago. But Mr. Wilson's retirement was not expected until he reached age 65 next May. W. Evelyn Walker, a spokeswoman for the company, said the resignation was not related to the labor dispute, though she added that the reason for Mr. Wilson's early departure was unclear.
Lukens, based in Coatesville, Pa., is the nation's third-largest producer of plate steel used in construction, shipbuilding and transportation. While other steelmakers were battered by the recession, Lukens remained strong because of its niches in highly profitable corrosion-protective steel and high-quality steel. The company also developed a growing business in highway products and in goods and services for the mining and energy industries.
Mr. Van Sant, 53 years old, has been a director of Lukens since 1988. He has extensive experience in manufacturing, aerospace and construction. He rose to vice president for manufacturing and engineering at Deere & Company, where he worked for 26 years. Then he served as president and chief operating officer of the Cessna Aircraft Company.
He joined Blount Inc., a Montgomery Ala., construction company, in 1987 and had been president and chief executive since 1990.
Mr. Van Sant holds bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Iowa. He is married and has three sons and two daughters.

Copper Hits 15-Week Lows On London Market Easing

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Copper prices fell to their lowest levels in 15 weeks yesterday, as the market responded to a relaxation of what several analysts viewed as an artificially tight supply situation on the London copper market.
Earlier this week, the London Metal Exchange placed limits on the price premium paid for the nearest delivery month over the succeeding month, in order to defuse what some traders viewed as an attempted supply squeeze. 
 A Japanese concern, Sumitomo, denied that it was hoarding supplies, which are fairly plentiful worldwide, and futures prices fell this week in London and on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
The Comex December copper contract lost 2.05 cents a pound yesterday, to 98.50 cents.
Analysts said a sluggish recovery from recession in the United States and weak growth elsewhere were limiting industrial demand for copper.
"A balanced market is projected in 1992, which will lead to generally stable prices," Fred Demler, a metals economist at Paine Webber Inc., said at an industry conference yesterday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for January delivery fell 37 cents a barrel, to $20.39.
On the New York Cotton Exchange, cotton prices dropped to a new three-year low, with the March delivery down 0.89 cent, to 58.57 cents a pound.
Traders said the Agriculture Department was expected to again cut a critical price marked to keep American cotton exports competitive on the world market.
"That is weighing on people's minds, as well as a potential cut in exports in next week's U.S.D.A. report," said Sharon Johnson, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, feeder cattle contracts plunged in line with a recent tumble in fully fed live cattle prices, and wheat prices edged up again.
The March feeder cattle contract plummeted 1.35 cents a pound, to 77.575 cents, as operators of cattle feedlots lowered their bids for unfed cattle because of poor profit margins.
February live cattle edged down 0.45 cent, to 73.65 cents a pound.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures again posted new highs, but some analysts said the market might be running out of steam.
March wheat rose 1.75 cents a bushel, to $3.85 1/4, after the Soviet Union tendered for 500,000 metric tons of American wheat. The Soviets will use the first installment of loan guarantees recently granted by the Bush Administration to make the purchase.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Full-Price Brands Fighting Off Assault by Cheaper Rivals

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS the souring economy spurs shoppers to buy lower-priced products, some marketers of full-price packaged goods are fighting back.
Consumers "still want to buy a name brand, but they don't want to pay a big price," said Deepak Raj, an analyst who follows household and personal-care products for Merrill Lynch Research in New York. "That puts pressure on the manufacturers." 
 Typifying the way companies are seeking to reverse buyers' switching to lower-priced goods, which advertising and marketing executives call "trading down," are television commercials sponsored by Procter & Gamble for its Dawn dishwashing liquid. In the spots, created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in New York, a woman recounts her decision to switch from Dawn to a "value brand," which, she says, provided less effective grease-cutting power.
"Will I switch again?" she asks. "I'm thrifty, not crazy." The spots, which have been running since August in 15- and 30-second versions, end with the usual Dawn slogan -- "Takes grease out of your way" -- plus an additional line, "And that's the real value."
The current economic climate provides "as good a time as any to convey the outstanding performance and real value that Dawn provides to consumers," said Chris Burbank, a P.&G. spokeswoman in Cincinnati. But she added that the company considered the spots, which have been appearing in addition to the old Dawn commercials, to represent no departure from Dawn's basic advertising theme, which has been running since 1976.
The counterattack against lower-priced products is similar to what occurred during the late 1970's and early 1980's. Then, the target was "no name" generic products, which came in plain wrappers and were priced below name brands and store brands.
Now, the target is what the Dawn spots refer to as value brands, which are priced below full-price brands, but above generics and private labels. An example of a value brand is Suave, a line of hair-care and personal-care items made by Helene Curtis Inc. and priced less than P.&G. brands like Prell shampoo and Sure deodorant.
The counterattack also mirrors recent developments in the fast-food industry. Last year, the McDonald's Corporation introduced an upbeat, image-oriented campaign, by Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago, that carried the theme "Food, folks and fun." But when sales growth stalled, in large part because of lower-priced menu items introduced by rivals like Wendy's International and Taco Bell, McDonald's regrouped; a revamped campaign, called "McDonald's today," has been presenting what the company considers the values that customers can find under the Golden Arches.
If consumers believe there is "not that much difference" between a full-price brand and its lower-priced competitor, "then today, you're in trouble," said D. Frederick Baker, senior vice president and director of market research at McCann-Erickson New York.
As a result, he added, makers of full-price products "have to protect, nurture and expand their emotional ties with the consumer." And one method of achieving that, he continued, is "to be associated with delivering quality at a level" that consumers would perceive to be unmatched by lower-priced competitors.
Some packaged-goods companies are not participating in the trend. "Our strategy really hasn't changed," said Sharon Morganstern, director of consumer affairs at the Lever Brothers Company in New York.
Rather than run advertising that pummels lower-priced brands, Lever is instead continuing to distribute what she termed tons of cents-off coupons, redeemable on purchases of its full-price brands like Wisk detergent.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
The First Draft of I.B.M.'s Future

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Just how far I.B.M. is prepared to go to free itself from the large-system computer business that has been its bread and butter became obvious yesterday when it separated a $2 billion printer company and its $11 billion disk drive business from its mainframe division.
"By freeing these individual companies we are establishing competition, and that's healthy," John F. Akers, chairman of the International Business Machines Corporation, said in a telephone interview. 
 I.B.M. said it would establish the Pennant Systems Company to develop and manufacture advanced printers and related software and services. The company will be a wholly owned subsidiary run by James T. Vanderslice, an I.B.M. vice president who will report to Terry R. Lautenbach, a senior vice president.
Mr. Vanderslice has been senior managing director of manufacturing and development for the company's Asia-Pacific region. The new company will be based in Norwalk, Conn.
 
New Data Systems Unit
 I.B.M., whose headquarters are in Armonk, N.Y., also established its data systems division as a new line of business, known as Storage Products, to be run by Ray S. AbuZayyad, who was named general manager. He will also report to Mr. Lautenbach.
"It's the end of the mainframe hegemony," said Rick Martin, a Wall Street financial analyst at Prudential Securities and a former product manager for one of I.B.M.'s mainframe computers.
I.B.M. also provided fresh details on new management and financial measurement systems designed to build independence and accountability into each of its business. It said it would establish systems of reporting and measuring financial results and tie compensation to performance.
Mr. Akers also said the company was planning, perhaps as soon as its 1992 annual report -- which will be released in February 1993 -- to give a never-before-public look at the details of the company's financial performance, giving performance data on each of its businesses.
Until now, I.B.M. has given revenue data only on major business categories like mainframe processors, personal computers, work stations and software; it has not broken down data on each operation's profitability.
Mr. Akers also said that decisions on selling equity in I.B.M.'s newly independent businesses would not be made quickly. "We're not going to wake up next spring and do something," he said. "We are establishing an environment."
"Our intention is to go public with all the financial results of these businesses," he said. "We want these businesses to be publicly visible and publicly measurable and publicly accountable. You have to do that first before you can deal with the equity issue."
Since the mid-1980's, the fastest- growing segment of the computer industry has been personal computers and more powerful computers known as work stations, both of which are increasingly linked by office networks.
Mr. Akers bridled at the suggestion that I.B.M. had not pursued opportunities in personal computers and work stations for fear of competing with its more profitable but slower- growing large-systems business.
"I think that is a bunch of baloney," he said. "In the final analysis, the customer has something he wants to do. If he wants to do it with a mainframe, we'll sell those to him. If he wants a local area network, we can provide that as well."
Mr. Akers identified software and services as two businesses where high growth is expected and said the changes the company was making should help it pursue those opportunities. He said that next year he expected the company's newly formed services business to have $5 billion in revenue and a 30 percent annual growth rate.
 
Memo to Employees
 In a memo describing the changes, which was distributed yesterday to its 350,000 employees, I.B.M. reassured its workers that it was not ending its no-layoffs policy. But in an unusual caveat at the end of the document, the company noted that full employment was not a guarantee at I.B.M. and depended in part on the health of the economy. It also said it was "impossible to predict" what actions the independent businesses will take as they evolve.
The company has reduced its employment by 65,000 through voluntary departures and retirements between 1986 and 1991.
The company yesterday also made several management changes affecting both its Personal Systems and Applications Business Systems businesses, which sell personal computers, work stations and more powerful minicomputers. In Personal Systems, an executive board was established, composed of marketing executives from I.B.M.
I.B.M. also established a new group called the Employment Solutions Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary that will provide hiring and recruiting services to I.B.M. in the United States and market those services to other companies. Each I.B.M. business will still do its own recruiting and hiring, while the new company will help schedule interviews and test and screen applicants.
On the New York Stock Exchange, I.B.M. stock gained 25 cents a share, closing at $90.25.

HEADLINE: Layoffs in the Auto Industry Send Jobless Claims Higher

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Seasonal layoffs in the auto industry and other industrial cutbacks threw nearly a half-million workers into the jobless ranks in late November, just weeks after factory orders registered the first increase since July.
The Labor Department said today that 471,000 people filed initial unemployment claims for the week that ended on Nov. 23, up 57,000 from the previous week. 
 President Bush, at a news conference, conceded that "economic growth is sluggish at best."
He added, "People are out of work, and we need to get this country back on its feet, people back on the job." Mr. Bush said he would make several major economic proposals in his State of the Union Message in January.
The President also said he would speed up about $9.7 billion in Government payments and benefits to help spur the economy.
 
Evidence Increases
 The Labor Department's jobless claims report provided further evidence that the economy is at a standstill or is sinking back into recession.
"It's not a death spiral," said David Rolley of DRI-McGraw Hill. "It just means we're on the bottom. We've stalled out."
Robert Dederick of the Northern Trust Company said, "The economy is rapidly spinning its wheels, trying to make up its mind whether its going to gather strength or slide back."
The jobless claims report all but erased the previous week's decline of 80,000, to 414,000. That was seen as a fluke, because it reflected a week in which unemployment offices were closed on Veterans Day.
Over the last month, jobless claims, a good but not foolproof gauge of how many people have been laid off in a given week, have averaged 458,000 a week, analysts said. That is a worrisome number, they said, especially when compared with the four-week average of August and September, when it was a much more moderate 400,000.
 
7% Rate Predicted
 Many economists predicted, before the Labor Department's report on Friday on the unemployment rate, that the rate will have climbed to 6.9 percent or 7 percent, from 6.8 percent in October. If the rate hits 7 percent, that would match the highest level of the recession, when unemployment hit a five-year high of 7 percent in July.
Economists also think Friday's report will show that companies are still cutting their work forces. The number of payroll jobs could tumble by up to 75,000, analysts said.
If the news is as weak as expected, some analysts said, the Federal Reserve might be prompted to provide new cuts in interest rates to try to prod the economy.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off on Expectations Of More Interest-Rate Cuts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slumped yesterday on foreign exchange markets on expectations that interest rates here might continue to fall.
Gold prices rose in New York after falling earlier in Europe. Republic National Bank quoted gold at $366.50 an ounce at 4 P.M., up $1.60 from Wednesday's late bid. 
 Traders said worries that interestrates might be headed lower and that November unemployment data to be released today would show more weakness kept pressure on the dollar. Falling rates make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
At the same time, analysts said it appeared the currency market had overreacted a day earlier to the Soviet Union's plans to halt payments for a year on the principal portion of its foreign debt.
Some traders sold German marks on Wednesday because of the potential impact of that development on German banks and the German economy. But Jeffrey Mondschein, managing director of foreign exchange at the Continental Bank in Chicago, said traders reconsidered the situation yesterday and bought marks once again.
Germany left its interest rates unchanged, and Mr. Mondschein said traders still believed German rates would hold steady or move higher.
With expectations of further rate declines, he said those developments would widen the difference between rates in Germany and the United States, making the mark more appealing and the dollar less attractive.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.85 yen, down 0.40 yen from Wednesday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 128.65 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 128.70 yen from 129.10 yen late Wednesday.
In London, the pound was quoted at $1.7935, compared with $1.7730 late Wednesday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.7965 from $1.7835.
Late dollar rates in New York compared with late rates on Wednesday also included: 1.5885 German marks, down from 1.6015; 1.4050 Swiss francs, down from 1.4160; 5.4315 French francs, down from 5.4750; 1,202 Italian lire, down from 1,210; and 1.13795 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13715.
Silver for current delivery rose 2.2 cents an ounce to $4.026 on New York's Comex.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Why Fiscal Policy Has to Have Soul

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the United States economy in worse shape than the official statistics disclose? Or is the national mood simply a lot worse than the economic data warrant?
The Commerce Department's shift this week to a new set of figures for tracking the United States economy is intended to put the economy into sharper focus, even though it may muddy the waters for people accustomed to thinking in the old terms. The new approach focuses on gross domestic product -- or what is produced within United States borders -- rather than gross national product, which included income earned by Americans companies and individuals abroad as well as at home. In addition, the department moved to 1987 prices from 1982 prices. 
 Whichever figures are used, there is an undeniable disparity between the pattern showed by the statistics, of a recovery, albeit sluggish, following a short recession, and the deep anxiety that people have been expressing at the ballot boxes, in consumer surveys, in the marketplace and to each other. It is an anxiety deeper than in the recession of 1981-82 or earlier postwar recessions.
One source of the gap between economic data and people's perceptions may be their sense that the morning in America of the Reagan years did not turn everything around, but left the nation and its businesses and people with a pile of debts that will take years to pay off and that could breed a financial catastrophe.
There is widespread awareness that living standards for most people have been stagnating and that life is harder for the young than it was for their parents. With the increase in many social problems -- ranging from crime to health care to homelessness to urban decay -- growing, many blame the politicians for offering no public philosophy or believable solutions. And, on this 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, many fear the United States is losing out to Japan economically.
Economics is not just about production data, money and prices; it is also about people. A Stanford economist, Tibor Scitovsky, in his 1976 book "The Joyless Consumer," sought to link motivational psychology to economics. Work means more to most people than just a way of getting income; it may be the core of their life. Unemployment, and fear of unemployment, can undermine their confidence in themselves and their society.
Conversely, hope is energizing. In the current issue of the Quarterly Journal of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, published in Rome, Mr. Scitovsky wrote, "Needless to say, I was not the first economist to realize this and try to distinguish the different sources of human satisfaction." He notes that Joseph A. Schumpeter spoke of the entrepreneur's creative urge and John Maynard Keynes spoke of his animal spirits.
The standard cures for depressed spirits are based on money; tax cuts or expenditure increases. President Bush's chief economist, Michael J. Boskin, this week hinted that a sizable, temporary tax cut may be offered by the President if the economy does not rally in the coming months. Yesterday, President Bush, calling the economy sluggish at best, said he was speeding up $9.7 billion in various Government payments and benefits to help "get this country back on its feet."
Democratic politicians are discussing such stimuli as reshuffling taxes to the rich from the middle class and poor, temporary tax cuts for all and expenditure increases.
But the polls are showing that many ordinary people oppose further tax cuts in the face of the swelling budget deficit. And some conservatives, in both parties, are concerned about the long-run consequences on savings, investment and economic growth of deepening the huge structural budget deficit. They know the Keynesian arguments for ignoring the deficit for short-term stimulative purposes. But they also know the difficulty of increasing taxes when the need for tax cuts is past and or of slashing spending programs once they are undertaken.
The people's concerns may be rational, but not conventionally rational, in the economist's meaning of rationality as a narrow calculus of self- interest. They see genuine reasons for concern about where the nation and their own lives are going, and they are looking for leadership. A revival of animal spirits would help, but they are not just animals out there.

Mystery Cabinets
Almost as quickly as Sotheby's issued the catalogue of its Dec. 13 London sale of French and Continental furniture and tapestries, tongues began wagging. One of the sale's star offerings -- a pair of Louis XIV ebony cabinets decorated with Boulle ormolu marquetry -- looked awfully familiar. Experts in the rarefied world of fine French furniture believed the cabinets had been among the most prized pieces in the celebrated Patino Collection. Sotheby's sold this collection of furniture and decorative objects, which had belonged to Antenor Patino, the Bolivian tin magnate, to an unnamed buyer on Nov. 1, 1986, for $797,500. 
 A Sotheby's spokesman said that the auction house could not divulge a purchaser's name without permission. But insiders in the art world are convinced that the 1986 buyer was Basia Piasecka Johnson of Princeton, N.J., who is the widow of J. Seward Johnson of the pharmaceuticals family. Mrs. Johnson, through a spokesperson, declined to comment.
Two questions arise. Why is the pair of cabinets back on the block five years later without a mention of the Patino provenance and with a significantly lower estimate? (In the 1986 Patino sale, Sotheby's experts were quoting a figure of between $400,000 and $600,000. Today, it expects to sell the pieces for between $354,000 and $530,000.)
And why, according to the most recent catalogue description, has a large front mount been replaced when they were all listed as original five years ago?
A source at the auction house who would speak only on condition of anonymity said that this is what happened: Mrs. Johnson made the purchase, but soon afterward she began questioning the authenticity of the cabinets. (Sotheby's acknowledges only that a question of authenticity arose.)
Three experts chosen by mutual agreement were then called in to look at the pieces, said Matthew Weigman, manager of auction information at Sotheby's, and all three said the pair of cabinets was authentic.
But Mrs. Johnson no longer wanted the cabinets, sources said. And since she had never paid her bill, Sotheby's kept the pieces in storage. Eventually the auction house decided to ship them to London for its December furniture sale. "During the process of shipping, one of the mounts was lost," Mr. Weigman said. "Restorers replaced it, which accounts for the lower estimate."
On the question of omitting the Patino provenance, Mr. Weigman said: "It was an oversight. But it will be corrected during the exhibition."
 
Against Sell Offs
 Last month the Rose Art Museum of Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., sold 11 Impressionist and modern works by such artists as Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec and Vuillard at Christie's in New York for a total of $3.65 million. The museum said the money would help pay for conservation and educational expenses as well as for future acquisitions.
Other institutions, including the Barnes Foundation near Philadelphia and Westbrook College in Portland, Me., have taken similar steps recently to cope with rising operating costs.
But not everyone thinks these new financial strategies are a good idea. The Association of Art Museum Directors, based in New York, has now issued a code of ethics stating that any museum that sells, or deaccessions, works of art from its collection for any purpose other than buying art will no longer be able to participate in loan exhibitions with any of the association's 160 museum members.
Millicent Hall Gaudieri, the executive director of the association, said the board voted unanimously for the change.
Phillipe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an association member though not a trustee, said that "to use proceeds from deaccessioned works of art for anything other than acquisitions is condemnable.
"People give works of art for augmenting a museum's collections," Mr. de Montebello said, "and it is our responsibility to respect our donors' intentions."
The directors are also expected to issue a policy statement before February that describes the proper use of funds by its membership. "This is an issue of considerable importance, and Brandeis is just one of a growing number of cases," said Mary Gardner Neill, the president of the Association of Art Museum Directors and director of the Yale University Art Gallery.
"There are always alternatives to deaccessioning," she added. For example, Ms. Neill cited the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum, both of which now rotate the hours at their galleries, rather than keeping all of them open full time. These museums have also made staff cuts recently. "It's time to be more imaginative financially," Ms. Neill said.
But David Rosen, a vice president for public affairs at Brandeis, maintains that the museum had few options and that the money raised selling the art was not used for "heat and electricity." He explained that he did not consider the money going to conservation or education as operating expenses. "They don't take into account institutions like ours where education is crucial to our existence," Mr. Rosen said.
 
Disappointment in London
 Results of this week's auctions of Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculpture at Sotheby's and Christie's in London indicate that the art market is still soft. The patterns in London were a replay of last month's auctions in New York where private collectors dominated the buying and seemed reluctant to spend more than $1 million for any work of art. And works that did sell, generally went for the low estimates.
At Christie's evening sale, 24 works were sold and 24 did not find buyers. The total was $12,746,624, well below Christie's projected $22 million to $35 million estimate. Sotheby's sale fared a bit better, bringing in a total of $18,254,000. But this figure was also much lower than its $35 million to $45 million estimate.
"It was a hit-and-miss sale," said James Roundell, the director of Impressionist and modern pictures and drawings at Christie's in London. "There were no wild-card bids. The dealers were there, but they were just watching. As usual in a market like this, 90 percent of those who attended were just watching." Leading the sale was Pissarro's "Gelee Blanche, Femme du Bois," which was sold for $3,291,200.
At Sotheby's, David Nash, who heads its department of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, also confirmed that the London sales echoed what the auction house experienced in New York. "But in London I was encouraged by the popularity of works on paper, because the amount of money needed to buy them is not astronomical," he said. The first part of Sotheby's sale, offering 19th-century French paintings and drawings from a European private collector, proved his point. A Millet drawing was sold to a Japanese dealer for $1,014,000, a record for a drawing by the artist. Another record for a drawing was Daumier's "Parade," which was sold for $682,000. Also from that collection was the evening's top lot, Delacroix's "Tete d'Etude d'Une Indienne," which was sold for $1.4 million, just under the low estimate.
One big disappointment and an interesting indicator of where the market is today was a Monet "Nympheas," which failed to sell. "In 1986 before the Japanese entered the market it was worth $1.5 million," Mr. Nash said. "In 1990 it soared to $10 million. Now in 1991 bidding stopped at $5 million."
 
High Hopes for Berlin
 With the economy depressed in the major art centers -- London, Paris and New York City -- dealers and auction houses are looking to Berlin as the next area of expansion. Sotheby's and Christie's have both opened large Berlin offices in the past year, and major art galleries both here and abroad are rushing to find space in the city's prime neighborhood, the area bound by Fasanenstrasse and Kurfurstendamm. Karsten Greve, a contemporary-art gallery, for example, is closing its Paris house and moving to Berlin. Eric Franck, a Geneva-based contemporary art gallery, is opening a Berlin branch. Even German galleries like Wolfgang Wegner, from Bremin, and Wolfgang Wittrock, based in Dusseldorf, are opening there.
"Berlin is a city poised for growth," said William O'Reilly, a co-owner of the Manhattan-based Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, who opened a branch in Berlin this fall. "When we were looking for a European location, we chose Berlin because we think it will reclaim the rich cultural heritage it once had."
Mr. O'Reilly, like many other players in the art world, is also banking on the strong interest in fine arts among the Germans, the country's relatively stable economy and Berlin's rising real-estate market. They are also riding on the coattails of many big banks who are establishing German bases. "The German market has enormous growth potential," said Michael Ainslie, president of Sotheby's Holdings.
So firm is Sotheby's belief in the Berlin market that it has begun holding auctions there. The first, on May 30, was a sale of German 20th-century art. It totaled $4.3 million, and 28 percent of the works failed to sell. Just last week, on Nov. 28, the house held its second Berlin sale of 20th-century German art, which did badly -- the auction totaled only $1.8 million, and 46 percent of the works did not find buyers. These poor results don't seem to bother Sotheby's. "We see this as a long-term strategy," said Mr. Ainslie.
Christie's, on the other hand, has no plans to hold auctions in Berlin, but they are hoping to attract German sellers. "We don't want to weaken London and New York," said Francois Curiel, president of Christie's in Europe. "But right now Germany is one of the most active countries in the art market and one that has not been affected by the recession. In fact, Paris and Berlin are competing to become the art capital of Europe by 1993. And from the way things look now, Berlin may well be the winner."

Of Bookings and Possible Bumpings
If you haven't noticed the vultures circling Broadway lately, look again. There is a booking crunch for the second half of the season, when activity traditionally picks up. That means there are too many shows for the theaters available. And finding the right home for a show can mean its life or death, both artistically and at the box office. 
 The unspoken rule is never to talk about booking a theater that has a show running, lest you invoke any evil spirits for your own. But with the stakes high in this recessionary economy, people seem willing to take their chances.
One of the biggest questions is where Jerry Zaks's highly anticipated revival of "Guys and Dolls" will go. He has been paid a salary by Jujamcyn Theaters for more than a year, and this show is an opportunity for that investment to pay off. Although the idea was to put it into Jujamcyn's Martin Beck Theater, no one counted on the longevity of its current occupant, "Grand Hotel." And though the show's gross for the week of Nov. 18 (printed in Variety this week as $248,233 of a potential $485,000) would seem to cast doubt on its ability to pull through the tough weeks before Christmas, and the annual January slump, Marvin Krauss, a co-producer and general manager, says that Cyd Charisse has just been signed and will play her first performance on New Year's Eve.
"I told Jujamcyn my estimate on when 'Grand Hotel' will run is at least until Labor Day," he says. "Last week and this week are blockbusters. And Jujamcyn is a major investor in this show. Who even knows if 'Guys and Dolls' will work?"
But Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, doesn't quite see it that way. "What if 'Grand Hotel' runs through March and as a result we lose 'Guys and Dolls' and have an empty theater for nine months to a year," he says. "That is not a prospect I welcome."
Still, for safety, "Guys and Dolls" sets are also being designed for the Marquis, the Gershwin and the Virginia. (Only the Virginia is a Jujamcyn house; the two others are Nederlanders.) "City of Angels" is at the Virginia, and Mr. Landesman says it remains unclear how it will fare in January. In any case, another musical, "Jelly's Last Jam," starring Gregory Hines, also wants the Virginia. Michael David, a co-producer of "Guys and Dolls," says the Gershwin may prove to be too large. The Marquis's availability will be determined after "Nick and Nora" finally opens on Sunday.
And what about next fall's booking, already in place at the Marquis, of "The Goodbye Girl," the Neil Simon movie turned musical with a score by Marvin Hamlisch? Whichever show is there, chances are it will have to move, says Arthur Rubin, the executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization. Its commitment to Mr. Simon, he says, is solid. And why not? Mr. Simon's "Lost In Yonkers" is playing at the Nederlander-owned Richard Rodgers Theater, and his new play, "Jake's Women," will open at the Nederlander-owned Neil Simon Theater next spring.
Then there's the Brooks Atkinson, now dark, another Nederlander house, which may or may not have Mike Nichols's production of "Death and the Maiden," an Ariel Dorfman three-character play starring Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss and maybe Juliet Stevenson, the British actress. The maybe is pending approval by the Actor's Equity Alien Committee. And if "Maiden" goes to the Atkinson, it will bump "Redwood Curtain," a new Lanford Wilson play directed by Marshall Mason. Their alternative, says its co-producer Tanya Berezin, might either be the Nederlander Theater or the Lunt Fontanne, a large Nederlander house usually reserved for musicals on the scale of "Peter Pan." Its current tenant is the comedy revue "Catskills on Broadway." "Redwood Curtain" is a three-character drama. Stay tuned.
 
A Leap Into the Lap of Stardom
 If you can't stand to hear one more thing about Asta, try this heartwarming cat tale. Casey, who co-stars in Israel Horovitz's "Park Your Car in Harvard Yard," with Jason Robards and Judith Ivey, was rescued from the pound by a friend of the show's stage manager. He auditioned, but lost the part. Then in a stunning show-biz twist, the cat who had been cast didn't work out (you know, artistic differences) and Casey replaced him.
Since then, he has become such a favorite of the Broadway show's stagehands that he was recently given a lifetime membership card to Local 1, their union. And since everyone in the theater knows that stagehands are better paid than playwrights, Mr. Horovitz might want to sit up and take notice. He has personally been paying a few hundred dollars a week to have his name included on an extra line in "Harvard Yard's" ABC ads. Shirley Herz, the show's press agent, says the producer, Robert Whitehead, "had contractually agreed to run Mr. Horovitz's name in those ads three times a week, because every day was too expensive." When Mr. Horovitz insisted, Ms. Herz says, Mr. Whitehead arranged to deduct the money from the playwright's royalties.
Does Mr. Horovitz feel that his name sells the show? "I pay because I am proud of the play," he says. Maybe Casey could arrange a loan.
 
Hall of Fame for Bancroft and Adler
 Roger Stevens and Earl Blackwell, the co-chairmen of the Theater Hall of Fame, have announced its inductees for 1991. They are the actors Anne Bancroft, Stella Adler, Gene Kelly, and posthumously, Charles Gilpin, who first played Othello on Broadway; the composers Cy Coleman and Harold Rome; the director Gene Saks; the costume designer Patricia Zipprodt; the choreographer Hanya Holm, and, also posthumously, the producer Theresa Helburn of the Theater Guild.
The ceremony will take place at the Gershwin Theater on Jan. 27. The theater owner and producer James M. Nederlander will receive the Arnold Weissberger Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Theater, and special tributes will be paid to Joseph Papp and Colleen Dewhurst.
 
For Sunday Nights, a Variety Show

Something to ease the pain on Sunday nights: Rainbow and Stars has started "Varieties," a revue that will run through Dec. 29. A performing ensemble appears weekly, including Jason Graae, Adam Green and Douglas Bernstein. On Dec. 15, one guest act will be a duet with Rita McKenzie, an Ethel Merman impersonator, and Carole Shelley, as Mary Martin. They will sing a famous medley that Merman and Martin did for the Ford 50th Anniversary Special, broadcast in 1953. On Dec. 29, Chris Durang and Dawne will be there.


GRAPHIC: Shirley Knight has been cast in the American premiere of Edward Albee's "Marriage Play," which is to open at the Alley Theater in Houston in January and move to the McCarter in Princeton, N.J., in February. Mr. Albee will direct the two-character play, co-starring Tom Klunis, about the end of a 23-year marriage. It is his first new work to be produced in this country since 1983.

Borscht Belt Humor Goes to Town

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
The title of the show "Catskills on Broadway" deserves a truth-in-advertising award. With these four stand-up comics at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, you pay your money and you get the jokes, unless you happen to miss the punch lines because of the laughter.
Appropriately, the show begins with a quick, clever montage of photographs of celebrities and guests enjoying themselves at diverse hotels. The song "Comedy Tonight" is heard in the background. For receptive theatergoers, "Catskills on Broadway" offers something familiar, and something entertaining. Is Broadway ready for the Catskills? Do Catskill hotels serve too much food? 
 One-liners and ethnic wisecracks speed by as these jokesmiths offer their shtick in trade, just as they would if they were performing their routines in a nightclub. Despite the presence of a director, Larry Arrick, there is no special adaptation to the Broadway stage. Expect no newness here, although there are updated variations on old themes. The comics, three men and a woman, deliver a spritz of recognition.
Freddie Roman, who conceived the show and is the opening act, reflects on his boyhood in Queens. After knocking today's cinderblock cineplexes, where if you leave a theater to go to the bathroom "you forget which movie you're seeing," he remembers the grandeur of Loew's Valencia. The mere mention of that palace evokes an audible sigh from theatergoers. Responding to nostalgic references, the audience becomes an integral part of the show, so much so that Mr. Roman is forced to interrupt and comment, "Who's working here?"
His effervescence becomes infectious as he shifts targets from the Catskills to Florida. He pinpoints the problem of retirees living in perpetual sunshine until their grandchildren arrive for their annual holiday visit, when it rains every day. By his own description, Mr. Roman is a semi-chubby man in the midst of a midlife crisis, and he is as personal as his medical report. "I took a cholesterol test," he says. "My number came back 911."
Finishing his finely honed routine, he introduces Dick Capri, followed by Marilyn Michaels and Mal Z. Lawrence. Mr. Capri, who adds an Italian-American note to a mostly Jewish field of humor, is the most predictable of the four comedians. But he serves at least one useful purpose: He lets the audience catch its breath between laughs.
Then Ms. Michaels appears, backed by a band, to deliver deft and often daft imitations. Of the comics, she has the most individualized talent. The objects of her mimicry are so instantly identifiable that there is no need for her to introduce them by name.
Her booming version of Ethel Merman imperils the chandelier, and her Elizabeth Taylor assumes a tremolo. After raining on Barbra Streisand's parade, she tosses off a passing impression of Jackie Mason, who, of course, is the role model for the current entertainment. Ms. Michael's chef d'oeuvre is a three-minute version of "The Wizard of Oz," in which she imitates Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Toto, the witches and the munchkins, one of whom sounds suspiciously like Dr. Ruth.
Mr. Lawrence, who has a ponytail and the manner of a Borscht Belt hipster, winds up the show with a rapid-fire monologue that races from the mountains to the shore, in this case Atlantic City, which he says is not a city but a bus terminal. Proving his point, he takes the audience aboard a bus dense with geriatric gamblers.
"Catskills on Broadway" manages to reproduce the ambiance of the Catskills. The basic difference is that on Broadway there is not a nosh in sight. But there is a groaning board of jokes about eaters and stuffers. As Mr. Lawrence observes, everyone in the Catskills wears warm-up suits. Warming up for what, he asks, sumo wrestling?
After every comic has had a 30-minute spot, the show ends with a chorus of one-liners as each tries to top the others. They could keep going for hours. Catskill resorts may be fighting the recession, but Catskill comedy has not lost its flair.

HEADLINE: Trenton Panel Supports Plan For Welfare

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The New Jersey Legislature took a significant step today to advance a controversial plan for revising the welfare system by, among other things, trying to discourage welfare mothers from bearing more children.
A pivotal committee of the Legislature today approved a package of bills that would drastically revise New Jersey's welfare system, among other things barring additional benefits to any welfare mother who gives birth to another child while receiving benefits. 
 The six-bill package, written and strongly supported by the Assembly's Democratic majority leader, Wayne Bryant of Camden, is intended to break the cycle of welfare dependency. It also includes provisions intended to encourage employment and education as well as a stipulation that benefits could continue even if the recipient married a wage-earner.
 
A Senate Pledge
 The approval of the package by the Assembly's Health and Human Services Committee means that the bills can go to the Appropriations Committee, which is expected to approve them. The package is likely to come to the floor of the Assembly for a vote sometime before the Democratically controlled lame-duck session of the Legislature ends in January and a solid Republican majority takes control.
The Senate President, John A. Lynch, a New Brunswick Democrat, has pledged to bring the bills to a vote in that house.
Privately, legislative leaders say the package has a good chance of being approved in toto despite opposition by church groups and others who fear that the denial of benefits for additional children in a welfare family would serve only to hurt the children. Gov. Jim Florio has not committed himself on the Bryant proposals, but he has said he would welcome changes that would break the cycle of welfare dependence, the pattern in which the children and even the grandchildren of welfare recipients remain in the system. The Bryant bills have also undergone revisions, including amendments attached today, and may undergo further changes before they reach the Democratic Governor, if they do.
Mr. Bryant, who said he discussed his proposals at a White House meeting with Bush Administration aides last month, said he knew of no other state considering such sweeping changes in the welfare system.
In public hearings across the state, witnesses have generally accepted the premise of the welfare revision package but have questioned whether it might ultimately hurt children cut off from welfare funds by the fact that their mothers were in the system when they were born.
 
A 'Punitive' Provision
 That objection was raised again at the committee session today by Cecilia Zalkind, associate director of the Association for Children of New Jersey. The cutoff provision, she maintained, "is punitive and directed toward the most vulnerable segment of our population, the children."
"I think we should not lose sight of how difficult it is for poor families to live as it is," she said.
But Mr. Bryant, representing Camden, the poorest city in the state, where a majority of the residents receive some form of public assistance, argued that the system did not encourage parents to take responsibility for their children.
"If you decide to enlarge your family," he said, "that is great. But if you do, you should do as I do -- get a job and earn more money."
Mr. Bryant, who is black, maintains that the welfare system is particularly injurious to poor blacks and has called it "a modern form of slavery."
The pending legislation seeks to encourage welfare parents, particularly those who have additional children while in the system, to seek employment by allowing recipients to earn as much as 25 percent of their monthly grants without losing any grant money.
The system, Mr. Bryant said, breeds both irresponsibility and criminal behavior. "Sixty-four percent of the welfare population comes from three counties in the state, and 50 percent of the jail population comes from the same three counties," he said. The counties are Essex, Hudson and his own Camden County.
 
Incentives in Package
 But while the ban on increasing aid to a mother who gives birth to another child while on welfare has received the most attention, Mr. Bryant's package also includes incentives intended to encourage education and preservation of the family.
One provision, for example, would allow continued benefits for the children of a mother who marries, even if the husband is employed, so long as the family's total annual income does not exceed 150 percent of the official poverty level.
Mr. Bryant argues that the present system discourages a man from marrying a woman with children receiving assistance through the Aid to Families With Dependent Children program because that assistance would be cut off or reduced and he would have to support the family.
"The promotion of two-parent families among A.F.D.C. recipients," the pending legislation maintains, "should enable more recipients to become economically self-sufficient."
 
Employment Incentives
 A central part of Mr. Bryant's welfare revision program is called the Family Development Act. It would provide incentives to welfare recipients to seek employment and assistance, like training and transportation, in doing so.
An able-bodied welfare recipient whose youngest child was older that 2, for example, would be required to participate in an educational program, vocational assessment and training or some form of employment, or have their benefits reduced for refusing to do so without good reason. Day-care services, to be bought through a voucher, and other assistance, including transportation, would be part of the program.
The family development program would intitially be limited to the counties of Hudson, Essex and Camden and would be phased in statewide over the next two years.
Mr. Bryant acknowledged that putting into effect some provisions of the legislation, like denial of benefits under certain conditions and the changes in allowable earned income levels, would require waivers from existing Federal regulations.

HEADLINE: Border War on Lake Champlain Waste

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TICONDEROGA, N.Y.

 BODY:
Hostilities have erupted between New Yorkers and Vermonters over the operation of a giant paper mill here that discharges waste into Lake Champlain.
In a charge led by Vermont's Governor, Howard Dean, Vermont environmentalists are demanding that New York State officials force the International Paper Company mill to use oxygen instead of chlorine to bleach its paper products. They contend that the byproducts of the chlorine process are carcinogenic. 
 "I don't view I.P. as the bad guys, but we have to ask them to use the best technology available," the Governor said.
But officials and employees of International Paper, the area's largest employer, argue that the chemicals discharged by the mill have not been proven to cause cancer, and that switching technologies would price their products out of the market.
 
'A Cost Disadvantage'
 "For this mill alone to have to convert would put us at a cost disadvantage," said Jill Kurtz, a spokeswoman for the mill. The company also argues that there is no guarantee that the new technology works.
At issue are chemicals known as organochlorines, which are byproducts of chlorine bleaching. Of all the organochlorines, dioxin has become the most feared, partly because it is a chemical name the public has widely come to associate with cancer.
International Paper contends dioxin levels are undetectable in the water of Lake Champlain, which is used for drinking water by some communities. There is no third-party study of the dioxin level of the lake, which is the northeast boundary of New York and the northwest boundary of Vermont.
Tension between the two states came to a head in mid-November at a New York Department of Environmental Conservation hearing to take testimony on a new discharge permit for International Paper, which releases 18 million gallons of waste water a day into the lake.
 
Wrong Arrowsw and Vandalism
 On the way to Ticonderoga for the hearing, members of the Vermont delegation said, they were purposely misled by handmade road arrows and greeted with signs like: "Environment Yuppies Leave Mill-Worker Jobs Alone, Our Mill Does Not Pollute." Afterward, Elizabeth McLain, Vermont's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, discovered her car had been splashed with yellow paint.
In the hearing, Ms. McLain was criticized by Thomas C. Jorling, head of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, who told her he found it "disconcerting to hear that we should do more from a state that's not doing as much as we are doing." This apparently was a reference to Vermont's water-quality standards not meeting the Federal requirements for toxin substances, while New York's do.
"My understanding is that Tom Jorling used to be an environmentalist," Governor Dean said in a later interview. "He clearly is not the same person now."
Ms. Kurtz said the draft of a new discharge permit includes more stringent requirements for pollution control and monitoring than the one issued in 1984. The draft sets a dioxin discharge limit of 18 parts per quadrillion, about 36 tablespoons for the entire lake; before that number was a guideline. The proposed permit also requires more frequent testing and for more substances. A final version of the permit is due in early March; the draft has not satisfied the delegation from Vermont.
Because no one has demonstrated that dioxin causes cancer in humans, International Paper officials say the worrying is excessive. But Alan McIntosh, a specialist in water toxicology at the University of Vermont, said he believes there is sufficient evidence for concern.
"Based on tests on rats and fish, there is experimental evidence to show that organochlorines are carcinogenic," said Mr. McIntosh, who will head up a two-year Government study of toxins in Lake Champlain.
Mill workers and townspeople demonstrated for the company at the hearing, fearing that a mill producing paper neither white enough or nor cheap enough to compete in the marketplace would soon be out of business.
 
Big Employer in Hard Times
 International Paper employs 850 people, 75 percent of whom live in Essex County, where the unemployment rate in October reached 9 percent, compared with the state average of 6.9 percent. The mill also provides a large amount of business to loggers on both sides of the lake.
Patrick Robins, a Burlington businessman who sits on the Lake Champlain Management Conference, said, "It all seems to be a green agenda over here, green as in environmentalist. There's a green agenda over there, but there it's about green dollars."
Governor Dean, a doctor, said that Vermont has "never wanted to ask I.P. to shut down, just to change technology." He also said that Vermont is prepared to provide a market for paper bleached through oxygenation.
"We intend to put our money where our mouth is," he said.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Jittery Over Gunfire Threats

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROXBURY TOWNSHIP, N.J., Dec. 5

 BODY:
Christmas and commerce at the Roxbury Mall are mixed this year with threats of sniper fire, extra police patrols, bitter merchants, jittery shoppers and the angry residue of financial trouble.
Someone shot out at least 14 windows at the mall late one November night and -- a few days later -- left on car windshields, in neighborhood mailboxes and at the Shop Rite supermarket about 100 hand-lettered fliers warning shoppers of sniper fire during business hours. "Your life will be in danger," the leaflets said. "This is your only warning!" 
 The police say the shootings and the leaflets are the work of one or two among the 100 or so subcontractors who helped enlarge the mall from 14 to 46 stores 15 months ago and have not been paid for about $5 million worth of work and material.
 
No More Gunfire
 No one has been hurt so far, and there has been no more gunfire in the night. But an edgy mood prevails among shoppers and store managers, part bravado and defiance and part anxiety.
"No way I'm saying anything," said the owner of a card shop. "This is the time of year that makes or breaks us for the whole year, and it's lousy that this is coming up now."
"We're just sitting here like dead ducks," said another shopkeeper who sought anonymity. "Some of us are afraid, some not. These idiots are going around hurting the small merchant, and that's very unfair because we're already struggling with the economy. If I had somebody's gun, I'd know what to do with it."
At the Continental Hair Salon, Lee Pozar said business had not slipped because of the incidents, adding: "Actually, we're busier at night than in the day. It's like a serious threat that's not being taken seriously."
 
Parking Lots Filled
 At first glance, the threats seem to have had little impact on shopping. At lunchtime today, the 3,200 spaces in the mall's parking lots were filled. Shop Rite was bustling, and 6 of the 14 cash registers at Caldor's were open, each with two or three customers waiting in line.
Nancy Eden, 30 years old, and her boyfriend, Joe Henriquez, 25, emerged with a bag of toys and two children's sleeping bags. "I don't think fliers will stop people from shopping at Christmas," Ms. Eden said. "But if something happens . . ."
"They should picket or boycott or set up stands and do a protest," Mr. Henriquez said of the subcontractors. "Violence and sniper fire with kids around at Christmas is ridiculous. It's the same as them reducing themselves to gangs fighting over crack in New York."
Two women in their 20's, Arlene Liquori and Ida Robak, came to the mall together. "When I first heard about this, I didn't come," Ms. Robak said. "But this week, I'm coming with friends during the day. I wouldn't come at night; I wouldn't feel safe."
 
Business as Usual
 A prime target of November's gunfire was an unfinished three-story office building at the mall's entrance. Three windows at the ground-floor Liberty Travel Agency and two in an adjacent branch of the National Westminster Bank were shot out, Detective Sgt. James Simonetti said.
Michelle Varga, operations supervisor of Liberty Travel, was upbeat. "I honestly don't think it has had any impact on business," Ms. Varga said. "We're open 9 to 9, and people are always coming in and out, just like nothing happened. It's not our fault. We're not involved. We feel sorry for the subcontractors, but they shouldn't be shooting out windows."
November's round of vandalism is the mall's second since its expansion. About a year ago, a small fire was started on a shelf in Caldor's, the police said, and soon afterward tar was poured in air-conditioning ducts. The culprits were never found.
A $10,000 reward has been posted for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the fliers and the shooting, the police said.
 
Dispute Over Payment
 The principals involved in the expansion project disagree on why the subcontractors were not paid. The mall's owner, Salvatore Davino, head of the Fidelity Land Development Corporation of Chatham, said his company had paid the general contractor, Modular Structures Inc., of North Branch, $15.7 million, of which $10.5 million was paid to subcontractors.
Richard Greene, head of Modular, which has filed for bankruptcy, said of Mr. Davino's figures: "I can't say they're accurate or not accurate." But in a telephone interview he said the mall's owner had failed to pay some requisitions from subcontractors after Modular's contract was terminated when the project fell behind schedule. Mr. Greene declined to provide the amount of the disputed requisitions.
Many of the subcontractors are puzzled. "The subcontractors have no idea why they got stuck," said Robert Kerris, vice president of the Marchelle Corporation, a construction company in West Caldwell. "Nobody really knows what happened." Mr. Kerris said the company had lost about $500,000 on the Roxbury project. "There's a whole lot of people in the middle who got hurt dramatically," he said. "I believe a lot of people lost their companies and their homes. In the 90's, this shouldn't happen. Somebody, somehow, should protect the guy who does all the physical work on a job and then gets stuck. It's always the little guy who gets hurt."
The biggest loser on the job, Gene Smith, who did the mall's masonry and cement work, said he lost $1.2 million. "It's expensive to pursue a suit," he said. "There's not much hope of getting my money out. I might have to go bankrupt myself."

HEADLINE: In New York, the Doctor Is Out

 BODY:
New York State suffers from a surge of public health problems, yet the crucially important posts of State Health Commissioner, New York City Health Commissioner and president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation remain vacant.
Mayor David Dinkins may be forgiven for not having filled the Health and Hospitals post. Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo resigned only recently. But the jobs of City and State Health Commissioners have remained unfilled for months. Dr. Woodrow Myers resigned the city post in May; the state job has been vacant since February, when Dr. David Axelrod suffered a stroke. 
 City officials say good health commissioners are hard to recruit because first-rank physicians and health system managers usually take a big pay cut when they accept public service. Yet the state's search committee found a promising candidate in Dr. Mark Chassin, a former Federal Medicare administrator and Rand Corporation researcher who was nominated by the Governor this summer.
The problem in Albany is the State Senate, which has neglected its duty to hold confirmation hearings. Senator Mark Tully, the Long Island Republican who heads the Senate's Health Committee, now says he won't even call a hearing until January. That would be nearly a year after Dr. Axelrod's departure, even though the prospect of a special budget session this month provides the chance for immediate action.
Meanwhile the state's health problems multiply: tuberculosis, measles, AIDS and drug abuse are epidemic. Medicaid costs have exploded alarmingly. New York City's staggering public hospitals are locked in bruising negotiations with private affiliates -- a problem that underscores the need to appoint a new H.H.C. president.
Mr. Tully says he wants to postpone hearings until the full Senate reconvenes because these issues are so complex. On the contrary. The health urgencies make it imperative to confirm the new commissioner as soon as possible.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Thank Them Not

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Now that the last American hostage is free, so is the Government of the United States. It is free at last to use a political weapon that might prevent other Americans from being taken prisoner and held captive year after foul year.
The weapon is the truth -- the truth about the terrorist organizations that took the Americans prisoner, about how the terrorist states organized them, paid them, how they kept them in guns, Mercedeses, safe houses and money, and how they could have stopped the kidnappings almost as soon as they began, quite possibly before. 
 Until Terry Anderson was "liberated" by the kidnappers and their masters, a privately spoken case was sometimes made by Washington for holding back on the truth. The argument was that speaking candidly would have meant a political indictment of Iran, the country that inspired, organized and maintained the various Holy War gangs, and Syria, the country that allowed them to operate their prisons and dungeons on Lebanese territory controlled by Syrian troops and police.
That kind of honesty might have made it more difficult for Syria and Iran to carry out their cynical end-game charade of suddenly discovering that after all they did have enough influence with the kidnappers to open the cell doors.
It was a decent case, but it had great weaknesses. It permitted hostage-taking to go on for seven years and it provided no credible threat of penalty either for the kidnappers or their sponsors. And it led the U.S., its Western allies and Israel into one devious deal after another with the criminal nations.
But those years have already been lost, those tears already all shed, except of course by relatives of hostages who are in their graves. Two questions now must be faced -- punishment and prevention.
Don't hold your breath until the terrorists pay any sort of price for chaining men to walls, torturing them and their families -- or until the terrorist states are held to payable account for not ordering them freed.
Iran and Syria are safe from retribution. Teheran offers economic deals. Syria protects itself simply -- with the Western illusion that it is the great hope for Mideast peace. Syria, imagine. The Western and Israeli landscape is littered with the careers of diplomats who thought they could outmaneuver Hafez al-Assad.
But still we can hope that Washington will at least find the courage to tell the truth. Iran and Syria could have freed the prisoners years ago, and ended hostage-taking as a strategy of Mideast terrorism, had they so wished. But they so wished only when in their own sweet time they decided the hostages were squeezed dry and that it would be more profitable to release them than have them kept, or killed.
And for that, the U.S. thanks the Syrians and Iranians. Hostages are paraded in front of a portrait of Hafez al-Assad -- as that little British boy was forced to stare terrified into the face of Saddam Hussein and suffer his touch.
But this time our own Ambassador is there. Standing among the smirking Syrian diplomats and police agents he has to utter some unctuous blather. I hope that he longed to raise his finger and point it straight at them.
Hostage-taking would never have started had not Iran shown the way by capturing the American Embassy staff in Teheran. And it is a fantasy, a lie, that once kidnapping started in Lebanon neither Syria nor Iran or both together could persuade kidnappers dependent on them for their very lives to release the prisoners.
Daniel Pipes, a top American specialist on Syria, puts it clearly: Without Syria and Iran the kidnappers are orphans. These Holy War gangs, he says, are not simply allied to Damascus and Teheran -- they were created by them, for them.
President Bush and the State Department have worked hard for the release of the hostages. But morally, politically and legally Syria and Iran are parties to a series of sickening crimes against Americans.
It is in American interests for Mr. Bush to say so in this moment of his own freedom. That will not be a guarantee against more abductions. But it will make them more difficult -- because those who bear the real guilt will be walking around with a brand on their foreheads.

HEADLINE: CHANCES FOR END TO YUGOSLAV WAR SEEM TO BE FADING

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Although Western nations have dramatically stepped up the economic and political pressure against Serbia in recent days, the prospects for a quick end to the war in Yugoslavia remain tenuous at best.
Cyrus R. Vance, the United Nations envoy trying to broker a durable cease-fire and deployment of peacekeeping forces, acknowledged as much today as the 14th truce in the Yugoslav conflict fell apart after several days of increasingly violent clashes. 
 At the close of a week that took him from the battlefields to the capitals of the warring parties, Mr. Vance, a former American Secretary of State, appeared to pour cold water on the possibility of stationing United Nations forces in Yugoslavia anytime soon.
 
Vance Protests Shelling
 "It makes it much harder to even consider it," he said of the reports of widespread fighting in Croatia today. During a visit to Sarajevo, the capital of the ethnically mixed republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, he said he had sent a protest letter to the Yugoslav Defense Minister over the renewed shelling.
"I was outraged to receive news of the shelling of Osijek and Dubrovnik," he said. "It is appalling to think this was going on."
"I will continue to do what I can, but this certainly makes it very difficult," Mr. Vance told reporters.
 
Few Other Options
 European diplomats say that if Mr. Vance's mission fails, the West has few other realistic options to stem a conflict that has already driven 500,000 people from their homes and left thousands of soldiers and civilians dead.
[Citing the shelling in Croatia, the United States announced economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. Page 7.]
Diplomats say Serbia and the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army are comparatively immune to economic sanctions, which in recent days had been expanded to include a ban by Bonn on air and truck traffic between Germany and Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavs work in Germany, and the air route had been among the Yugoslav national airline's most profitable, carrying 170,000 passengers last year. Serbia also relies on German companies for spare parts in various industries.
European Community members have removed preferential tariffs for textiles from Serbia and Montenegro, another Yugoslav republic, and urged the United Nations to impose an oil embargo.
Serbian officials say that they have already drawn up plans to sidestep the sanctions, and that they have already secured supplies of crude oil. Gasoline lines nonetheless persist in regions near the battlefields.
"There is nothing prouder that resisting pressure that is improper, and this is improper," Brana Crncevic, a Serbian writer said this week in a televised panel discussion aimed at explaining "what Serbia wants."
Sanctions have some chance of succeeding over the longer term. Yugoslavia's central bank is furiously printing money to finance the war -- prices rose close to 20 percent last month -- and foreign businesses have suspended investment. Diplomats say economic hardship could eventually kindle popular revulsion against the war and the leaders responsible for prolonging it.
 
An Unproductive Step?
 As for Germany's announced plans to accord diplomatic recognition by Christmas to the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia, many analysts in Belgrade believe it would have the opposite of its intended effect.
Recognition of Croatia, which is strongly opposed by the United States, could well spur the national army to step up its offensive before Croatia can import more powerful weapons from Western nations. The Yugoslav Army is in little danger of running out of armaments, because Yugoslavia's extensive domestic arms industry is mostly in Serbia.
Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President, assailed Washington today for its refusal to endorse recognition.
Yugoslavia is now under a European Community arms embargo. Some figures in Europe, notably the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, have backed recognition as a means of giving Croatia the weapons needed to counter the Yugoslav Army.
A report by exasperated European Community observers in Yugoslavia, disclosed this week, accorded most of the blame for the war to the Serbian-dominated army. It asserted that the generals were waging a cowardly struggle to preserve their perquisites and pensions.
The report raised the possibility of deploying Western military forces -- presumably from air and sea -- to attack the army whenever it indiscriminately shelled civilian areas. But few experts believe that this idea is technically or political feasible in the jumbled battlefields of Yugoslavia.
Mr. Vance's mission has been widely portrayed here as the last real chance for securing peace in Yugoslavia. He has made it clear repeatedly that United Nations peacekeepers will be placed between the two sides only if the fighting stops. This in effect leaves the various military forces in the field, regular and irregular, with veto power over any truce arrangement.
The Croatian radio reported today that 14 people were killed and 71 wounded Thursday in shelling of Osijek, in eastern Croatia. The Associated Press quoted hospital officials as saying that 6 died and 15 were wounded there today.
There were also reports of renewed fighting in the port of Dubrovnik, although the circumstances were unclear. The Croatian radio even reported fighting among rival Croatian units.
 
Memories of World War II
 Belgrade television reported tonight that Croatian forces had opened atank-backed attack against army positions in Lipik, a central Croatian town.
Serbian officials said this week that the war would continue as long as the two million to three million Serbs living outside the republic's borders feel under threat from a Croatian government routinely characterized in Belgrade as "fascist." In nearly every conversation, the Serbians refer to World War II, when the Nazi-installed puppet government of Croatia killed hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies.
Croatia, which has lost one-third of its territory to the combined forces of the national army and Serbian irregulars, contends that it is the victim of a blatant land grab.
"I've been here for three and a half years," a European envoy said. "I've gotten gloomier and gloomier about our ability to coerce, pressure, guide or direct these people to our way of thinking, particularly when it comes to this matter of ethnicity."

HEADLINE: The New Immigrants: Reshaping the Region/A special report;
Wider Mosaic: Suburbs' Jobs Lure Immigrants

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
They still come for all the things that enticed their predecessors: economic opportunity, freedom, a better life for their families. But unlike earlier immigrants, today's new arrivals often bypass New York City, settling in the towns and cities that dot the metropolitan region.
Quickly but quietly, areas that not long ago were fairly homogeneous have changed. Indian saris swish down sidewalks in Edison, N.J. Pastors deliver sermons in Portuguese and Spanish in North Tarrytown, N.Y. Vietnamese restaurants and markets are springing up in the West End of Hartford. Iranians are becoming homeowners in Great Neck, L.I. 
 Some of the new immigrants have tapped an extensive network of friends and relatives already living in communities outside New York City. Others have had the money and savvy to establish themselves in desirable suburbs. Almost all were attracted by job markets that expanded far more quickly in the 1980's than did employment opportunities in the city.
"Traditionally, immigrant groups started out in sizable city enclaves and gradually -- across generations -- fanned outward into the suburbs," said Dr. Richard D. Alba, professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Albany. "Now we have groups that are leapfrogging over the early stages of that process."
In a recent New York Times Poll of the entire New York metropolitan region, 48 percent of those questioned in the suburbs around New York City, as well as in the five boroughs, said their communities were more racially mixed than they were five years ago. Of those who lived from one to two hours from the city, 43 percent said their communities had become more diverse. Just how diverse should become evident early next year when the Census Bureau releases 1990 data on immigrants' country of origin.
"Until the 1980's, a lot of these places saw themselves as completely white, and they were," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, Regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York. "But immigrants tend to be young, innovative and entrepreneurial, and they moved to where the action was."
For the immigrants and for the communities where they move, the changes, while often beneficial to both, have been tinged with bitterness. The newcomers appreciate the jobs, housing and educational opportunities available where they live. They are proud, too, of the businesses that they have established. But they voice frustration over their lack of political influence, obstacles toward advancement in the work place, resentment in some schools and scattered bias attacks.
 
Education
Schools Speak With Many Voices
 The experiences of new arrivals in the region are as diverse as their cultures.
The Japanese executive in Scarsdale, who will probably be returning to Japan in a few years, has a vastly different view of -- and impact on -- the region than, say, the Salvadoran peasant struggling to stake out a new life as a landscaper in Hempstead, L.I.
But one common flash point is the public schools. The rise in bilingual education and special instruction for children for whom English is a second language have strained school districts at a time of intense financial pressures.
In Stamford, Conn., which saw tremendous economic growth in the 1980's, some 30 foreign languages, from Laotian and Russian to Urdu and Creole, are spoken by the students in the 17 public schools. The district now has 20 instructors teaching English as a second language, which is mandated by the state for those whose native language is not English.
Along the Hudson River in Westchester County, the Tarrytown school district is now 40 percent Hispanic, with large numbers of Dominicans and Cubans.
"There is resentment on the part of some parents simply because they know that a very large part of the budget has to be spent getting these children up to speed," said Betsey Hardeman, a former deputy superintendent in Tarrytown. "The basic prejudice comes out when people are dealing with their pocketbooks."
The same tensions, though perhaps more muted, are present in the wealthiest suburbs where many Japanese families have settled, like Scarsdale, in Westchester County, and Greenwich, Conn.
"They create, at the very least, a situation where huge numbers of people need remedial work in English," said John Wheeler, vice president of the Japan Society, a private educational organization promoting United States-Japanese relations. "You also have students worrying that the Japanese are taking their place in terms of test scores."
 
'Work at Integration'
 In Fort Lee, N.J., 688 Korean students and 357 Japanese make up 36 percent of the enrollment in the public school system.
But Dr. Alan W. Sugarman, Superintendent of Schools in the middle-class community overlooking the George Washington Bridge, said social interaction between Asian students and whites -- and even between Japanese and Koreans -- is lacking. "We have to constantly work at integration," he said.
While public schools struggled with the social tensions and educational burdens accompanying the influx of newcomers, the mood in the work place, especially among employers, is one of gratification.
 
Employment
The Willing Hands Of Varying Ability
 "Immigrants in Westchester fill the jobs that Americans disdain," said Luis Andrew Penichet, a lawyer in White Plains and chairman of the county's Hispanic Advisory Board. "They are gardeners, cooks, dishwashers and domestics, and they work like dogs."
That view is supported by the recent New York Times Poll of the metropolitan region, which found that 63 percent of those questioned, both in the city and the suburbs, believe that immigrants take jobs that United States citizens do not want. And about two-thirds in both places said that today's immigrants work harder than people who were born in the United States.
The rapid growth of the region's economy during the 1980's provided employment for many of the new immigrants, whose numbers swelled during that period.
 
Eased Restrictions
 Westchester's Hispanic population rose by 89 percent in the last decade, to 86,000, according to census data, and leaders of the Hispanic community say that illegal aliens probably bring the total number of Hispanic residents to around 120,000.
Changes in United States immigration laws that lifted restrictions from East Asian countries and loosening emigration policies abroad have also brought more skilled workers and professionals to the region, like doctors and computer programmers from Korea, mathematicians and pharmacists from India, translators and theatrical producers from the Soviet Union.
The new arrivals took advantage of the region's economic expansion. Between 1980 and 1990, 660,000 jobs, an increase of 17 percent, were created in the 18 counties of northern New Jersey, the mid-Hudson Valley and Long Island that sweep around New York City. In the same period, jobs in the city increased by 212,000, or 6 percent.
Yet some immigrants believe that their prospects are limited, and they blame discrimination. "The concern of the upper-middle-class Chinese scattered throughout the suburbs is very much the 'glass ceiling,' " said Peter Kwong, the author of "The New Chinatown" and a professor of political science at the State University of New York's College at Old Westbury on Long Island.
"In corporations, in computer firms and engineering firms," he said, "they can be the senior engineer but they can't be the manager. It's a frustration commonly shared by Chinese."
And not all new arrivals slip easily into the work force. In Hartford, for example, some Vietnamese immigrants who arrived without professional skills are struggling. "We put them into vocational courses, but we're not lucky with everyone, and some go on welfare," said Hai Nguyen, a 47-year-old counselor for Catholic Charities Migration and Refugee Services who is herself a former "boat person" plucked from the sea in 1975. "Once they are on welfare, even though it's just a little money, they're pleased since they had even less before."
Mrs. Nguyen lives in Manchester, a suburb of Hartford, with her husband, a senior analyst for an insurance company, and their two youngest children. A third child is in college. A month ago, after a 10-year campaign, she welcomed her mother, father and brother to the United States.
 
Politics
Struggle to Develop Government Role
 If economic gains have been uncertain, those in the political arena have been more elusive still. Typically, immigrants are not concentrated enough to elect, say, an Indian or Korean, leaders of those groups contend.
"What Koreans really feel is that the history of immigration is short, and we don't have any assemblymen, senators, Congressmen or judges," said Dr. Richard S. Rhee, a neurologist in Rumson, N.J., and past president of the Federation of Korean-American Associations of New Jersey. "There is no political clout, no one to turn to with a problem."
Though they have yet to field a candidate, Indians who have settled in Edison, N.J., have begun to organize, outlining agendas and supporting candidates sensitive to their needs. Edison, with a population of 89,000, had 6,000 Indian residents last year, up from only 900 in 1980, according to the Census Bureau.
As their numbers have grown, so have their incomes. "When you're self-sufficient and have money, you have time to get involved in politics, and that time for us has come," said Pradip Kothari, a travel agent and president of both the Indo-American Cultural Society of Edison and the Indian Business Association.
Hispanic people, who are the largest ethnic group in the region, have also made the greatest strides politically. In Hempstead, L.I., where bodegas, video stores and restaurants cater to the island's largest Hispanic community, there is excitement among the village's Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans about their rising political prospects. Recently, some of them gathered to discuss the formation of a political action committee to mobilize Hispanic voters in local elections.
"For the first time we have an Hispanic member on the school board," said Rafael Picon, a civic leader who migrated to Hempstead in the 1950's from Puerto Rico. "That will be only the beginning."
Frank Rey was elected mayor of North Tarrytown last spring, becoming the first Hispanic leader in the history of the village, which is 34 percent Hispanic. North Tarrytown's 2,776 Hispanic residents "are better represented because I'm Spanish," said Mr. Rey, whose mother emigrated from Spain 51 years ago, just before his birth.
 
Opportunity
As Diversity Rises, Options Expand
 More than anything else, one has only to walk down the street -- looking and listening -- to realize the growing diversity of the region.
In North Tarrytown, a video store rents tapes translated into Spanish while a Chilean bakery offers traditional pastries like milhojas and meringues. In the same tiny business district are a Cuban-owned laundromat, a Dominican-owned stationery store, an Argentine-owned television repair shop, a Puerto Rican-owned grocery store.
Two years ago in Great Neck, the Colbeh restaurant opened to serve the growing Iranian community, now estimated to be a few thousand strong. The restaurant offers the only glatt kosher Persian cuisine on Long Island, and also features a traditional dish called Chelo-Kabab, a mix of grilled and barbecued chicken, salmon and beef.
In Edgewater, N.J., one of the most striking retail additions in the region is the Yaohan shopping plaza, a three-year-old complex of Japanese businesses, including a bookstore, golf shop, beauty salon, pharmacy, travel agent and bonsai tree outlet. There is also a giant supermarket, where Elvis Presley croons over aisles brimming with thousands of Japanese products, from rice crackers and dried seaweed to Japanese-brand condoms.
 
Divergent Reception
 Elsewhere in New Jersey, three Hindu temples in Middlesex County draw worshipers from the Indian community while around the state some 100 churches, most of them Protestant, provide services in Korean. A handful of churches in Elizabeth and East Orange hold Mass in Creole for the growing Haitian population.
Some longtime residents see such "foreign" influences as an intrusion in their communities; others welcome them. In Larchmont, N.Y., for instance, many residents feel that the French community of some 400 families in the area lends a certain cachet to their village, one of the most expensive suburbs in Westchester.
Not so in the comfortable neighborhoods surrounding the more working-class village of Mount Kisco in northern Westchester. In the last decade, the Hispanic population there has risen to 1,100 from 400, with many Guatemalans and Salvadorans crowding into apartments. Some residents have organized to expel illegal aliens.
"People keep calling the Immigration and Naturalization Service and telling them to make raids on Mount Kisco," said Joseph A. Sena Jr., a lawyer who counts many Hispanic immigrants among his clients. "If Hispanics live in west Yonkers in the slums, they don't attract too much attention. But if they live in affluent northern Westchester, it's a different story."
Welcome or not, the immigrants now living in the region make it likelier that their numbers will grow, thanks to the networking phenomenon, immigration specialists say.
"The new immigrant whose cousin is in Mount Kisco doesn't need to settle in New York City," said Jeffrey S. Passel, director of the program for research on immigration policy at the Urban Institute in Washington. "He can live with his cousin until he finds a job in Westchester. Those informal networks are very strong."
Mr. Kothari, a leader of the Indian community in Edison, N.J., said the special stores and services catering to ethnic communities in the region were also a strong pull. "Twenty years ago, there was no alternative," Mr. Kothari said. "If you were an immigrant from India, you went to Queens. Now you can move to Jersey City or Middlesex County, where everything is available."

HEADLINE: BLEAK JOB REPORT SHOWS EMPLOYERS SLASHED PAYROLLS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
In an unexpectedly grim report, the Labor Department today found that employers slashed payrolls by 241,000 in November, the biggest drop in jobs since late last winter, when the economy was mired in recession.
The nation's unemployment rate remained at 6.8 percent last month -- and did not rise slightly as had been widely predicted -- but economists took little comfort from any part of the report, which now shows 8,499,000 unemployed. The report is the first comprehensive gauge of the economy's performance last month. 
 In hopes of heading off a new downturn, the Federal Reserve moved swiftly to cut yet again the interest rate on overnight loans among banks, carrying the Federal funds rate to 4 1/2 percent, the lowest since mid-1972. [Page 37.]
 
Greenspan Cites Slowdown
 Bond prices rallied and yields fell on expectations that the weak economy would force further cuts in rates, and the stock market, which has benefited from the diminishing appeal of competing investments, also rose on the news, although it lost the gains by the end of the day.
The Federal Reserve, as is usual, did not explain its action, which consisted of temporarily injecting money into the banking system by purchasing Treasury securities. But Alan Greenspan, its chairman, observed to a trade group meeting in Florida, "The economic recovery, which seemed to be gathering momentum and spark during the summer, more recently has shown signs of faltering."
Analysts said consumers would enjoy no immediate benefits of today's interest-rate cut. But the belief spread today that perhaps by Christmas, the Federal Reserve, which has reduced rates repeatedly to help the sputtering economy, would cut its discount rate by another half-point and that banks would then cut the prime rate further.
 
Shrinking Labor Force
 The discount rate, now at 4 1/2 percent, is what the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions, and the prime, currently at 7 1/2 percent, is the benchmark rate for consumer and business loans. A cut in the prime rate would reduce the cost of various consumer and business loans, including home equity mortgages, that are tied to the prime.
The steadiness in the unemployment rate in the last two months, averaging 6.8 percent for both the second and third quarters, reflected a sharp 292,000 shrinkage in the size of the labor force that was roughly equal to the job losses. Since a person must be seeking work to be counted as unemployed, those who stop looking are not included in calculating the unemployment rate.
Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., noted that the official jobless rate would have climbed to 7 percent had the labor force not shrunk, part of the evidence in the report that he said "clearly documents the need for programs to get people back to work."
Jobs in construction and retail trade were particularly hard hit last month, with construction, down by 95,000, suffering from unusually severe weather in various areas as well as generally weak conditions in the industry.
In retailing, hiring for the holiday season was well short of normal, with the result that jobs fell by 111,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The 241,000 jobs lost represent the largest total since 258,000 jobs were cut in both February and March.
"This is a very discouraging report," asserted Norman Robertson, chief economist for Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank. The number of payroll jobs, he noted, is now lower than in May, and since April the increase is a meager 66,000. By contrast, during the first seven months of the recoveries of 1961, 1970, 1975 and 1983 payroll gains averaged nearly 900,000.
"You can't describe this as a recovery anymore," Mr. Robertson concluded.
 
A Mitigating Factor
 Labor Department and other analysts did point to one mitigating factor: the introduction of updated, semiannual seasonal adjustment factors that, had they been applied to the October data as well, would have produced a decline for November of about 170,000 jobs instead of 241,000. Most predictions, however, were for a decline of 50,000 or less.
Factory jobs fell by a more moderate 33,000, the third straight decline, with most of the contraction in the durable goods and primary and fabricated metals industries. Automobile jobs rose enough to offset declines in September and October.
There was some employment growth in the service industry although it was less than in the three preceding months. Gains in health services were nearly offset by declines in business and other services.
 
More Factory Overtime
 Other negative elements of the department's survey of payrolls were that the proportion of industries shedding jobs rose for the third straight month and that the index of aggregate weekly hours edged down one-tenth of a point, to 121.4, below the August level. The length of the average private-sector workweek expanded by six minutes, to 34.4 hours, and factory overtime climbed by the same amount.
Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said in response to questioning before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, that it was not possible to determine from employment data alone whether the increasingly feeble economic recovery was becoming a new contraction. But she said that "November certainly shows some deterioration and sluggishness; there's no doubt about that."
This was the 137th and final time that Dr. Norwood, who is to retire at the end of the year, appeared before the committee to interpret the monthly figures. She first testified in 1978 when she was acting commissioner.
According to the Labor Department's survey of households, on which the unemployment rate is calculated, there were 209,000 jobs lost last month, somewhat fewer than in the separate survey of establishment payrolls, which counts jobs, rather than people with jobs. With the total labor force shrinking by 292,000, however, the ranks of the unemployed actually declined by a statistically small 83,000 and the unemployment rate remained unchanged.
Among the 11 biggest states for which job data were published today, the biggest change was for Texas, where the unemployment rate fell 1.3 points, to 6.6 percent. The rate for Michigan jumped nine-tenths of a percentage point, to 9.7 percent, while the rates for New York and Illinois rose eight-tenths of a point, to 8 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.
State figures, the department cautions, however, are highly erratic because they are based on far smaller samples than the national data.
The various population groups showed relatively little change last month, although since midyear the jobless rate for adult men has receded a bit, to 6.3 percent, while the rate for adult women, now 5.9 percent, has been on a gradual upswing.
The proportion of the working-age population with jobs eased to 61.3 percent from 61.5 percent in November, about 14 1/2 points below its level of July 1990, when the economy slipped into recession.
Today's report also showed that while the number of newly unemployed -- those out of work less than five weeks -- was about unchanged, the number out of work 27 weeks or more jumped by 180,000. Benefits for the long-term jobless were recently extended.

NEW IMMIGRANTS, NEW DESTINATIONS
They still come for all the things that enticed their predecessors: economic opportunity, freedom, a better life for their families. But unlike earlier immigrants, today's new arrivals often bypass New York City, settling in the towns and cities that dot the metropolitan region. Quickly but quietly, areas that not long ago were fairly homogeneous have changed. Indian saris swish down sidewalks in Edison, N.J. Pastors deliver sermons in Portuguese and Spanish in North Tarrytown, N.Y. Vietnamese restaurants and markets are springing up in western Hartford. Iranians are becoming homeowners in in Great Neck, L.I. Page 1.

The Economy
 Payrolls were slashed by 241,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said, the biggest drop since late last winter. The Federal Reserve moved swiftly to cut again the interest rate on overnight loans among banks, making the Federal funds rate 4 1/2 percent, its lowest level since 1972. The nation's unemployment rate remained at 6.8 percent last month, but economists took little comfort from any part of the report. [Page 1.] With the recession biting deeper into New York's most important businesses, the city's unemployment rate climbed to 10.2 percent in November, the highest since the summer of 1984. [25.] President Bush told workers at a flashlight factory in California that he knows "people are hurting." [47.] 
 The differences in the way Democrats and Republicans view tax policy was highlighted during the second day of hearings about the economy. Democrats focused on tax plans that would let middle-income taxpayers keep a few hundred dollars more a year. Republicans offered a package of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that they said would create millions of jobs. [37.]
Consumers have reversed course and again began taking on debt, including a 1.3 percent increase in October, the steepest jump in six months, the Government said. [47.]
 
Companies
The selloff of the Maxwell empire began in earnest, and employees of Mirror Group proposed to buy the 51 percent stake in the company held by two family companies. Pearson, which owns The Financial Times and the Viking Penguin publishing house, said it might be interested in making an offer. [37.] Kevin Maxwell, the publisher of the Daily News, pledged to keep the paper operating and invited unions to help decide how to cut costs. [49.]
A committee of Pan Am creditors sued Delta for backing away from a reorganization plan that might have saved the bankrupt airline from having to shut down earlier this week. [41.] American Airlines refused to add flights on routes to Brazil and Argentina after the Transportation Department gave it the right to do so only temporarily when Pan Am shut down. [41.]
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter said it might sell parts of its business and lay off up to 1,000 workers. [39.]
 
 International
Europe's leaders seem ready to give up control of their economic fate in return for a unified monetary policy when they meet tomorrow in the Netherlands. Despite Britain's objections, the European Community is moving forward with its plans for a common currency. [37.] Germans are balking at bidding farewell to their beloved mark. [38.]
The U.S. imposed economic sanctions on Yugoslavia's republics in an attempt to end the undeclared war. [7.]
 
Markets
The Federal Reserve eased monetary policy another notch, pushing down short-term rates in response to a much larger-than-expected decline of 241,000 jobs on corporate payrolls in November. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the economic rebound of the summer months "has shown signs of faltering." [37.]
Stocks closed mixed for the day after a volatile trading session. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 2.69 points, at 2,886.40. For the week, it dropped 8.28 points. [40.]
The dollar slid after the release of the Government's jobless report and a subsequent easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. [45.] Wheat futures prices closed lower. [45.]

HEADLINE: Theory and Practice Are at Odds in New Proposal on Minority Scholarships

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Education Secretary Lamar Alexander's proposal for settling the legality of minority scholarships enables the Bush Administration to have it both ways on the issue of race.
The stand outlined by Mr. Alexander last week played to conservative concerns by striking down, in theory, scholarships that are based solely on race. But then, almost in the same breath, Mr. Alexander reassured many minority students, and the college administrators who want to attract them, by doing almost nothing that would eliminate any of the 45,000 race-based scholarships now available. 
 While little may have changed in a practical sense, to some people the Education Department's actions send a disturbing message, one that echoes similar sentiments of division and resentment in debates over other civil rights issues, especially those involving affirmative action.
"This may represent the neo-racism of the 1990's," said Anthony James Catanese, president of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, a public university of 13,800 students whose minority scholarships have been under review by the Education Department. "This says that neo-racists are not illiterate Southerners in hoods and sheets trying to burn crosses, but people who are well-educated, wearing three-piece suits, who are raising questions obscured in issues of legality and constitutionality when in fact they are trying to say the same thing as old-time racism -- that the economic and social problems of this country are due to giving minorities an even chance."
 
Race-Neutral Guidelines
 At his news conference Wednesday to discuss the new policy, Mr. Alexander did not mention affirmative action or use any other political code-words that might play to conservative causes. He insisted that the new guidelines were intended to be race-neutral, and would not deprive minority students of opportunities for scholarships. "What we're trying to do is solve problems," the Secretary said, "not create them."
As college officials try to clarify which scholarships remain legal and which can be made legal by a few changes in wording or bureaucratic procedures, many said they thought the final word will eventually have to come from the courts.
But in the meantime they said the confusion over the new policy would make disadvantaged minority students think that opportunities for them to advance have been shut off. It may also make some administrators reluctant to seek out minority students with assistance programs that could end up being challenged in court.
"Many of us are very much afraid that the Secretary's decision will put a chill on inititatives to recruit minority students," said H. Patrick Swygert, president of the State University of New York at Albany.
Part of the confusion stems from the fact that, after seven months of study, Education Department officials have arrived at seemingly contradictory conclusions. In essence, they say that scholarships granted exclusively on the basis of race violate provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits acts of racial discrimination. Yet, they go on to say that most of the 45,000 such scholarships now awarded on the basis of race can probably continue to be awarded, if certain technical changes are made.
The new policy will not be adopted until after a 90-day period of public comment, which extends to March 9.
In question are about 45,000 race-exclusive scholarships, about 3.5 percent of all scholarships awarded to minority students. Generally, according to the policy guidelines issued by the Education Department, such scholarships are discriminatory because they deprive non-minority students of an equal chance at receiving the assistance.
But Mr. Alexander said the department realized the importance of such scholarships in helping disadvantaged youngsters and wanted to see them continued. He said race could be used as a factor, rather than an obligatory condition, to determine eligibility for scholarships aimed at increasing racial, ethinic and cultural diversity on college campuses, and that would be in keeping with the law.
Such a definition is considered so broad that almost any minority scholarship now offered could continue to be offered, provided the eligibility criteria were slightly altered. Although this, in effect, would open such scholarships to non-minority students, universities could continue to give preference based on race.
The Education Department also has outlined several broad exceptions for minority scholarships. These include scholarships created by Congress and race-exclusive scholarships sponsored and paid for by private sources.
Last December, Michael L. Williams, Assistant Secretary of Edeucation for civil rights, declared in a letter that a $100,000 scholarship fund for minority students set up by the sponsors of the Fiesta Bowl college football game in Phoenix was illegal. Under the new interpretation of the law offered by Mr. Alexander, the Fiesta Bowl scholarships would be considered legal because the money to support them came from private sources giving it for that purpose.
 
Past Discrimination Cited
 A third broad category of permissible scholarships based on race covers those used to overcome past discrimination as determined by the courts or by Federal agencies like the Education Department.
The Martin Luther King Jr. Scholarship Program at Florida Atlantic University, for example, has given just over 100 scholarships to black students since 1984 as a way of raising the minority enrollment there. Of the university's 13,800 students, 6.7 percent, or 928, are black.
Officials at Florida Atlantic believe the scholarships will be allowed to continue because all Florida universities have been under pressure from the courts and from the Education Department to remedy past discrimination.
But lawyers at the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest and policy center that filed a complaint with the department about the university's scholarships several years ago, contend that Florida Atlantic is too new a university to have established any record of discrimination.
Dr. Catanese, the university's president, said there was far more doubt about the status of special scholarships offered by the State of Florida that are open only to direct descendants of Confederate Army veterans.
"That says about everything you can without saying it's for whites only," he declared.

HEADLINE: In Congress, Miles Apart On Tax Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The stark differences in the way Democrats and Republicans in Congress view tax policy, the economy and politics was highlighted today on the second day of hearings about what to do next year to speed recovery from the recession.
The solutions put forward by Democrats in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee focused almost entirely on tax plans that would let middle-income taxpayers keep a few hundred dollars more a year from what they earn. 
 "A proposal to cut taxes on middle-class individuals, paid for by the very rich, must be a centerpiece of whatever we come up with," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
 
The Republicans' Proposal
 Republican leaders, by contrast, offered a package of tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and said the measures would create millions of jobs. These measures should be enacted "for the sake of the unemployed and the country," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip.
The lack of common ground illustrated how difficult it will be to reach a consensus next year when the lawmakers begin to vote on legislation.
No action will come in Congress until after President Bush offers his State of the Union Message late next month. It was apparent from the testimony Thursday of the President's top economic advisers that the Administration has not decided what to propose.
Economists disagree on whether tax cuts for capital gains, savings, small businesses and real estate investment, like those the Congressional Republicans propose, would be good for the economy.
But hardly any economist argues that the Democrats' main plan, which would give middle-income families a tax reduction of up to $400 a year financed by higher taxes on the wealthy, would do much for the overall economy. The less than $8 a week in new spending money for families that qualify for the tax cut would hardly be enough to give the economy a big kick, especially since the money would come directly out of the pockets of wealthier taxpayers.
What happened today in the Ways and Means Committee's large, windowless hearing room across Independence Avenue from the Capitol was largely a made-for-C-Span spectacle.
 
'A Season of Anxiety'
 Mr. Gephardt sat in the witness chair for two hours this morning, beginning at 9 o'clock sharp, while he and his fellow Democrats blamed Mr. Bush and former President Ronald Reagan for the sorry state of today's economy. In one speech after another the Democrats complained about how rich a few people had become while the poor and middle class became worse off.
"This is a season of anxiety, worry and great hurt," Mr. Gephardt said at one point. "The nation's longest peacetime expansion was certainly that, if you're talking about the incomes of our most fortunate citizens."
It sounded a bit like the way the Prime Minister of Britain is questioned by members of his own party in the House of Commons.
At one point, for instance, Representative Michael A. Andrews, a Texas Democrat, asked Mr. Gephardt "for the benefit of the committee, to reiterate two or three specific things that you think we've got to do to increase our savings rate."
That gave Mr. Gephardt the opportunity he had clearly been waiting for to talk about the American rate of savings and investment and productivity compared with that in Japan.
Then Mr. Gingrich and Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee, were called to testify, and they said basically that there was no tax cut they did not like.
 
Tax Credit Plan Favored
 For example, after presenting the 12-point plan that House Republicans had agreed to two weeks ago in the last days of the Congressional session, Mr. Gingrich embraced two new ideas: a $2,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, and the abolition of the capital gains tax altogether for families with incomes below about $35,000 a year.
After the party leaders presented the proposals that are likely to be the starting point for the deliberations in the House next year, about two dozen other lawmakers offered their own pet tax plans. They varied in the particulars. In general, the Democrats offered what they called middle-class tax relief, to be financed either by tax increases on the wealthy, cuts in military spending or both. The Republicans for the most part sought tax cuts, especially on capital gains, in which better-off taxpayers would be the main beneficiaries.
Representative Bill Gradison, an Ohio Republican, said he saw an "obvious compromise": both a capital gains tax cut and lower income taxes for the middle class.
"The rich folks, who realize most of the capital gains, will realize more and pay more revenue to the Treasury," Mr. Gradison said. "Plow it back into middle-class tax relief. Why does it take so long to do it?"
To the Democrats, that sounded like another free lunch.

HEADLINE: November Jobless Rate in New York City Jumps to 10.2%

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
With the recession biting ever deeper into New York City's most important businesses -- from retailing to publishing to Wall Street -- the city's unemployment rate jumped to 10.2 percent last month, the first time the November jobless rate hit double digits since 1977, the Federal Government reported yesterday.
Unemployment rose from 8.5 percent in October and now stands at the highest level since the summer of 1984. 
 The figures are particularly troubling, economists said, because employment generally rises in November as retailers begin gearing up for the busiest shopping season of the year.
The unemployment rate was 7.4 percent in November 1990.
"It does reflect fundamentally that New York City is in the grips of a long and severe and unusual downturn that took another turn for the worse in November," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The news was also grim for the state overall, as unemployment increased to 8 percent, the highest level in more than seven years, up from 7.2 percent in October. New Jersey's unemployment rate was 7.1 percent, up from 6.8 percent the previous month. Figures for Connecticut are not yet available for November, but in October unemployment was 6 percent, down from 6.4 percent the previous month.
There were 339,000 unemployed New York City residents in November, up from 279,000 in October and 248,000 a year ago, according to the Federal figures.
Nationally, the unemployment rate remained at 6.8 percent. The problem is more severe in New York City, Mr. Ehrenhalt and other analysts said, because the anchors of its economy all seem to be suffering at once.
Many of the businesses hardest hit by the recession, like banking and advertising, are concentrated in New York, and many are in the process of paring down their budgets or merging with other companies, which often results in layoffs.
 
Defining New York
 "The industries that define what New York is all about are in the process of re-inventing themselves, of sorting out what's out there," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
One of those is the airline industry. And to employees of Pan American, which announced this week that it was shutting down, the new unemployment data came as no surprise. Even before the shutdown, the airline was cutting jobs. In September, for example, Pan Am laid off 900 flight attendants.
"We're not at the point where we're dealing with statistics," said Brian Moreau, president of the Independent Union of Flight Attendants for Pan Am. "I know them by names. To us it's Ms. Smith and Mr. Davis and Mr. Jones. It's a lot more painful than 10.2."
Michelle N. Coffman, 26 years old, an inflight purser for Pan Am, was filing for unemployment benefits yesterday in Jamaica, Queens, and wondering when she might find work again.
"I worked part-time selling Christmas trees, and that's what I'll do to get me through the holiday season," she said. "When Pan Am goes out of business one day, and the next The Daily News files for Chapter 11 -- they are the mainstays in New York. It makes you wonder what big corporation is going next.
"When the big names start going, it really makes people insecure."
 
More to the Story
 Some analysts said that the Federal statistics may not be telling the whole story of workers' discouragement with the economy.
Isaac Lagnado, a principal in the firm Tactical Retail Solutions, which studies retail trends, said many people have stopped looking for the jobs they were trained for, and instead are taking any job to avoid being unemployed altogether.
"I've just run a small ad for a very junior position in my firm, and I had over 100 inquiries in a couple of days," he said. "I am shocked at the qualifications of many people who wanted this position, which is really a junior position that doesn't pay that much."
At the Jamaica unemployment office, Robert A. Rogers, 54, had a similar story. A security guard for 11 years, he was laid off in April. He worked for 13 days in June as a doorman during the doorman's strike but has been unemployed ever since.
"I've been to factories and everything. You can't find nothing anywhere," he said. "They keep saying that the recession is over, but I can't see it."
For New York City, things may get worse before they get better. The city's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Development, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, said that the effects of layoffs announced months ago are just now being felt. "You remember the announcements of Citicorp, New York Telephone, I.B.M., the Chemical Bank-Manny Hanny merger," she said. "In many of those instances, it was a multi-year process. Unfortunately, the numbers were in the thousands. We had been saying that it would not be until the end of 1992 that we thought we'd be hitting bottom.
"It just happens that the service industries that are restructuring to insure their long-term competitiveness are concentrated here. I think we're going to be feeling this for awhile longer."
 
Layoffs at Banks
 New York City's banks, which employed about 240,000 at the end of 1990, will lose another 15,000 to 20,000 jobs during 1992 and 1993, said Thomas Hanley, a bank analyst for Salomon Brothers.
"Banks have been cutting back on their staffs perhaps at an accelerated rate thus far this year," Mr. Hanley said. "As we look ahead, and the merger process unfolds over the next couple of years, I would think the staffing levels would be reduced even further."
And this is not expected to be a strong holiday season in terms of retail sales. Mr. Lagnado of Tactical Retail Solutions said a study by his firm was forecasting that retail sales during November and December of this year would be 6 percent less than the year before, while nationwide, sales are expected to increase by 1.5 percent.
"It's a chicken and egg problem," Mr. Lagnado said of the relationship between employment and the overall economy. "High unemployment leads to an erosion of the economic base and hence affects the retail industry, which unfortunately provokes more unemployment."

HEADLINE: President Tours Successful Factory

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ONTARIO, Calif., Dec. 6

 BODY:
President Bush toured a flashlight factory today and told the workers that he understands that "people are hurting."
Mr. Bush's political strategists said that the Mag Instrument factory in Southern California was chosen for the trip because it was a success story and the President wanted to show, as one White House official put it, that "all the news isn't bad." 
 The company was also chosen because it donated 40,000 flashlights to serve as "points of light," in Bush argot, at the inaugural celebrations in Washington.
Mr. Bush's tour of the factory and speech to the local Kiwanis and Rotary clubs here were part of his accelerated effort to show that he is sympathetic to the problems of average Americans hurt by the recession.
Bush strategists said that the President had no plan to meet with unemployed Americans right now, and that the White House was trying to accent the positive in Mr. Bush's picture-taking sessions at factories around the country.
Asked by a local reporter at the Mag factory if he planned to stop by a nearby General Dynamics plant where there had been recent layoffs, Mr. Bush demurred, replying: "I'm having a good time. I'm learning a lot here."
The President told the lunch of business executives that he would have a health care proposal ready to deliver in his State of the Union Message in late January. Mr. Bush has been under a lot of political pressure to come up with such a program.
"So we've been concentrating on prevention," he said. "But I do think the time has come for the Administration to come forward with a comprehensive program."
Mr. Bush also praised the Federal Reserve for taking "the constructive step" of easing the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a point today, to 4 1/2 percent.
"And even now, this percentage drop in the Fed funds rates, I think, will help the economy along," he said.
 
'Message to the Democrats'
 Mr. Bush was asked about a report that Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democratic Presidential candidate, had held a fund-raising breakfast in Southern California today that was attended by major Republican contributors seeking to send the President a warning on the economy.
"Interesting," Mr. Bush replied, shrugging his shoulders, adding later, "I want to send a message to the Democrats."
He said that the proposed free trade agreement with Mexico would not cost American jobs. "No, create jobs," he said.
On Saturday, Mr. Bush will speak at the 50th anniversary marking the attack on Pearl Harbor.
At the White House this morning, Mr. Bush said that he would offer his regrets about the United States internment of Japanese-Americans during the war.
"I will point out that was, on our side, one of the tragic things that happened and, of course, it will never happen again," he said. "But it was a very shameful chapter in an otherwise glorious achievement, you might say, the total victory over imperialism and totalitarianism."

HEADLINE: Conyers Journal;
Veteran Touches Raw Economic Nerve in Georgia

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONYERS, Ga., Dec. 6

 BODY:
When Bob Mensinger, a World War II veteran, decided that he wanted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor by burning a replica of a Japanese battle flag on public property, he touched an economic nerve here.
And for good reason: Conyers, a city of 9,000 people 22 miles east of Atlanta, has shared in that city's growing international profile and become home in recent years to four Japanese companies whose payrolls provide more than $6 million annually to the city. 
 Robert Kitchens, a maintenance supervisor at the Japanese-owned Maxell Corporation plant here, called the idea "stupid" and said publicity about it had caused tension among his Japanese co-workers.
But even among those not directly affected by the Japanese presence, the Japan-bashing implicit in the idea seems alien to anything remotely felt in Conyers and amounts to just plain bad manners. Mr. Mensinger's flag-burning act is scheduled to be held in the city's Pine Log Park at 7:55 A.M. Saturday, but most people here are betting he will be pretty much alone.
"He has no community backing," said James Proxmire, a veteran and member of the Atlanta chapter of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. "You know, he spent time as an M.P. in the Army Air Corps stationed in England, while I spent 52 months at Pearl Harbor and in the Pacific. What he is doing just doesn't make sense."
News of Mr. Mensinger's unusual observance led the Rockdale-Conyers Chamber of Commerce to visit each one of the Japanese companies here to reassure them that the enmity implied in Mr. Mensinger's act was not generally shared.
"The incident has brought out support for Japanese-owned companies here, and many have spoken to us to encourage us," said Seiji Omahsu, general manager of Takahashi Works Inc., which moved to Conyers a year ago and makes cabs for heavy equipment.
Seiji Ogasawara, the manager of Liochem Inc., a division of Toyo Ink, which has been here for three years and manufactures printing inks, said, "We have strong relations here, but I hope nothing happens."
There is more than $26 billion in Japanese direct investment in the United States, according to the economic affairs office of the Consulate General of Japan in Atlanta. About $12 billion of that is scattered among 321 manufacturing companies in the Southeast and 512 other Japanese-owned business outlets. A total of 85,000 people are employed at these businesses, including 20,000 each in Georgia and Tennessee.
Last year, when Toshiki Kaifu, then Prime Minister, became the first Japanese chief executive to visit Atlanta, the event was intended to highlight the significance of this region as the focus of so much Japanese investment and manufacturing activity, a spokesman for the consulate said.
Maxell, the audio and video tape manufacturer, is a subsidiary of Hitachi America Inc. It is the oldest Japanese-owned company in Conyers, arriving 10 years ago and initially employing 50 people. There are now 220 workers at the plant and distribution center here, said Tony McGiboney, assistant manager of the plant.
Besides Liochem, which employs 28 people, and Takahashi, with 33 workers, there is one other Japanese-owned company here: Hokushin, which makes parts for fax machines and copiers, and employs 100 people.
Mr. Mensinger, who is 69 years old, said in an interview that his planned observance of Pearl Harbor was not aimed at arousing anti-Japanese feelings in the area, but was intended only as a way of honoring the American soldiers and sailors killed in the attack 50 years ago. He noted that he was not planning to burn Japan's national flag with its red sun on a white field, but a battle flag with a red sun and red rays emanating from it.
He conceded that the flag burning might be considered to be in bad taste, but added, "We have freedoms in this country, and I have the right to show bad manners as long as I don't break the laws."
Acting City Manager Roland Vaughn said that city officials had granted Mr. Mensinger permission to hold his observance, but not on public property in the heart of downtown Conyers as he had originally requested. They have allowed the observance to be held at a park just outside the city and at 7:55 A.M. on Saturday. Mr. Vaughn said the time was chosen partly because it is the exact time the attack began, but mostly because it was when city and county police officials could provide protection and other services.
Mr. Mensinger said he believes the permit's requirement that it be held at the early hour, while symbolic, was intended mostly to cut down on the number of those who might want to join the observance.
Local pressure and opposition had forced three of six veterans who had initially planned the observance to drop out, Mr. Mensinger said, but he added that he had received telephone calls of support from others who promised to attend.
"Seven fifty-five wasn't too early for the Japanese to come bomb us at Pearl Harbor," he said, "but I guess some people won't come because of the early hour."

HEADLINE: Paterson to Monitor Dig at Burial Ground

 BODY:
To insure that archeologists not be hurried in digging an 18th-century burial ground for blacks in lower Manhattan, State Senator David A. Paterson said yesterday that he would form a team to monitor the work.
The cemetery, known in the 1750's as the Negros Burial Ground, was discovered at a construction site on Broadway, between Duane and Reade Streets, where a 34-story Federal office tower is planned. More than 90 skeletal remains have been unearthed there since October and there may be dozens more. 
 Senator Paterson, a Democrat who represents Harlem and the Upper West Side, had expressed fear that the Government would put economy ahead of archeology. Construction delays from a painstaking dig may cost up to $6 million.
The New York Times reported in some editions yesterday that the project manager, John Rossi, was considering quicker excavation. But after learning of the article, the regional administrator of the General Services Administration, William J. Diamond, said on Thursday night, "There will be no speeding up that will endanger the artifacts."
While acknowledging that assurance, Mr. Paterson said he would nonetheless gather preservationists, elected officials and concerned citizens to keep watch on the dig.
Mr. Diamond said yesterday, "We welcome any and all serious oversight, as we will go to all appropriate lengths to assure the community that their ethnic and social heritage is being well protected."
Senator Paterson said he would take Mr. Diamond's word that it was now his intention to give archeologists first priority. "But I'm not assured that this was the original intention," he said.

HEADLINE: New Move On Rates By the Fed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve eased monetary policy another notch yesterday, pushing down short-term rates in response to a much larger-than-expected decline of 241,000 jobs on corporate payrolls in November.
The most recent move by the Fed is the latest in a series of adjustments to reduce interest rates that began in early 1989 and accelerated in the last few months. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, noted in a speech yesterday that the economic rebound of the summer "has shown signs of faltering" and that there was enough uncertainty about the future to make lenders, consumers and businesses more cautious. 
 David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a government securities firm, commented: "This was a devastatingly weak employment number, and I doubt it is the last move by the Fed to ease. Later this year, or more likely early next year, the Fed will probably move again to cut rates again."
 
Unnoticed by Consumers
 Yesterday's actions did not greatly affect consumers, but Mr. Jones said he expected an additional move by the Fed in the next month. If it cuts the discount rate to 4 percent from 4 1/2 percent, that may well produce a reduction in the prime lending rate charged by banks, which is now at 7 1/2 percent.
Yesterday's decline in payrolls was roughly the same size as monthly declines during the recessionary months of October 1990 through April 1991, and led many economists to predict flat growth for the economy during the current quarter and perhaps a small decline in the first quarter of next year.
 
To Encourage Spending
 The Fed is cutting interest rates to try to stimulate a weak economy by encouraging more borrowing and spending. According to the theory, as rates come down, borrowers pay less for loans, and consumers become more willing to spend as the interest rates on savings decline.
The starting point for the process of declining interest rates is the Treasury securities market, where the Fed signaled its desire for lower rates about 11:30 A.M. when it temporarily purchased securities for the account of its foreign customers. Traders and economists quickly concluded that the Fed was aiming to provide enough credit to the banking system that overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market will average about 4 1/2 percent, down from 4 3/4 percent since early November and 7.3 percent in December 1990.
While the Fed has succeeded in pushing down short-term rates, long-term bond yields have been slower to drop.
Interest rates on Treasury bills quickly dropped a tenth of a percentage point or more, with the three-month issue ending the day at about 4.24 percent, down from 4.34 percent.
Among the longer-term notes and bonds, prices rose modestly and yields declined for most issues, but not all the change could be attributed to the Fed's move. A comment by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady late Thursday that he was considering reducing the Treasury's quarterly sales of $12 billion of 30-year bonds caused many firms to buy bonds to offset positions taken earlier in a trading strategy involving the sale of borrowed bonds.
 
Yield on 30-Year Bond
 By late in the day, the 8 percent Treasury bond due in 2021 was offered at 102 10/32, up 1/2 point, to yield 7.80 percent. Earlier in the day the 8 percent bonds traded as high as 103 1/4, to yield 7.75 percent. The yield on the 30-year bond, a benchmark for home mortgages and corporate bonds, was 8.14 percent in December 1990.
Selling by securities dealers and other speculators was enough for the 7 1/2 percent Treasury notes due in 10 years to fall 1/32, to 101 29/32, to yield 7.23 percent. The 6 1/2 percent notes due in 1996 rose 6/32, to an offered price of 100 30/32, to yield 6.28 percent.
Although the Fed's moves have not prevented steep declines in consumer confidence or a slowdown in the overall economy, analysts note that the effects of monetary policy are always felt later.
 
Support for Policy
 Hugh L. McColl, chairman of the NCNB Corporation, the nation's seventh-largest banking company, said earlier this week that the economy needed lower interest rates and added that consumers and businesses were benefiting from lower rates even if their spending remained subdued.
"When we refinance somebody's mortgage at today's lower rates, that leaves more money in their wallet available for spending on other things," he said.
The refinancing of old high-rate mortgages has been a booming business and one of the most visible ways in which some consumers are benefiting from lower rates. For every eighth of a percentage point reduction in mortgage rate, the monthly payment on a $100,000 mortgage declines by nearly $10. For example, replacing a 10.5 percent $100,000 mortgage with a new loan, which could carry a rate as low as 8 1/2 percent, would reduce the monthly payment by $145.83.
Jerry Baker, a managing director at the Countrywide Funding Corporation, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., one of the nation's largest mortgage lenders, said that declining interest rates had stimulated heavy demand for mortgages. "The demand is not just from homeowners looking to refinance at a lower rate; we are beginning to see more by home buyers," he said, noting that demand is about evenly split between those categories.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Jumps 1.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Consumers reversed course this fall and again began taking on new debt, including a 1.3 percent increase in October, the steepest jump in six months, the Government said today.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit advanced a seasonally adjusted $802 million in October after a sharply revised gain of one-tenth of a percent a month earlier. The September estimate originally had been a 2.5 percent drop in debt. 
 They were the first gains since installment debt jumped 1.9 percent in April.
Still, some analysts said the increases could be revised downward in subsequent months.
"Even if they're not revised, November and December certainly will be more in line with the economic state and we'll see falling consumer credit again," said Jean Sundrla of Evans Economics, a Washington forecasting service.
"There's no reason for these figures to be increasing," Ms. Sundrla added, pointing to falling consumer confidence, a continued loss of jobs and an uncertain political climate.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It helps finance much of overall consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The increased debt was all charged on credit cards. Revolving credit advanced 6.9 percent, or $1.3 billion, in October. Still, that was slower than the 13.7 percent jump in September.
"Any purchases on credit cards at this time, beyond normal holiday spending, are being made for absolute necessities" that consumers cannot otherwise afford, Ms. Sundrla said.
Consumers continued to pay off their bills in other areas faster than they took on new debt.
Automobile credit in October dropped eight-tenths of a percent, or a seasonally adjusted $173 million. But that was much slower than the 7.4 percent drop in September and the 7.3 percent decline in August.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate fell 1.4 percent, or $240 million, nearly matching the 1.7 percent decline in September.
Borrowing for mobile homes plummeted 8.1 percent, or $128 million. Still, that was not as sharp as the 37.1 percent plunge a month earlier.
The changes left consumers holding $730.4 billion in installment debt at the end of October.

McDonnell Helicopter Plans Major Cutbacks

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MESA, Ariz., Dec. 6

 BODY:
The McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Corporation, a unit of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, said today that it might sell portions of its business and lay off up to 1,000 workers because of what it called "rigorous cuts in defense spending."
Based in Mesa, Calif., the helicopter company said it was also exploring options for joint ventures. 
 It said it plans to cut its work force by 800 to 1,000 in 1992. "The rigorous cuts in defense spending coupled with a sharp economic downturn forces us to take action," Tom Gunn, company president, said in a statement.
The layoffs will be accomplished as existing contracts are concluded and will be done via normal attrition and the elimination of less essential positions, the company said. McDonnell Douglas Helicopter has 5,200 employees, including 4,000 in Mesa, Ariz., and 1,200 in Culver City, Calif. The cuts will be made in both locations, the company said. It said it would also consolidate internal divisions and reduce spending in all areas.
McDonnell stock was down $87.5 cents today, to $66.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company said it did not have any estimates on how much it would save from the work force reduction.
Ken Jensen, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas Helicopter, said, "We're exploring everything, product lines included."
 He said the helicopter unit was profitable and was expected to remain profitable in the future.
The cuts come just days after the St. Louis-based parent company, the nation's largest military contractor, said it would slash up to 3,800 jobs at its Douglas Aircraft Company unit in the next 18 months because of a slowdown in jetliner production and cost-cutting efforts.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Mixed; Dow Is Off 2.69

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed for the day, after a volatile trading session that saw the Dow Jones industrial average swing 50 points before finishing down 2.69, at 2,886.40. For the week, the index fell 8.28 points.
Despite the Dow's loss yesterday, gainers led losers by 874 to 775. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 199.2 million shares traded, up from 166.4 million on Thursday. 
 The market rallied after the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate to 4 1/2 percent, indicating an easier credit stance. By the afternoon, however, "as the bond market became disappointed that the Fed did not follow up with a discount rate cut, bonds sold off and stocks similarly reversed field, coming back down from the high on the Dow and slowly giving it all back," said Anthony Ludovici, a senior vice president and senior investment analyst at Tucker Anthony.
 
'Still on Unsteady Footing'
 "The fact that the market's breadth was so narrow, evidenced by the closeness between losers and gainers, demonstrates that the overall market is still on unsteady footing," he added.
Among other indexes yesterday, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 1.71 points, to 379.10, as the American Stock Exchange index gained 0.83 point, to 372.63. The Big Board's composite index rose 0.78 points, to 209.74.
Trading on the Nasdaq pushed the composite up 2.27 points, to 536.30, while the Russell 2,000 index gained 0.31 point, to 177.54.
Mr. Ludovici said market activity yesterday was punctuated by program trading that saw it begin the day with a selloff, following disappointing November employment data that showed non-farm payroll down sharply.
Birinyi Associates, a research firm that tracks program trading, said the impact on the market was heavy on both sides of trading, with 11 programs adding a cumulative 13.85 points to the index throughout the day.
 
The Big Movers
 According to the research firm, the big movers on the Dow that were off more than a point included International Paper, I.B.M., Caterpillar and Sears, Roebuck. Stocks up more than a point included General Electric, Merck and Texaco.
Elsewhere in the market, shares of Alpine Lace Brands jumped 3 1/2, to 7 1/2, as the food-processing company declined to comment on market speculation stemming from an article in the Dec. 16 issue of Business Week magazine. The article said that there was fresh takeover speculation about the company and that one investment manager said RJR Nabisco Holdings headed a list of three companies interested in Alpine.
Xoma released some favorable data on Thursday about a protein in development for bacterial infection. The stock rose as much 1 1/2 yesterday, to 20, before finishing at 19 1/2. Traders said Robert Kupo, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, increased his rating on the biotechnology company to "hold" from "underperform."
Other stocks receiving favorable ratings yesterday from analysts included the Gap and the Limited. William N. Smith, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, repeated his buy rating on both retailers after they reported sales gains in November. The Gap rose 1 1/2, to 52, and the Limited rose 1 1/8, to close at 26 3/4.

HEADLINE: European Monetary Union: Now Much More Than Talk

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
After years of talk, European Community governments seem set to relinquish control over their monetary policies and form a landmark monetary union that will include a common central bank and a single currency.
Despite Britain's objections, the plan calls for setting up a common currency in several European countries, perhaps as soon as 1997 and no later than 1999. 
 If all goes according to plan, the European Currency Unit, or ECU, will become the currency of hundreds of millions of Europeans -- and could someday rival the dollar in importance. European officials say the plan will bolster growth and investment, push down inflation and interest rates, and improve Europe's competitiveness versus the United States and Japan.
Over time, there will be trade-offs for countries that join the monetary union. For example, they will relinquish sovereign power over their money supply. Each nation will stop issuing its own money and forfeit control over the setting of interest rates, since those powers would go to a common central bank.
These countries will still influence overall monetary policy because they will have representatives on the board of the common central bank. Member countries will also give up the power to devalue their currencies. Many European countries with competitiveness problems and trade deficits have devalued their currencies, because it raises their exports by making them cheaper abroad.
Also, countries will no longer have full freedom over their budget policies. Concerned that large deficits can push up inflation and interest rates, the community plans warnings and even fines against countries with deficits that exceed 3 percent of their gross domestic product.
Still, every community member except Britain insists that the benefits of monetary union will outweigh any of the losses.
Although the decisions taken next week in Maastricht, the Netherlands, will not have overnight repercussions, monetary union will ultimately have far-reaching effects on people and businesses both here and in the United States.
Germans who travel to France and the Netherlands will no longer have to worry about changing their marks to French francs and Dutch guilders; all three countries will have the same currency. Similarly, vacationing Americans who travel from Nice to Florence will not have to fret about their leftover francs.
And businesses will be able to end the bothersome and costly practice of preparing invoices in separate currencies for different countries. Companies will also save money by eliminating the European currency-hedging operations they use to protect the value of shipments against currency fluctuations.
American banks and manufacturers doing business in Europe strongly support monetary union, saying it will lower costs and, they hope, stimulate the Continent's economy.
"Imagine what it would be like operating our business in the United States with 12 different currencies," said Ursus Jaeggi, director of government affairs for Du Pont in Europe. "It would have a hell of a negative impact on our bottom line, because our costs would go up significantly.
"As soon as these European currencies can be replaced by a single currency, we can simplify internal administration. It would help our costs, our bottom line, and our ability to compete."
 
Builds on Existing System
 The plan for monetary union will build on the existing 10-nation European Monetary System, which pegs exchange rates among the community nations. Monetary union will improve on this by creating a large currency zone that raises investors' confidence by eliminating the threat of devaluations and exchange-rate fluctuations.
It is unclear now how many nations will join a common central bank and use a common currency. After bitterly fighting monetary union to preserve its own currency and sovereignty, Britain is likely to opt out. Several other nations may also be excluded if they do not rein in their inflation rates and budget deficits. Many European officials predict that seven nations, including France and Germany, will make up the first group to use a common currency and form a joint central bank.
Since July 1, 1990, when the first stage of the monetary union plan took effect, community nations have sought to make their economic policies and performance converge by lowering inflation rates and budget deficits. Europe's currencies can only be fused together if community members bring down their inflation rates so that they are in a narrow range, European officials say. These officials add that community members need to slash their budget deficits to ease pressures on inflation and interest rates.
 
In 1994, a Second Stage

The second stage of monetary union -- which begins on Jan. 1, 1994 -- calls for an embryonic European central bank, known as the European Monetary Institute, to guide and put pressure on the 12 nations to bring their inflation rates, interest rates and budget deficits into line.
"Monetary union will not only create certainty, but it will create a better consensus on economic policies over all that are strongly influenced by the idea of lowering inflation," said Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint-Gobain, the French glass and packaging company.
By the end of 1996, the community's members plan to vote on a third and final stage of monetary union -- to create a common central bank and set permanent exchange rates. These moves require unanimous approval. Officials from several nations hope a decision to form a single currency will also be taken then.
Worried that a lack of unanimity would cause a single currency to fall by the wayside, France won a compromise from other nations this week that aims to insure the creation of a single currency. A new vote is to be taken by late 1998, and according to the compromise a simple majority of nations will suffice to form a common central bank and currency.
 
Similar to Fed System
 Once a common central bank is formed, the central banks of France, Germany and other nations will take on functions not unlike the role of the regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States.
France, Spain and Italy want a communitywide central bank because they are frustrated that Germany's Bundesbank so dominates the European Monetary System. These countries contend that the German central bank, with its high interest rates, too often favors fighting inflation over promoting economic growth.
"You won't have a policy that is totally influenced by the specifics of one country," said Mr. Beffa of Saint-Gobain. "It could be a little more growth-oriented. It could take into account a little more the situation of other countries."
 
Germans Are Wary
 President Francois Mitterrand of France persuaded Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to go along with monetary union after Mr. Kohl sought to dispel fears that his nation would dominate Europe as a result of German reunification. But in exchange for agreeing to abandon the Deutsche mark, Mr. Kohl insists on making the community's institutions more democratic, partly to reflect the population of a united Germany.
Many Germans are wary of embracing the ECU, which they fear will be weaker than the mark. The ECU's value will be based on a weighted "basket" of community currencies.
"Some people feel this is a very unique opportunity, and we shouldn't let it slip by," said Ulrich Schroeder, an economist with Deutsche Bank. "But others say we should proceed a little more cautiously, that we shouldn't commit ourselves right now."
The Germans insist that the new central bank be independent of government pressure, which would allow it to concentrate on keeping prices stable rather than on easing credit, as many politicians want. They also fear that if community members fail to bring down inflation, the common currency will prove far flimsier than the mark.
 
Conditions for Joining
 The plan sets several conditions that a nation must satisfy to join the monetary union:
*Its inflation rate must not exceed by more than 1.5 percentage points the average rate of the three community nations with the lowest rates.
*Its budget deficit must not exceed 3 percent of its gross domestic product and its overall Government debt must not exceed 60 percent of G.D.P.
*Long-term interest rates must not exceed by more than 2 points the average interest rate of the three countries with the lowest inflation rates.
*Its exchange rate must not fall, for two years, more than 2.25 percent below the average of the European Monetary System.
Currently, only France and Luxembourg meet all of these criteria. Even Germany does not meet all of them, because the costs of reunification have pushed its budget deficits to 5 percent of G.D.P.
Italy does not meet any of the conditions. Its deficit is about 10 percent of G.D.P., and its overall debt is more than 100 percent of G.D.P.

HEADLINE: Maxwell Says The Daily News Still Has Several Weeks of Breathing Room

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Kevin Maxwell, the publisher of the bankrupt Daily News, pledged again yesterday to keep the paper operating and invited unions to help decide how to cut costs, almost certainly including labor concessions.
"We have the cash to meet any obligation that may fall due in the foreseeable future, and the paper is not for sale," Mr. Maxwell said, responding to two of the most urgent concerns of the paper's employees. 
 On Thursday, the board of Maxwell Newspapers filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, which shields an unprofitable company from creditors while it tries to reorganize. While Mr. Maxwell said the situation called for speedy action, he seemed to suggest that The News had some breathing room, perhaps several weeks or more, to become self-sustaining and emerge from bankruptcy.
 
Effort to Begin Soon
 Federal Bankruptcy Judge Tina L. Brozman is expected to set a hearing in 20 to 40 days to bring all parties involved together for the first time. But a reorganization effort is expected to begin in earnest next week.
After meeting with union leaders at the paper yesterday morning, Mr. Maxwell appeared at a news conference with union leaders and announced a partnership with them in the effort to save The News one more time. After a devastating five-month strike, the late Robert Maxwell won significant concessions from unions and kept the paper alive by acquiring it from the Tribune Company.
Mr. Maxwell said all financial information would be shared with the unions and two people chosen by the unions would join a working party of advisers who will prepare a reorganization plan for The News. John Campi, a News spokesman, said the advisory group would include the paper's management, creditors and union leaders and would probably be organized next week.
 
Board Seats for Unions
 Should the paper emerge from bankruptcy, two union representatives would be placed on the board.
Mr. Campi said the paper cost about $1 million a day to operate and had about $8 million in cash on hand. Another $20 million to $25 million is in accounts receivable, mostly for advertising, and he said normal collection rates were about 90 percent. He added that the paper generated more than $2 million each week in circulation revenue.
Mr. Maxwell also said The News would investigate borrowing against assets like its Brooklyn printing plant and a truck garage, which Mr. Campi said had been appraised at about $7.5 million.
John S. Reidy, a stock analyst who specializes in newspaper companies at Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York, said yesterday that The News could probably operate through Christmas with little difficulty. After that, he said, it could face a substantial decline in revenues. While advertisers would find it very difficult to withdraw from the paper shortly before Christmas, January is traditionally a poor month for advertising, and this year's advertising climate is especially poor over all because of the recession.
 
Effect on Advertisers
 "The bankruptcy will definitely have a dampening effect on advertising in a very damp market," Mr. Reidy said.
Les Goodstein, vice president for advertising at The News, said many leading advertisers had been contacted since the Chapter 11 filing and all had expressed support. He said no advertisers had said they wanted to withdraw or reduce advertising.
If advertising revenues decline from pre-Christmas levels, pressure will increase to make significant cuts in costs.
While relations at present between unions and the paper's management appear cordial, that could change should an effort be made to cut the paper's work force drastically or to void the current contract and change work rules and salaries.
 
Opportunity in Adversity
 Indeed, James P. Willse, editor of The News and a member of its board, said a reorganization would be "an opportunity to set right what needs to be set right about the structure of the paper," which has been shorthand for significant reductions in areas like the number of people needed to operate presses. For instance, during the five-month strike that ended in March, the paper's presses were operated by about half the number of people now operating them.
No member of the paper's management would elaborate on what changes would be sought in a reorganization plan.
George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella organization for the paper's unions, said Theodore W. Kheel, a lawyer who acts as unpaid adviser to the unions, would be one of the unions' representatives on the advisory board.
Union leaders are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss who the other representative should be. That person will be expected to do a financial analysis on the unions' behalf.
 
Willing to Help
 While Mr. McDonald expressed his willingness to help with the reorganization effort, he said he was concerned that the unions might make one set of concessions to make the paper profitable and then be called upon to make more concessions by a buyer if it was put up for sale.
The Maxwell family's private companies were put in bankruptcy in London on Thursday and the British court appointed four partners of Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm, to be administrators of the various businesses, which include The Daily News through various holding companies.
While filing for Chapter 11 protection in the United States offers The News some protection from immediate sale, the ultimate power over its fate lies with the administrators in Britain because they have the power to replace The News's management, including Mr. Maxwell.
 
Control Lies in London
 The administrators issued a statement yesterday saying they were "working with the board and management of The Daily News to protect The Daily News so that it continues as a viable newspaper."
But the administrators have repeatedly said they would sell whatever assets were necessary to satisfy creditors. That could well include The Daily News, especially if it becomes profitable through a reorganization plan.
Yesterday, David Cornstein, president of Finlay Enterprises, a company that sells jewelry through department and other stores, said through a spokesman that The News was too important to be allowed to die. The spokesman, Gary Lewi of Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, a public relations firm, said Mr. Cornstein was investigating whether a consortium of businessmen might invest in the paper.
 
Potential News Buyers
 Mortimer B. Zuckerman, a real estate developer and owner of U.S. News & World Report, and Peter S. Kalikow, also a developer and the owner of The New York Post, who is also in personal bankruptcy, have also expressed some interest should The News be put up for sale.
Mr. Maxwell said his family had invested $20 million to $25 million in The News, in addition to the $60 million it received from the Tribune Company for taking over the paper in March.
About $7 million of the Maxwell investment was in cash, Mr. Campi said, the rest in debt to other Maxwell companies.
Mr. Maxwell declined to address questions regarding the source of the money he had used to subsidize The News's operation.
Robert Maxwell, his late father, apparently transferred millions of dollars from pension funds of the Mirror Group Newspapers in Britain to shore up his private companies. Mr. Campi said he could not say whether this was the source of funds that came to The News.
Mr. Maxwell and union leaders said The News's pension plan was intact.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW YORK;
From Sotheby's High Gloss To Filth of Calcutta's Slums

BYLINE: By Douglas Martin

 BODY:
The auctioneer cut an imposing figure, nearly six feet tall in heels, her English-accented contralto crisply authoritative. "We're going to dash right in and start," she announced Wednesday evening.
In less than an hour she would sell Keith Carradine's lucky cowboy boots, Dorothy Hamill's favorite skates, Nolan Ryan's no-hit cleats, Ivana Trump's mules and the used footwear of more than a dozen other famous people as part of a benefit staged by the Fashion Footwear Association to help AIDS patients. 
 The auctioneer waved her pen like a conductor's baton, shushed gigglers, noticed bidders' slightest twitches. A pro. Almost like old times, when she was not just doing this for charity but was on top of the auction world.
That began for Lorna Kelly in 1976, when she became an auctioneer at Sotheby's in New York -- the first woman to do so and one of the first women to become a fine arts auctioneer in America. Over the next six years she conducted nearly 50 auctions, yielding some $50 million a year. Her achievements were chronicled in The New York Times and other publications.
She lived on the Upper East Side, dined at the best restaurants, wore elegant clothes, adored the power that comes from orchestrating the sale of a Picasso. She says she gave it all up for God and humanity -- albeit with a little push from Sotheby's.
Her ever-strengthening religious convictions left no doubt that her dismissal served larger purposes. "God did for me what I couldn't do for myself," she declared.
Ms. Kelly made a tiny West Side apartment a base for soothing God's scattered children. She journeyed to Calcutta to work in Mother Teresa's House for the Dying, worked as an AIDS volunteer at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan, personally vaccinated 2,000 children in West Africa, ministered to the needs of garbage-dump residents in Cairo, fed the homeless on 42d Street, spent 100 days at an upstate Buddhist retreat in complete silence.
And now Lorna Kelly -- who at 46 years of age has been to the top of many mountains, at times feeling "a sibling rivalry" with Jesus -- wants the simplest of things. "I want a job, not a career," she said. "I want to get back in the mainstream of life. I want to get up, put on my pantyhose and go to work."
Ms. Kelly regards New York as a calling as much as a city. Growing up in London, she daydreamed about New York's adrenalin and sophistication. She first visited as a strong-spirited 15-year-old on her way to catch a liner home after spending a year in Toronto living "a Dickensian life with a tyrannical aunt."
She vowed to conquer Gotham. At age 18, she returned as an au pair to care for four children, all under 7. "The price of admission," she calls this domestic bedlam.
Shorthand, typing and sheer drive fueled her survival. She thrived after becoming an expert in tiny Japanese objets d'art at Sotheby's. Her decidedly nervous request to auction was greeted with a decidedly immediate yes. Her confidence grew to that of the prototypical New Yorker.
Ask Mother Teresa. Ms. Kelly first arrived at her mission wearing designer clothing, perfect makeup and very long, Cadillac-red fingernails. Mother Teresa grabbed a hand and demanded, "Why do you wear that stuff?" She suggested her money might be better spent on the poor.
Ms. Kelly shot back that Jesus had repudiated Judas's suggestion that He ask Mary Magdalene to stop annointing His feet for similar reasons. Mother Teresa had clearly not expected somebody with fingernails like Ms. Kelly's to fire off scriptural retorts. They stared at each other.
"I was trying to put her down," the visiting New Yorker acknowledged. Mother Teresa just laughed.
The result was that Ms. Kelly visited many more times, coming to feel at home sleeping on straw pallets full of bugs that she calls "God's beloveds." She spent days cleaning maggots off people. In turn, she says, Mother Teresa made a point of seeing her on visits to New York.
"I think she was as fascinated with me as I was with her," Ms. Kelly ventured.
However, New York ultimately became more affecting for her than the slums of India or other distant hells. Ms. Kelly was more personally involved here, particularly with AIDS victims she cherished. And her life traversed valleys familiar to many: a decade-long failed marriage, apartment moves, periods of economic uncertainty, lost loves.
These days, she works on an autobiography, gives speeches, conducts auctions for good causes. Her goal, as always, is to seek new horizons -- not necessarily to do extraordinary things, but to do "the next thing."
Yet surely they will be extraordinary. You should have seen the way she toyed with the crowd to draw a bid of $5,250 for Madonna's only slightly used sneakers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Jobless Data; Gold Is Higher Worldwide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slid yesterday after the release of an extremely disappointing jobless report and a subsequent easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery gained $2 an ounce to settle at $369.40. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $368.75, up $2.25 an ounce. 
 The dollar was pummeled by a Labor Department report showing non-farm payrolls tumbled a steep 241,000 last month, despite an unemployment rate that remained unchanged.
Soon after the report was released, the Federal Reserve lowered a key interest rate in yet another attempt to revive the economy. The central bank trimmed the Federal funds rate -- the rate on overnight loans between banks -- by 1/4 percent, to 4 1/2 percent.
"It was a very, very tough day," said Randolph Donney, research director at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. With the cut in the Fed funds rate, "there is the expectation we will see an even more aggressive lowering of interest rates in the next week or two," he added.
Lower interest rates are bearish for the dollar because they make dollar-denominated securities less valuable for investors.
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the advisory firm IDEA, noted that economists used the unemployment report, one of the earliest bits of economic data from the previous month, as a base for their projections of other November data that have yet to be released.
 
Lower Dollar Expected
 "This will force people to reassess the economy," he said. "It looks like the dollar is poised to continue to slide."
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.15 yen, to a closing 128.70 yen. Later, in London it was quoted at 128.00 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 127.95 yen, down from 128.70 yen on Thursday.
In London, the pound was quoted at $1.8095, compared with $1.7935 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.8167 to buy 1, more expensive than Thursday's $1.7965.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5675 German marks, down from 1.5885; 1.3845 Swiss francs, down from 1.4050; 5.3590 French francs, down from 5.4315; 1,187.00 Italian lire, down from 1,202.00, and 1.1364 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1380.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5710 German marks, down from 1.5880; 1.3885 Swiss francs, down from 1.4065; 5.3720 French francs, down from 5.4280; 1.7700 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7895; 1,188.50 Italian lire, down from 1,200.75, and 1.1363 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1366.
In London gold rose to $367.90 an ounce, from $364.15 late Thursday. In Zurich the bid was $367.75, up from $364.25. Earlier, in Hong Kong gold rose $1.91 an ounce, to $368.18.

HEADLINE: Waiting to See if 'Hook' Will Fly

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Even before it opens next week, "Hook," Steven Spielberg's update of "Peter Pan," has become a symbol of all that is right and all that is wrong with the movie business.
With its magical special effects and its all-star cast -- Robin Williams as the grown-up Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as the pirate captain and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell -- "Hook," from the Sony Corporation's Tri-Star Pictures, is the kind of big-screen spectacle that even competing studio executives say should rekindle the excitement of moviegoers. 
 The industry desperately needs some excitement. Although several new releases, including the Paramount Pictures Corporation's "Addams Family" and the Walt Disney Company's "Beauty and the Beast" are proving to be big hits, this year has been one in which box-office results and the bottom lines of most studios have been battered.
Part of the problem, industry executives and analysts say, has been the recession, which for many people has made a trip to the movies a luxury. But they also blame the movies themselves, which with a few exceptions have left reviewers and audiences yawning or deciding to wait for the home-video releases.
No one in Hollywood is yawning about "Hook," if only because it is one of the most expensive movies ever made. While most studios are preaching the virtues of cost-cutting, Sony's two studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star, have been spending freely to re-establish themselves as major forces in the business.
To some industry executives and Wall Street analysts, "Hook" is evidence of how Hollywood will never really learn to control production costs or hold the line against soaring salaries. Even if it is successful, they say, it will hurt the business by encouraging other studios to take huge risks in the pursuit of the next blockbuster instead of concentrating on movies with more modest aspirations -- and budgets.
 
$62 Million for Production Alone
 Some people in Hollywood who have seen the film say it may not live up to its hype. Sony and Tri-Star executives say they are confident, however, that "Hook" will pay off in the long run and that every penny they have spent has been worth it. But even they acknowledge that the movie will have to be a big hit before the studio can turn a profit.
People involved in the film said the initial $48 million production budget for "Hook" started swelling even before shooting began, first to $52 million and finally to a little more than $62 million by the time the film was completed.
At that level "Hook" was three times more expensive to produce than the average studio picture -- placing it in a league with "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," the big hit of last summer but among the costliest productions in Hollywood history. And the $62 million does not include $20 million or so to advertise the film and distribute it to theaters, or the tens of millions of dollars to be paid to its stars and director, under a deal that gives them a hefty cut of the studio's revenues.
 
Other Studios Becoming Thriftier
 The finances of "Hook" stand out in part because such lavish spending comes when most studios are actually making some progress in holding down their costs. After years of bemoaning rising costs and then rushing to bid for the next high-priced deal, studio executives seem to be looking for ways to hold down costs, especially for stars and scripts.
At Disney, Jeffrey Katzenberg, the company's studio chief, has reduced the average production budget this year to $16.3 million from $24.1 million last year. In large part, the decrease came from Disney's unwillingness to sign big stars to expensive contracts or to cast more than one big star in a movie.
At Paramount, executives are scrutinizing deals and scripts more closely than ever in an effort to avoid movies that do not make economic sense.
"When you get into those high-octane ventures you have to look deep into the remains of your soul and ask if it is something audiences really want to see," Brandon Tartikoff, Paramount's new studio chief, said several months ago. "There have been pictures offered to us that were so expensive we'd never get the money back."
Agents report that all but the biggest of stars are being forced to cut their asking prices, although most continue to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per film, if not millions.
 
'Event' Movies Considered Viable
 A few studios, including 20th Century Fox, are still making many expensive movies. And almost all studios are continuing to make at least one or two very expensive movies a year on the theory that properly conceived and executed, "event" movies can still make economic sense. "Terminator 2" turned out to be very profitable for its producer, Carolco Pictures Inc., and for Tri-Star, which distributed it to movie theaters in the United States. Indeed, some Hollywood executives argue that the most expensive of movies are actually less risky than those with moderate budgets because they offer jaded audiences something out of the ordinary.
"Hook" is just one of two high-priced Tri-Star movies opening this month, the other being "Bugsy," the story of the gangster Bugsy Siegel, starring Warren Beatty and Annette Benning.
Earlier this year, the studio suffered through the spectacular flop of "Hudson Hawk," starring Bruce Willis, another high-priced movie. Mike Medavoy, Tri-Star's chairman, is clearly under pressure to start generating some returns for Sony, whose multibillion-dollar investment in Hollywood has so far yielded the Japanese company little other than a reputation for profligacy.
 
Ingredients for Success
 Mr. Medavoy said that he preferred not to make big-budget movies but that "Hook" combined all the ingredients for success: a director, Mr. Spielberg, who was behind five of the 10 biggest hits in Hollywood history, including "E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"; proven box-office draws in Mr. Williams, Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Roberts, and a story derived from one of the most successful plays of all time, J.M. Barrie's "Peter Pan.".
"It's obvious that there are certain circumstances when event-type movies, while risky, are worth making," Mr. Medavoy said.
Much of "Hook's" costs will be visible in special effects and dazzling sets, including a life-size pirate galleon built on a huge sound stage on the lot shared by Tri-Star and Columbia Pictures. The invisible costs include a reported $1 million-plus settlement with the film's original director.
But no element of the movie has raised more questions and eyebrows in Hollywood than the deal that brought Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Williams, Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Roberts to the film. Brokered by Michael Ovitz's powerful Creative Artists Agency, the deal gives the director and stars a hefty portion of the film's revenues before Tri-Star gets its investment back.
So-called gross deals are not uncommon for Hollywood's biggest stars, who usually find it more profitable to take a percentage of a film's gross box-office receipts than a flat salary. Jack Nicholson earned tens of millions of dollars with his gross deal to play the Joker in "Batman."
But the total size of the deal for "Hook" dwarfs any prior previous film arrangement. People familiar with the deal said the director and the three stars will split 40 percent of the studio's initial $50 million in worldwide revenues, meaning they will receive $20 million and Tri-Star $30 million.
Since a studio's revenues typically are slightly more than half of the box-office gross, with the rest kept by theater owners, the first $50 million in studio revenues corresponds to about $100 million in ticket sales -- a level that only a handful of films reach each year.
 
The Break-Even Point
 After the studio's first $50 million in revenues, the deal calls for Tri-Star to keep all the proceeds up to $120 million, giving the studio a chance to recoup its costs. At $120 million in studio revenues, or a block-busting $240 million in ticket sales, Tri-Star would keep $100 million -- enough, its executives calculate, for the film to break even.
After revenues reach $120 million, the director and stars again keep at least 40 percent of each additional dollar.
In Tri-Star's favor, the movie will generate considerable revenues from sources other than domestic box-office receipts. Foreign box-office receipts are likely at least to match receipts in the United States. Home-video sales, broadcast and cable-television fees and product licensing deals will all help.
Many industry executives agree that "Hook" will ultimately make money. But they question whether it will ever be profitable enough to justify the studio's investment and risk.
"The real problem with a movie like 'Hook' is that it's indicative of how the industry is giving away an increasing portion of the profit from its hits without remembering that you also have to cover your failures," said an executive at a rival studio. "It's not enough to prove that a winner is a decent investment. The winners in this business need to be fabulous."

HEADLINE: Bottled Suffolk Water? County Thinks It'll Sell

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, L.I., Dec. 6

 BODY:
Perrier, Poland Springs and Great Bear may soon be making room on supermarket shelves for Pine Barrens Pure, bottled and marketed by the Suffolk County Water Authority on eastern Long Island.
Michael LoGrande, chairman of the Suffolk County Water Authority, thinks there's a big market out there for the 10,000-year-old glacier water pumped daily from the pristine aquifer beneath the sands of Suffolk's pine barrens. He envisions sales of more than $80 million a year in Suffolk County alone, but he has a ways to go to convince shoppers to put down money for something they can get out of their own tap. 
 "How could I serve that to my guests?" asked Miriam Skells, loading a six-pack of Evian into a shopping cart filled with snacks for her husband's 50th birthday party.
"It's probably all the same stuff, but I like the little bottles," she said as she hurried on down Aisle 13 at Waldbaum's supermarket here.
 
Started With a Joke
 Shoppers are now paying about $1 per gallon for bottled water, which represents one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the United States, with consumption of about 2 billion gallons in 1990, more than double the volume since 1986. Mr. LoGrande said that he and the authority's controller, Charles Stein, were talking one day about the increase in the consumption of bottled water and speculated, at first jokingly, about bottling county water.
"But he said, 'Look, don't laugh, it may be a good source of revenue,' so I agreed to give it some thought. It was never our intention to bottle the water per se, but we have a very extensive testing system that enables us to provide unchlorinated water for bottling," he said.
"And at $1.18 cents per thousand gallons, it's the best deal in the county," he added. "But we're always looking for ways to hold that rate down, and bottling water would help."
Dr. James Pierson, a consultant for the authority, concluded that sales of bottled water in Suffolk, with its population of 1.3 million, should number 12 million gallons in 1992. His study also determined that by 1999, sales of the water in the entire metropolitan area could possible reach 300 million gallons.
Only one other municipality in the United States sells its own water in bottles -- Memphis Light, Gas and Water, in Tennessee.
Pure Memphis, advertised as "the flavor of the South," went to market in October 1990 and has been so successful that several private companies are now bidding to acquire the bottling rights, said Tommy Jackson, supervisor of energy services for Memphis Light, Gas and Water, a city agency.
"We sell it in upscale-looking packages of blue-tinted plastic," he said. "We started by giving it away to promote our water quality for economic development purposes. But the novelty caught on and we began marketing it."
Geary Campbell, a spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association in Alexandria, Va., said there were 475 private bottling plants in the United States and 600 different types of brand labels.
And that means a lot of competition for a new product whose working name is Pine Barrens Pure. Sarah Kearny, for one, would need convincing.
"It's exciting to drink water that comes from Ireland," she said, putting two liters of Tipperary into her shopping cart at Waldbaum's. "Drinking Suffolk water would be like never leaving home."

Tenneco Names Head Of Its J. I. Case Unit

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Tenneco Inc. said yesterday that Edward J. Campbell, president of its Newport News Shipbuilding unit, had been named president of its troubled J. I. Case unit, effective Jan. 1. Based in Racine, Wis., Case is the world's largest maker of small and medium-size construction equipment, like bulldozers and backhoes, and the second-largest maker of farm equipment in North America, behind John Deere.
As president, Mr. Campbell, who is 63 years old, succeeds Robert J. Carlson, who will continue as Case's chairman and chief executive. A 30-year employee of John Deere, Mr. Carlson joined Case in July from BMC Industries, a Minneapolis electronics and optical company, where he was chairman and chief executive. Mr. Carlson filled a position left vacant last March by the resignation of James Ashford. 
 Tenneco said it was strengthening the management team at Case as part of its program to return the unit to profitability. Stung by the recession and the sliding demand for farm equipment, Case took a $461 million special charge in the third quarter in connection with plant closings, contributing to a record loss for Tenneco of $693 million.
Case itself had a $169 million operating loss, and earlier this month said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs by the end of 1992, bringing its worldwide total to 21,000. The unit has already cut 5,000 jobs this year.
"Ed Campbell is a highly experienced, proven executive who has demonstrated his leadership many times," Michael H. Walsh, Tenneco's president, said in a statement. "He and Bob Carlson give Case two very experienced leaders in the equipment industry. They're a very good team, with well-matched skills, and both are dedicated to returning Case to profitability."
Mr. Campbell previously worked at Case from 1968 to 1978, last as an executive vice president, before moving to Newport News. While he was president of Newport News, its sales rose from $700 million a year to more than $2 billion, and operating income improved from $13 million to more than $200 million, Tenneco said. At Case, he will be responsible for worldwide operations. A successor to Mr. Campbell at Newport has not been named.
Mr. Campbell received a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering and an M.B.A. from Northwestern University.

HEADLINE: Many Reasons Prompt Donations to Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Although lagging behind last year's pace, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is receiving more than one hundred donations every day as the 80th annual appeal closes out its first week.
In the short notes and spirited letters accompanying their checks and money orders, donors have detailed a wide range of reasons for giving. "We are the parents of a beautiful healthy girl," wrote Jill and Tim Stoller of Cedar Grove, N.J., who gave $384. "We hope this money can be earmarked for less fortunate children, especially those infected with the H.I.V. virus." 
 Alexandra Werner of Manhattan, who gave $300, also wrote in celebration of life. "On the eve of my 92d birthday, being in reasonable good health and comfortable financially, I am sending the enclosed check."
Janice Gorn of Manhattan sent $50 in remembrance "of Lion Albert Gorn who perished in the North Sea 29th November, 1943."
 
Windfalls Passed to Others
 Last year more than 15,000 individuals and organizations contributed a record $4.4 million to the Neediest Cases. Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled.
The New York Times covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected is passed on to seven charities. The money buys food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless and clothing for those without. It also provides Hanukkah and Christmas presents for thousands of New York City children.
Several donors have contributed because of a windfall, including Michael Damelin of Great Neck, L.I., who donated $75 from his office baseball pool, explaining that the participants "wanted to share the spoils with the less fortunate."
Another winning bet prompted Mr. Damelin to send $25 more. He and two friends were playing golf and, he explained, "As golfers sometimes do, a small wager was negotiated on the first tee.
"After we completed the 18 holes and the debts were settled, we said to one another how lucky we were to have enjoyed the others' company and the beautiful day. Then we started talking about those less fortunate and decided to send the winnings to the Neediest Cases."
Reflecting the tough economic times, many people said they have donated despite personal financial worries. "I don't know what my own finances will look like next year," wrote Kirsten Kirby of Pleasantville, N.Y., who gave $125, "but I am sending a little extra this year, while I still can. Surely the need has never been greater."
Patricia S. Bridges of Flushing, Queens, said that money problems forced her to end a long string of contributions last year. Her family's situation has not improved but she sent $100 because, "We're still better off than so many New Yorkers."
"I wanted to send this in as soon as possible," she wrote, "partly to relieve my guilt about not doing so last year, and, as you say: 'To delay may mean to forget.' "

HEADLINE: Former Museum Head Named to Culture Post

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Luis R. Cancel, a former executive director of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, was named New York City's Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs yesterday by Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The post had been vacant since Sept. 6, when Mary Schmidt Campbell left to become dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. 
 The appointment comes at a time of stress for the city's arts institutions. In its recession budget adopted last July, New York City reduced its allocation for the arts by 28 percent, or $24 million, from a proposed budget of $87.1 million, which does not include mandated expenses. As a result, numerous productions and exhibitions have been canceled, visiting hours curtailed and jobs eliminated.
Even in the best of times, the Culture Commissioner has so little discretionary money to spend that the job is considered largely symbolic.
In addition, the Department of Cultural Affairs is under pressure from the City Council. On Nov. 12, Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, introduced a proposal to merge Cultural Affairs with the Parks Department. The two departments were one agency before 1977.
 
Accustomed to Austerity
 When asked what he could realistically hope to accomplish, given the city's lack of money, Mr. Cancel said, "Part of my mandate will be to make people aware of the integral part the arts play in the economic life of this city." He referred to "the disastrous consequences to the city if the arts continue to take a beating."
Mr. Cancel, who is 39 years old, also pointed to his experience at the Bronx Museum as valuable training for tough times. "I am accustomed to working in austere situations," he said. "This is no news to me."
Under Mr. Cancel, who directed and managed a $6.5 million capital campaign and renovation project that was completed in 1988, the Bronx Museum's operating budget grew from $125,000 in 1978 to its present level of $1.7 million. He left the museum in October, saying he wanted to pursue other career opportunities.
Before arriving at the Bronx Museum, Mr. Cancel was director of the Cayman Gallery in SoHo, which specialized in Latin American art. He has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute and master's degrees in museum management and public administration from, respectively, New York University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Mr. Cancel is also a painter and has exhibited his work in several group shows in New York.
The selection of Mr. Cancel, who was born in Puerto Rico, comes at a time when Mayor Dinkins's relations with the city's Hispanic groups are rocky, particularly since Dr. J. Emilio Carrillo's stormy resignation as head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation in October. The Mayor recently appointed Cesar A. Perales to be deputy mayor for health and human services.
Mr. Cancel said, "The Mayor's selection of me was in part an opportunity to send a signal that for this city and this administration, access to the arts is a particular concern. He explained that in his tenure at the Bronx Museum he had paid special attention "to engaging citizens who have not traditionally been involved with the arts."
Mr. Cancel will take office immediately at an annual salary of $97,000, minus the 5 percent pay cut imposed on all city managers earning $70,000 or more.
Mr. Dinkins also announced the appointment of three new members to the city's Art Commission: Vivian Millicent Warfield, who was named executive director; Lo-Yi Chan, and Barbaralee Diamonstein-Spielvogel. Ms. Warfield, who served on the Mayor's Advisory Commission on Cultural Affairs from 1979 to 1990, has been interim executive director of the Art Commission since July. Mr. Chan is a partner in the architectural firm Prentice & Chan Ollhausen. Ms. Diamonstein-Spielvogel is a writer and television interviewer who has served on a number of boards, including the Landmarks Preservation Committee and the Municipal Art Society.

HEADLINE: Hellinger Theater Sold To Church

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The Nederlander Organization has sold the Mark Hellinger Theater to the Times Square Church, the Rev. Donald W. Wilkerson, a pastor of the church, said yesterday. The Hellinger has long been considered one of the best and most beautiful theaters for presenting Broadway musicals.
Mr. Wilkerson said the 1,600-seat theater at 217 West 51st Street had been sold "during the last few weeks." He would not disclose the purchase price, but others knowledgeable about theater property values estimated it at $15 million to $18 million. 
 The last production in the theater was "Legs Diamond," which closed in February 1989. Before "Legs" closed, the Nederlander Organization, saying there were no new musicals around, leased the Hellinger to the church for five years, at more than $1 million a year. Previously the church had leased the smaller Nederlander Theater on West 41st Street since January 1988.
"I'm a theater person and I hate to see any theater go," said Arthur Rubin, executive vice president and general manager of the Nederlander Organization. "It's a question of economics. We can't fill the theaters we have, and the city has not given us tax abatements when the theaters are dark."
 
3,500 Attend Services
 Mr. Rubin said he did not know the purchase price of the theater. Robert Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization, did not return a telephone call.
Mr. Wilkerson described the Times Square Church as an evangelical pentacostal church headed by three pastors: himself, his brother, the Rev. David R. Wilkerson, and the Rev. Robert Phillips. Although the church has no formal membership, the Rev. Donald Wilkerson said 3,500 people regularly attended services.
The Hellinger Theater originally opened as a movie house, Hollywood Theater, in 1930 and became a legitimate theater four years later. In 1949, after several name changes, it became the Mark Hellinger in honor of the Broadway columnist.
In 1956, Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady," starring Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews, opened and stayed for six years. Among the other shows to have played there are "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," with Barbara Harris; "Coco," with Katharine Hepburn; Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Jesus Christ Superstar," and "Sugar Babies," with Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller.
The Times Square Church will not alter the theater. "The theater is landmarked and it will remain the same," the Rev. Donald Wilkerson said.

HEADLINE: Ball's Dropping for a New Year's Sitter

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
Finding a baby sitter for New Year's Eve is an inevitable struggle. Now is not too soon to line one up.
Educators, parents and baby-sitting agencies in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and on Long Island say they expect the demand to be high despite the recession. "We're already getting calls," said Lucille Warrington, owner of the Service, a baby-sitting agency in Larchmont, N.Y. Conspicuous spending is in disfavor, but people still plan to celebrate. 
 The experts say baby sitters are always scarce for New Year's Eve and that parents should offer a nonfinancial incentive, extra pay or both.
With that in mind, it is worth determining whether the cost is worth it. If you are indifferent to New Year's Eve parties, you might be happier at home with a midnight toast. It would certainly be less expensive.
 
Double Time Plus
 Many professional baby-sitting agencies will be charging double time. The minimum number of hours is likely to be higher, a nonrefundable deposit or cancellation fee may be required and there could be additional charges for transportation.
The Baby Sitters' Guild, a Manhattan agency that serves many of the larger hotels, is doubling its normal fee of $10 an hour. Charges will also vary depending upon the number of children being tended and whether a foreign-language speaker is needed.
The guild is also asking for a nonrefundable deposit of $50, an extra $7 for transportation and a minimum charge of five hours. For this amount, the parents will be provided with an adult female ("no teen-agers," said Heidi Ball, the guild's director) and no limit on the number of hours. Visitors to the city can make a reservation through their hotel concierge.
Ms. Ball recommends that vistors call before arrival, even if the concierge says it is not necessary.
Parents who use neighborhood teen-agers will also be expected to provide something extra. "You're going need an incentive to get anyone good," said Steffani Cohen, a mother of two in Scarsdale, N.Y., who runs parent-education programs for the Edgemont School District's Parent-Teacher Association.
Mary Kay Wallace, an executive member of the Parents' Council, an umbrella group of 10,000 families in Nashville, said it was customary in her area to offer time and a half, dinner of something like an "extra special pizza," and even to permit the sitter to bring along a friend.
"You might want to rent a couple of movies, too," she said, "something suitable for the kids for early in the evening and something selected by the sitter for herself for later on." Even if the sitter does not want to make an immediate commitment, it is worth mentioning the extras.
Dawn Svenson, executive director of the Mother Connection of Montrose, N.Y, a parent-support and education group, said she favored inviting a baby sitter to sleep over on New Year's Eve, especially if the parents expect to be drinking or unsually late and the sitter is a young teen-ager.
The protocol, she said, is to suggest the idea to the sitter and then confirm the offer with the sitter's parents. "Some parents will not let their children baby sit on New Year's Eve because they're so worried about what might happen on the way home," Ms. Svenson said. If the sitter is staying over, it's customary to work out a flat fee instead of an hourly rate.
Parents who have been invited to a private New Year's Eve party might also consider organizing a cooperative. One favored by a growing number of parents who give parties in their homes is to encourage guests with small children to bring them along and let them sleep in a bedroom during the party. Couples with older children might think about organizing a supervised slumber party for their youngsters while the grown-ups celebrate in another part of the house.

HEADLINE: Decorative Arts Sale Defies Auction Slump

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The sale of French furniture and decorative objects from the Keck collection on Thursday night at Sotheby's proved that in this depressed auction season a touch of gilt and lacquer goes a long way. Many pieces sold for more than their high estimates, a far cry from the disappointing results in last month's auctions of paintings, drawings and sculpture. Of the 55 objects on the block on Thursday, only six failed to sell. The auction's total, $10,212,400, confirmed what the art market already knew: fine French furniture appears to be recession-proof.
"It just doesn't fall," Jean-Marie Rossi, a Paris-based dealer, said after the sale. "This is still a serious market." And that was exactly what Sotheby's was banking on. With the auction house's bread and butter -- Impressionist, modern and contemporary paintings -- bringing in far less revenue, it is counting on the decorative arts to make up much of the difference. 
 As a result, Sotheby's treated Thursday's sale with the importance it accords a sale of major paintings. It was at night, the first time a furniture sale in New York has not been held during the day, and the house presented the Keck collection in an elaborate hard-bound catalogue. The auction house also guaranteed the seller, Howard B. Keck, an undisclosed sum, which some experts estimated was as low as the sale's low estimate of $8,189,000 and others estimated was as high as $19 million. (A guarantee is a minimum price that the auction house promises the seller regardless of the outcome of the sale.)
 
Small but Potent Turnout
 Still, the turnout seemed small compared with the crowds that attend the major paintings auctions, although all the major decorative-arts dealers from New York and Paris were present. In the front row were the Antiquaires a Paris, five French dealers (including Mr. Rossi) with their own Paris galleries who hold joint exhibits and often buy pieces together. There were also several private collectors visibly bidding. And a great deal of business was done on the telephone.
The collection was from La Lanterne, the Bel Air mansion in Los Angeles belonging to Mr. Keck, the son of William M. Keck, the founder of the Superior Oil Company; most of it was acquired within the last 10 years. The sale was forced by a divorce.
"It's an outstanding collection," said Thierry Millerand, who heads the French furniture department at Sotheby's, "one that covers the scope of French furniture."
Highlighting the sale was a Louis XVI ebony and Japanese lacquer commode and secretary, both by Adam Weisweiler, a well-known 18th-century furniture maker. The pieces fetched $2,860,000 and the final bid was made by Mr. Rossi, who was buying the piece for the Antiquaires a Paris.
"Highly unusual pieces are what people were after tonight," said Mr. Millerand. A pair of blue-and-white marble Jardinieres, expected to sell for $250,000 to $350,000, sold for $825,000 to a private collector bidding on the phone. A rare Louis XVI stained horn, mother-of-pearl, stone and brass marquetry writing table, estimated to bring $400,000 to $500,000, was sold for $962,500 to a dark-haired man wearing dark glasses and identified only as a European private collector. A Louis XVI ormolu and hard stone-mounted ebony cabinet brought $572,000, well above its projected $350,000 to $450,000 estimate; it went to the Paris-based dealer Maurice Segoura, who said he was bidding for a client from Monte Carlo.
 
A Disappointment
 The evening's one major disappointment was a Louis XV desk attributed to Joseph Baumhauer that was estimated to sell for $1 million to $1.2 million. Bidding stopped at $675,000. "It was one of the most distinguished pieces in the sale," Mr. Millerand said. "Maybe the problem was that it was too distinguished. Tastes tonight ran toward the more exotic."
Indeed, rare works of French furniture, no matter how recently they have been on the market, are a strong commodity these days. Another sale of a major collection of French furniture assembled in recent years, the Roberto Polo collection, auctioned Nov. 7 in Paris, also brought top dollar. Estimated to bring $10 million, the final total of the Polo sale, held at the French auction house Ader Tajan, was $17,422,271.
Surprisingly, none of these prices seem the least affected by the recent 18.6 percent tax that the French Government recently imposed on the purchase and importation of French antiques. While the French dealers who were buying in New York are thought to be shipping their goods to Geneva, such arrangements are more difficult for private French collectors. "There was a noticeable absence of French collectors bidding tonight," said Mr. Millerand of Sotheby's. "But for a number of years now, because of the economy, the French have been sellers on the auction scene rather than buyers."

Quick Leap From Dominance to Disarray

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
The president of the International Olympic Committee said yesterday that the decision of the Soviet Government to withdraw support from its central sports agency would lead to a sharp decline in performance by Soviet athletes in future Olympics.
"In Albertville and Barcelona, the Soviet Union will be No. 1," Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, said from Lausanne, Switzerland, referring to the sites of the 1992 Winter Games and Summer Games, in France and Spain, respectively. "After Barcelona," he added, "the Soviet team will be weaker." 
 Samaranch met earlier in the day with Vitaly Smirnov, the president of the Soviet Olympic Committee, who told him that the Government had shut down the ministries for many aspects of Soviet society, including Gossport, the agency responsible for all aspects of sports, everything from the upkeep of facilities to the salaries of coaches to apartments for athletes.
 
Twenty Years of Success
 In short, this was the organization that for more than 20 years made the Soviet Union into the leading medal winner in the Olympics, the various world championships and other major international competitions. It had already been weakened by the fact that independence was granted earlier this year to the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Just how debilitating the elimination of the centralized system will be to Soviet sports in the 12 remaining republics is impossible to gauge quickly. The agency's strength was organization across the country, the ability to spot exceptional talents in 10-year-old children and nurture them through a network of 40 sports schools and 50 sports colleges.
Now, like so many other changing facets of life in Soviet society, the responsibility for maintaining the programs is being left to the individual republics.
While many sports officials interviewed yesterday agreed with Samaranch that the Soviet performance was more likely to suffer in the long run, a dissenting view was proposed by Tom Kelly, the president of the Goodwill Games, which were first held five years ago in Moscow and again last year in Seattle as a joint venture between the Turner Broadcasting System and Gossport.
 
New System Coming?
 Kelly, who speaks with his Soviet colleagues on a regular basis, said that senior Soviet officials had known for months that the ministry would be eliminated. As a result, he said, they expected that a new system would emerge quickly, led by officials from the Russian republic and possibly modeled after Britain's and designed to embrace Western-style marketing concepts.
In some events, like soccer's World Cup, British athletes represent England, Scotland and Wales. In the Olympics, they compete together.
"I think that soon, we're going to see an interrepublic confederation of sports in the Soviet Union," Kelly said from Atlanta. "They're not going to let the sports system simply dissolve. It means too much to the country."
And if that's true, he said, the new model could eventually produce stronger and more solvent Soviet Olympic teams than those in place for 1992. Just last week, Soviet Olympic officials said they had sufficient funds to send a team to Albertville but not yet enough to send one to Barcelona. The 1996 Summer Olympics will be held in Atlanta.
Samaranch acknowledged the Soviet Union's financial pinch but could offer no additional assistance from the I.O.C. beyond the amounts of money that flow normally to all countries through the sale of Olympic television rights, marketing agreements and other commercial deals.
"We cannot fund the Soviet Union; it would be too expensive," he said. "We have no money, but we can help in other ways, like with marketing seminars that teach them how to get money."
But just how much does success in the Olympics mean now to the average Soviet citizen? With the current economic crisis, it's a safe bet that it's not as much as before.
"I don't think the Soviet people are looking at medals as recognition of their country," said Mike Jacki, the executive director of the United States Gymnastics Federation. "Recognition of their country is a stable economy and food."
 
The Talent Drain
 Jacki said the migration of expert coaches and teachers might have a more profound impact on the Soviet sports system than reduced funding. As the economy has soured in recent years and immigration laws have been relaxed, many of the Soviet Union's leading coaches have left, some for the United States.
Aleksandr Gomelsky, who coached the national basketball team for many years, now lives in Chicago. Vladimir Artemov, the all-around champion in gymnastics in the 1988 Olympics, is coaching in San Antonio. One of his teammates, Vladimir Gogoladze, is coaching in Houston.
Athletes, too, have left, although they retain the right to represent the Soviet Union or a republic. Last summer, Sergei Bubka, a Russian who is the world's best pole vaulter, moved to Berlin to train with a club, but he intends to represent the Soviet Union in Barcelona.
"I think the real hazard is in their development programs," said Ray Essick, the executive director of the United States federation for swimming. "Mom and Dad aren't used to paying X number of rubles for coaching or pool access. Those kinds of costs can be considerable. I think their current swimmers will be O.K. But what about the 14-year-old kid preparing for 1996?"

New Process Cuts Cost of Real Vanilla

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Vanilla, with its smooth facility for blending with other tastes and fragrances, eclipses even chocolate as the most heavily consumed flavor. Despite that, most people rarely taste the real thing.
The reason is its expense. Natural vanilla, extracted from the bean, costs about $1,200 a pound. The beans themselves are $35 a pound, but only 3 percent is usable for the extract. By contrast, flavoring made from synthetic vanillan costs only $7 a pound. 
 Using a relatively new technology called cell culturing, however, a small California company has patented what it says is a much cheaper way to produce natural vanilla. The result, it said, is a richer, more complex flavor than the artificial product most people have come to know.
"You have a much fuller-bodied, rounded flavor, rather than the sharp chemical aroma," said Raymond J. Moshy, president of the Escagenetics Corporation in San Carlos, Calif.
The difference, Mr. Moshy said, is that the natural extract contains more than 200 trace compounds that add subtle overtones that enhance the basic flavor of vanilla. By contrast, he said, synthetic flavorings consist entirely of the chemical vanillan and have none of the subtle shadings of the real extract.
Cell culture techniques represent a relatively new way to produce plant products without growing the whole plant. In this case, tissue samples from the vanilla plant are transplanted into a laboratory dish, where they are induced to multiply into a large colony of cells. By manipulating the nutrients, the company said, the cells can be made to secrete the vanilla components for "harvesting."
The process can cut the cost of flavoring to less than $200 a pound, which may make it economical for use in premium ice creams, baked goods and other foods. Quest International, a division of the Unilever Group, is preparing a pilot plant and plans to run market tests on food products containing the flavor.
Om Sahai and Mark E. Kanuth, researchers affiliated with Escagenetics, received patents 5,057,424 and 5,068,184.

Soviet Union Shuts Down Its Sports Ministry, Ending Financial Support for Olympic Effort

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Soviet Union's state sports agency announced today that it was being closed down because of the Government's crushing financial problems, raising doubt about the nation's ability to field a competitive Soviet Olympic team in 1992.
The organization, Gossport, was shut down as part of the Soviet Government's efforts to shrink a bloated bureaucracy. 
 Leonid Drachevsky, first deputy chairman of Gossport, told the Soviet news agency Tass that Gossport could no longer meet its payroll to keep the state system of 25,000 athletes and 12,000 coaches working toward the Winter Games in Albertville, France, which start in February, and the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.
"If our athletes are not able to take part in the Olympic Games, it will damage the prestige of our country," he added.
Even though Gossport said it had to shelve plans to field competitive teams in the 1992 Olympics, sports officials in Russia, the Soviet Union's dominant republic, announced that they were making an attempt to maintain the national Olympic effort by enlisting support from the other 11 Soviet republics that now exercise separate forms of sovereignty.
In making its announcement today, Gossport joined a chorus of once-powerful bureaucracies that are experiencing the end of Kremlin-controlled financing. They have been lobbying for fresh support with some cataclysmically worded cries for help, with thus far mixed results.
The sports agency was richly supported throughout the Cold War. Athletes enjoyed privileges and comforts normally experienced only by ranking Communist careerists, and for its investment the nation reaped prestige and often the lion's share of Olympic medals. Since 1972, the Soviet Union has won far more medals than any other nation, accumulating 674, as compared with the United States' 500.
But now the Government's financial crisis extends to all aspects of Soviet life, with the 12 republics intent on establishing their own sovereignty and controlling the amount of money they devote to national endeavors.
The three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which reclaimed their independence after an attempted coup in the Soviet Union last summer failed to reassert a hard-line Communist dictatorship and brought down the centrally controlled and financed system, have indicated they will send their own teams to the Olympics.
There is a proposal that the 12 remaining republics commit themselves to a single Olympic team, according to Vladimir Vasin, the chairman of the Russian republic's own Olympic committee.
Vasin said today that Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, and others had expressed preliminary interest in creating some sort of an interregional center for preparation for the Winter Olympics. Vasin had no specific commitments to report but said that further discussions would be held.
"It would be a tragedy for sports if the best athletes wound up making cigarette lighters rather than doing what they do best," Vasin told the Russian Information Agency news service.
The disbanding of Gossport may not be the last word on Soviet state support for the Olympic teams. Last weekend, after dire warnings similar to those of Gossport, the government of the Russian republic stepped in at the last minute and agreed to help the central Soviet Government avoid imminent bankruptcy and to meet some Kremlin payrolls.
There was no sign today that this might happen as well for the Olympic payroll. But here, as everywhere, sports are far more popular than run-of-the-mill bureaucracies, and republic leaders, now popularly elected, are likely to be more mindful of the public's interest in Olympic competition.

HEADLINE: With No Frills, New Bush Chief Signals Changes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Samuel K. Skinner, who will take over as the new White House chief of staff this month, flew here today from Washington to give a luncheon speech. By commercial airline. In coach class.
The no-frills travel was only one of several signals Mr. Skinner sent on the first day after being named to the post that he planned to use a different style, political agenda and perhaps a different staff at the White House than John H. Sununu, whose manner, imperial tastes and economic and political judgments all led this week to his resignation. Until the White House restricted Mr. Sununu's travel this year, he often used Air Force planes for business and personal trips. 
 In an interview on the way to Chicago and in a speech to the Illinois Manufacturers Association, Mr. Skinner made clear that he intended to make the economy and domestic policy the focus of White House attention, and to help President Bush overcome Democratic criticism that he has neglected the home front to concentrate on foreign policy issues.
"The baton has been passed," Mr. Skinner said, from Mr. Bush's foreign-policy and military advisers to himself and other domestic advisers, who will work to make the health of the American economy match the new world order developing in the cold war's aftermath.
Mr. Skinner said he had a short list of priorities to address upon taking over from Mr. Sununu on Dec. 16. "The economy, the economy, the economy. And then behind that, the economy and domestic policy, because they've got to work together," he said.
Mr. Skinner, who professed in an interview to be "kind of awed" and nervous about becoming Mr. Bush's chief aide, said he expected to make few changes in Mr. Sununu's staff or operations -- for at least two weeks.
But in a clear sign that he intends to make the staff operation his own, Mr. Skinner said he had asked John Croisant, a friend who heads human relations at RJR Nabisco, to review Mr. Sununu's operation. Mr. Croisant, a customer of Mr. Skinner when he was a salesman for I.B.M. in the 1970's, worked closely with Mr. Skinner when he became Transportation Secretary. Virtually every important appointment at the department was overseen by the two men.
Mr. Bush "has given me a mandate to move as fast as I can," and he met with the President early this morning to discuss the economy, Mr. Skinner said. But first, he continued, "I want to make sure I know how the operation works now, in detail, and who the players are." Not until Mr. Sununu's staff members have been interviewed to get their views on the office will any reshuffling take place, he said.
He said Mr. Bush, who was insisting two weeks ago that any new economic stimulants could wait until his State of the Union Message in late January, was now "singularly focused" on economic policy and would take regular and frequent steps to speed a recovery.
Asked later to explain his and Mr. Bush's apparent conversion to believers in economic stimulus, Mr. Skinner said that politics had nothing to do with it. "What obviously happened is that the economy is changing somewhat," he said, adding that the Administration had seen an "almost overnight" drop in consumer confidence that it now believed warranted stronger action.
Some of Mr. Skinner's remarks appeared to reflect his reputation as a team player who, in this case, was on the hustings pitching the Administration's most recent version of its political message on the economy.
But Mr. Skinner is also an acute politician, schooled in Chicago-style electioneering, who could not have helped but know that he would be closely watched in his debut for signs of change at the White House. Although Mr. Skinner took pains at every stop in today's five-hour blitz of Chicago to lavish praise on Mr. Sununu, his words and actions nevertheless were billboards that sometimes seemed to shout "new and improved."
 
Return Flight to Capital
 Self-effacing and indefatigably upbeat, Mr. Skinner worked the friendly crowd in this, his hometown, with abandon. In his speech, a news conference, and a stop to christen a new Federal office, he pumped strangers' hands, cracked jokes and handed out praise like political buttons." His mission completed, he boarded another commercial jet and returned to Washington tonight.
Mr. Skinner said in an interview that the Administration was now fully aware that "people vote their pocketbooks, they vote the economy, and in the economy, obviously, we have a lot of challenges." One of his primary duties, he said, will be to insure that Mr. Bush keeps more in touch with the economy's effects on average Americans, largely by taking him out of the White House on whistle-stop tours.
One of Mr. Skinner's first jobs will be to help Mr. Bush find replacements for himself as Secretary of Transportation and for Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, whom Mr. Bush named Thursday as his 1992 general campaign chairman.
Administration officials said today that the President had not yet settled on any nominees for either post, but names of likely contenders were already circulating in the White House and the agencies involved.
Among the contenders for Commerce Secretary is Kenneth Lay, chief executive of Enron Corporation, a natural gas company based in Houston; John D. Macomber, a friend of Mr. Bush who has been head of the Export-Import Bank since 1989 and was chief executive of the Celanese Corporation; Bill Frenzel, a former Minnesota Congressman who is an expert on trade issues; Maurice Greenberg, head of the American International Group Inc. of New York, an insurance concern, and Barbara Franklin, a Washington businesswoman and former White House aide.
Possible contenders for Transportation Secretary include Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who is married to Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican, and Deputy Transportation Secretary James B. Busey 4th. Roger Porter, Mr. Bush's domestic policy adviser, has been angling for a Cabinet post and has his sights on the transportation job, officials said.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Weighs Anti-Bias Law on Carnival

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
A law has been proposed that would ban discrimination of any kind in clubs that sponsor Mardi Gras, but opponents of the proposal say such a measure could mean the death of this city's famous festival.
The proposal, which was introduced in the City Council last week, is the latest chapter in the politics of race here. Last month, State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi, lost a race for Governor in which he ran a racially divisive campaign. 
 During Mardi Gras's seasonal brawl of parades and partying, the city is virtually a hostage to fun. But behind the fun is a tradition that is laced with prejudice in many forms.
The 27 private clubs, known as "krewes," that sponsor the glittering parades which are Carnival's centerpiece discriminate widely: against women, against men, some against Jews, blacks and Italians. Among the most prominent of the parade sponsors are elite white male non-Jewish clubs that make up the core of New Orleans high society.
 
Killing Mardi Gras?
 The law,introduced by a black City Council member, Dorothy Mae Taylor, would deny city services and parade permits to clubs that discriminate. The city pays $3.5 million for the extra police protection and garbage cleanup needed for the festival, but a University of New Orleans study found that the 1990 Carnival pumped $480 million into the local economy.
City Council Member Jackie Clarkson, who represents the French Quarter, where the celebration is wildest, complained that the proposal would "kill Mardi Gras."
And the Mayor's Mardi Gras representative, Maureen Detweiler, said the proposed law could "do away with parades" in the city. Some parades have already been moved to the suburbs, following whites who used to live in the city.
She said that the clubs "will not change overnight; they will change with time," and that some of the popular newer clubs are already racially mixed. In addition, New Orleans has one predominantly black, all-male krewe and at least one krewe with both men and women members.
Ed Muniz, the leader of Endymion, a 1,250-member krewe, questioned the need for the law and said the clubs were changing without the ordinance. Of his own krewe, he said, "We have never refused a black who was interested in joining."
Blaine Kern, a float builder who is part of an all-male krewe with some black members, said he favors racial integration, but as for women, "We don't want 'em, pure and simple." Mr. Kern says he sees the all-male krewes as "just a bunch of guys getting together and raising hell," while women would "pay serious attention to costumes, frills, froufrou and sequins."
Mr. Kern said, "Most krewes are opening up" without city laws "because it's normal and the natural thing to do and with the economy, krewes need members." The krewes charge dues and members must sometimes spend lavishly on costumes and other expenses.
 
Modeled on New York Law
 Mrs. Taylor's proposal is modeled on a New York City law banning discrimination in business-oriented private clubs that was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 1988. The City Council on Thursday deferred action on the ordinance until Dec. 19, responding to a request from Carnival leaders and Mayor Sidney Barthelemy.
Councilman Lambert Boissiere Jr. said today, "I'm hoping we'll work out a compromise" between the krewes and Mrs. Taylor. Mr. Boissiere, who is black, said Mardi Gras is "a special day" and "you don't want to lose that. Millions of people come here every year to enjoy that free-spirited day. You don't want to tone that down."
But Dr. Dwight McKenna, who is black and the chairman of the New Orleans school board, says Mardi Gras has long had "a plantation mentality" and that "no tradition or economic loss is worth more than my dignity."
Nonetheless, nine of 10 letters in The Times-Picayune newspaper on Thursday criticized the proposal, emphasizing the possible economic harm to the city.
Arthur Hardy, who publishes the "New Orleans Mardi Gras Guide," said, "the talk in the street" is that 5 of the city's 27 Carnival krewes would not parade if the law is passed, "and that would mean 5 nights without parades." During Carnival there are 10 days and nights of parades leading to climax of the festival on Mardi Gras, March 3 next year.
"Mardi Gras sets the whole tone for our economy and our spirit," said Mr. Hardy, who is white. "We're all recipients of the money the people on the floats are spending, no matter what color they are."
Mr. Hardy said his family has been in New Orleans since the 1830's but has not been invited to join Carnival's most exclusive club. "That doesn't bother me. I'm excluded because my family didn't know their great-grandparents. I never even think about it."

HEADLINE: Pay-per-Minute Phone Advice Gets Personal and Professional

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
The pay-per-call services -- 900 telephone numbers -- that dispense advice of all kinds are reaching out again, expanding to include insurance assistance and legal information.
Now you can dial a 900 number from anywhere in the country and talk to an insurance consultant or a lawyer. What's next? Financial services: there are plans to put financial planners, bond specialists and other experts at the end of new 900 lines. 
 Consumers are expected to spend $1.2 billion on calls to 900 numbers this year, according to Marketing Logistics, a consulting business in Lincolnshire, Ill. The growth of live professional consulting services on 900 lines comes as new restrictions are being placed on the pay-per-call industry by the Federal Communications Commission.
Starting this week, all such calls must begin with a preamble disclosing the price and the provider's identity, and offering callers a chance to hang up without charge. In addition, consumers must be offered the ability to block 900 calls from home telephones at no charge, and telephones cannot be disconnected for failure to pay for calls to a 900 number.
The essence of live 900 services, which grew out of services that offered recorded advice on a variety of subjects, is that callers can ask personal questions and receive informed answers from a specialist. Some are open only during business hours, while others are open evenings as well. And since the caller is paying a high price -- usually from $1 to $3 a minute -- an integral part of the arrangement is that the person on the other end will give advice, but should not try to sell the caller anything.
"The primary advantage is that it is an easy way to get information from a third party who doesn't have a vested interest in your being a client," said Bruce Kushnick, president of Strategic Telemedia, a New York market research company. "And it's good for people who have a desire to find out information late at night."
 
Sometimes, All That's Needed
 Gene Chamson, president of Intermedia Resources, a consulting company in San Francisco, said: "You can talk directly to an expert who you might not otherwise have any access to. Obviously, you can't have as complete a consultation as you could in somebody's office, but in many situations that's not necessary."
Still, just because a 900 service exists does not mean that its promoters are qualified to provide help or that the information is not available free elsehwere.
"I sometimes wonder who is accrediting them," said Linda F. Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers League. "Treat it like any other purchase you make."
Insurance Information Services in Simi Valley, Calif., recently began a 900 service for all kinds of insurance, including life, health, automobile and homeowner. By dialing (900) 776-7103 and paying $2.50 a minute, callers can get facts and figures about personal insurance problems.
"We'll explain how to lower insurance costs, what liability means, what benefits you have and many other things," said Bill Steiger, a veteran insurance agent who founded the service. "And the client will never be referred back to us for insurance."
A similar $3-a-minute service is Tele-Lawyer, begun two years ago by Michael A. Kane, a lawyer in Huntington Beach, Calif. Callers can get legal advice by dialing (900) 370-7000 and tax advice from (900) 835-3829. "An advantage is the convenience of being able to pick up the phone for information and not having to wait for an appointment," Mr. Kane said. "A lot of people are using us as a second-opinion source."
Similar professional consulting services are planned. Dale B. Krieger, president of the Carnegie Hill Company, an investment adviser in Princeton, N.J., plans to start an information service on municipal bonds, Munichek, early next year. It will be operated in cooperation with Kenny S. & P. Information Services.
And Laura Adams, a certified financial planner on Hilton Head Island, S.C., said she plans to start a 900 service for financial advice early next year. The service, which will cost $3 a minute, will "offer people, who are very often intimidated by the process of seeking out an adviser, low-cost, effective advice and information," Ms. Adams said.
The reaction of professional groups to these telephone services is mixed. For example, William E. Hornsby Jr., staff counsel of the American Bar Association's special committee on delivery of legal services, said: "It's nothing you are going to want to use as a substitute for a lawyer when you need a lawyer. You have to be very careful."
But Sean F. Mooney, senior vice president and economist of the Insurance Information Institute, said, "If the person on the phone has the expertise, it would be very useful." And Madeline I. Noveck, president of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, said, "You can certainly give helpful information if you ask the key questions and get the circumstances of the particular person."
 
 
ABOVE ALL, KEEP IT SHORT
 There is a charge for all calls to 900 numbers. The amount varies, depending on the service. To avoid problems, here are some tips from the National Association for Information Services, a trade group for companies in the 900 business.
*Don't stay on a 900 call unless you are willing to pay the price disclosed at the start of the call.
*Don't call a 900 number if you are unsure what information it supplies.
*Call the billing inquiry number on your phone bill if you think the 900 service did not deliver what was promised.
*Insist that children ask permission before making any 900 calls.

Mobil Reduces Spending Budget

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: FAIRFAX, Va., Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Mobil Corporation, the nation's second-largest oil company, behind the Exxon Corporation, said it had cut back this year's spending budget by $500 million, or 10 percent, from what it had originally planned because of the recession. The company, based in Fairfax, Va., also said it had deferred some investments until business conditions improved.
 "These are difficult times for the oil industry as the pace of economic recovery is slower than expected," said the company's chairman, Allen Murray. He said that the recession in the United States and in key markets abroad was having a significant impact on demand for Mobil's petroleum and chemical products. A Mobil official declined to disclose the actual level of the 1991 capital budget, saying the data are strictly for internal use.

ALL BUT THE WALTZ
Essays on a Montana Family.
By Mary Clearman Blew.
Illustrated. 223 pp. New York: Viking. $19.95. 
 A cold, sharp prairie wind blows through "All but the Waltz: Essays on a Montana Family," Mary Clearman Blew's haunting memoir of life on the high Montana plains. It is a wind that quickly disperses any wisps of lingering romanticism in either author or reader about the glamour of ranching in the old West. As Ms. Blew pieces together her family's hundred-year history in central Montana, she writes with sadness, fierce pride and an unforgettable clarity of their struggle to survive drought, disaster and economic depression. These are people who struggled on slipping ground: "One foot after another, falling back with every step they took, scratching not to get ahead or even to stay abreast but only to keep from sinking for as long as they could."
Beginning with Abraham Hogeland, her great-grandfather, who came from Pennsylvania in 1882 to establish a ranch "on the very ground where I played among the willows along Spring Creek and tried to imagine my way past the river bluffs," Ms. Blew explores her connections to the earlier settlers of this lonely prairie. In loosely related essays, she describes, among others, her grandfather Albert, a renowned cowboy who died at the age of 33; Albert's widow, Edna, who took over the grinding work of the ranch; grandmother Mary, who taught into her mid-70's in isolated country schools; Jack, Ms. Blew's father, who drove away from his ranch one day in 1983, deliberately lay down on a distant hillside and died of exposure.
As Ms. Blew, born in 1939, cuts back and forth in time, she includes snippets of her own personal history. We learn how her father tried to bring her up as the son he never had. "We'll be Jack Hogeland and Daughters," he promised his family. But Ms. Blew fled the rigors of ranch life, first to the university, teen-age marriage and motherhood, and finally to a Ph.D. and teaching career. She is now an associate professor of English at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, with two books of short stories and a byline as co-editor of an anthology of writings about Montana, "The Last Best Place," to her credit.
"All but the Waltz" is not a memoir that tries to win the reader with humorous or ingratiating anecdotes. What we hear of Ms. Blew's own story is brief and stark. In her almost unbearably moving last essay, Ms. Blew sketches the downward lurch of her second marriage. Her husband, Bob, a lighthearted man who wooed her with his generosity, audacity and "his grasshopper's delight in the sunlit present," leaves the oil fields where he made his money. He buys farmland north of Havre "and gambled all over again on the weather." In Montana, the reader now knows, this is a losing bet.
When Bob contracts a fatal lung disease, he slowly disappears into a dream world that dissolves around him. The farm succumbs to drought and neglect. Ms. Blew finally takes their small daughter and leaves. She imagines the voices of those who see his last days in the Havre Hotel: "He's a walking skeleton. He has nothing to do, nothing to look forward to -- How could she have done it to him?" Her readers, who understand that she learned survival from her ancestors, see how she could have done little else.
The price of survival on the Montana prairie has always been high. Once when Ms. Blew's grandmother Mary had not seen another woman for 18 months, she began to hallucinate and see the beckoning shapes of women when she went to draw water at the spring. Mary, a schoolteacher, was one of "those armies of women of all ages in their dark rayon print dresses, heavy from their starchy diets, graying as the years passed, weather-beaten and cranky, moving from school to school, year by year, in their tenureless quest for a bare living, for an independence of sorts." In their remote one-room "teacherages," these women lived in constant fear of rape. Imogene, Mary's daughter, was given a rifle by a beau to defend her teacherage. When a gang of young men approached one night, they saw her pile of tin cans, used for target practice, and reluctantly withdrew.
Behind Ms. Blew's tales of hardscrabble living, the Montana prairie always looms, a "fearful vacancy" that nonetheless attracts and fascinates her. "I am bone-deep in landscape," she admits, and in prose with a shining edge she etches short, stunning vignettes of this bleak yet beautiful country. Its spaces are often heavy with silence: "The air grows colder as he [a neighbor] rides out of the gully and emerges from the bare black branches of hawthorns and chokecherries into the undeflected wind on the slope that leads higher into the bluish-dark stain of pines. No movement in the empty, heavily grazed grass. Not a magpie flaps across that gray snow-laden sky, not a calf bawls, though the signs of cattle are plentiful on the trail and scattered through the bunchgrass."
The compressed vigor of Ms. Blew's prose enlivens her narrative, and so does her spare but telling detail. In lives bare of luxury, she evokes the power of essentials: "A ladder nailed against the wall led through a trapdoor to the suffocating heat of the attic, where my aunt Imogene used to sleep in the summertime. She could look out the tiny window and see bunchgrass blowing in the yard and tumbleweeds ragging at the barbed-wire fence and the two tracks of the road." Here, as elsewhere, Ms. Blew opens an unexpected window onto a scene that might otherwise fade into overwhelming space and silence.
It is this intense observation, an insistent vitality, that lifts Ms. Blew's stories out of mourning into a kind of affirmation. She seizes the unchronicled lives of those who have gone before her and rescues them from oblivion. The spirit of these essays is perhaps best caught in a poignant memory of the author's father. The winter winds blew long and hard at the grassland cattle ranch, but in time, they ceased: "The first sign of spring would be the night he rode in with the pale wet lavender of the first wild crocus, the pasqueflower, in his hatband."

HEADLINE: CRIME

BYLINE: By Marilyn Stasio

 BODY:
Wise men know that "murder and embezzlement, like the promise of youth, are ephemeral." Wily businessmen like John Putnam Thatcher, the executive vice president of Sloan Guaranty Trust, also understand that "the gross national product of Japan is not." So don't expect any big fuss to be made in EAST IS EAST (Simon & Schuster, $19), Emma Lathen's 21st mystery to feature the distinguished Wall Street banker as sleuth, when a minor functionary with Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Investment is murdered during tense negotiations between an American steel company and the giant Japanese trading corporation that wants to acquire its English robotics affiliate. The crucial thing is that the deal should go through, come hell, high water or murder.
Ms. Lathen, a pseudonym for the writing team of Mary Jane Latsis and Martha Henissart, has a wonderful knack for turning the driest, most complicated corporate maneuvers into high drama, and occasionally burlesque. Shuttling her high rollers from Japan to Alaska to England, she drolly observes them trying to conduct delicate business while such land-mine scandals as industrial sabotage and wholesale government corruption burst all around them. 
 Although they play fast and hang tough, the more broadly satirized Americans look like klutzes compared with the crafty elder statesmen of the Japanese business world, whose glacial formality bespeaks to the ever-alert Thatcher the understanding that "with experience comes the ability to display, not real feelings, but those that are useful." What is most useful here is a rich sense of humor.
Pity young Simon Bradshaw, traumatized into manhood, in B. M. Gill's cunningly twisted suspense mystery THE FIFTH RAPUNZEL (Scribners, $19.95), following the death of his parents in a car crash. The 18-year-old naif is shocked to learn that his artist mother, whose nursery-story illustrations always gave him bad dreams, was more than a little mad, and that his pathologist father kept mistresses, including the woman Simon falls in love with. No wonder the lad is spooked by threats from a man his father's testimony helped put away for murdering five prostitutes.
High-strung minds that snap under stress are the special province of Ms. Gill, whose ambitious scheme here is to ensnare an entire English village in her sticky web of abnormal psychology. "City crime was anonymous," muses one of the few locals who manage not to lose their marbles in this Grand Guignol plot. "Village crime was like that poisonous plant that opened wide its petals and engulfed everyone."
This morbid perspective encourages some farfetched acts of depraved lunacy from the wretched villagers. In temperate doses, however, the Welsh author's dark craft yields subtler horrors, from a disturbed artist's view of the world ("an extraordinary place in which the centuries merged and the past became a grotesque, fairy-tale present") to the even more troubling vision of a healthy mind like Simon's, trapped in its nursery of nightmares.
Don't know what's got into Shifty Lou Anderson. For a professional magician who can do a classic version of three-card monte, he keeps losing sight of where his best tricks are at. In William Murray's comic mystery I'M GETTING KILLED RIGHT HERE (Perfect Crime/Doubleday, $18.50), this inveterate horseplayer also sits out most of the races at Del Mar, and he spends more time pitching woo than cutting cards -- or solving murders.
The structural problem is easy to spot. Shifty's newly acquired Thoroughbred, a spirited filly by the name of Mad Margaret, has sore shins, which puts her owner at loose ends. But instead of filling in the waiting time with some fast track action or a mystery worth its salt, he gets involved in a dull love affair with a drippy married woman who constantly whines about her mug of a husband.
Shifty's garrulous pals come through with their usual pearls of turf wisdom, and Mad Maggie eventually gets her run for glory. But since this one never really breaks out of the gate, it's good we can cling to that bit of racing philosophy that says: "At the race track, it's always tomorrow."
Any author who takes an entire chapter to explicate the phrase "shuck and jive" overestimates the charm of her narrative voice. Sarah Shankman allows herself so many self-indulgences of this nature in SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY (Pocket Books, $20) that the reader has a stiff job finding the story line of the whodunit she has set at the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City. Something about a lubricious contest judge who is missing, only nobody cares, and about Miss New Jersey's stolen gown, which elicits more concern from this crowd.
This is not to say that Ms. Shankman's glib prose isn't amusing to read -- she's a bundle of fun on such fascinating pageant lore as bugle beads and rhinoplasty -- just exhausting. More detrimental to the author's light style, her amateur sleuth is hard to take, seriously or otherwise. A reporter for The Atlanta Constitution, Samantha (Sam) Adams has smarts to spare, but as Ms. Shankman once wrote about another manic character, she also has a "mouth going one hundred twenty-two miles per hour" and the notion that every time she opens it she has to say something adorable. You can almost sympathize with the serial murderer who belts her in the mouth -- especially when the spunky Sam snaps back with a wisecrack about orthodontia.
"Wasn't something new, something different and unexpected supposed to happen at Carnevale?" Edward Sklepowich teases the reader in his second Venetian mystery, FAREWELL TO THE FLESH (Morrow, $19), whose title is a literal translation of the pre-Lenten street festival observed with spectacular abandon in the serene city. "Wasn't it when anything could happen?" Including murder, as it turns out.
Under cover of Carnevale, someone has crept down a dark and narrow alley to murder an English photographer. Dragooned into conducting a discreet investigation, an agreeable American dilettante by the name of Urbino Macintyre soon discovers that the victim had connections, mostly unsavory, with members of Macintyre's international set. With a superb sense of timing, the urbane Urbino unmasks the villain on the stroke of midnight, at a gala ballo in maschera given by his friend and patron, the Contessa da Capo-Zendrini, at her splendid palace on the Grand Canal.
Mr. Sklepowich's animated scenes offer an enchanting spectacle of Venetian street life. But for all this descriptive glitter, the author is too much the sophisticate to neglect the intriguing, even sinister history of the festival. Writing with somber grace, he also takes care to end his tale in the spirit of "silence, ashes, and repentance" that descends on the revels come Shrove Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A Fight To the Death

BYLINE: By Trip Gabriel; Trip Gabriel is a frequent contributor to this magazine.

 BODY:
THE BAREFOOT WOMAN IN faded jeans and a pink turtleneck is curled in a chair in her Oregon farmhouse. Ann Humphry, 49 years old, is an attractive blonde whose hair is knotted above her head Katharine Hepburn-style. She doesn't look like a woman who, for two years, has waged a fight against breast cancer.
"You know, I'm tough," she says. "I can look after myself." The words and the image of Humphry have been preserved on a grainy, amateurish videotape, which was made on Oct. 1. The next day Humphry trailered a horse into the Oregon wilderness 100 miles from the farm, watched the sun set over the blue-gray peaks of the Cascade Range and swallowed an overdose of barbiturates. 
 Ann Wickett Humphry was a co-founder of the Hemlock Society, a group whose how-to books about suicide for the terminally ill and 11-year campaign for the liberalization of euthanasia laws have helped put this emotional issue on the national agenda. Last month, when voters in Washington State became the first in the world to decide whether dying patients should be allowed to commit suicide with the help of doctors, it was Hemlock Society signature-gatherers who helped get the initiative on the ballot and Hemlock members around the country who flooded the campaign with $313,000 in contributions. Although the measure narrowly failed, its strong support was seen as a critical first step to possible victories in other states.
But what Ann Humphry is saying in her pre suicide videotape is that she had developed strong doubts about the right-to-die movement and about one of its leading crusaders, her former husband, Derek Humphry, the well-known author of the best-selling suicide manual, "Final Exit." Since the couple formed the Hemlock Society 11 years ago, Ann's own experiences -- as a cancer patient and also as someone who assisted in the double suicide of her aged parents -- had given her second thoughts about euthanasia.
"I've thought, 'What's the answer?' " Humphry says on the tape, which was recorded at Windfall Farm, her 42-acre property in Monroe, Ore., in the rain-drenched western part of the state. "I've got my own supply of barbiturates because I was lucky enough to get them when I was in the middle of Hemlock. Should it be as easy as that? I think the legislation is simply too dangerous."
Humphry had come to believe that if doctor-assisted suicide were legalized, then euthanasia might become more and more involuntary. Poor people or those without medical insurance, for example, might be influenced to accept a fatal drug dosage. Or regardless of their economic means, the feeble and the sick might feel subtle pressures to relieve their families and friends of the emotional burdens of lingering death. On the videotape recorded the day before she died, Ann accuses her ex-husband of applying unwelcome pressures during her cancer. She describes a conversation with Derek in which she told him she'd prefer suicide if her cancer was terminal.
"I remember saying, 'If anything were to happen, if the cancer were to metastasize, I'm getting out of here,' " Ann says. "And I remember how relieved he was. I said, 'No hospital beds for me in the middle of the living room, no puking my guts out . . .' And I remember feeling really chilled to the bone because now it was my life and my dying and it was kind of like 'Good, get out of the way as quickly as possible.' There was none of this 'Jesus, hang in there, I want you to be here for me!' . . . I knew I was being pushed out of the picture."
The reasons for Ann Humphry's suicide are not simple. She was not terminally ill -- her cancer was in remission -- and she was not, by most accounts, clinically depressed.
In addition, there have been questions about the purity of her motives in attacking the Hemlock Society. She had stopped working for the 46,000-member organization, headquartered in Eugene, Ore., following an angry and much-publicized divorce from Derek, who contends that all of his ex-wife's criticisms are outgrowths not of their philosophical differences but of their marital clashes.
Nevertheless, Ann Humphry's negative views of life in the Hemlock Society illuminate a darker side of the right-to-die movement than is generally known, even among its followers. In the videotape, Ann accuses Derek of having become "an agent of death and dying." At one point, she describes how he had learned that a strong barbiturate could be ordered without prescription from a Swiss pharmacy, bought 500 tablets of the drug and distributed them to some Hemlock members. "I began to feel really uncomfortable with this," Ann says, "and I began to feel I'm getting much deeper into something I'm not clear about at all."
ANN HUMPHRY'S STORY really begins with Derek Humphry and his first wife, Jean, in England. In 1971, Jean was found to have breast cancer. Anticipating a painful death, she asked Derek, a reporter for The Sunday Times of London, to be prepared to help her end her life. When the time came, he brewed a mug of coffee laced with Seconal and codeine, which she drank. Jean died in 1975 at home in the Cotswolds with Derek beside her.
A year later, Derek Humphry married Ann Wickett, a 33-year-old American student of Shakespeare he met through a personals ad she'd placed in a newspaper. Moved by the tender story of his first wife's death, Ann persuaded Derek to write about it in "Jean's Way," which, when published in Britain in 1978, stirred much controversy and strong sales. Since aiding a suicide is a crime in Britain, as it is in the United States, Humphry was investigated by the police, but no charges were ever brought. In the meantime, the Humphrys moved to Los Angeles, where Derek had found a job as a feature writer with The Los Angeles Times.
Soon, interest in "Jean's Way," which was published in America in 1979, and the topic of euthanasia overwhelmed Derek's reporting career. He was invited to address medical schools and other groups throughout the United States, Canada and Australia. The size and enthusiasm of the crowds astonished him. "My journalistic antenae told me this was going to be a big subject," Derek Humphry recalled a few weeks ago, sitting on a couch in his office in Eugene. He gave up journalism in 1980, and, together with his wife, formed the Hemlock Society.
After the appearance of "Jean's Way," Humphry had received scores of letters pleading with him to disclose what drugs he'd used to ease his wife's dying and how he'd acquired them. A sympathetic doctor had given him the pills, but at the time Humphry had decided not to ask what they were. "Secretly," he wrote in a subsequent book, "I was glad that I did not know, for how could I have, with good conscience, sent the fatal formula to people whose true medical and psychological condition I had no knowledge of?"
On this point, Humphry was to change his mind -- provoking a public outcry. In 1982, he authored "Let Me Die Before I Wake," a book of anecdotal accounts of assisted suicides but with drug information embedded in the text. Then, in May of this year, through the Hemlock Society, he published "Final Exit," which describes in stark detail, without the nuance of narrative, how to take one's life. The book includes a table of prescription drugs and their fatal dosages. In a chapter entitled "How Do You Get the Magic Pills?" it tells how to fool doctors into prescribing lethal quantities of drugs. On page 112, Humphry suggests Dramamine to prevent vomiting the suicide drugs, and on page 95, he recommends pulling a plastic bag over the head as a backup to the sleeping pills.
Humphry, a man of restrained but not humorless mien, says the information was gleaned from 12 years of research and conversations with pharmacists, physicians and "many hundreds" of informants who've assisted loved ones to die. "Nobody else could have written 'Final Exit,' " he says proudly.
The book, which has already sold 520,000 copies in North America, is one of the most unlikely success stories in publishing history. The 61-year-old Humphry, whose nearly bald dome and wide sideburns have become familiar to talk-show viewers, expects to earn about $1 million in royalties from the book and says the society will reap $2 million more. Numerous Hollywood producers have even sought the film rights -- apparently without bothering to read the book, which has no characters, scenes or dialogue.
Yet some experts on medical ethics and even laymen who favor liberalizing the euthanasia laws were shocked by the content of "Final Exit." The book has been boycotted by some booksellers and the target of protests -- all of which only fed its sales. "I defended the book massively," says Humphry, who clearly relishes the public debate as well as the personal attention. "I think I did a good job. I was spending 18 hours a day on radio and television."
In addition to book sales, the Hemlock Society is kept afloat by some $500,000 a year in membership fees. Today, in a converted white clapboard house, recently expanded, Humphry, whose annual salary as executive director is $66,000, heads a full-time staff of 11. His latest plans are to open Hemlock Society field offices around the country and to become more active in political races.
Perhaps the most common criticism of Derek Humphry is that troubled individuals will be tempted to use "Final Exit" in a moment of passing depression. Its shop-manual approach, critics say, just makes suicide too effortless. And indeed, copies of the book have been found near the bodies of several victims who suffered from depression and who apparently carried out Humphry's instructions. "I'm concerned about giving an easy approach to people who otherwise would not commit suicide," says Alan L. Berman, director of the National Center for the Study and Prevention of Suicide in Washington. "Why is there a need for this book?"
Humphry's response is that if the nonterminally ill kill themselves with his book, that's an abuse. He contends that anything -- guns, rope, a gas oven -- can be abused. "This cry went up when we published 'Let Me Die Before I Wake,' " Humphry recalls. "But the suicide rate did not alter. It'll be intersting to see if the rate in America alters now. I doubt it."
But what about the ethics of providing recipes for self-annihilation to people without knowing how sick or mentally unstable they are? Humphry himself had once opposed this, finding it repugnant to send drug information indiscriminately through the mail to inquiring readers of "Jean's Way." Asked what had led to his conversion, he replies, "I changed my mind."
One casualty who unquestionably used the pharmaceutical advice disseminated by the Hemlock Society and who was not terminally ill was Ann Humphry. The powerful prescription pills she ingested came from a cache she had hoarded in anticipation of the day she might need to seek "self-deliverance" (as is advised on page 70 of "Final Exit"). Although Ann had recently quit drinking, a bottle of Chivas Regal was found beside her body, suggesting she'd heeded the information on page 112 that certain drugs, when combined with alchohol, are 50 percent more toxic.
On Oct. 14, Derek Humphry took out a half-page advertisement in The New York Times, which, to the casual reader, might have seemed like a heartfelt eulogy to his former wife. "Sadly, for much of her life Ann was dogged by emotional problems, and . . . her life was a series of peaks and troughs," the ad said. "Suicide for reasons of depression has never been part of the credo of the Hemlock Society."
Asked recently why he had placed the ad, Humphry said flatly: "Damage control."
WHAT DAMAGE WAS Derek Humphry trying to control? The chain of events that led to the acrimonious split -- both personal and ideological -- between the co-founders of the Hemlock Society and that finally drove Ann Humphry to kill herself were set in motion two years ago. In September 1989, for the second time in Derek's life, a wife of his was found to have breast cancer. Three weeks after surgery to remove the cancerous lump, and just four days after Ann had started chemotherapy and radiation treatment, Derek phoned from a business trip to say he was walking out of the marriage. He conveyed his intentions in a message left on their telephone answering machine.
Ann was shattered. According to friends, she concluded that Derek was fleeing the prospect of having to watch a second wife wither away from cancer. But facing months of treatment and a winter alone at Windfall Farm, she could not forgive Derek for withdrawing emotional support just when she needed it most. Ann suffered a nervous breakdown and checked herself into a psychiatric ward for eight days.
Derek Humphry tells a far different story. He says his home life had long been a shambles. The cancer, he maintains, was a crisis that hastened the inevitable. "It was terribly bad luck," he says in his clipped British accent. "I felt bad, but I did not run away."
According to Derek, Ann, at first refused to talk to him about her cancer. But then she began making self-pitying comparisons with his first wife. "She kept saying, 'You don't love me like you loved Jean,' " Derek says. " 'You're not crying for me like you cried for Jean.' I would say, 'Ann, I don't think you're dying.' "
After Ann's lumpectomy, Derek recalls, the oncologists pronounced her cancer-free -- a fact Ann never disputed. But she continued to fear that the disease would return and that it would one day kill her. "I snapped and walked out," says Derek. "I knew it was the worst possible moment to walk out. I just could not take it anymore."
Because of the sharp contrast with his handling of his first wife's illness, the couple's breakup became more than a private dispute. Accusing Derek of violating the principles of compassion that are part of the Hemlock Society's credo, Ann wrote in December 1989 to her fellows on the seven-member board of directors to urge that he be sacked as executive director. Meanwhile, Derek barred her from Hemlock's offices and changed the locks on the doors.
Early last year, both parties went public with their differences. Ann talked volubly to newspapers and on the Sally Jesse Raphael and Larry King shows. Derek issued a four-page statement entitled "Why My Marriage to Ann Wickett Failed," which managed both to elicit sympathy and to showcase an almost clinical detachment. He wrote of "the unacceptable way" Ann had handled her cancer. Today, he says that he never wanted to make their problems an open book, but that once Ann had lashed out, he felt constrained to "counterattack."
Most of Hemlock's officials sided with Derek, accepting his explanation that his wife's depression had caused their marriage to unravel and his denial that he had compromised any of the society's articles of faith. Yet one dissenting voice, Henry Brod, the president of the Oregon chapter, issued a news release accusing Derek and the other board members of acting "despicably."
"I thought Hemlock was all about compassion and decency towards people desperately ill," Brod said. "But Hemlock is, after all, Derek Humphry -- and that is not good enough any more."
HER OWN experience with cancer produced in Ann Humphry a growing skepticism toward the gospel of assisted suicide, which she had preached enthusiastically for years in books and speeches.
One sign of her disaffection was a friendship she entered into with Rita L. Marker, the head of the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force and a former debating adversary of Derek Humphry. "Ann called me in December 1989, not too many weeks after she'd lost her husband, her health and her job," Marker remembers. Four or five months into their friendship, according to Marker, Humphry expressed misgivings about her old ideology. "She said until she developed her cancer, she had not known what subtle and not so subtle pressures could be put on people to get out of the way."
Ann also came to be troubled by the 1986 double suicide of her parents, 92-year-old Arthur Kooman, a Boston banker, and his 78-year-old wife, Ruth. The couple had been among Hemlock's charter members. Then one day they called and asked their daughter for help in dying. While neither was terminally ill, they were "affronted and humiliated by the growing indignities of their deterioration," Ann wrote in "Double Exit." The book was her thinly veiled account, complete with pseudonyms, of how she and Derek had flown in from California with a lethal supply of Vesparax, the barbiturate Derek had obtained from the Swiss pharmacy.
In separate bedrooms, Derek helped Arthur Kooman ingest the drugs in a mixture of applesauce and 7-Up, while Ann assisted her mother. When it was all over, the book suggests, Ann's conscience was clear. "They actually did it," she writes. "And they did it right."
But in ensuing years, Ann seemed increasingly burdened by ambivalence. "She felt guilty and remorseful," her closest friend, Julie Horvath, says. "At the same time she'd rationalize, saying, 'I'm proud of what I did.' But then she'd start to cry, saying, 'All I wanted to do was help my parents.' She went back and forth. It ate away at her."
In the videotape from Windfall Farm, Ann identifies some of the memories that haunted her. Her mother's suicide, she had come to believe, was not entirely an act of free will, but subtly coerced. "I knew my mother was not ready to die," Ann says. "I knew she felt pressure and that she couldn't survive without my father. I never forget that."
She also confesses on the tape that her mother's death was not as antiseptic as portrayed in "Double Exit." After swallowing the barbiturates, Ruth Kooman had begun choking. "I got really scared," Ann says, her voice catching. "Derek had always said to me, 'Just use a plastic bag or a pillow.' And so there was a plastic laundry bag with her linen in it, and I took the bag and I very gently held it over her mouth." There is a long pause. "She died very peacefully. But I walked away from that house thinking we're both murderers."
By contrast, according to Ann, Derek took his in-laws' double suicide in stride. "He could walk away from it and within 24 hours he was back again mowing the lawn," she says. Perhaps, she surmises, that is when the couple's marriage began to crack.
Ann's friends say she made the confession about her mother's death to blunt charges that her criticism of the Hemlock Society was inspired by a personal vendetta against her ex-husband. And on the tape she goes on to voice an even more startling claim: that Derek had used a pillow to smother his first wife, Jean, after she'd started to regurgitate her suicide drugs in her sleep.
If true, it would mean Derek Humphry had not simply assisted a suicide, but had, under the law, committed murder. Derek, who adamantly denies smothering Jean, says he is shocked by Ann's accusation. Where is the evidence, he asks? Why is the charge being leveled now, he argues, when for 13 years Ann let her name appear on the cover of "Jean's Way" as its co-author? "Even in the weeks before her death," he says, "she was taking money for 'Jean's Way,' which, if it was untrue, would have been terribly dishonest."
IT IS DEREK HUMPHRY'S contention that his ex-wife's suicide and her antagonistic behavior toward him over the last two years -- including the charge he suffocated Jean -- were the result of mental illness. He claims Ann attempted suicide once before in the early 1970's, after the breakup of her first marriage. Ann suffered "huge depressions," Derek says, in which she could be reduced to a "catatonic" state. "Sometimes she was the most beautiful person to live with," he says. "Other times she was hell on earth."
Humphry alleges that Ann was a heavy Valium user who had spent much time in therapy. In several public statements he described her as "a borderline personality," given to sudden mood swings and dark rages. Marion C. Freeman, a longtime friend of the Humphrys, recalls that on a weekend visit to Windfall Farm, which Ann had bought in 1988, Ann exploded with startling anger during a minor disagreement with her. "She came up to me practically nose to nose and screamed in my face," says Freeman. "She had so much rage in her that never got out."
In her most virulent moments, Ann accused Derek of waging a premeditated campaign to drive her to the brink of suicide. In October of last year, three months after their divorce became final, she filed a $6 million lawsuit against him and the Hemlock Society, contending that Derek had libeled her in his public statements about her emotional instability and that he'd harassed her to impede her cancer recovery. On her videotape, Ann lobs accusations against virtually everyone prominently involved in the Hemlock Society, reeling off a list of names of people who are, she says, "trying to kill me."
The depth of Ann's anger and hurt on the tape raises the question of whether her suicide might have been an act of revenge. In leaving her, Derek had obliterated not just their marriage but, in the subsequent shakeout within the Hemlock Society, the status and identity she'd enjoyed for almost a decade as its deputy director. The videotape may have represented an honest expression of her doubts about euthanasia and the Hemlock Society, but it may also have been Ann Humphry's way of paying back her ex-husband.
"Derek," begins the suicide note Ann left for him. "There. You got what you wanted. Ever since I was diagnosed as having cancer, you have done everything conceivable to precipitate my death. . . .
"You will have to live with this until you die. May you never, ever forget."
In response to Ann's note, made public by her friend, Rita Marker, Derek accuses his ex-wife of "trying to lay a guilt trip on me," adding: "I felt terribly sad and I feel pained and I've cried about her death. But I know how ill she was."
IT IS UNCERTAIN what, if any, fallout there will be from Ann Humphry's death for either the Hemlock Society or the broader euthanasia movement. Derek claims to have noticed no discernible upsurge in membership defections after the sordid publicity surrounding the divorce, and he doesn't expect any now, in the wake of Ann's electrifying videotape, which was given to this reporter by a friend of hers.
Jack Nicholl, director of the campaign to place an aid-in-dying initiative before California voters next year, also predicts the controversy will have little impact on public opinion. But, he adds, "For the insiders, it's hard. They're fighting from the grave now. Who knows what to believe? Obviously, they were very angry at one another."
Ann's friends contend, however, that although she was emotional, she was never consumed with anger, and they dispute Derek's claim that she was mentally ill. They describe a woman who was rational and actively engaged in life. In the last year, they say, Ann had learned to fly-fish, taken a five-day river rafting trip and trained for an airplane pilot's license.
In her last eight months, Ann had also become romantically involved with Dr. Rick Urbanski, a 41-year-old emergency-room physician in Eugene. "I'm used to looking for suicidal depression, and I didn't see it," says Urbanski. "A person like that creates so much havoc around them, I wouldn't have allowed them in my life. Ann and I had a wonderful relationship."
Yet despite the bright spots of her final months, Ann also had to endure a series of sharp setbacks. There were complications from reconstructive breast surgery, and a second operation led to an infection that damaged her liver. She'd hoped to write a book about her struggles with her disease, according to her friend Julie Horvath, but her proposal was turned down by publishers who told her the woman-with-cancer story was overdone. "That really took a lot out of her," Horvath says. "She used to call and be really upset." The book rejections came at the very time "Final Exit" was becoming the top-selling nonfiction title in the country.
Friends say a great weariness came over Ann in September. When she visited Rita Marker, the subject of suicide arose. "She had really been through an awful, awful lot in the last two years," Marker says.
In late September, Ann called Horvath, a helicopter flight instructor in Los Angeles, and invited her to Windfall Farm. "She was planning on 'checking out,' as she termed it, and the purpose was to say goodbye," says Horvath, who arrived on a Sunday with a sense of dread but also a conviction that Ann was sound of mind. On Monday night and off and on through Tuesday, the two recorded the videotape, which was meant to be a record of Ann's story though not necessarily her last statement.
On camera, Ann says: "It bothered me that when I die I might slip through the cracks, and I thought, 'Well, that's just the way it is.' You live in the country and life is cheap. . . . And maybe you finally have to accept the fact that you did slip through the cracks. . . . I just want to get out of here and go to sleep and just be left alone."
Ann goes on to say there are two things she would like to live for: to continue speaking out about her misgivings about euthanasia and to see through to the end her lawsuit against Derek, a conclusion she expects will fully vindicate her.
When Horvath left with the videotape on Tuesday night, Ann seemed in no immediate danger. She had weekend plans with Rick Urbanski to drive one of her steers to a cattle auction. But suddenly her plans changed. At 12:30 Wednesday afternoon, Horvath received Ann's call:
"She said, 'Julie, I'm checking out.' I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'My attorneys dropped the lawsuit. They said they've already given the papers to Derek to say he's won.'
"She said, 'I'm so tired. I can't go on.' I said, 'Anna, let me come up.' She said, 'No.' I said, 'Anna, then come down here and I will support you, get you back on your feet.' She said, 'I'm just too tired.' "
Horvath began to cry. "I said, 'I love you so much.' She said: 'I love you, too. I'll see you wherever.' "
Hastily, Ann scribbled a few farewell notes, including the letter to Derek. Then she hitched a horse trailer to her Chevrolet pickup and set off east, for the four-hour drive into the mountains. Turning up a rough road into the Three Sisters Wilderness, she headed for one of her favorite places, Park Meadow -- driving fast, trying to make it by nightfall.
At a trailhead, she saddled up and cantered out to the meadow, a large clearing amid the tall pines with a view of the mountains. Her friends are certain she arrived in time to watch a gorgeous sunset. Then she rode 200 yards off the trail, removed her horse's tackle so it wouldn't snag once the animal was free and sat down with her back to a tree. "She apparently just lay down," said the head of the search team that found her six days later, "and went to sleep."

HEADLINE: FILM;
A 'Peter Pan' for the 90's

BYLINE: By HILARY DE VRIES; Hilary de Vries writes about the performing arts for The Los Angeles Times and other publications.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The pirate extras are milling about the deck of the Jolly Roger, a coal-black galleon the size of a Episcopal church. A Japanese television crew, filming a commercial, hunches over a treasure chest, debating the number of doubloons that should appear in the frame, while the actors, bedecked in the requisite eye patches and earning tidy per diems, take time out from their attempts to appear craven.
The site is Stage 27 of the Sony Pictures lot. For "Hook," Steven Spielberg's $60 million-plus updating of J. M. Barrie's classic "Peter Pan," it's all over but the shooting of this commercial. 
 Mr. Spielberg is nowhere to be seen, but a reverential hush hangs over the proceedings. Up on the poop deck of the Jolly Roger, an earnest press aide leans forward and whispers to a visitor: " 'Hook' isn't really about pirates. It's about Steven's views of modern parenting."
The film, which opens Wednesday, is considered the big movie in a season crowded with nearly a dozen big films opening within the same two weeks -- among them Barbra Streisand's "Prince of Tides," Oliver Stone's "J.F.K." and Barry Levinson's "Bugsy." "Hook" has generated more than usual interest largely because it represents a watershed in Mr. Spielberg's career -- a return to the themes that have made him the industry's No. 1 practitioner of fantasy film making. As such, the movie marks another potential blockbuster for the director as well as for Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Japanese owners of Tri-Star Pictures, the studio releasing the movie. "Hook" is expected to bolster Sony's future in Hollywood as well as the recession-battered American film industry.
For Mr. Spielberg, the director of such hits as "Jaws," "E. T., the Extra-Terrestrial," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and the Indiana Jones series, "Hook" is the movie he said he would never make, and it is one influenced as much by pop psychology as by Barrie's quirky views of child rearing.
In the film, Robin Williams plays an overweight, middle-aged man who leaves the world of corporate raiding to return to Neverland on a mission to rescue his own two children, kidnapped by his arch-foe Captain Hook, played by Dustin Hoffman. Clearly, this is a New Age Peter Pan for the 90's.
"Peter has grown up into a Type-A personality who is fairly unlikable as a modern parent," says the 43-year-old Mr. Spielberg (father of "four with one on the way"). "He is a workaholic like a lot of us -- I can relate to that -- but he evolves into this wonderful man-child."
For years, the conventional wisdom in Hollywood has been that no one was better equipped to bring Barrie's puerile sprite to the screen than Mr. Spielberg, himself dubbed Hollywood's Peter Pan because of his ability to tell children's stories that appeal to young and old alike. And perhaps it was only a matter of time before Barrie's Victorian tale of childhood in extremis met its match in the psycho-speak of John Bradshaw, another firm believer in extended childhoods, who coined the mantra for the 90's -- "the child within."
Mr. Spielberg's preoccupation with Peter Pan dates back several years to a time when he worked on his own screen adaptation of the Barrie tale about a boy who prefers the pirate-infested Neverland to puberty. The story first saw life as a play at the Duke of York Theater in London on Dec. 27, 1904, and was reworked into a best-selling children's book in 1991. Of the many versions of the story, the 1953 Disney animated film and the 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin and directed by Jerome Robbins, remain perhaps the best known.
In his initial flirtation with his own film version, Mr. Spielberg went so far as to woo Mr. Hoffman for a role, but the venture became mired in script difficulties, and Mr. Spielberg went on to shoot "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," the 1989 film that completed his trilogy about the archeologist-adventurer.
"I will never direct 'Peter Pan,' " he said at the time.
"Did I say that?" he says now. "I guess I had to get a little older to see that I wasn't done regressing. I've given up trying to be Martin Scorsese, Kurosawa or David Lean. Maybe this film is about my finally growing up. I guess I've given up avoiding me."
Anthony Powell, the costume designer for "Hook" who has worked with Mr. Spielberg on the Indiana Jones films, says: "The whole premise of this version is Peter Pan finding himself, and Steven is fascinated by that idea."
Mr. Spielberg brings many "I gotta be me" sentiments to "Hook." With a tone bereft of irony, he describes the film as "Peter's journey backward to reclaim his own childhood." In Mr. Spielberg's hands -- and with a script by Jim Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo, based on a Nick Castle story -- Barrie's narcissistic protagonist is transformed into a far more laudable individual, even a role model for a middle-aged man.
To the suggestion that Barrie's Peter was often a less-than-admirable hero, Mr. Spielberg replies deadpan: "He was? That's Barrie's idea. I think we go in the other direction."
Kathleen Kennedy, Mr. Spielberg's longtime associate and one of the producers of "Hook," elaborates: "What is unnerving in Barrie's story is its focus on regression. Steven is not making a movie about regression, but he is tapping into that child-as-adult theme.
"Unlike 'E. T,' he is telling this film from an adult, not a child's, perspective."
As this New Age revision goes, the middle-aged Peter (renamed Peter Banning) goes up against a Captain Hook played by Mr. Hoffman with a kind of campy villainy that owes much to William F. Buckley Jr. Julia Roberts flutters in and out as a decidedly androgynous Tinkerbell, a cantankerous aide de camp on this journey toward the center of self. Wendy (Maggie Smith), Barrie's other major female character, has been consigned to the sidelines as a 90-year-old plot device.
Indeed, this has become a story of middle-aged men in search of themselves. Mr. Spielberg even calls Captain Hook "a grown-up Lost Boy -- the biggest boy with the most toys." And in discussing the film, most of the principal actors sound as if they had just finished a seminar by the pop-psychology guru of inner maleness, Robert Bly.
"I can't remember a film of this ilk; it's not just a job, it's extraordinary," says Mr. Hoffman, who was less entranced with his heavy costume, which included a yak's-hair wig, a five-pound steel hook and an air-conditioning hose running up the back of his velvet waistcoat.
"Hook," explains the 54-year-old actor, "is about killing off a part of yourself when you grow up. God knows, I'm not a feminist, but I do think women understand the idea more than men. As a rule, women can sit on the ground with the kids and just get lost for hours; and for men it's work. The child is still alive in the female more than the man."
Mr. Williams, 40 years old and a father of "two with one on the way," suggests that "Hook" "is about growing up, the good and the bad -- the joy of seeing an uptight workahaolic get back his imagination and make him magical again.
"Fight, fly and crow," says the actor, who spent two weeks of the filming strapped to an elaborate cable and camera system being flown around the sound stage 60 feet in the air. "Those are the things needed to get back to childhood, and in order to fly you have to have one happy thought. And 'they didn't audit me' doesn't count."
It is gently suggested that a post-Victorian audience might find it hard to believe that a grown man, even one as playful as Mr. Williams, would crow as a sort of whimsical primal scream. In response, he launches into an impression of President Bush. " 'Well, gotta ooooh! Gotta do it, gotta make it happen, gotta fly. Gonna work together, people.' Yeah, wouldn't that be great."
Probably Mike Medavoy, the chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, would be equally ecstatic if "Hook" turns out to be the hit of the holiday season. When he was handed the script shortly after his arrival at Tri-Star last year, he swiftly jettisoned the original and less-experienced director, Nick Castle, and signed Mr. Spielberg. Mr. Castle received a $500,000 kill fee, a story credit on "Hook" and a promise to direct another Tri-Star film. Mr. Medavoy then went after Mr. Spielberg, who "committed in two weeks," says Mr. Medavoy.
And Mr. Spielberg, whose reputation had suffered when he tried to make what he called "grown-up stories" like "Always" (1989) and "Empire of the Sun" (1987), got to make the movie that many in the industry thought he was destined to make.
At Mr. Spielberg's insistence, all the film's sets -- ranging from the Jolly Roger and the teeming Pirate Town to the Lost Boy's treehouse and Tinkerbell's dollhouse -- were built in the "timeworn Hollywood tradition" of artificial sets photographed realistically.
"We are trying to be less cutesy than the Disney version and go back to Barrie's darker original, which was more about unleashed devilment," says the set designer John Napier.
Adds Mr. Spielberg: "Neverland is not a cartoon world. It is a real place."
 
 
 
HOOK'S DREAM BOAT
 When filming of "Hook" began in Hollywood last February, the set -- considered lavish even in an industry inured to fiscal excess -- proved to be one of the biggest draws in town. The A-list of visitors to the Culver City studios included royalty (Queen Noor of Jordan), ex-wives (Amy Irving, formerly married to Steven Spielberg) and actors from competing films (Warren Beatty of "Bugsy").
Most of the film's $60 million-plus budget went into the production (director and stars are receiving percentages of the gross); $1.5 million went into Captain Hook's pirate ship, the Jolly Roger, whose sheer size -- 170 feet long, 35 feet wide and 70 feet high -- made it the most expensive prop ever used in a Spielberg film, along with the mechanical extra-terrestrial in "E. T.," which also cost $1.5 million.
The Jolly Roger was designed by John Napier, the man behind the helicopter in the Broadway musical "Miss Saigon," and it took 15 weeks to build. The ship is a combination of a Spanish galleon and a 17th-century English frigate with a skull-like protrusion on the bow that "came to me in a dream," Mr. Napier says. "This is the ultimate pirate ship -- bleak, tough, but with an element of romance."
Norman Garwood, the film's production designer, was responsible for translating Mr. Napier's designs into a wood-and-steel structure surrounded by 400,000 gallons of water. Then there was the question of painting it. "With a ship this size, the temptation was to paint the whole thing pink to make it look ominous and regal," says Mr. Garwood, who opted instead for a traditional color scheme of black, gold and crimson. Except for the rigging (designed by British nautical experts) and the cannons (replicas of those on the real H.M.S. Bounty), which can fire plastic cannonballs, nothing on the Jolly Roger actually moves. "Basically," Mr. Napier says, "this is just big scenery."
Maybe not. Plans are under way for a Peter Pan theme park in Orlando, Fla., which may be why Tri-Star spent $500,000 to dismantle and store the "Hook" sets rather than destroy them.

Should Ice Cube's Voice Be Chilled?

BYLINE: By Jon Pareles

 BODY:
Ice Cube must be pleased about the reception for "Death Certificate." In the last month, the album of angry raps zoomed up to No. 2 on Billboard's album chart and brought denunciations from groups that believe Ice Cube's virulent diatribes are racist: proof that he's not only popular but important.
Welcome to the bitterly contested zone of hate speech, which can lead to disciplinary action on some college campuses, arrest in some states and, now, a best-selling album that some people want to squelch. In the past, rockers who slipped into bigotry accused their accusers of nit-picking a line or two. Ice Cube devotes long stretches of his album to knee-jerk racial and class prejudices. 
 Hate speech is hard to define but disturbing and threatening to many of its targets, and it has become a major battleground in constitutional law. On Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments over whether a St. Paul law against cross-burning violates the First Amendment.
"Death Certificate" offers more complex (and sometimes contradictory) messages than a cross-burning, but it's not subtle. Ice Cube knows who he hates, and his raps bluntly insult and threaten violence against homosexuals, women, whites who exploit blacks, whites who covet black women, blacks who date white women, Korean shopkeepers, rappers who cross over to pop, the Los Angeles chief of police, self-destructive ghetto blacks and more.
The album is divided into "the death side" -- purportedly ironic gangster raps about gunplay and sex -- and "the life side," which reduces politics to grudge matches, often defined on racial lines. On the life side, Ice Cube is serious. Clearly influenced by the Rev. Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, which he endorses in liner notes, Ice Cube favors black separatism, although he doesn't want his black nation to include homosexuals ("true niggers ain't gay") or yuppies. In his opposition to miscegenation, he probably has a lot in common with the pre-campaign David Duke and his notions of racial purity.
The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human-rights group, urged four major record-store chains to stop selling the album, calling it a "cultural Molotov cocktail." The center had previously protested songs by Public Enemy, Guns 'n' Roses and Madonna, but has not called for an album's withdrawal.
It singled out "No Vaseline," a put down of Ice Cube's former group, N.W.A. The main metaphor is a homophobic one, and at one point Ice Cube envisions hanging and burning N.W.A.'s Eazy-E. The center cited Ice Cube's references to the group's manager as a Jew and his suggestion that N.W.A. "put a bullet in his temple/ You can't be the nigga for life crew with a white Jew telling you what to do." (N.W.A.'s current album is called "Efil4zaggin," intended to be read backward.)
The center also cited "Black Korea," in which Ice Cube rails against "Oriental one-penny countin' " shopkeepers who "follow me up and down your market." The song threatens a "nationwide boycott" and continues: "Pay respect to the black fist or we'll burn your store right down." The Korean-American Coalition has also condemned that rap. The British album will delete "No Vaseline" and "Black Korea," although the album will still include inflammatory material.
In a rare editorial about an album's contents, Billboard magazine described "Death Certificate" as "the rankest sort of racism and hatemongering." The editorial specifically rejected the Wiesenthal Center's request for removal of the album, but concluded, "Each of us must decide whether or not Ice Cube's record is fit to sell or purchase."
A response by James Bernard, senior editor at the rap magazine The Source, said Billboard's conclusion favored censorship because the magazine's editors "are too dainty and thin-skinned to hear the anger and rage and frustration that many people are forced to deal with every day."
The rage and frustration are real; so is the demagoguery that would exploit them, and the stupidity of some who are enraged. Ice Cube has decided that his people have been bullied too long, and that the appropriate reaction, as it would be in a gang war, is to identify the enemy and perpetrate vengeance. It's an ugly, simplistic reaction, an escalation rather than a solution. If Ice Cube were running for political office, seeking the power to realize his fantasies, he'd most likely be defeated as decisively as David Duke was.
By not only replying to Ice Cube's ideas but urging that he be silenced, the Wiesenthal Center handed him a tactical bonanza. Now he has opposition, white and Jewish to boot, that's out to muzzle him, proving that even paranoids have real enemies. The issue becomes not whether Ice Cube's raps are worth heeding, but whether they can be heard at all. When Jesse Helms and George Bush win elections with racially divisive commercials, Ice Cube's supporters can easily charge that the censorship is selective. As for hype, many rappers and rockers would give up their drum machines to be perceived as "a cultural Molotov cocktail."
Why are people buying "Death Certificate"? Most, I suspect, are not endorsing its racism; they're savoring the action-movie thrills of Ice Cube's dirty words, his machismo, his gift for violent imagery and his general anger -- N.W.A.'s formula. While Ice Cube has said that album is addressed to black listeners, and others don't matter, it's unlikely that "Death Certificate" reached No. 2 solely through sales to blacks; whites are buying it, too, and are probably not persuaded to see themselves as "the devil."
This year, N.W.A., Guns 'n' Roses, Metallica and Skid Row have all hit No. 1 because, doctrines aside, they're mad as hell and ready to profit from it. The recession has left young people un- and underemployed, disillusioned and seething. Some will fall under the sway of political demagogues, some will join gangs; Ice Cube didn't invent us-vs.-them thinking. A far larger audience, however, will just play loud music.
None of Ice Cube's ideas -- some half-baked, some arguable and some pernicious -- will surprise anyone who is aware of the racial rhetoric of American cities. Ice Cube is not the most responsible voice; someone who calls himself "the nigga you love to hate" doesn't pretend to be. Ugly as some of his thinking is, however, he has a right to be heard by those who are curious about his message -- and, then, to be challenged for his prejudices.

HEADLINE: Time for a Change in Builder Incentives?

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
UNDER the combined weight of budget deficits, a deep recession and a surplus of new buildings, New York City officials are facing off against the construction industry in an attempt to overhaul the city's generous incentives for real estate development.
The incentives include tax breaks for developers and have become a fixture of New York construction over the last 15 years. Beginning in 1976, a time of fiscal crisis, they were created, modified and layered in an attempt to foster new construction, steer it to the commercial backwaters of the five boroughs and keep big business from leaving the city. 
 Now, in the aftermath of a development wave gone sour, there is almost universal agreement that changes in the incentives are needed.
Can the city afford to subsidize new development when there is already too much space to fill? And can it afford to stop, thereby dealing a further blow to construction, which grew in the 80's into New York's largest industry, but is now floundering?
"Times have changed," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. Although the incentives "generated numerous benefits for the city in the real estate market of the 1980's," she added, "we require a redirection to focus on the problems of the 1990's."
The debate in some ways echoes another in Washington, where Congress and the Bush Administration are grappling with what tax incentives to enact to jump-start a national economy mired in recession. New York's economy also is in recession, and the construction industry, after losing more than 20,000 jobs since 1989, is considered by some to be in depression.
"It is precisely because New York City is under fiscal constraints that it needs incentives for development," said Louis J. Coletti, president of the New York Builders Congress, a trade group. "Until we get the real estate design and construction industry moving again, the city will not regain its luster."
Ms. Pinero spoke before a City Council committee that is due in January to recommend revisions or elimination of one of the largest of the development incentives, the Industrial and Commercial Incentive Program, which since 1976 has provided tax benefits to developers across the city. Because of a sunset provision, it is scheduled to end this month.
The program, known in the shorthand of City Hall as "I.C.I.P.," postpones property taxes for up to 23 years on new and renovated commercial buildings and is available to anyone building outside the best blocks on the East Side and in the Wall Street area.
IN an analysis last week, Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm, found that 20 large commercial buildings have been completed over the last decade with I.C.I.P. benefits. They include office towers on Broadway, the Hotel Macklowe on West 45th Street and the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in the theater district.
Ms. Pinero said all I.C.I.P. benefits should be eliminated for new construction everywhere south of 96th Street in Manhattan. But she did not recommend ending the program, saying new tax breaks should be extended to those who renovate old office space in lower Manhattan, where vacancies are the highest in the city and many buildings are technologically ill equipped.
Her proposal did not go far enough for many construction-industry executives.
A study commissioned by the New York Building Congress, released last week, analyzed the spillover effect of construction as it benefits other businesses and concluded that it had grown during the boom of the 80's to account for 23.4 percent of the city's economic output.
But now, the group said, cutbacks in construction spending have created a "reverse ripple" affect, in which jobs are being lost across a spectrum of related businesses. What the builders need, it maintained, is more, not less, help from City Hall.
Among the recommendations of the builders is that the I.C.I.P. program be renewed and extended, providing its tax benefits to anyone who builds anywhere in the city. The group also proposes that $1 billion in the city's capital budget, raised through the Municipal Assistance Corporation, be spent entirely on the repair of roads, sewers and public buildings.
Other real estate executives said the city's efforts to revive the construction industry should be more narrow, and targeted to areas most in need of development.
"We don't need subsidies for new buildings, but we do need to enhance existing resources," said John E. Zuccotti, chief executive officer of Olympia & York of Toronto, owners of the World Financial Center in lower Manhattan. He also serves as president of the Downtown Lower Manhattan Association, a group advocating renovation and development below Chambers Street.
Mr. Zuccotti said the city "needs a bundle of subsidies" to retain and attract corporate tenants, but that the inducements should be offered directly to the tenants instead of to their landlords or developers.
He also said incentives for development should be designed exclusively for lower Manhattan and include tax abatements for those who renovate old office and loft space into other uses, particularly housing.
Any new incentives would come at a time when developers, contractors, architects and building trades people are desperate for work. In one small example of the industry's plight, Der Scutt, the New York City architect, placed a "help wanted" advertisement in The New York Times on Oct. 20 for three entry-level architects in his firm. He was overwhelmed by 1,100 applications. The three positions were quickly filled, but not before the mailman serving Mr. Scutt's Manhattan office asked if he was running a sweepstakes.
Still, some analysts of City Hall and the New York economy say that reviving development now is at best wishful thinking, and at worst a serious waste of tax revenues.
"The 80's may have been wonderful for the construction industry, but we can't recreate the past and shouldn't try," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University and co-author of a report on prospects for the city's economy entitled "Reinventing New York."
Mr. Moss and Hugh O'Neill, a New York University professor of economics, said the objective of financial incentives and tax policy should now be people rather than real estate. Any subsidies the city can afford, they said in the report, should go to schools, libraries, the arts, parks, job training and other programs that would reinforce its position as a center of "intellectual capital."
"We should be creating incentives for job creation, not space creation," Mr. Moss said.
New York was far from alone among American cities in the 1980's in providing incentives for development. In Houston, Los Angeles, Boston and many other cities, zoning inducements and tax breaks led to a surge of building that was faster and more exaggerated, and led to office gluts that are now more severe than the one in New York.
"New York City has spent a boatload on its real estate incentives, but it has done better than most cities in monitoring what incentives were appropriate," said Margaret Sowell, director of real estate advisory services for Coopers & Lybrand, the Manhattan accounting firm.
Another lure to development in all cities in the early 80's were Federal tax shelters used by wealthy people who financed or built real estate. The tax breaks, allowing people to sharply reduce their taxes by declaring "passive losses" on real estate, were largely eliminated with the 1986 revision of the tax codes, but not before drawing vast investments into development that was not completed until later in the decade.
For New York, one competitive fact of life remains, even though the real estate boom has turned to bust: New, lower-cost office space beckons business from Jersey City, Stamford, White Plains and other suburban corporate centers. Without tax breaks from City Hall, Manhattan real estate executives say they would be out of the game.
"WE think it sends the wrong message to foreign companies and big corporate tenants when the Dinkins administration talks about scaling back" development incentives, said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York City. "It says the city does not want growth."
The costs and benefits of development incentives are impossible to measure. While it is simple to calculate how much tax money is lost if property taxes on a new building are temporarily deferred or eliminated, it cannot be known how much more would be lost if the building were not constructed at all.
This becomes a classic chicken-or-egg question for planners and historians. Without incentives, how much would be built?
"There is just no way to know," said James P. Goonan, a partner in Deloitte & Touche, a New York accounting firm, which tried in vain in the 80's to measure the fiscal impact of the city's J-51 program, which eliminates property taxes for 10 years for owners who renovate apartment buildings.
Still, experts say there is no question that the large menu of incentives promulgated by New York City were an important spur to developers. Besides the I.C.I.P. program and J-51 -- both still being offered -- other initiatives led to bursts of building just as these initiatives were taken off the city's books.
One was the 421a program, which offered tax abatements to builders of new luxury housing. Designed to alleviate the city's severe housing shortage in the early 80's, it was eliminated below 96th Street in Manhattan in December 1985, thereby creating a deadline for builders to put in foundations.
The result was a construction spree from 1986 to 1988, with more than 20 huge condominium and rental buildings rising from the posh avenues of the Upper East Side to the far reaches of Clinton, formerly known as Hell's Kitchen. Many of the new condominiums, priced from $200,000 to over $1 million, were completed just as the city's residential market began to slump after the stock market collapse in 1987.
Another deadline was created at the end of 1987 under a program of zoning bonuses for commercial developers who built offices and hotels in the western half of Midtown Manhattan. The developers were allowed to put up taller and bulkier towers than would otherwise have been permitted.
The deadline led to a fresh surge of development from 1988 to 1990, with more than a dozen commercial buildings and 9 million square feet of new offices rising in West Midtown, mainly around Times Square. When they were completed, the urban economy was already slumping, and some of the new towers at still begging for tenants.
"While it is true that some of these building are in deep trouble attracting tenants, the program accomplished its goal of attracting development from east to west" in the nation's most heavily developed commercial district, said Robert Flahive, director of the Manhattan office of the New York City Department of Planning. He added that the new West Side buildings will "prime the pump" for more development in the neighborhood when the real estate slump ends.
Perhaps the most important development incentives since 1988 have been incorporated in what City Hall calls its "other-boroughs strategy." The incentives include the biggest tax breaks allowed under I.C.I.P., other tax credits for each employee, subsidized energy and moving expenses. They go to developers who build, or business that move, above 96th Street in Manhattan or in any of the other four boroughs.
Real estate executives say the program has been instrumental in a development surge in downtown Brooklyn. More than 15 million square feet of office space is being completed there and almost all has been leased to an assortment of Wall Street firms, other private companies and government agencies.
DESPITE that apparent success, some critics say the other-boroughs strategy, like other incentives, is an idea whose time has passed. "Manhattan is, and always will be, the epicenter of commerce," for the New York region, said Mr. Moss of New York University, adding that whatever incentives remain in place should not be designed to draw development elsewhere.
Mr. Moss's proposals for the city have little else in common with those of the real estate industry, but he concurred on that point, which was put this way by Mr. Spinola:
"We need to protect the city's core and build on it."
Whatever the outcome of the debate over incentives, New York City has already lost huge numbers of jobs and much needed tax revenue, at least compared to the peak years of the construction boom from 1985 to 1987.
Construction itself has fallen off sharply. In 1987, the peak of the boom, more than 11.3 million square feet of new office space was started in the city, according to F. W. Dodge Company, a research concern. Last year there were starts for only 4.3 million square feet, and for the first ten months of this year, the total is only 700,000.
Employment in construction has also plummeted. Since 1989, when construction industry employment averaged 120,800 jobs, the highest ever in New York City, it has fallen to an average of 99,500 jobs so far this year, according to the Federal Department of Labor.

HEADLINE: Talking: 2-Families;
Bias Now Prohibited In Rentals

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
TRADITIONALLY, the rental apartments in two-family houses in New York City have been exempted from the laws that prohibit racial and other forms of discimination in housing, provided the owner or a member of the owner's family lived in the house.
While owners of two-family houses could not publicly advertise that they would accept only, say, a white Christian family, they were able to legally make such a distinction when an applicant called at the door. The rationale was that renting the second unit in a two-family house was like bringing someone into one's home and thatcontrols would be an unfair restriction on private property rights. 
 Although not every landlord discriminated, the exemption meant effectively that more than 100,00 apartments were not available to families of some ethnic or religious groups.
But now an amendment to New York City's fair-housing regulations that took effect Sept. 16 has brought owner-occupied two-family houses under the antidiscrimination regulations. This means that owners may no longer refuse to rent on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, citizenship status, occupation, children, sex or sexual orientation, age, disability or marital status. An owner can still refuse someone who has a poor credit or employment history, insufficient income to pay the rent or a criminal record.
Lonnie Soury, director of public information for the New York City Human Rights Commission, said the commission had sought the change to eliminate "major sources of weakness where discrimination could freely flourish."
Keeping owner-occupied two-family houses outside the purview of the law was viewed as having major implications. The 1990 census showed that the city has 188,474 two-family houses: 82,170 in Brooklyn, 70,448 in Queens, 17,135 in Staten Island, 16,864 in the Bronx and 1,857 in Manhattan. Not all are owner-occupied, but most probably are, say housing observers, and two-family houses contain some of the largest and most economical apartments in the city.
Moreover, New York City was recently cited in a Federal study as having the worst record for housing discrimination in the country.
The new antidiscrimination amendment applies to units offered publicly for rent. The only exclusion is "if the available housing accomodation has not been publicly advertised, listed (with a real estate broker), or otherwise offered to the general public" -- the actual amendment's words.
Harvey Fisher, assistant deputy commissioner for law enforcment for the city's Human Rights Commission, said this means that "if the landlord puts up a notice on a church bulletin board or in the laundromat or tells a real estate broker or even puts it a small ethnic newspaper, the apartment would be subject to the new amendment."
Phyllis Spiro, director of the Open Housing Center, a nonprofit group in Manhattan that helps victims of discrimination gather evidence against landlords, added that it could also mean a notice in a window or in a private-membership newsletter.
But there could be exceptions. Ms. Spiro gave as a hypothetical example two white friends in an office who talk about such an apartment at the water cooler. If a black colleague overhears and applies and is turned down, he might not have a legitimate right to complain.
But Mr. Fisher of the Human Rights Commission further warned that even under those conditions the owner may no longer have a right to discriminate. When the two-family-house amendment was approved, he said, the regulations were also modified to broaden the definition of "publicly assisted housing," another category of housing covered by the law.
PUBLICLY assisted housing now includes any two-family house built after July 1, 1950, that might have been bought with the help of a Goverment-subsidized financing program such as a Sonny Mae mortgage, a loan from the Veterans Administration or even a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Provided the loan was taken out after July 1, 1955, the house will now be subject to the law even if the second unit is not publicly offered.
Normal Siegel, a lawyer and executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that as a result it would be prudent for any owner of a two-family house to check with a lawyer before making any attempt to rent. The owner should also double-check the nature of the financing to see if it might be deemed "publicly assisted" under the widened definition.
He also said that owners who have a family member living in one of the units -- rather than themselves -- should also be cautious before assuming that the family member qualifies under the amendement. It would proabably have to be an immediate family member like a child, a parent or a sibling, said Mr. Fisher.
Mr. Siegel further warned that the city's Human Rights Commission has been gradually strengthening the penalties likely to flow from any violation of the fair housing law. Fines up to $100,000 can now be imposed if the commission is able to prove "willful, wanton or malicious" dealings.
Even so, tenants should not expect those practices to disappear overnight. Roberta Bernstein, president of the Small Property Owners of New York, expects some of the strongest resistance to come from owners who have tradionally preferred to rent only to members of their own ethnic group, she said.
Also, many owners may not yet be aware of the change. "I only just found out myself," said Ms. Spiro of the Open Housing Center. She suggests that any applicants suspecting discrimination should call the owner's attention to the new amendment.
While that may not save the apartment for them -- applicants rarely move in even if they win a case or an argument, she said, because they fear retaliation -- it could help save the day for another family. The commission is already prosecuting its first case under the new amendment but would not release details.
Tenants who need advice or suspect discrimination when applying for an apartment in a two-family house should contact the Open Housing Center (941-6101) or the Human Rights Commission hot line (306-7500). They should not contact any of the state or federal anti-discriminaton agencies since the new amendment has not been adopted into state or federal law. It applies only to New York City properties.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Grand Central;
Adding to the Area Where Air Rights Can Be Used

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
HOW far will city planners go to find development sites where Grand Central Terminal's air rights can be used?
East 48th Street, it would seem. 
 Tomorrow, the City Planning Department is to issue a report on a proposed zoning subdistrict from Madison to Lexington Avenues, 41st to 48th Streets, that would expand by 15 blocks the area to which the unused development rights -- some 1.7 million to 1.9 million square feet -- can be transferred.
The question of which sites are eligible has bedeviled developers, owners, city planners and preservationists ever since the United States Supreme Court upheld the landmark designation of Grand Central in 1978.
That decision effectively barred Penn Central from building a 55-story tower over the terminal itself, given that there were other sites in the vicinity on which Grand Central's development rights might be used.
However, without a subdistrict, the only eligible sites are those adjacent to the terminal, across the street or connected through a chain of lots under common ownership.
City planners have been working since 1989 on the subdistrict proposal, which is to be reviewed next year by Community Boards 5 and 6, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger and the Manhattan Borough Board, after which it must be voted on by the City Planning Commission and City Council.
In the core of the subdistrict, planners would allow buildings with floor-area ratios of 21.6; that is, having floor space 21.6 times greater than the lot size. Such a floor-area ratio, or F.A.R., would yield a 432,000-square-foot building on a 20,000-square-foot lot. On the district's edges, the F.A.R. would be 16.
To qualify for the 21.6 F.A.R., a builder would have to provide major improvements to the pedestrian circulation system around Grand Central and contribute to the maintenance of the landmark.
The director of the Manhattan office in the City Planning Department, Robert E. Flahive, explained, "We are trying to provide a mechanism, on sites where appropriate, to allow transfers to occur but at the same time to impose additional controls."
Within the Grand Central subdistrict, planners have identified 15 potential development sites. Some are under single ownership but others would require laborious assemblage.
Under current zoning, the F.A.R. is 15, before bonuses. An increase in allowable bulk of more than 40 percent might make it economical -- in an improved market -- to attempt an assemblage or tear down a large building to be able to capitalize on the zoning. Planners have cited these structures:
* Graybar Building, 420 Lexington Avenue, between 43d and 44th Streets; -- "1927 building with outdated systems; not first-class office space; prime location; large lot."
* 250 Park Avenue (former Postum Building), between 46th and 47th Streets -- "1924 building on prime Park Avenue location."
* Roosevelt Hotel, Madison Avenue and 45th Street -- "Old hotel in single ownership; easy site for redevelopment."
BUT new construction is out of the question today. As a practical matter, a possible enlargement of Manufacturers Hanover Plaza may provide the first opportunity to draw down the air rights, which are owned by the Penn Central Corporation of Cincinnati, corporate successor to the New York Central Railroad.
The question of space is particularly relevant for Manufacturers Hanover, which is to merge next month with Chemical Bank. Chemical's headquarters are to move into Manufacturers Hanover Plaza, which occupies the whole block between Park and Madison Avenues, 47th and 48th Streets.
Under the subdistrict proposal, the bank headquarters would be eligible to receive 353,000 square feet of air rights from Grand Central. These could be used to add 11 or 12 floors to the Madison Avenue annex, which is only 12 stories high, as opposed to the 52-story tower on Park Avenue.
Such an addition could not be constructed today because the headquarters is larger than zoning permits, with an F.A.R. of 17.2. It was built in 1960, for Union Carbide, before the current Zoning Resolution.
Moreover, even if there were a higher cap on bulk, Manufacturers Hanover Plaza is too far from Grand Central to be eligible for its air rights under current zoning rules, although it would qualify under the subdistrict, whose northwest corner it occupies.
In 1989, the City Planning Commission rebuffed an effort by a developer, G. Ware Travelstead, to establish a "chain of common ownership" along the subsurface lots of the rail yard running from Grand Central to his property, 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets.
The commission's denial was upheld last August in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Mr. Travelstead is planning an appeal.
Mr. Travelstead is under contract to buy 1.5 million square feet of air rights from Penn Central. He hoped to use more than half of those rights to build a 1.45 million-square-foot tower (roughly 650,000 square feet as a matter of right, supplemented by 800,000 square feet from the terminal).
UNDER his contract with Penn Central, Mr. Travelstead must close on the air rights within a year of the end of his lawsuit -- he plans to go to the United States Supreme Court, if necessary -- or, under any circumstance, no later than November 2004. Penn Central is not a party to the suit.
Aside from Mr. Travelstead's portion, it is not clear how much square footage there is in air rights. Penn Central says the total is 1.966 million square feet. Even subtracting the air rights under contract, that leaves more than enough to sell to Manufacturers Hanover.
But Frederick W. Rovet, the general counsel and managing director of the Travelstead Group and a former Penn Central executive, said he "did not believe that Penn Central has 353,000 square feet to give to Manny Hanny, in addition to the 1.5 million it has under contract to us."
He said Penn Central controlled 100,000 square feet free and clear. It owns another 100,000 square feet that are subject to use by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority if it chose to add floor space to the terminal.
Then there is an unusual lot at 416 Lexington Avenue, sandwiched between the Graybar Building and the Grand Hyatt Hotel. On it is a three-story building with a tunnel-like passage to a loading dock at Grand Central.
If the parcel at No. 416 is considered part of the terminal's zoning lot -- because it functions as a driveway to Grand Central -- it yields 270,000 square feet more of air rights for Penn Central. But it also might be considered a separate lot, like the adjacent Graybar and Grand Hyatt parcels.
Penn Central includes the 416 Lexington Avenue lot in its calculations. City planners neither concede nor dispute the point, referring to it instead as an "open issue."
Robert W. Olson, senior vice president of Penn Central, said he would not comment on "any discussion I may or may not be having" with the city and Manufacturers Hanover.
Should all other efforts fail to draw down the air rights, Penn Central is still prepared to propose a tower directly over Grand Central, perhaps using as a model the plans drawn in 1910 by Warren & Wetmore, architects of the terminal itself.
Mr. Olson said Penn Central had engaged the architect Hugh Hardy, of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, "to research how the Warren & Wetmore Beaux-Arts building works and how it relates to the terminal." For example, there are already banks of elevators at the corners of the terminal that were designed to serve a building overhead.
Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer designed the comprehensive exhibition "Grand Central Terminal: City Within the City" at the New-York Historical Society in 1982.

HEADLINE: IRT Power Plant

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was outraged to read in your article on Nov. 17 titled "The Power of Design vs. Con Ed Power" that the Landmarks Preservation Commission is going to try again to designate the IRT power plant at 59th Street and 11th Avenue -- an incredibly ugly building that, as your story points out, was obsolete when it opened in 1904. 
 The commission will spend badly needed tax dollars on hearings and court proceedings, and Con Edison will fight designation and add the costs to what we pay for electricity.
How can we expect anyone to take the city's needs seriously when we engage in this sort of insanity in the middle of a recession?

HEADLINE: Perspectives: A Converter Looks Back;
Recasting Rental Apartments as Co-ops

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
PEOPLE have the wrong notion of Francis Greenburger if they think of him as a co-op converter. He says he hasn't been in that business for five years.
Being in that business means being a buyer of rental property for conversion into co-ops. The downturn in the market for New York City co-ops, a series of New York State regulatory steps, and tax policies, not to mention the Tax Reform Act of 1986, soured Mr. Greenburger's taste for acquisitions. He hasn't bought a building for conversion since 1986. 
 "But for seven to nine years I spent two or three nights a week negotiating with tenant groups," he said in the soft-spoken and thoughtful, almost grave, tone he sometimes adopts, "and I would spend three to five days negotiating with owners."
All those negotiations led to the conversion by Mr. Greenburger and his company, Time Equities, of about 100 buildings with 10,000 apartments, making him one of the city's leading conversion sponsors. He did only noneviction plans. About 6,000 apartments were sold for owner-occupancy. Of the remaining 4,000, mostly renter-occupied, 80 percent have been turned back to his lenders. Half of the rest are owned by former partners. The other half, about 400 apartments, Mr. Greenburger still owns.
Now he is reflecting on the conversion years, which were sandwiched between periods of buying Manhattan residential real estate for investment and, after 1986, industrial and commercial buildings around the country. Time Equities was formed in 1968 and it owned 25 buildings with 1,000 apartments even before the first conversions began in 1979.
"We all paid too much in hindsight," he said of his mid-80's rental purchases for conversion, "what with tax reform, the increase in the tax assessed on capital gains, the expensive incentives we had to give in order to sell, and the economy going to hell. No one who bought a building after 1985 to convert made any money, and the more you paid the more you lost."
Other losers in the market's downturn, which cut values sharply, have been some of the purchasers of converted apartments, particularly outside buyers who paid market prices for their units in the mid and late 80's. If they need to resell in the current market, many will have to accept losses.
Beyond that, the flood of conversions has left a series of problems. The worst have been caused by the handful of sponsors who collected rent payments on renter-occupied apartments in co-ops but failed to make maintenance payments to the co-op corporations.
Or in some cases, sponsors collected payments on new mortgages that encompassed the building's existing underlying mortgage, but then failed to make debt payments on the underlying mortgage.
Mr. Greenburger, for his part, kept up his maintenance payments or turned over his shares to lenders who have done so. The publicity given to his early acknowledgment to the state's Attorney General that he foresaw problems in meeting his obligations to his lenders sent tremors through the co-op market and may have helped depress sales of vacancies in co-ops with renter-occupied apartments.
"He should be commended for not waiting to bring the problems to everyone's attention," said Frederick K. Mehlman, the assistant Attorney General in charge of the Bureau of Real Estate Finance. Subsequently Mr. Mehlman required far more detailed sponsor disclosures.
IN Mr. Greenburger's opinion, the new requirements created a "crisis atmosphere" in the name of full disclosure. "They made you present information that was overbiased negatively," he said. "It made you present the worst case possible and that panicked the market. It was like requiring a sign that says 'There may not be enough exits in this theater if there's a fire."'
The more rigorous reporting procedures instituted when sponsor difficulties began to emerge three years ago grew out of longstanding policies of the Attorney General's office. Its narrow goal -- some, including the Attorney General, have tried to get the Legislature to widen it -- in regulating conversions is to make sure sponsors provide "full disclosure."
Thus, acceptance of a plan by the Attorney General never meant that the plan offered buyers a good deal in an economic sense; it meant only that the sponsor had given buyers the information they needed to make an intelligent decision. Beyond that it was essentially "let the buyer beware."
Documents notwithstanding, many tenants organized to negotiate better prices and terms from converters, who were hoping for large sales to the tenants, called insiders. Other sponsors tended to be less concerned about insider sales. There were conversions with so few insider purchases that the converted building hardly seemed like a co-op at all. Only 15 percent of the apartments must be sold for a noneviction conversion. Some of the buyers were people who moved into vacancies as renters before conversion, planning to buy, rather than long-term insiders.
Mr. Greenburger said he typically obtained 40 percent of sales to long-term tenants before converting. Many current co-op officers remember him well as a negotiator.
"WE found him fair," said Ira Mothner, president of the 55-unit building at 309-317 West 93d Street. Mr. Greenburger still owns a handful of shares in the building; others that he owned are now held by an institution. Mr. Mothner suspects that these holdings increased the building's difficulties when it set out to refinance the underlying mortgage over a year ago.
In the end, the director of funding for Time Equities, Stuart Bruck, succeeded in finding the co-op a lender. The loan provided "excellent rates in a tough lending environment," said Ira Stein, treasurer of the co-op, in a thank-you letter.
Mr. Greenburger, who will be 43 next month, also runs a literary agency, Sanford J. Greenburger Associates, which his late father founded in 1932. With Time Equities it operates on a floor of 55 Fifth Avenue, at 12th Street, an office building that Mr. Greenburger bought in 1984.
His entrepreneurial tastes developed early. While still in high school he established a book export business, buying English-language books wholesale from an American publisher and selling them to a German book club to be retailed to English-speaking Germans at a 50 percent mark-up. "I made $15,000 to $20,000 a year as a 14-year-old," he says.
Later, he had an office on 59th Street, and sublet half the space at a rent that covered his own. His real-estate career was born.
The value of the 400 renter-occupied apartments he still holds has slipped with the market's decline. In 1988, Mr. Greenburger figured the average value of his apartments, when they are vacated by rent regulated tenants, at $100,000 a unit and their value if occupied at 25 percent of that. "Today people often say they are worth 12 to 15 percent of their vacancy value," he says.
His policy on apartments that are vacated is to rerent them at market rates if they can earn 8 to 10 percent of their vacancy value, but to sell if they would earn 7 percent or less. If an apartment with a sale value of $75,000 can produce income of only $4,800 a year, or 6.4 percent of the value, he would sell. But if the sale value of that apartment was $50,000, he would retain it beause the annual earnings would be 9.6 percent of the value.
He advises buyers to look at the size of a building's underlying mortgage in relation to the building's value before making a purchase. Assuming there is no commercial space in the building, if the loan-to-value ratio exceeds 25 percent it would suggest the maintenance is not competitive in the marketplace. Nowadays, the building's mortgage will typically be 15 to 25 percent of the total value of a building's shares, he said.
The co-op conversion boom in New York City was an aberration tied to rent regulation, Mr. Greenburger said. It represented a "political compromise" -- a way to deregulate housing but divide the financial benefit between the owners of buildings and their renters.
"The rental value of buildings had been driven into the ground," he said. "Conversions attracted new money to fix buildings up, and they created a tax base. Now there are not many buildings left to be converted. Even if the market strengthens, you won't see massive conversions again."
But he does expect to see higher prices. "My feeling is that we are at a bottom now," he said. "I don't expect prices to get worse, but over two to five years they will get better."

HEADLINE: In Search of the Perfect Christmas Tree

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER

 BODY:
THE best-looking blue spruce in the United States was grown last year in Connecticut, on Ski's Christmas Tree Farm in Lebanon. A blue ribbon on the wall of the office of the farm's operators, B. John and Mary Skawinski, attests that their tree was judged the top prize winner for spruces by the National Christmas Tree Growers Association at its annual convention in Anaheim, Calif.
"It was the first time that anyone from Connecticut ever won a blue ribbon for Christmas trees in a national competition," Mr. Skawinski said. 
 Mr. Skawinski, a retired civilian employee of the Navy at Groton, has been growing Christmas trees for 28 years. "I love growing trees," he said. "They don't talk back and they don't argue."
 
Big Business in Trees
 The Skawinskis grow nine varieties of Christmas trees on their seven-acre farm -- white pine, Fraser fir, Scotch pine and various spruces. The farm opened on Friday for the annual choose-and-cut tree season.
Between now and Christmas Eve, the Skawinskis' farm and 200 others in Connecticut will be open, usually from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily, though a few may be open only on weekends.
Growing and selling Christmas trees is a big business in the United States, with sales of 36.5 million trees for $1.2 billion forecast this season by the national association, which has its headquarters in Milwaukee.
The 500 Christmas tree growers in Connecticut are expected to sell 350,000 to 400,00 trees this year for $7 million, according to the executive director of the State Association of Christmas Tree Growers, John Olsen. Most of the trees are sold at wholesale prices by the growers to retailers who sell them to the public at corner lots or garden centers.
But more and more people in Connecticut and other states are turning to the choose-and-cut method of obtaining a tree. For many suburban and city residents, it is not only a chance to buy a tree cheaper than pre-cut ones but also an opportunity to make an expedition to the countryside.
"The kids just love it," Mr. Skawinski said. "It's a real happy occasion."
 
Prices Haven't Risen
 He gives lollipops to children, but other Christmas tree farmers also dispense hot chocolate and doughnuts and offer hayrides in an effort to make tree cutting a more pleasant experience. At Bishop's Orchards in Guilford, for example, patrons receive hot mulled cider.
Despite inflation, the price of a choose-and-cut tree has not changed appreciably in the last few years. The range, $20 to $40, is about the same as last year.
At the Skawinski farm, the price is $20 for a budget tree, $25 for an average tree, $30 for better trees marked with a yellow ribbon, and $35 for top-of-the-line trees.
In New Hartford, Laura M. Auburn sells blue spruce, Norway and white spruce and Douglas fir trees at about $20 a tree. At Bishop's Orchards, the price for Fraser fir, Douglas fir and spruce is about $30 a tree.
At the Jones Tree Farm in Shelton the price varies by the day of the week in an attempt to attract more customers on weekdays. The price is $35 a tree from Monday to Friday but $40 on Saturdays and Sundays.
Before setting out, call to find out precise directions, days and hours a farm is open, weather conditions and whether or not to bring your own saw. (Most farms will furnish a bow saw.) In addition, the farmers suggest that you dress warmly, wear gloves and boots, and bring rope to tie the tree to the top of your car or to tie the trunk lid down for the trip home.
 
Care Prolongs Trees
 To preserve the tree before it is set up inside the house, put it in a pail of water outside, but not under cover. Before bringing it in, cut off an inch from the bottom to permit it to take up water more easily, thus prolonging its life.
Once the tree is inside the house, place it in the coolest part of the room, away from heat-producing equipment, like radiators or television sets. Set the tree in a stand that holds at least a gallon of water and replenish the water as needed, and unplug lights before going to bed, to minimize fire hazard. And, when the holiday season is over, do not burn the tree. Instead, the association suggests, put it outside as a feeding station for birds or chop it up for mulch.

HEADLINE: Grass-Roots Goal: Rebuilding a City

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
IN some parts of Camden, abandoned, crumbling houses dominate neighborhood blocks, the remnant of the city's industrial decline when thousands of people moved away.
The vacant properties are eyesores for residents, targets for arsonists and havens for drug dealers. More than 3,500 such properties are scattered around the city. 
 As this city of 87,500 residents tries to revitalize its faltering economy, grass-roots groups are trying to rebuild their neighborhoods block by block. The task is enormous in a city where more than 10 percent of the housing units are vacant.
 
'It's a Challenge'
 "It's a challenge," said Sister Peg Hynes, managing director of the Heart of Camden, a nonprofit housing group in South Camden. "But we realize we can make a difference."
An outgrowth of the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, the volunteer group has rehabilitated more than 50 homes since 1984. The Heart of Camden is among a half-dozen groups that have begun rehabilitation projects in neighborhoods around the city.
"It's a very monumental task to revitalize the neighborhoods of Camden," said Thomas A. Roberts, executive director of the city's Redevelopment Agency. "They're very tough, but they can be brought back."
The neighborhoods began their downward spiral in the 1950's as white residents started moving to the suburbs. Between 1950 and 1980, the city lost nearly one-third of its population.
"We had a lot of vacant buildings left," Mr. Roberts said. "They were eventually abandoned, and the city came to own them."
 
Extensive Repairs Needed
 Using volunteers from churches, schools and civic groups, the Heart of Camden is slowly refurbishing a five-block area in South Camden. Most of the houses, vacant for a number of years, require extensive repairs.
"We really have to gut them and start all over again," Sister Peg said. "It takes a lot more muscle and a lot more time."
It takes months for crews to refurbish the houses, replacing walls, installing sprinkler systems and upgrading the properties to meet current building codes, she said. Residents say the effort is making a difference.
Freshly painted row houses now line Holcain Street, a narrow alley that was once filled with trash. A neighbor lovingly cares for a fenced-in garden park.
"Nobody would have thought these houses could be brought back," said Herb Clayton, who has lived on nearby Jackson Street for 14 years. "They were empty, almost ready to fall down."
 
Properties Acquired From City
 The Heart of Camden acquires the abandoned properties from the city and sells the rehabilitated homes to low-income families at minimal cost.
"We're not in this to make money," Sister Peg said, noting that the annual income for most families is under $10,000. "We're in this to help families find homes."
Eligible families receive interest-free mortgages with no down payment required, Sister Peg said. The average monthly mortgage payment is about $200 and includes taxes, she said.
At one time, there were nearly 200 abandoned houses in the neighborhood near the Delaware River, Sister Peg said.
 
City Is Criticized
 Despite the scattered success of grass-roots organizations, critics say the city should play a larger role in rebuilding neighborhoods and demolishing vacant, dilapidated houses.
"They say we are building Camden block by block, but I think we are losing this city block by block," said Maribel Roman, a member of Camden Churches Organized for People, which has asked the city to demolish or rehabilitate 58 abandoned properties by the end of the year. "We need help and we need it fast," she said.
Mayor Aaron A. Thompson, who coined a slogan, "Camden's on the Move -- Rebuilding Neighborhoods Block by Block," said the city could not afford to demolish all the abandoned properties. The city is giving priority to razing buildings left in ruins after a Halloween Mischief Night arson spree.
Though the city has concentrated on a $500 million waterfront revitalization project, including a state aquarium, Mayor Thompson says neighborhoods will not be overlooked.
"For us to grow on our waterfront and not in our neighborhoods would be a tragedy," said Mr. Thompson, a lifelong Camden resident. "I firmly believe that we must build in our neighborhoods."

HEADLINE: Speed-Up of Fiber-Optic Network Debated

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A $1 BILLION plan by New Jersey Bell to make New Jersey the first state to have fiber-optic communications available to virtually every household and business has provoked an intense debate between proponents of the plan and a powerful coalition of forces opposing it.
With fiber optics, New Jersey Bell officials say, they can create a vast network of high-speed audio, video and data services that will revolutionize the way residents and businesses in the state communicate. 
 In what the company calls a "fully fibered state," homebound students can attend school by using their television sets, doctors can read CAT scans taken in hospitals miles away, businesses can market products over an interactive two-way video network and residents can dial up virtually any cable television program offered anywhere in the state.
But critics, including the cable television industry and the New Jersey Press Association, say that New Jersey Bell's elaborate plan is excessive, expensive and unnecessary and that it will result in higher rates for consumers. They say most residents will neither need nor want many services that may become available but will nevertheless end up paying the plan's $1 billion price tag. They also criticize company plans to run fiber "to the curb" and then charge consumers extra to connect it to their houses.
The debate is gathering steam as the lame-duck Democratic-controlled Legislature contemplates a controversial telephone rate freeze and deregulation legislation that New Jersey Bell says is necessary before it can proceed with its plans.
"The network that we see and we feel is so close at hand is going to impact on the lives of every consumer," said Dennis M. Bone, director of regulatory planning for New Jersey Bell in Newark.
The company's plan, Mr. Bone said, involves rewiring the entire state by replacing 56.3 million miles of copper wire with fiber-optic cable -- a finger-thick flexible cable made of hair-thin strands of glass. The plan would push forward by 20 years, to the year 2010, a previous date for completing the conversion.
"With fiber going into every single home and business in the state, there will be all sorts of capabilities for everybody to use that simply do not exist today," Mr. Bone said.
A fiber-optic network, he said, will require less cable and will be far superior to the copper cable network that now connects the company's 3.2 million customers. Fiber, he said, can handle thousands of two-way voice, data and video transmissions, compared with hundreds of one-way transmissions that can be made over copper wire. Fiber is easier to install and maintain, provides clearer transmissions, is immune to electromagnetic interference and does not corrode.
Mr. Bone said a "fully fibered network" would provide consumers with unprecedented access to information and entertainment services and would encourage economic development as well.
"If we develop this capability first, there's going to be a rush of information service providers coming here to set up shop," Mr. Bone said. "We're going to be the best test-bed in the world for this stuff."
Among the advantages that a fiber network would offer, he said, is the ability for students to communicate with schools both visually and aurally. A student in a school in Trenton, for example, could participate in a class offered in a school in Woodbridge. And a homebound student could keep up with his class -- even participate in class discussions -- while sitting in his living room.
Mr. Bone said that with fiber optics, residents could have electronic access to libraries and "read" books, complete with photographs and graphics, on video monitors in their homes.
Medical specialists, he said, could read diagnostic tests like CAT scans and MRI's without leaving their offices, and would be able to examine the results of the tests with consulting experts merely by dialing a telephone number.
And consumers, Mr. Bone said, would benefit abundantly from the new technology. For example, grandparents in Toms River would be able to see their grandchildren as well as talk to them through a telephone call. Home shopping would take on a new dimension with buyers and sellers communicating "face to face" though miles away from each other.
And cable television programming, which is now provided by individual cable operators serving specific geographic areas, would be available on an almost unlimited basis, with a viewer in Port Jervis, N.Y., having access to programming from a cable provider in Cape May.
"Some of our adversaries say that we shouldn't be putting fiber out there because consumers don't need it," Mr. Bone said. "But we're going to put fiber out there anyway -- every telephone company in the country is going to put fiber out there anyway. The question is whether we should accelerate it."
Under existing plans, the state's telephone network would be completely converted to fiber by the year 2030. Under the new proposal, New Jersey Bell would accelerate the replacement program -- at an additional cost of $1 billion through 1999 -- and complete the conversion by 2010. The total cost of the accelerated program has not yet been determined by the company.
The linchpin of the New Jersey Bell plan is the passage of pending legislation that would freeze telephone rates at existing levels through 1995. Then, from 1996 through 1999, rate increases would be limited to a percentage of the Consumer Price Index, with a maximum increase of 25 cents a month each year on basic exchange services.
In addition, the legislation would enable the State Board of Regulatory Commissioners to deregulate New Jersey Bell services that the board determines are competitive services, like the Yellow Pages. The legislation would also allow the board to regulate equal access to the Bell system.
"Everybody can say that this new technology investment is going to cause rates to go up, and our answer to that is, No, it won't," Mr. Bone said.
 
New Business Expected
 The investment will be paid for, he said, by retained earnings, growth in existing competitive and regulated services and new business that will be generated as customers take advantage of the new services that will be offered.
"We're betting the ranch on that," Mr. Bone said.
Critics of the company's plan, however, contend that not only is the accelerated conversion to fiber unnecessary, but also it is likely to be paid for by consumers.
"What we are fearful of is a one-wire world," said Nancy Becker, executive director of the New Jersey Cable Television Association, a Trenton-based trade association. "If the telephone company is basically unleashed, that will create the most incredible monopoly the United States has ever seen."
The association, along with other organizations including the New Jersey Press Association in Trenton, the American Association of Retired Persons and the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, is lobbying legislators to block passage of the telecommunications bill.
 
'Rips Away' Regulation
 "The legislation really rips away 80 years of regulation of local telephone rates," Ms. Becker said. "It gives Bell carte blanche to do virtually anything it wants in terms of deregulated services, which are not defined, and it forces the ratepayer to pay for this speculative infrastructure, which could cost New Jersey telephone subscribers $2 billion to $4 billion."
Ms. Becker said the telephone company's proposal to put high-capacity fiber optics into every house and business was "gold plating" the telecommunications system. "Do people really need a six-lane highway going into their driveways?" she said.
Other concerns about the telecommunications legislation revolve around two issues: Should telephone rates in fact be lower than they are now rather than being frozen, and how will the distinction be made between services that are regulated and those that are not?
Robin Portnoi, an assistant deputy public advocate in the State Division of Rate Counsel, said regulatory officials had to first be able to determine whether New Jersey Bell's costs were decreasing -- as many critics charge -- before they could judge whether a rate freeze was appropriate.
"Rate stability in a declining cost industry is not really beneficial to ratepayers," Ms. Portnoi said.
And deregulating competitive services, Ms. Portnoi said, is not easy. The legislation contains no provision defining the level of competition that must be present before rates can be deregulated, she said, nor does it provide for re-regulating services that cease to be competitive.
 
No House Connections Included
 Another issue that irritates some is that the New Jersey Bell plan does not include actually connecting fiber- optic cables to each house. The company intends to leave the fiber "at the curb" for connection to a house only upon the request of the homeowner.
Rob Stuart, program director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group in Trenton, said that this proposal only supported the contention that the majority of people would probably not benefit from the new service.
"Our concern is that consumers will not be seeing any increased services for the initial $1 billion investment and then will have to pay an additional charge to take advantage of the service," Mr. Stuart said.
New Jersey Bell officials acknowledged "a lot of misunderstanding about that issue" and said any charge to connect fiber to a house would be a "modest, nonrecurring charge."
At least part of the reason that New Jersey Bell is having difficulty conveying its message to the public, company officials say, is the fact that among its most ardent critics are newspapers and cable television operators.
"I think it's scandalous," Mr. Bone said, referring to some news media reporting on the plan. "Self-interest is in a very real way distorting some of the coverage of this."
 
Annoyed by Cable TV Ads
 Mr. Bone said he was particularly annoyed by advertisements the telephone company has been running on some cable television stations were immediately being followed by cable station-supported advertising criticizing the plan.
Tom Lancaster, a visiting media specialist at Stockton State College in Pomona, agreed that it was perhaps inappropriate for cable television providers and newspapers to use their access to customers to publicize a position on issues in which they have a stake. "Should the telephone industry start using its medium and call all of its customers to express its point of view?" Mr. Lancaster asked.
But John J. O'Brien, executive director of the New Jersey Press Association, a newspaper trade organization critical of the New Jersey Bell proposal, said he believed that the company had been treated fairly by the press. "I don't agree with the fact that because newspapers are editorializing against it, they are not getting a fair shot in the news columns of the papers," he said.
Frank P. DeJoy, vice president and general manager of Suburban Cablevision in East Orange, said his company was running advertisements immediately after New Jersey Bell ads and felt justified in doing so. "We are not in any way censoring or altering the ads that they send us," Mr. DeJoy said. "And I don't think it's inappropriate to run our ad next to theirs. All we're saying is, Don't rush this through until the public has a chance to understand it."
 
Regulated Monopoly FavoredSeen
 But some experts say consumers might be better served by having a regulated monopoly provide cable programming rather than the individual, geographically protected cable companies.
"The competition should not be among the wires that people screw into the back of their TV sets; the competition should be among the programs that are available on those wires," said Lee Goeller, a Haddonfield telecommunications consultant and author. "The best way to do that is to have a public utility that acts as the delivery vehicle."
Mr. Goeller said the telephone company would be singularly suited to provide video programming, particularly "pay per view" services, through which customers order specific programs for a charge.
"There's one thing the telephone company knows how to do well," Mr. Goeller said. "And that's how to bill things a nickel and dime at a time and still make a profit."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
New Questions About Monetary Union

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The 12 members of the European Community will meet this week in Maastricht, the Netherlands, for their crucial session on monetary, economic and political union. The task of the delegates will not be made easier by the fact that stock markets in Europe have been falling and the European Monetary System has been under stress because of the weakening American dollar, the rallying German mark and Germany's persistently high interest rates.
The pain in the stock markets, many of which have fallen by 4 to 9 percent recently, and the high interest rates throughout the monetary system are samples of the rough side of monetary and economic union. 
 In the 1980's, as Europe's economies grew, the tough anti-inflation discipline of tying a country's currency to the lead of Germany and its strict Bundesbank caused little pain. But now, as most of Europe is slowing economically and political and economic leaders are thirsting for lower interest rates to spur growth, the Bundesbank is saying no. It is focusing on its own domestic problems of rising inflation and the cost of the unification of the two parts of Germany.
The interest rate gridlock that begins in Frankfurt, the home of the Bundesbank, is raising questions anew about the workability of the European Monetary System.
The E.M.S. has brought some stability to European currencies, even the notoriously volatile British pound, which finally joined the monetary system just over a year ago. The system requires members to keep their currencies within fixed bands, and this has come to mean they generally have to follow the Bundesbank on interest rate policy because the mark is the dominant currency.
But today, some argue, a high price is being paid for this stability. This cost is the economic growth being lost as Germany seeks to use high interest rates to deal with its domestic problems.
In light of the stability provided by the European Monetary System, "I think it certainly does look as if it has worked," said Marcus Grubb, European equity strategist at UBS Phillips & Drew in London.
"But," he added, "the question coming to the front of people's minds is, While it is working in terms of stability, is it working in terms of economic growth? If it works, it could work at the cost of a real growth overkill penalty."
David Gilmore, senior foreign exchange economist at MCM Currency Watch in New York, added, "When economies are sinking and Germany has an inflation problem that keeps interest rates high, that is something they did not build into the equation of the E.M.S."
Despite these complaints, the members of the monetary system are adhering to the E.M.S. discipline because the pain is being passed around. France is proof. It raised interest rates last month, despite its sagging economy, to defend the franc and keep it within its range. Even in Britain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont, has said repeatedly that he stands ready to do what is necessary to keep the pound, which has been weak recently, in line.
It is because the E.M.S. is working that there is a pall over many stock markets right now. And there is no immediate relief in sight. No one expects the Germans to lower interest rates soon, and there is still a chance of another increase.
The Bundesbank did not increase interest rates at its meeting on Thursday, but it was unlikely that the central bank would make such a move just before the Maastricht meeting, which begins tomorrow. That would have thumbed a German nose at European cooperation just as final agreements are needed to push Europe toward a single currency and full economic integration.
Such a move would have been especially ill-timed because it might have put the British pound under even more pressure, which might have forced the Conservative Government of Prime Minister John Major to raise interest rates just months before he has to call an election, for which the Tories are not in great shape.
Raising German interest rates would hardly be helpful for Mr. Major, the most reluctant leader at Maastricht. The Prime Minister is dogged by doubts about economic and political union and is the target of members of his own party, including the former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who already says he has gone too far.
But while not raising interest rates now, the Bundesbank did send a signal that the option was still open when it set its 1992 money growth targets a notch below what was expected.
All in all, this has made Mr. Grubb of UBS pessimistic for now and the beginning of next year. "It is not looking good," he said of European stock markets. "There are a lot of risks in equities, and in the the short run there is not any light on the horizon." In fact, he does not expect a significant change until the second quarter of next year.
UBS is taking money out of bonds in countries where interest rates have already fallen, like the United States, and leaving it in cash. And they are advising investors to buy put options on stock markets in Europe; these puts will make money for investors if stock markets fall further.

HEADLINE: Abe Peled's Secret Start-Up at I.B.M.

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
HAWTHORNE, N.Y.
On a hillside here in the heart of I.B.M.'s home territory, Abraham Peled, an I.B.M. computer scientist, is trying to recreate Silicon Valley. To the extent that he succeeds -- or fails -- he will be a bellwether for I.B.M. in carrying out ambitious plans to redefine itself, arrest its declining earnings and bolster its falling market share.
Mr. Peled has taken a small group of engineers and programmers and spawned a start-up company inside the International Business Machines Corporation to create a new computer. Tucked away in a rented building within walking distance of I.B.M.'s computer science research laboratory, the group has worked in secrecy and outside the company's normal channels to translate basic research into a commercial product at a breakneck pace. 
 It is the classic approach of entrepreneurs in California's Silicon Valley, where engineers whose imaginations have been seized by an idea rush to get out a high-tech product that can grow into a billion-dollar company.
The result of Mr. Peled's project is the Power Visualization System, a graphics supercomputer, introduced last summer after a mere two years. Such a short product development cycle is an impressive accomplishment for I.B.M., which is famous for its deliberate ways.
"It used to be said that I.B.M. could come in to a market second and clean up," Mr. Peled said. "That's no longer the case."
The graphics supercomputer is intended to let scientists, engineers and product designers "see" the billions of pieces of data their experiments generate. The system can instantly transform the dry tables of numbers generated by research into striking color images on a computer screen. Automobile designers can view lifelike three-dimensional animations of their newest designs. Scientists can follow visual simulations of complex models, like the ozone hole in the atmosphere over the South Pole.
Mr. Peled is gambling that computer visualization will boom in the 1990's and that when it does, I.B.M. will be ready to grab a large part of the business with the machines, which carry price tags of $600,000 to $2 million each.
For I.B.M., Mr. Peled's experiment is taking on vital significance. It is one of a series of projects now underway to explore whether a revitalized I.B.M. can exploit its legendary research prowess -- a prowess that has won two Nobel prizes in the last decade alone -- to quickly identify new businesses and pioneer markets.
Underscoring the project's importance, last week the new supercomputer was on display at a meeting of I.B.M. international managers at which the company's chairman, John F. Akers, explained a far-reaching decentralization plan meant to make the company competitive again.
When I.B.M. announced the new focus last month, it said the company would redefine itself around flexible units that will move products to market more quickly. It took a significant step in that direction last week, saying that a printer company and its large disk drive business would be separated from the mainframe computer division, freeing them to compete on their own.
The company said last month that it will also slash at least another 20,000 employees next year and take a $3 billion charge in the fourth quarter of 1991.
It's all strong medicine for a company that computer and high-tech experts say still has technology that compares favorably with the best in the world. But these experts agree that I.B.M. has frequently fallen behind the pace of the industry. Small, young companies, like Sun Microsystems, a leading work station manufacturer, have proven far nimbler in recognizing new markets, developing products for them and then capturing large segments of market share.
 
The Lag to Market
 Being late in the work station market is a particular embarrassment because I.B.M. made the basic discoveries needed. RISC, or reduced instruction set computing, for example, was a design that I.B.M. invented in 1975 at nearby Yorktown Heights in a legendary research project headed by the computer scientist John Cocke. But the company didn't introduce a commercially successful RISC computer -- the RS/6000 line -- until last year.
"It has been a definite problem for I.B.M. that R.&D. is so distant from the customer," said John Moussouris, a former I.B.M. scientist who helped pioneer RISC technology and now heads Micro unity Inc., a Silicon Valley start-up that is building an advanced RISC chip. "It was classically true in research that you could start any project you wanted to, but getting something finished was almost an impossibility," he said of his I.B.M. years.
The pace may have been slow, but I.B.M. ruled the computer industry for decades. Beginning in the 1980's, that dominance began to erode as thousands of competitors selling desktop computers and other products expanded markets beyond the traditional corporate data processing centers where I.B.M. had held sway with its giant mainframe computers.
"If you look at the growth in the computer industry between 1980 and 1990 and say, 'Which portion comes from existing base and which portion comes from products that didn't exist in 1980?' more than 50 percent didn't exist," Mr. Peled said.
That fact is now seen as the central lesson that I.B.M. learned from the 80's: It must enter new markets as quickly as possible and with the right product. "We must do our research in the marketplace," Mr. Peled said.
But there is a potential dark side to I.B.M.'s new focus. Could it place too much emphasis on getting quick results from research and in the process emasculate what has been one of the world's finest corporate research organizations?
"I worry that the part of research that will be most affected will be the systems thinkers," said Lewis Branscomb, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a former I.B.M. research director who now serves on I.B.M.'s scientific advisory committee.
Last year, I.B.M. spent $6.5 billion on research and development. About 90 percent of this money went to 30 development laboratories to support the increasingly large commitment required to sustain each new generation of computers and their components, such things as software and peripheral products. But at five laboratories -- in San Jose, Yorktown Heights, Zurich, Tokyo and Haifa, Israel -- the remaining 10 percent of the budget, or about $700 million, is spent on more basic research that can win Nobel prizes and make discoveries that lead to dramatic new high-tech products.
Some researchers, both inside and outside I.B.M., are now asking whether decentralization could weaken the labs as groups like Mr. Peled's team are spun off to do their own thing, perhaps in secrecy.
Inevitably, these skeptics contend, some of the the newly independent units will begin to compete for both funds and talent. The fear is that such competition, making it difficult to justify scientific work that might have no direct payoff for many years, could put spending on basic research at risk.
An often-cited example of what might be lost in such a shift is the discovery of high-temperature superconducting materials made at the Zurich laboratory in 1986. The discovery has created a flurry of research at corporate and academic laboratories around the world and won K. Alex Muller and J. Georg Bednorz the Nobel prize in physics in 1987. But despite its great potential, new products that could generate strong revenues for I.B.M. have yet to appear and are probably years away.
I.B.M.'s top executives vow that the new focus will not be permitted to undermine such basic research. "We want I.B.M. research to be famous for its science and vital to I.B.M.," said Jack D. Kuehler, the company's president and its most senior executive with a technical background.
Still, there is little question I.B.M. must capitalize more quickly on its research, and to do this it has set up a number of projects like Mr. Peled's graphics supercomputer group.
 
Future Ambitions
 For example, last year I.B.M. took several of its researchers in high-speed computer networks and made them the nucleus of a new business group called High Performance Computers and Communications. During the 90's, high-speed network computing is expected to match or even exceed the growth of the personal computer, combining a number of existing disciplines: Computers, telecommunications, information providers and entertainment.
The group's mission is to exploit this potential as quickly as possible. It has recently set up joint ventures with a variety of players, including Rogers Cable of Canada, that country's largest cable television provider; BellSouth, and McGraw Hill.
A third example of using basic research to pursue new markets is the color flat-panel display technology, for which I.B.M. researchers pioneered several materials in research during the early 80's. Few basic technologies have the potential that these brilliant displays do as a replacement for the traditional cathode ray tube screen in a host of portable video and desktop computing devices.
I.B.M.'s strategy here is to build an alliance with Japan's Toshiba Corporation to manufacture the displays, first in Japan and possibly later in the United States. So far, the Japanese have dominated the flat-panel market and I.B.M. hopes the Toshiba connection will give it entree to a market that has eluded venture-capital-backed start-up companies.
I.B.M.'s new graphics supercomputer had its roots in an evening in early 1989 when Abe Peled, vice president of systems and director of computer sciences, had dinner with Ralph Gomory, a mathematician who was then I.B.M.'s vice president of research and who now heads the Sloane Foundation in New York City.
Mr. Peled, a Rumanian who grew up in Israel, earned graduate degrees at Princeton and joined I.B.M. in 1974, expressed his frustration about I.B.M.'s inability to quickly enter new computer markets. He was worried that new projects conceived by his researchers would fail because they stepped on toes in the company's deeply entrenched product divisions. The two hatched the idea of creating a small start-up that would function like a private company and Mr. Gomory took it to I.B.M.'s top executives, who were enthusiastic.
Mr. Peled's lab had two groups of researchers -- one interested in building a supercomputer with multiple processor chips and another that wanted to build a high-performance graphics computer. He convinced the two to combine their efforts and then, with the aid of an outside consultant, studied start-ups. Eventually, I.B.M. committed $25 million.
 
Forget the Riches
 Early on, the toughest issue to resolve was whether engineers and programmers would dedicate themselves to a demanding work schedule over several years -- without the stock incentives that are part of Silicon Valley-style start-ups.
"People were skeptical," Mr. Peled recalled. He said he told his team, "Look, you won't get rich, but you'll feel good for having built something that is out there in the market." I.B.M. researchers bought the concept, in part Mr. Peled said, because most of them work principally for the intellectual challenge, having decided that their first priority is not to get rich.
I.B.M. has sold five of the machines so far, and there have been some pleasing surprises characteristic of start-up companies.
One has been learning about who the likely customers are. As expected, a car company (Honda) and scientific research laboratory (Cornell University) were early buyers. But to the researchers' surprise, a large bank bought a system, too. (I.B.M. declined to identify the bank.) Mr. Peled's group has realized that bankers, stockbrokers and economists also want to quickly visualize complex financial and economic models.
That suggests that the I.B.M. team may have hit upon a broader market than it originally thought, a suggestion the group is hurrying to exploit.
A big question still remains: Can start-ups and other approaches like them take root in a corporation that has a reputation for bureaucracy and being slow off the mark?
Yes, answer senior executives. "Over the last 10 years the world has changed drastically," said James McGroddy, I.B.M.'s director of research. "You have to work higher up on the food chain. More importantly, you need to have your eye on the market."
 
 
 
GETTING IT OUT THE DOOR
 If they were going to rush a new computer to market, I.B.M.'s research scientists knew they also would have to find a new approach to marketing it.
So they asked Amanda Morrow, a veteran I.B.M. marketing executive, to put together a special team to circumvent some of the moribund traditional company sales and marketing channels.
She now runs a five-person marketing group that has far more control over the sales process than is customary at I.B.M. It oversees the entire process -- from submitting a bid to a prospective customer to installing the machine at the customer's site once the sale is made.
Moreover, the team has an unusual sales tool: Abe Peled himself. Like a Silicon Valley start-up C.E.O., Mr. Peled has been making sales calls of late.
Ms. Morrow said that she has found running a marketing organization under one roof to be much more efficient than normal I.B.M. corporate procedure. She is able to approach customers and then take their requests directly to the programmers and developers who designed the system.
"I can get off the phone and walk down the hall and get an immediate answer," she said. "That's something that is frequently not possible elsewhere in the company. The reason I took this job is that I wanted the ability to make a direct connection from research to the customer."
 
THE PRACTICAL BLIND SIDE OF BASIC RESEARCH
 When I.B.M. scientists extoll the unexpected benefits of basic research, they often point to a remarkable device called the scanning tunneling microscope, invented at I.B.M.'s Zurich laboratories in 1982. No one could predict back then that the microscope would now have an important role in flat-panel display research at the company.
The microscope has transformed the work of chemists, physicists and materials scientists. Before the microscope, chemists, for example, would use statistical techniques in an attempt to predict how atoms interact in the formation and behavior of materials. But the scanning tunneling microscope permits the scientists to examine the surface of a material atom by atom and actually see what is occurring.
One day recently, the desk of John H. Boland, an I.B.M. chemist, was covered with photos of what looked like rows of eggs. The eggs actually were the atoms of a semiconductor material Mr. Boland is studying. The photos were made by the microscope.
Mr. Boland's research could lead to making flat-panel computer screens that are brighter and more efficient users of battery power.
"Our basic philosophy is to understand the science at the deepest level we can on an atom-by-atom basis and then push toward product applications," he said. The microscope has shown that much of what scientists thought about the flat-panel materials before they could see them at the atomic level was wrong.

HEADLINE: Argentina Shops Shares in Its Telephone System

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES

 BODY:
The Argentine Government, hoping to sustain its economic turnaround and hasten its privatization program, went on the road this week to persuade international investors to buy shares in the country's telephone system.
Officials want to capitalize on the global popularity of telephone stocks, especially of Latin American companies. But investors are complaining that Argentina is rushing its deal to market with too high a price and inadequate documentation, leaving them too little time to analyze the company and bid aggressively. 
 The Government sold 60 percent of Telefonica de Argentina, representing half of the nation's service, to an investment group last November, but this is the public's first chance to buy shares. Beginning in Madrid and Minneapolis last Monday and continuing throughout Europe and the United States last week, the lead underwriters, Government officials and officers of the company are presenting their roadshow to pension fund managers, mutual fund companies and other institutions.
Thirty percent of the company will be sold, with shares selling for a minimum price of 16.5 cents to raise at least $600 million. Officials hope that an auction similar to the process of selling United States Treasury securities will push the price above 20 cents a share, or more than $800 million.
In the United States, the shares will be directly available only to large institutional investors; smaller buyers will have to buy them through foreign brokers.
Bankers say this departure from the fixed prices of most initial public offerings could discourage some investors. Moreover, they say, only last Monday did the Government release a prospectus and other documentation on the company's balance sheet. "How can I advise my clients if only today I received the documents," said Gordon Davis, a broker on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.
Government officials say the offering must take place as soon as possible. "The probability is that they will not maximize value," said one banker close to the negotiations. "But politically it is extremely important that you do this deal before the end of the year. They need the money, and they need to show a credible deal."
The cash is vital for President Carlos Saul Menem's Government to maintain the kind of budget surplus that international lending organizations like the International Monetary Fund are demanding for the country to prove its fiscal stability and responsibility. Argentina is seeking both a three-year, $3.4 billion loan from the I.M.F. and aid under a United States plan to dramatically cut its $60 billion foreign debt.
The country's Economy Minister, Domingo F. Cavallo, has been widely praised for measures that have dramatically reduced inflation, restrained the printing of money, kept the currency stable for more than six months, collected more taxes and deregulated the economy.
But I.M.F. officials have repeatedly voiced concerns that Argentina is not running a large enough budget surplus and thus depends heavily on the cash from privatizations to meet its obligations. They note that such sales are one-time events that may cover deficits now but not in the future.
Mr. Cavallo argues that much of the proceeds from sales are being used for one-time payments of pension fund obligations of the privatized companies.
Few believe that the first sale of telephone stock will be an outright failure, particularly given an underwriting syndicate led by Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan.
In Argentina, four of the largest banks -- Banco Roberts, Banco Galicia, Banco Rio de La Plata and Banco Tornquist -- are leading domestic sales. Small investors, buying $5,000 or less, will get a 5 percent discount.
Latin American telephone companies have been hot stocks this year. Telefonos Mexicanos, also called Telmex, issued stock to the public in May at the equivalent of $1.36 a share. The shares have risen 85 percent and have recently been trading at around $2.15. On the New York Stock Exchange, Telmex American Depository Shares, each representing 20 shares of the underlying stock, were originally sold for $27.25 and are now trading at around $43.
"The telephone is an essential tool for almost everybody," said Douglas A. Campbell, president of D. A. Campbell Company, a money management firm in Santa Monica, Calif. " Thus, it is a very stable business, almost like food."
Mr. Campbell added that Latin American phone companies tend to be especially productive cash cows, since most have barely begun to saturate their market. California has 85 telephones for every 100 people, he said, while Latin America generally has fewer than 10.
"You have almost unlimited demand, and all you have to do is keep pumping in telephones," he said. "It has got to be one of the most profitable businesses in the world."
For Argentina, the initial public offering of Telefonica comes a year after the nation sold a controlling interest in its telephone system to private investors. In November 1990, Argentina split its telephone company, Entel, in two, giving each company about half of the nation's population. It sold a 60 percent interest in Telefonica to a group of investors led by Citicorp, Spain's national telephone company and an Argentine industrial group called Techint.
A 60 percent interest in the other company, called Telecom, was sold to a group led by J. P. Morgan, Italy's telephone company, France's telephone company and Perez Companc, an Argentine industrial group.
The combined sales earned the Government $214 million in cash and the right to retire almost $5 billion in debt. It plans to sell 30 percent of both entities to the public, and eventually 10 percent to employees. The Telecom shares are expected to be sold in March.
In its first year, Telefonica earned $113 million, after a one-time charge of $60 million. Telecom, which has a much faster depreciation schedule and thus will tend to report lower profits, earned $53 million.
Mr. Campbell noted that Telefonica, at 16.5 cents a share, has a price-to-earnings ratio of almost 12, equivalent to other major international telephone stocks. "That's no bargain," he said. "It is a very full price."
Mr. Davis, the Buenos Aires broker agreed. "For a good deal, you want to price it a little low so that people want to come back for the second offering next year," he said.

Since taking over as chief executive of the troubled El Paso Electric Company two years ago, David H. Wiggs Jr. has become steeped in the ways of crisis control. Last week provided another lesson when the utility, buried under $900 million in debt, flirted with bankruptcy by edging close to a default on a key credit agreement.
Mr. Wiggs managed to buy the company more time when he got creditors, including some 30 banks, to extend a Dec. 1 restructuring deadline to Dec. 16. Analysts think there is a better-than-even chance that the restructuring will win approval before then. 
 Previously the company's outside counsel, Mr. Wiggs, 44, had no management experience when he was tapped to head El Paso Electric. His mandate: straighten out a financial mess resulting from a costly investment in an Arizona nuclear power project and a number of real estate ventures that went sour.
"It's been quite a baptism," Mr. Wiggs said last week.
Nonetheless, analysts give Mr. Wiggs high marks for presenting a workable recovery plan to creditors and regulators alike. He has brought in a new board of directors, trimmed expenses and overseen the liquidation of money-losing diversified enterprises.
Although rate increases have been far less than the company has sought, regulators last month committed to a phased-in, four-year recovery for El Paso Electric's investment in Unit 3 of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station 50 miles west of Phoenix. The utility owns a 15.8 percent stake in Palo Verde's three nuclear plants, which were built in anticipation of far more regional growth than actually materialized.
Mr. Wiggs says a Chapter 11 bankruptcy would not help anyone, mostly because of the uncertainty over whether a Federal judge would have the power to order a rate increase to bail the company out.
The bankruptcy route "just doesn't make sense," Mr. Wiggs said. "We think it's better to have a decent, viable recovery plan."
Indeed, analysts say the formidable cost of bankruptcy, which can tie up creditors' money for years, is what has so far spared the Tucson Electric Power Company, another troubled Southwestern utility, from going under.
What's more, even if a judge could order a revenue increase, a jump in rates could backfire in today's uncertain economy, inhibiting growth in demand in the company's service area, said Edward Tirello, a utility analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
In time, the current increase in demand of 2.5 percent a year combined with more anticipated power sales to Mexico will put El Paso Electric back on track, Mr. Tirello said, adding that he would like to see Mr. Wiggs stay on after that.
As for Mr. Wiggs, he's taking it one day at a time. "I feel like 44 going on 84," he said.

The Unraveling of Robert Maxwell's Posthumous Empire 

A month after his body was found at sea, Robert Maxwell's media empire is in ruins. Last week, Mr. Maxwell's sons, Ian and Kevin, filed for bankruptcy protection in the British courts for the family's private businesses. The New York Daily News, one of the family's companies, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law, and Kevin Maxwell vowed to keep the newspaper alive. Britain's Serious Fraud Office began investigating charges last week that Robert Maxwell illegally drained up to $765 million in Mirror Group P.L.C. pension funds to prop up his ailing businesses. It was also discovered that his private companies borrowed $538 million -- perhaps more -- from the public ones. The tattered empire with its hundreds of subsidiaries is now expected to be sold off. But according to John Talbot, an administrator appointed by the British courts, the assets may be significantly less than the liabilities.
 
 
The Intractable Trade Problem
 
Economists often suffer from a disease called hardening of the categories. No matter what reality says, their paradigms stay the same. Trade is one of those categories. Despite seven years of a cut-rate dollar that was supposed to make American products more attractive, America's trade deficit with Japan has barely budged, though there has been remarkable progress elsewhere. And years of trade talks have not put many American goods on Japanese retail shelves. But while economists urge patience, business people are not optimistic. "The Japanese have built a structure that is completely different from ours," said Arnold Brenner, an executive vice president in charge of the Japanese operations of Motorola Inc. "For an American company, it is always going to be especially tough to break in."
 
 
G.E.'s Alliance With South Korea
 
The General Electric Company has been doing its part lately to bring down the trade balance by exporting jet engines, locomotives and power generators. Last week, it made a deal to sell a $400 million communications satellite to South Korea. The Lucky-Goldstar Business Group has agreed to be a partner in the project. G.E. beat British Aerospace P.L.C. for the contract. But it was not just G.E.'s experience that clinched the deal. It also agreed to transfer technology to its South Korean partners -- a promise that some fear might harm G.E. later.


The Biggest L.B.O.
 
 The collapsing Soviet Union got its own version of a leveraged buyout. Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of Russia, said last week he had reached an agreement with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for Russia -- the largest and richest republic -- to assume the central Government's debt and payroll. The power of the purse -- not to mention the fact that most of the republics have broken with Moscow -- elevates Mr. Yeltsin and downgrades Mr. Gorbachev. By taking over the budget, Mr. Yeltsin also gets control of the ruble. That gives him a lever to use to stabilize prices. The downside risk, as with all L.B.O.'s, is whether Mr. Yeltsin can afford to take on so much debt.


Even Japan May Suffer
 
They are not exactly jumping out of windows, but Tokyo's investors are not a happy lot. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell more than 1 percent on a single day last week and since March has lost 17.3 percent of its value. Companies are also having trouble raising capital -- unusual in Japan. And some investors fear the English-speaking recession (it's hit America, Britain, Canada and Australia) will soon reach Japan. "They are going into a contractionary period," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. Japan's rate of growth "will decelerate from 3 to 6 percent to 0 to 3 percent and cause fiscal problems for the Government," he said. That's slow, but not a recession. "What's happening in Japan is what happened here, but from a higher base," Mr. Weinberg said.
 

Salomon Wins Back Confidence
 
Last week, after a three-month suspension, Salomon Brothers Inc. said it had won back the World Bank's business. The Bank, as it is called, is the second-largest borrower in the world's financial markets. Its decision was an indication that Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor who is Salomon's interim chairman, was succeeding in making the go-go Wall-Street firm more, well, Midwestern. The California Public Employee Retirement System -- the nation's largest -- is considering rescinding its suspension too. If that happens, Solly's rehabilitation may soon be complete.


Sweden's Monetary Medicine
 
Most of the world considers it a bold move when the Federal Reserve raises or lowers the discount rate a quarter of a percentage point. Not in Sweden. Last week, Sweden's central bank increased the rate it charges banks to borrow to 17.5 percent from 11.5 percent -- a six percentage-point jump.
 
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Wanna Buy a Route? In Cash?
 
Last week, after its financing deal with Delta Air Lines unraveled, Pan American World Airlines shut down. The airline had been on the verge of extinction for almost a decade, selling off pieces of itself including its New York terminal and signature headquarters building until all that remained was a small domestic operation and some valuable Latin American and Caribbean routes. The routes will go on sale today. But there is one inhibiting factor. Judge Cornelius Blackshear of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District in Manhattan insists that all bids for Pan Am's routes be in cash. That's the one commodity in today's airline business that remains in short supply.


Digital Quietly Tends to Business
 
While the International Business Machines Corporation anguishes in public about its future, the Digital Equipment Corporation, the nation's No. 2 computer maker, continues to plod along. Last week, it unveiled four aggressively priced workstations built on a new, superfast RISC chip -- for reduced instruction set technology. And while I.B.M. and the Microsoft Corporation continue to feud, Digital and Microsoft are doing just fine, thank you. Digital's new boxes will run Microsoft's Windows NT, its newest operating system.


The Days of 3.25% Interest
 
For those who love 1950's nostalgia, consider this: Citibank, the nation's No. 1, bank, said last week it will lower the interest rate paid on passbook savings accounts to 3.15 percent from 4.34 percent at its Citibank FSB savings and loan in Chicago. That rate has not been around since Cadillacs had fins and blouses had Peter Pan collars.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
Making Room for New Ideas
 
Though John Sununu liked to call himself the Administration's "pit bull," many thought of the White House chief of staff, who resigned last week, as more of the monkey on the President's back. A conservative Republican, he helped fashion President Bush's economic strategy. But even conservatives grew to dislike his ideas. "When faced with economic policy failures, he was incapable of admitting mistakes," said Edwin S. Rubenstein, an economist at the conservative National Review magazine. "Holding to the budget agreement the way he did was a mistake -- hubris." Of the new chief of staff, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, Mr. Rubenstein said: "He's tough, not so ideological, but a 'yes' man."


A Sickly G.D.P.
 
The economy is still struggling to rouse itself from its slump. The Commerce Department said last week that gross domestic product expanded by a slim 1.7 percent in the third quarter. G.D.P. measures the total output of goods and services within America's borders. For an economy emerging from recession, growth is typically in the 6 percent range. "Will there be a double-dip recession?" asked Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. "No. We'll have slow growth. But a persuasive case can be made for the other side of the argument."

 
Payrolls Drop; So Do Rates
 
The unemployment rate held steady in November at 6.8 percent, as expected. But payrolls tumbled by nearly 241,000, the second-largest drop of the year. Payroll statistics are considered more accurate. The drop in payrolls raised the Federal Reserve's level of concern about a possible "double-dip" recession; last week it dropped the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other, to 4.5 percent from 4.75.


A Few More Construction Dollars
 
No, it wasn't an aberration. Construction spending rose 1.0 percent in October, the fourth straight monthly gain and part of the longest string of advances in five years, the Commerce Department said. Despite the gain, spending on construction is still below last year's level. The industry "needs an economic stimulus package, and we need it now," said Mark Tipton, president of the National Association of Home Builders.

 
Manufacturing Peters Out
 
For months, the manufacturing sector was the lone horse pulling the nation's economic wagon. Domestic and export sales of manufactured goods grew as the rest of the economy languished. But manufacturing lost its snap in November. The National Association of Purchasing Management, which surveys 300 corporate executives on the size of their order books, said its index fell last month to 50.1, from 53.5 in October. A reading of 55 shows expansion, 50 indicates stagnation and below 44 signals recession. "The economy grew perceptively weaker in November," said Robert Bretz, chairman of the association's survey committee.


Detroit Is Quick to Rejoice
 
Ten days of improved sales is not enough to signal an industrywide turnaround. Even so, the numbers sure looked good to Detroit. Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks climbed 20.9 percent in late November, the auto makers said last week. Sales to rental fleets pushed the sales figures higher. Though sales for the entire month were down, Detroit did win back some business from the Japanese. Detroit had 62.3 percent of the market last month, compared with 60.1 percent a year earlier. But before Detroit uncorks the champagne, it should recall that in the 1970's, the General Motors Corporation had 60 percent of the market all to itself.

HEADLINE: All About/Baby Products;
Smaller Families Perhaps, but So Much More to Buy

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
This is not your parents' baby boom. They bought cribs and strollers from Sears Roebuck; today's new parents might spend up to $3,000 on their newborns for everything from backpacks to electronic monitors. Increasingly, the emphasis is practical -- safety, function and good design.
Fueled by a mini-baby boom, sales of products aimed at newborns to 2-year-olds hit $2.45 billion in 1990, up 8 percent from $2.25 billion the year before, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Marlton, N.J. And that is not counting clothing, toys or disposable diapers. 
 The birth rate actually declined slightly in the first six months of this year, after five years of steady increases. But most demographers say the decline is temporary, due to the effects of the recession, and baby-gear makers say they expect sales growth to continue once the recession ends.
"The business has grown dramatically, not just because of the number of births, but because of the amount of new products," said Shirley Pepys, the trade group's president and also president of Noel Joanna Inc., a maker of children's bedding and accessories based in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. "New parents are open to anything and if you told them they needed 150 new products, they'd probably buy them."
Style plays a bigger role than ever in baby products, but so does safety, industry leaders say. And while 30-something parents are skeptical of gimmicks, they are looking for innovative products that can make life easier for working parents. Many of these products come from new companies formed by parents turned entrepreneurs.
Fewer children are being born than during the 1950's and 60's, "but people are spending more per child," said Alise Kreditor, a marketing consultant based in Great Neck, L.I., who works with baby products companies. "Parents are more informed and are making better choices," she said, noting that the more outlandish products -- like designer car seats -- are not selling well.

 
 
The 'Perfect' Nursery
Exotic-Wood Cribs And Baby Bedding
 Decorating a baby's room used to be a bit like buying a car from Henry Ford; you could have any color you liked as long as it was pastel pink or blue. No more. Fashion has entered every segment of the market.
"It's very important how you decorate your nursery and a lot of money is spent on decorating that room," said Ms. Pepys of Noel Joanna, which sells wildly colored and patterned sheets, quilts and matching lamps.
Fashion baby bedding "is a huge business in the United States that came out of nowhere," said John Moeller, president of the Simmons Juvenile Products Company in New London, Wisc., which added bedding to its line of cribs recently.
Style is also a deciding factor for parents buying a $500 crib instead of a $99 model, when both meet the same safety standards, Mr. Moeller said. While cribs all used to be finished in the same maple color stain, now they come in white, cherry, natural, washed finishes and even exotic hardwoods. Despite the recession, "some of our best-selling cribs continue to be the most expensive," he said.
 
 
 
New Entrepreneurs
Parents Put Their Insights to Work
 One factor fostering the growth of new products is the entrepreneurial nature of today's new parents. Many new items, like training pants that open up at the sides, are the result of new mothers or fathers creating solutions to their own problems and in the process creating new marketing niches.
"People are innovative -- many products are born of people being new parents," said Ms. Pepys of the Juvenile Products Manufacturers. "The more babies born, the more entrepreneurs," she said.
One new mother who started a profitable business is Ruth Wimmer, president of Wimmer-Ferguson Child Products Inc. in Denver. A former nurse on a neonatal ward, Ms. Wimmer saw a need for an object that would stimulate and hold the interest of newborns. The result was the Stim-mobile, which dangles five disks with simple, high-contrast black-and-white patterns above the infant.
"I had a child and designed the mobile for her," said Ms. Wimmer. "I had been reading the research on early visual development. Health care professionals all knew about the research on contrast."
Initially, those health care professionals and parent educators were the target market. Now the Stim-mobile is sold in baby specialty stores and catalogues.Wimmer-Ferguson has expanded the line to include soft cards and squeezable toys with the same patterns. Research showed that babies like to recognize the familiar in new objects.
"I've been careful to stay close to the research; too many baby products are just cute," said Ms. Wimmer. She and her husband, Allan Ferguson, who handles marketing, have also kept the line relatively narrow. "Babies don't need that many toys; they need a few good ones," she said.

 
 
For Too-Busy Parents
Specialty Catalogues Offer Convenience
 For mothers turned entrepreneurs, like Ms. Wimmer, the baby specialty catalogues are often the fastest route to a broad market. With names like Right Start, Hand in Hand, and One Step Ahead, the catalogues seek out new and innovative products and refresh their offerings often to stay a step ahead of mass merchandisers and chain stores. For baby boomers used to Land's End or J. Crew, the catalogues are a natural source.
"Working moms and dads trying to incorporate a baby into an already hectic life style don't have time to do comparison shopping," said Karen Scott, president of One Step Ahead in Deerfield, Ill. That's where Ms. Scott and her mothers panel come in. They screen hundreds of products each month; less than 10 percent end up in the catalogue.
"We actually see what happens in the household," said Ms. Scott, a former marketing executive with Kraft, turned new mother, turned entrepreneur. "I think parents are getting fussier," she said. "They are not afraid to spend money, but they don't want to spend it foolishly." These parents are looking for products that meet real needs. "The days of just introducing a new bunny pattern are over," he said.
In addition to products aimed specifically at newborns, like the Stim-mobile, Ms. Scott said she has seen the greatest innovation in accessories to make travel with an infant easier, and to make the home and car a safer environment for children. But innovation can go too far. Ms. Scott said an electronic voice-activated crib -- it rocked when the baby cried -- has been dropped from the catalogue.
It put the baby to sleep "in about 75 percent of cases," she said. "But if you were in the 25 percent quadrant you weren't too pleased. It was a bit of overkill."
 
 
 
SELLING SAFETY TO WORRIED PARENTS

Product safety has always been a concern in the nursery. But today, with the media focusing more attention on childhood hazards, safety is a selling point.
"On the anxiety scale, worry about one's children and their safety ranks very high -- that's why safety sells so well," said David Markus, editor of Parenting magazine. "Every article about the accidental death of a child has a ripple effect."
In 1989, more than one million American children age 4 and younger were injured at home seriously enough to require emergency-room care. Many such injuries can be avoided if parents take some simple steps, experts say. An ever-broader array of items is available to help.
Safety items are a big portion of the One Step Ahead catalog, which specializes in innovative products from small companies. "Just in the past six months, safety products have started to provide a really important capacity to improve the odds against children getting hurt," said Karen Scott, One Step Ahead's president.
Ms. Scott praises a vinyl-cushioned bumper guard that fits around the perimeter of coffee tables as "not high tech but ingenious," and a fire-resistant blanket developed by the Monsanto Company, with a special fiber structure, rather than a potentially toxic chemical retardant. And there is an auto safety vest that hooks into the shoulder harness; it promises greater protection against whiplash than a booster seat.
Michael Lerner, who introduced the once-ubiquitous "Baby on Board" sign in 1984 after buying the idea from a friend, has turned child safety into an entire business. Safety 1st Inc., based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., now has 115 products, which are sold in chain stores and baby specialty shops. These range from simple items, like electric outlet covers, to elaborate ones, like a swivel bath chair.
"Parents are more safety conscious than ever before," said Mr. Lerner, Safety 1st's president. He cites working parents as a factor. "Because they don't have as much time to spend with their children, they tend to zero in on health and safety benefits."
Safety is also a big factor in crib sales. More-stringent safety standards -- like narrower spacing of the slats -- introduced in the last 20 years make a new crib a more prudent purchase than a hand-me-down.
"If you buy a crib made before 1990, you're taking an unnecessary risk with your child," said John Moeller, president of Simmons Juvenile Products. A crib "is the one juvenile product designed for the child to be left unattended in," he said. "For the price of a crib, it's almost irresponsible to risk a baby."

HEADLINE: Cloning Casinos With Appeal for the Masses

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS

 BODY:
When William G. Bennett and a partner scraped together $4 million to buy the money-losing Circus Circus hotel and casino here in May 1974, they were convinced that, by applying financial discipline and some marketing flair, they could turn the operation around quickly. It took them all of one month.
"We made a large profit in June and never looked back," said Mr. Bennett, chairman and chief executive. Over the last 17 years, in fact, Mr. Bennett has built Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. into one of the gaming industry's largest and most profitable companies. Its seven Las Vegas casinos netted $84.3 million on sales of $618.5 million in the nine months ended Oct. 31. 
 The company's success, analysts and industry executives say, has also helped change the way casinos approach their business. Mr. Bennett was among the first to branch out beyond high rollers and hard-core gamblers to woo the masses -- what the company refers to as "the middle-income tourist and player" or "middle America" -- with rock-bottom room rates and meal prices.
He was also among the first to recognize the importance of transforming Las Vegas into an entertainment center for all ages. Starting with the flagship property, which, as its name suggests, offers big-top acts along with slot machines, Mr. Bennett has gradually moved toward building properties that owe more to Disneyland than to the shady origins of gaming in Nevada. His largest casino, the Excalibur, is a pseudo-medieval castle, complete with jousting knights in armor, whose 4,000 rooms have been almost constantly booked since the opening last year.
"Circus is clearly the leader in its industry and extremely well run," said Mark Manson, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York. "Their basic concept, that a casino is an entertainment mega-store, is an idea whose time came at about the time they began to exploit it. They've also shown discipline in sticking to their market niche."
Despite a recession that has depressed results for all gaming companies, Circus is now planning to build another casino adjacent to the Excalibur. The property, known at Project X, is to open in less than two years and will center on a 30-story pyramid that any pharaoh would be proud of. It will have a science fiction theme, including "spaceship" elevators and Disney-like rides.
Once a business of entrepreneurs who would throw up a boxy hotel around a dimly lit casino, the industry today increasingly revolves around a handful of large, well-financed corporations with resort-like projects that require huge investments.
"This is part of a long evolution that has Las Vegas becoming the Orlando of the West," said Daniel R. Lee, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation in Boston.
Analysts believe that tourism here will continue to expand steadily -- albeit somewhat more slowly than in the last decade. Still, the casino companies face a certain risk that Las Vegas is becoming as overbuilt as Atlantic City.
At a cost of about $290 million, Project X is the third lavish new project to be announced in Las Vegas in the last several months. Mirage Resorts Inc., formerly Golden Nugget Inc., is planning a $300 million project called Treasure Island and MGM Grand Inc. recently broke ground on a project designed to be equal parts theme park and casino.
Those projects come on top of a huge building boom here in the last several years. Top-ranking casinos like Caesars World Inc.'s Caesars Palace have been undergoing expansions and refurbishments.
And new resorts like Excalibur and the Mirage have largely forced that sort of investment by continuing to establish new standards of flashiness -- the Mirage's smoke-belching volcano, for example. So far, the losers have been older properties, like the privately held Dunes and Aladdin hotels, whose owners have not had the money to remain competitive.
For the 66-year-old Mr. Bennett, building an entertainment powerhouse was not at all in the career plan. He was a Navy pilot in World War II and planned to become an aeronautical engineer -- his passion to this day is flying model airplanes. Instead, he became a furniture salesman. By 1960, he owned a 10-store chain in California and Arizona, but within a decade lost it to a bad recession in the region and went to work for Del Webb Inc., a land developer and casino operator. "In my life, I never saw such waste and mismanagement," Mr. Bennett said. "The retail business is a tough business, and it was easy for me to apply some of that discipline to the gaming business."
Within five years, he headed Webb's operations in Nevada, but he and a friend, William N. Pennington, were looking to go out on their own. After acquiring and turning around the Circus Circus casino in Las Vegas, the company quickly, added rooms and casino space to the existing property and opened similar projects in Reno and Laughlin, Nev.
Mr. Bennett's enduring notion was that there was far more profit in offering a good value to a wide market than in competing for the serious gamblers. To him, there was no shame in running a casino whose parking lot was filled with recreational vehicles carrying two-bit gamblers; Circus Circus welcomed the RVs with open arms, building a special lot with power hookups for them.
Those two-bit players, as it turned out, just kept dropping quarter after quarter into the slot machines -- in volumes that the rest of the industry and Wall Street finally discovered when the company went public in 1983.
"I don't want to brag about what we did, because in some cases we did some really silly things, but we changed this business when we went public," Mr. Bennett said. "People knew we were doing well, but until then nobody knew how well. Once they found out, everyone went after the so-called family business, and that is continuing."
The company's success has richly rewarded its shareholders, notably the founders, who have seen the stock price go from an initial price of $4 a share to a high of $41 earlier this year. The damage of the recession has since pushed the stock to the low-$30 range. According to the company's most recent proxy statements, Mr. Bennett retains nearly 2.6 million shares, or 9.4 percent of the company, worth $83 million at current prices.
Mr. Pennington, Mr. Bennett's original partner, retired as president of the company three years ago at the age of 65. Mr. Bennett had also planned to retire early in 1992, but abruptly changed his mind earlier this year, saying he wanted to stay on to oversee Project X. His decision prompted the immediate resignation, with no new job, of the man who had been slated to replace him, Richard P. Banis, Circus Circus's president, who is widely respected as one of the industry's most skilled executives.
Some analysts wonder whether it was not time for Mr. Bennett to step aside. On the other hand, they say, it is hard to quarrel with Mr. Bennett's leadership. The company has what analysts consider the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Circus Circus has the only investment-grade debt rating of any pure gaming company. (Hilton, which has both gaming and hotel properties, is also investment grade.) Glenn Schaeffer, Circus Circus's new president, said the company is capable of financing all of Project X from its internal cash flow of $150 million a year.
Assuming Project X comes off on schedule and on budget, Circus Circus seems to have strong prospects for growth at least for the next several years, according to analysts. After that, Mr. Bennett said, the company is looking at Atlantic City as a possibility for expansion, despite his dislike of New Jersey's current regulatory and tax policies.
Beyond that, Mr. Bennett said, legalized gaming is expanding rapidly into new areas. There is considerable interest in casinos in the Midwest, he said. It is an opportunity that would clearly appeal to a company built on middle America.
 
 
 
A TWO-BIT ROAD TO PROFIT-BUILDING
 Circus Circus's strategy is built around keeping its costs low and its casinos full. In building the Excalibur, for example, the company spent less than $300 million, not even half what Mirage Resorts Inc. spent to build the ritzier but smaller Mirage, the other big new casino in Las Vegas. Excalibur does not have a volcano or a dolphin pool, as does the Mirage. But its room rates -- currently as low as $28 on week nights, less than half the Mirage's cheapest rate -- keep it consistently more than 90 percent full.
The showplace atmosphere the company tries to create by filling the Excalibur with strolling minstrels, magic shows, arcade games and the like also help attract hordes of people from other hotels. Likewise, a $2.99 buffet is a lure. The company's goal is not to make money on rooms or meals -- and it does not. It simply wants to mobs of people, on the theory that almost all of them will ultimately gamble.
"The casino remains the primary profit engine," said Glenn Schaeffer, the company's president.
The company's core middle-class clientele tends to wager heavily on slot machines, which, not being labor-intensive, generally are more profitable than table games. In 1990, operating profit as a percent of revenue at the Circus Circus casino was 27.5 percent, compared with 16.7 percent at the Strip at Caesars Palace, a favorite of the high rollers.
"When people walk past slot machines," said Robert Maxey, who is heading MGM Grand's new theme park and casino under construction across the street from the Excalibur, "a certain portion of their disposable income gets left behind."

HEADLINE: Managing;
Don't Forget the White Males

SERIES: Third of three articles on retaining employees.

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
NANCY GHEEN, the director of human resources at the Monsanto Company, is sure that white men at the company are never denied promotions in favor of less-qualified women or minorities. But she's having a hard time getting white men to believe that.
"They don't notice when six white guys get promoted," she said. "They notice the one black, or the woman, and they say, 'These are the only folks getting ahead.' Sometimes I have to physically drag them to the bulletin board to prove it's not so." 
 Rightly or wrongly, a great many white men feel that their careers are on hold. They complain that rampant downsizing and the push to eliminate layers of management have reduced the number of high-level jobs available, and that blacks and women are promoted over their heads to fill even those.
Although there has been no mass exodus of white men from the laboratories or managerial corridors in response, many human resources experts are worrying that there will be the minute the economy picks up. In exit interviews and surveys, they have sought clues to what might instill loyalty in white male employees in better economic times.
The conclusion most have drawn is that white men, much like their black and female colleagues, will settle for nothing less than a chance to get ahead on the basis of talent. Thus, companies are seeking color- and gender-blind ways to identify people who should be put on the fast track and to keep them happy if gridlock temporarily takes hold.
"Good working conditions and benefits will hold workers, but only career pathing will keep managers and professionals," said Laurence J. Stybel, head of the Boston consulting firm of Stybel, Peabody & Associates.
Since management jobs rarely open up on cue, some companies are setting up mechanisms to constantly remind people that, while they haven't been promoted, they have not been deliberately sidelined.
Last year, S C Johnson Wax designated about 25 people -- a mix of white and black, men and women -- as officer material. Each got an executive as a personal sponsor and a list of jobs that they should try to have sometime in the next 15 years. "This way, they have a career path to shoot at, and a coach who makes sure they don't get lost in the shuffle," said Gayle P. Kosterman, a divisional vice president of human resources.
The Computer Sciences Corporation's Integrated Systems Division in Moorestown, N.J., cites a similar rationale for beefing up training and management meetings for its designated hitters. It has made several of its technical hotshots deputy project managers, so that they can learn skills that will enable them to manage a project themself, if a suitable one comes in. And it picks about seven mid-level managers every year who have demonstrated promise, tells them they are fast tracked and sets up a series of meetings between them and various vice presidents whom they would otherwise be unlikely to meet in the course of their work.
"We're trying to give our best people the feeling that, even if they're not immediately promoted, high-level people are interested in them and their progress," said Thomas J. Smith, vice president of human resources.
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company is struggling to convey that feeling to everyone in its far-flung empire of 140,000 employees. This year it started an international "Valuing People" program that aims to combat stereotypes -- including those plaguing white men -- and to help all employees develop satisfying careers. "Yes, we still have affirmative action goals, but we don't want our white men to feel like an endangered species," said Faith A. Wohl, a director of human resources.
Maintaining a sense of evenhandedness is particularly important if a company is abolishing more jobs than it is creating. The American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation recently noticed that too many people, including many white men, were quitting soon after the company had paid for them to get advanced degrees. "They felt we don't give them opportunities to use their new skills," said Ruthann Prang, a human resources strategy manager.
In response, A.T.& T. set up a data system that enables all management employees to call up details about internal job openings via their personal computers. And starting this year, the company's college recruiters will consider A.T.& T.'s own new graduates for jobs that require degrees. "We've got to get them thinking that A.T.& T. really is a place they can build a career," Ms. Prang said.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: Middlebury;
Seminar Strives To Give Students Economic Insights

DATELINE: MIDDLEBURY, Vt.

 BODY:
Far off the beaten flight path linking Washington, New York and Boston, Middlebury College has never been a mecca for economists, captains of industry or Federal policy makers. Now, however, 25 economic experts are trekking to this rural New England college to instruct 30 students in the realities of applied economics.
"We're trying to address the gap between theory and policy," said J. Dewey Daane, a former governor of the Federal Reserve Board, professor emeritus of finance at Vanderbilt University and the inaugural holder of Middlebury's Alan R. Holmes Chair in economics. 
 The site of this bridge-building is a seminar titled "Monetary Policy and Financial Institutions." Taught by Professor Daane and Joanna Wayland Woos, an economics professor, the semester-long course presents juniors and seniors with no-holds-barred accounts of how the Federal Reserve fors its policies and how those policies work in the business world.
 
Fostered by Friendship
 Speakers have an opportunity to meet with Professor Daane, a former colleague of some and authority figure to many, and to honor Alan R. Holmes, who worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1948 to 1981, eventually running the bank's domestic and trading operations.
"All of these people came out of their friendship for Dewey Daane or Alan Holmes, and the chance to see Middlebury College," said Sidney L. Jones, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for economic policy.
After Mr. Holmes died in 1982, Robert Jones, former president of MMS International in San Francisco, which provides financial and economic information to businesses, and Middlebury's class of '59, established the $1.85 million chair in Mr. Holmes's name.
"Holmes epitomizes the ideal Fed career person," Professor Woos said. "He was a diplomat, an economist, and savvy on the politics of his era. He was profoundly respected in his field."
The speaker list is impressive, including Sidney Jones, the Treasury official; Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company; Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Margaret Greene, senior vice president of the foreign exchange department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as a selection of senior business executives from around the nation.
So far, their messages have been eclectic and sometimes surprising. Early in the semester, for example, Mr. Volcker urged students to pursue careers in Civil Service, arguing that a higher standard of professionalism would restore the public's trust in government.
More recently Mr. Jones from the Treasury told the class: "The economy is experiencing moderate growth, but it is different from what most people are used to after a recession. The Administration has repeatedly emphasized that this will be a moderate, cyclical expansion."
Regarding that assessment, Eric Wellmann, a senior majoring in German and economics from Stoneham, Mass., said, "His optimism seemed uniquely high and perhaps out of line with the predictions of the private Fed watchers whom we've heard from, such as David Jones from Aubrey Lanston & Company."
 
'A Better Understanding'
 In a recent interview, Professor Daane said that when he accepted the position at Middlebury last year, he resolved to put students in touch with the men and women who make economic policy or must live with it.
"Students," Professor Woos said, "will come out of this course with a better understanding of the technical complexity of real policy making than some grad students have."
"What we're getting is monetary policy through the eyes of the practitioner," said John Waldron, a senior in English from Bryn Mawr, Pa. "In this class we take a graph relationship from the textbook and put it into real terms."

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, Helping Hands for New York's Neediest Cases;
So a Crying Child May Someday Smile: In a Cold World, Hope Means Helping

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
"Leave me alone," is the refrain of this holiday season. "It's tough all over."
And so it is. People cling to jobs by their fingernails, forego presents and plans, try to scrape by. It is a dim Hannukah, a hard-candy Christmas, an unhappy New Year. "If one more smelly bum sticks his face too close to mine and demands just a dollar . . ." 
 There seems no horror cruel enough to break through the calluses. Underneath the new snow Friday morning, on some park benches one noticed the outline of bodies. People. What is it like to sleep beneath a frozen blanket? It became almost an intellectual question; there was neither time nor inclination to ponder how a life might come to this.
 
Looking Ahead
 Then, something happened that hit home. It happened on a southbound platform in the Times Square subway station. A man stumbled off a car, a little girl beside him. Both wore shabby, soiled clothes.
She had a slight, expectant smile. Suddenly, he slapped her face with the back of his hand. She flinched, looked at him incredulously, seeming to hope against hope that all this was not so. His -- her father's? -- lips curled in a grimace.
An observer felt he knew all he needed to know about the girl's past and future. Some hurts heal and some don't and this instant in the unwritten history of the world was not pretty. It broke your heart. It really did.
It would be a miracle if the little girl were somehow, sometime helped by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which is conducting its 80th annual appeal. But hundreds of others whom life is trying to crush will surely be helped. There are children without limbs or love or hope, immigrants to this too harsh promised land who live a dozen to a room, Holocaust survivors who dwell alone in the shadows of a dying century, people for whom a bed of their own is an immense dream.
Things are as they were when Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The New York Times, began the fund in 1911 after he was moved by a single beggar to whom he gave a few dollars. The initial campaign began with a depressing description of society, one that has changed little. It spoke of "a world of famine in the midst of plenty; of cruel heart and body hunger with bounty in sight but not in reach."
Truth to tell, things may be worse now. Poverty is deepening in this city even as people become inured to seeing it. The Community Service Society, a private group which keeps track of the needy, reports that New York City's poor population, as defined by Federal guidelines, is now nearly 2 million. Almost one in four New Yorkers is poor.
Not only have the number of poor grown, but the poor have become poorer, the society says. More of the poor are below 75 percent of the poverty threshold, defined in 1990 as $13,360 for a family of four.
All this has greatly strained governments' ability to help. By last count, the city's public assistance caseload reached 937,000, up 77,000 from a year earlier. By next June, city officials project the welfare caseload will climb to an all-time high of 988,000.
The impact of this increase in poverty, the Community Service Society says, is pervasive. Jumps in the incidence of infant mortality, child abuse, homelessness and death rates from liver and other diseases all seem, at least partly, a result of the worsening economic clime. Meanwhile, the city continues to lose jobs in the manufacturing sector, where the unskilled and semi-skilled are most likely to be employed.
These statistics might be persuasive if they were not just statistics. Numbers blur into numbers. And the fact is that the poor cannot speak for themselves. Says the Book of Ecclesiastes, "The poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard."
For 80 years, the hallmark of the Neediest Cases Fund is that it has given voice to people otherwise too weak, too immersed in their suffering, to be heard. It has expressed the eloquence of their words and lives in case studies like those that will be printed here.
Indeed, it is the needy themselves who have given the more affluent the chance to answer the challenge of Samuel Johnson: "A decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilization," he told Boswell.
 
A Home Is Found
 Certainly, these are sad stories, but just as surely there can be happy endings. Alberto, who has been quadriplegic, blind and profoundly retarded from birth, spent his first years of life in a hospital. The Children's Aid Society brought him to a new program to help these "medical foster boarder babies." The end result is that a foster mother was found, who fell in love with Alberto, who is now 5, and is in the process of adopting him.
Some of the stories grip precisely because they are so human-scale. Mrs. D. is a formerly homeless parent with two children. She needed orthopedic shoes for her 12-year-old daughter who will have to undergo foot surgery when she is older. But their $145 cost was a stretch for Mrs. D., who had just begun a new job. The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, with the help of the Neediest Cases Fund, paid the bill and made a Christmas.
Sometimes timing is the key thing. Roberta N. found herself divorced at age 56 and living alone in an apartment she could not afford. As if that were not enough, she had become estranged from one of her sons who refused to let her see her grandchildren. Westchester Jewish Community Services -- an agency of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, Inc. -- stepped in and arranged counseling, and is helping her go back to school and find housing.
"She has a renewed interest in herself, a strong sense of determination and greater self-confidence in her actions and ideas," an agency official said.
 
After Calamity
 There are, of course, real horror stories. The Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty, another U.J.A.-Federation agency, is helping a mother and son who lived through hell shortly after arriving in Brooklyn from their native Georgia in the Soviet Union.
A band of hooligans broke into their apartment in April 1990. They tormented the family with anti-Semitic insults and tortured them with a hot iron and with gas from a stove which they fed into an enclosed room. Then they strangled the father to death, leaving the 51-year-old mother and 19-year-old son alone. The Jewish poverty group is helping with rent and in job-hunting.
Ultimately, the Neediest Cases gives New Yorkers a chance to participate, in however small a way, in helping ameliorate the terrors and sadnesses that seem so omnipresent.
Take the little girl who was slapped by her father in the subway. The Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service stepped in and helped a family that seemed much like that. A mother named Juanita had her three children taken away and placed in foster care because she was discovered to be using excessive corporal punishment.
 
Together, Trying
 She was given intensive individual and group counseling, a 15-week course in parenting skills and gained a high school equivalency diploma. Now, Juanita has her children back and is well on the way to completing a nursing degree. She has learned that hitting her children solves nothing, and the family together attends biweekly therapy sessions.
So can battered and bewildered New Yorkers make a difference in how the city's frailest, most marginal citizens fare? If they do not try, in however limited a fashion, the answer is surely no.
Last year, 15,580 individuals and organizations said yes by contributing $4,439,093.47 to the Neediest Cases Fund.

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, Helping Hands for New York's Neediest Cases;
A Question A Mother Has Feared

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
A few weeks ago Lillian O. abruptly pulled her daughter off the bus after the 7-year-old pointed to an AIDS poster and asked, loudly, if that was why her mother was sick so often.
It was a few days after Earvin (Magic) Johnson had announced that he was infected with H.I.V. The child's second-grade class had spent hours discussing his future, and their teacher had said that Magic was going to die. 
 On the bus, Lillian's daughter wanted to know whether her mother also was going to die. It was a conversation Lillian had spent a long time preparing for, but she still was not quite ready.
"I panicked," said Lillian. "It felt like everyone on the bus was staring at me. I lied. I told her I didn't have AIDS. And I told her not to shout on the bus."
 
A Year Later
 Later that evening, however, she admitted to the girl that she has the disease, though she cushioned the blow by saying that Magic Johnson still has a long time to live. Her daughter was silent as she heard the news; Lillian is still not sure how she is taking it.
Just under a year ago, in an interview for The New York Times Neediest Cases drive, Lillian, a 31-year-old former heroin addict, had talked about her health, her child and the help they had both been receiving from the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven charities affiliated with the appeal.
The months since then have seen some small victories -- Lillian has learned to take better care of herself, has made progress controlling her temper, has become more open about her condition and has learned, with her daughter, to swim.
But her health has continued to decline. Lillian's high cheekbones have become more prominent, her dark brown eyes more deepset and her round face slightly gaunt. The AZT medication, she said, is "not doing anything any more." Her T-cell count -- an important indicator of one's resistance to the virus -- have dropped dangerously low.
She is no longer able to take advantage of some of the assistance arranged by the Society -- illness forced her to drop out of the college classes in social work she had begun.
Other services, however, have become even more important -- like the counseling she and her daughter receive at Frederick Douglass Mental Health Clinic, a branch of the Children's Aid Society, several times a week.
Last year, Lillian said she often found herself so depressed that it was difficult to move. She had just started talking to her daughter about how "Mommy is going to die some day," but could not bring herself to mention the word AIDS.
Since then, Lillian has received $1,475 from the Neediest Cases through the clinic. The money has paid for her daughter's tuition to a special summer program for gifted children, and gave Lillian much-needed free time to rest. The money also bought the little girl a swimsuit, goggles and summer clothes, and it helped pay for two semesters of social work school for Lillian, where she maintained a "B" average.
 
Help in Being Brave
 Most importantly, the assistance from the Children's Aid Society and the Neediest Cases has allowed Lillian to be brave, to confront her illness and to overcome the prejudices that are linked to the disease.
There was a dentist who practically threw her out of his office when he discovered she has AIDS. And a school administrator asked her to leave the swimming pool area, fearing that she would give the disease to the children. Her mother nervously double-checked that they were not sharing a glass.
But in recent months, Lillian has begun to attend meetings of a support group at the Hispanic AIDS Forum, visit AIDS victims at hospitals and talk to school groups about the disease.
Lillian still insists on walking her daughter to school every morning, but now in the afternoons she tells her daughter to play with her father. (He is unemployed, she said, unable to work because of heart disease.) And she lets him do more of the chores, though she still cooks dinner.
"For a while she was mad with me," Lillian said. "She told me to get a home attendant so that she would have someone who could carry her bicycle downstairs. She would ignore me and say that she was going to play with Daddy. It used to make me feel jealous, but now, I think she understands I need to rest, and it makes me happy to see them playing together.
"I'm glad that I'm taking care of business now," she said. "There are times that I can't see very far ahead, but I feel more secure."

Despite Protests, Buyers Are Sought For TV Station

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa

 BODY:
Despite a soft market and opposition from some journalism faculty members and students, Iowa State University's commercially run television station has been put up for sale.
The Iowa Board of Regents, which runs the three universities in the state, decided to seek buyers for WOI-TV, an ABC affiliate, after the Iowa State president, Martin Jischke, recommended in September that it be sold. 
 The university last week chose a broker, Ted Hepburn Company of Palm Beach, Fla., to work with potential buyers of the station, which is one of only two university-owned commercial stations in the nation. The Regents said they would consider offers at their meeting in February 1992.
In his report to the Regents, Mr. Jischke said the station's steadily declining profits had decreased cash distributions to the university, which have been used to support Iowa State's biotechnology program.
Mr. Jischke said he based his recommendation to sell the station largely on a 1986 report by the Denver consulting firm of Bortz & Company, which said that investing proceeds from a sale would bring more income to the university than ownership.
The station is reportedly worth $10 million to $15 million, said Ted Hepburn, the broker. He said it would have been double that four years ago. "Right now, we're in the doldrums," he said. "It's gloom and doom."
Still, Mr. Jischke said that now was the time to sell. "No one could assure me with any certainty that values would go up," he said.
Although Mr. Jischke said in an interview that his decision was not related to the university's budget problems of the last year, his report to the Regents cited current finances and a need for alternative sources of money as reasons for selling the station.
Proceeds from the sale would support the biotechnology program, technology transfer, "distant learning" using satellite transmissions to students at off-campus sites around the state and scholarships for students, the report said.
 
Strip-Mining Is Feared
 But Thomas Beell, a professor of broadcast journalism, said Mr. Jischke and the Regents were strip-mining the university. "It will have a devastating effect on our program," Professor Beell said.
Broadcast students are required to work at WOI for one course, and some classes are held in its building on campus. Since the university's telecommunicative arts program is one of 11 programs to be cut because of budget problems, broadcast students may be without production space if the station is sold, Professor Beell said.
Prof. Stephen Coon, who is in charge of the broadcasting program, said many of the 197 students in broadcasting -- and potential students -- were worried. The possible sale is already affecting recruiting efforts, Professor Coon said, noting: "One student decided not to attend I.S.U. He said, 'Call me when the situation is settled.' Multiply that by some unknown factor of those who have not bothered to contact us."
Rodney Fowler, a former broadcast student who is the morning anchor at WOI, says students who are working there are uneasy. "They may get their pink slips," Mr. Fowler said. About 50 students work part- or full-time at the station in news and production.
If the station is sold and moved to Des Moines, as the consultants recommended, the university may be able to retain the building that houses WOI and the station's satellite services for distant learning.
But these concessions may force a discount in the price, said Bishop Cheen of Paul Kagan Associates of Carmel, Calif. The media appraisal company is appraising the station a second time for the Board of Regents.
Although Mr. Cheen could not release details of the valuation, he said it would confirm work by Bortz & Company.
 
'Not as Polished'
 Mr. Cheen said WOI may not command as high a price as other commercial network affiliates because it is university owned and has low cash flow. "It's not as polished because it was a training ground," he said. "There's a lot of room for improved efficiencies."
He also said that moving the station to Des Moines could be beneficial, but with an NBC affiliate and a CBS affiliate already there, the competition could prove fatal to its news department.
"In today's television economics, with local news counting as 40 percent of revenue, is there room for a three-horse race in the news derby?" Mr. Cheen asked. "In other markets, the third horse has given up."
But some buyers, he said, may find a university-owned station a plus. "There's tremendous value in television stations," Mr. Cheen said. "But this is not an era where most owners want to put up their stations."

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, Helping Hands for New York's Neediest Cases;
Love Story: An Invalid, An 'Angel'

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
This is a love story about a frail 81-year-old lady and the robust, 26-year-old woman who looks after her.
Dora Goldfarb was living alone in her apartment on the Upper West Side when she fell two years ago and broke her hip. Afterwards, she could no longer walk. Sharon Gibson moved in, with her plants and calypso music, to work for the shrunken woman with the wispy gray hair and wasted legs. 
 "She can't balance anymore," Ms. Gibson explains. "If she goes to stand alone, she's going to fall."
Miss Goldfarb calls Ms. Gibson her angel. "When she gives a bath, boy, does she give a bath! Wash my hair. Cut my hair. Comb my hair. She's an angel!"
But Miss Golbfarb, a social worker in her day, has used up her small savings on medical bills and paying Ms. Gibson's salary for working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, no holidays or vacations.
 
In Need of Help
 The only thing standing between Miss Golbfarb and a nursing home is a $250-a-month rent subsidy from the Jewish Association for Services to the Aged, which receives money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The agency is also helping Miss Goldfarb apply to Medicaid to cover the expense of home care.
Stephen D. Solender, executive vice president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, one of the seven charities associated with the Fund, said a rising number of elderly people are turning to charities for food, clothing and help with rent as medical costs eat away at fixed incomes and the recession puts family members out of work.
Mr. Solender's organization provides rent subsidies to 25,000 people, mostly older people who need help to stay in their homes, through agencies like the one helping Miss Goldfarb. "More people are coming to us for the basics," he said. "We're like an emergency room."
 
Hanging On to Home
 To Miss Goldfarb, nothing is more important than being able to stay in her apartment of 25 years, a one-bedroom on the 17th floor at 96th and Central Park West that smells faintly of moth balls. There, she is surrounded by the familiar -- her parents' glowing brass samovar, her poetry books, the Picassoesque painting from her nephew's blue period."I want my own home and I want her and that's it," Miss Goldfarb says. "Sharon is my life."
Sharon Gibson has been looking after other people since she was a teen-ager. "I took care of my grandmother when she died. I was 15 then. I like nursing," she says. Gesturing to Miss Goldfarb, she says, "She's like a grandmother to me."
Like many immigrant women in New York City, Ms. Gibson is supporting children back home, a 5-year-old son and a 10-year-old daughter in Trinidad. She keeps their photographs at her bedside.
"Get the photographs," Miss Golbfarb tells her. Ms. Gibson comes back with the likenesses of her children. "Isn't he beautiful?" Miss Goldfarb says and kisses the photo.
Miss Golbfarb passes her days on a worn couch in the living room. Sometimes, she lays back in her blue housecoat and listens to Ms. Gibson's calypso and reggae music, her foot tapping on the needlepoint roses of her stool, her hands clapping as Ms. Gibson shimmies across the parquet floors.
Miss Goldfarb's vision is failing, so she looks a lot at the television. "The worst part is not being able to read," she says. She misses poetry especially, but she's vague on what her favorites once were. "I have them here. I don't remember. I can't remember."
But Miss Goldfarb does remember the photographs of Ms. Gibson's children that had been sitting on the coffee table just moments earlier.
"Where are the pictures?" she demands querulously. "The pictures!"
"They're right here," Ms. Gibson reassures her. "I moved them so you could put your feet up."
Ms. Gibson then helps Miss Golbfarb to her rocker and guides her to the bathroom. "This is the one with the biggest heart," Miss Goldfarb says, patting Ms. Gibson's arm. "Sharon, did you eat anything today?"
"I'm not hungry yet," Ms. Gibson replies. "When you're finished let me know."
A little later, Miss Goldfarb says, "Sharon will stay until I die."
"Maybe I'll die before you," Ms. Gibson says, tweaking her boss.
"God forbid!" Miss Goldfarb exclaims. "Shut up!"

HEADLINE: Bridge

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott

 BODY:
The Fall National Championships of the American Contract Bridge League, which ended a week ago in Indianapolis, were the smallest in four years, with fewer than 10,000 tables in play in the 10-day tournament. The poor turnout can be attributed to the recession, a preference for Thanksgiving at home, and the lack of a big local bridge population.
Those who did play enjoyed themselves, and that included nearly all the country's top players. But among those with big reputations on the international bridge scene, only two were able to capture titles. 
 One was Zia Mahmood, who dedicated his victories in the Life Master Open Pairs and the Open Board-a-Match Teams to his 16-year-old niece, Alya Hidyatallah of Manhattan.
The other was Bob Hamman of Dallas, many times a world champion, who won the Blue Ribbon Pairs with Nick Nickell of Raleigh, N.C. Hamman was 1990 Player of the Year, a title Zia has won this year. The award is based on success in major national events.
The most successful players in Indianapolis were David Berkowitz of Old Tappan, N.J., and Larry Cohen of Little Falls, N.J., who won two of the four major events and were second in a third. They would also have won a one-day Swiss Team event, and broken the record for master points won at a single National, but for an odd episode. They were deprived of the chance to play two potentially winning boards at the end of the day because the boards were prematurely removed by an overzealous caddy and could not be recovered. This was one example of a tendency among some members of the directing staff to take prompt, decisive action that later proved ill judged.
Berkowitz and Cohen won both major team championships, including the prestigious Reisinger Board-a-Match event at the end of the tournament. Their Reisinger teammates were Cliff Russell of Miami Beach, Sam Lev of Forest Hills, Queens, Marty Bergen of Farmingdale, L.I., and Bjorn Fallenius of Manhattan. They thus qualified for playoffs that will eventually determine the United States team in the 1993 world championships, but Fallenius is not eligible. He played for Sweden, his native country, in the 1991 Bermuda Bowl in Yokohama, Japan, and must wait until 1994 before he can represent another country.
The winners of major championships almost invariably have large collections of master points, but neither Fallenius nor Lev are life masters. Lev, who used to represent Israel in international competition, won the Reisinger for the second time but lacks points won at the local level, a relatively recent requirement for life master status.
He held the East cards on the diagramed deal from the Reisinger final, and took full advantage of a slight misjudgment by the declarer.
It was normal for North-South to reach a black-suit slam, and it is sure to be defeated with both suits breaking badly. Six clubs is slightly safer, but six spades is more likely to be a winning choice in board-a-match scoring, which is roughly equivalent to match-point duplicate.
In the diagramed auction Russell as West put pressure on his opponents with a pre-emptive jump to five hearts. North's final bid of six spades was pushy, since his heart queen was useless and the energetic bidding by East-West suggested that there would be bad breaks.
Lev was happy to double six spades, and the opening lead of the heart ace was ruffed by South. That player led a spade to the queen, losing to the ace, and was forced to ruff another heart. The play of the spade king brought a heart discard from West, and South knew that the slam was doomed. The question now was the size of the penalty. The position was this:
[DIAGRAM]
South now made an obvious play by leading the club ace. Lev demonstrated that this was a subtle error: Instead of routinely ruffing, he discarded a diamond. This excellent defense guaranteed that South would lose 500 instead of 200. Diamonds were led at this point, but now Lev could ruff the third round. The best South could do was to discard a club, but he was still left with an eventual loser in that suit.
In the post-mortem, South discovered that he should have played diamonds before touching clubs, for he could then have thrown both his club losers. He had given Lev the opportunity to help his team on the road to Reisinger victory, for in the replay the contract was six clubs doubled, failing by one trick.

HEADLINE: Brain Surgery For Protest Movement

 BODY:
My compliments on the tragic lobotomy feature "Lingering Effects of Lobotomies of 40's and 50's" [Nov. 3]. It's a story that for too long a time has been relegated to the dustbin of history. Especially deplorable was the use of lobotomies to tranquilize thousands of battle-fatigued emotionally broken veterans of World War II who crowded the psychiatric wards of Army hospitals. This so-called behavior-modifying procedure finally came to an end in the early 1950's, leaving a lobotomy wasteland littered with some 50,000 human "retreads," many of whom slid into a permanent vegetable state.
But there is a sequel to the lobotomy story. In the mid-70's it became known as psychosurgery. It was performed through the implantation of very thin electrodes into certain sections of the brain, the amygdala region, where "bad" brain cells, targeted by electrocephalogram readings and presumed associated with violent behavior, were burned out with an electrical charge. 
 Though claims for its scientific validity were denounced by some of the leading neuropsychiatrists, it caught on with municipal and government law-enforcement authorities, who viewed it as a quick fix to the rise of social disquiet across the country soon after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. Hundreds of thousands of his followers were in the streets demanding that their civil rights be recognized and that Dr. King's assassins be brought to justice.
For the police, the psychosurgery possibilities proved attractive in dealing with the leaders of the protests. Two of the principal medical sponsors of this approach, Dr. Vernon H. Mark, a neurosurgeon, and Dr. Frank E. Ervin, a neuropsychiatrist, both of Harvard, wrote to The Journal of the American Medical Association stating that though indeed there were socioeconomic reasons for the demonstrations, the individuals who were involved in violent behavior were suffering from brain dysfunction and could be remedied by pschosurgery.
Especially impressed with this theory was Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California, who promised to allocate $1 million to a violence-rreduction center to be set up in California. In the South there were reports of 50 psychosurgeries at the Atmoree State Prison in Birmingham, Ala. The Veterans Administration declared openly that it had used psychosurgery in V.A. hospitals in Durham, N.C.; Long Beach, Calif.; Minneapolis, and Syracuse.
Civil libertarians and prominent psychiatrists, together with various citizens' groups, saw this trend as an emergence of a racist threat, since most of the prison population was made up of Afro-Americans and other minorities. Eventually, because of the concern expressed by the Congressional Black Caucus, Health Education and Welfare Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger appointed a commission of physicians, lawyers and experts on medical ethics to study the situation.
For nearly a year in weekend meetings in Washington they pondered the matter, in the course of which it was disclosed that some psychosurgery enthusiasts would extend the procedure to such "deviant" individuals as hyperactive children, homosexuals, drug addicts and political nonconformists. The commission, officially known as the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, wound up its deliberations with a fuzzy resolution that didn't endorse the use of psychosurgery, but advocated further examination of its dubious claims.
Because of the growing economic disarray in the United States and the rise of the incidence of violence due to absence of gun controls, I believe it timely to remind the citizenry that socioeconomic problems require appropriate political solutions and not some bizarre behavioral approaches that have little to do with the social roots of violence.

HEADLINE: May U.S.-Japanese Friendship Grow Stronger

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The 50th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor is upon us. 
 The people of Japan embrace deep feelings of regret over their country's wartime history, and they have taken the lessons from this experience to heart in treading the path toward peace and democracy over the last 50 years. The United States-Japan relationship has grown closer and healthier into the most important bilateral relationship in the world. When problems have developed between our countries, they have been resolved through dialogue in a spirit of good will, without confrontation.
The visit of President Bush to Japan early next year will be a good opportunity to highlight the accomplishments of that relationship over half a century and to prepare to serve the entire world as we move toward the 21st century.
However, there are areas in this relationship where the level of understanding remains insufficient. Also, it is most regrettable that some quarters of both countries, including the news media, sneeringly focus on our differences and fuel the fires of misperception. An example is Karel van Wolferen's "An Economic Pearl Harbor?" (Op-Ed, Dec. 2). He pays no consideration at all to the development of democracy in Japan, to the fact that the Constitution is supported by the vast majority of the Japanese people, to the importance of the Japan-United States alliance for the Asia-Pacific region, to the international contributions Japan has made or to the serious domestic debate on what further contributions Japan should make in the future.
In any country, and especially in a parliamentary democracy, it unavoidably takes some time to determine the course of the nation. When Japan needs time to reach difficult decisions, it is altogether inappropriate to say that the decision-making process does not function or that there is a lack of domestic leadership. It is also wrong, in my view, to criticize the political systems or practices of other countries because they are different from the American or European model.
The Japanese want and yearn for world peace and the development of mutually beneficial relations among the countries of the world. It is not true that Japan distrusts the rest of the world. In building a new world order in the wake of the cold war, Japan will continue to cooperate with the United States and other countries under its policy of making an international contribution commensurate with its national capability.
The article also inaccurately states that I repeatedly used the term "Japan-bashing" at the Congressional Economic Leadership Institute to make "Americans hold back what they want to say about Japan for fear of being considered racist." As one who welcomes constructive mutual criticism, I would like to make it clear that any references to "Japan-bashing" (one in the body of my remarks and two in answer to questions about "Japan-bashing") were intended to express my concern that the biggest enemy to both countries and our relationship is emotional reaction created by an insufficiency of knowledge of the facts and a lack of objectivity on both sides. Any concerns between the United States and Japan should be resolved through dialogue between our countries, where problems can be pointed out on a friend-to-friend basis.
Indeed, isn't this already an important characteristic of our nowmature relationship? It is a relationship in which each party exercises self-control and strives to create an environment where we both can grow. Japan is prepared to say what needs to be said, but it is also ready to lend serious ear to any appropriate comment the United States has to make as well.

HEADLINE: How Much Is He Treading Water?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Trapped in the Impoverished Middle Class," (Nov. 17) quoted Donald V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar Inc., as seeing the shrinking of American incomes as a good thing. As the wife of a Federal employee, who has seen our family's income lag behind that of the rest of the middle class thanks to the anti-government-worker attitudes of the Carter and Reagan Administrations, I'm curious: What is Mr. Fites's annual compensation? How much of a pay cut has he taken in recent years? How many perks and bonuses has he declined to accept or given back? In short, has he had to "tread water" along with the rest of us?

HEADLINE: ...And About Bringing Down Wages

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It was gratifying to learn that Donald Fites of Caterpillar believes that increases in living standards of people in poor countries require some constraints on resource use by people in rich countries. Inevitably, however, that approach has limitations. For example, the real wages of Caterpillar workers have declined. Have Caterpillar executives sacrificed along with their workers? And what insures that workers in the developing world benefit as the United States standard of living declines? Mexican workers, mentioned by Mr. Fites, suffered a 3.5 percent average yearly decline from 1980 to 1987.
Having American incomes "tread water" while developing-country workers catch up, as Mr. Fites proposes, is not necessary if we pursue rising living standards in environmentally sustainable and community-enhancing ways. This could be done by building a less violent society, both at home and abroad -- one with greater social concern for families, and with secure, interesting and less-stressful work for all who want it.

HEADLINE: Frank S. Kristof, 74, Ex-Official Who Criticized Rent Regulations

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Frank S. Kristof, a retired housing official for New York City and an outspoken opponent of rent control, died on Friday at his home in Highland Lakes, N.J.
Mr. Kristof, who also had a home in Manhattan, was 74 years old. He died of Alzheimer's disease, his family said. 
 He served as president of the New York City Rent Stabilization Association from 1978 to 1981. Earlier, he served as the city's housing economist under Mayors Robert F. Wagner and John V. Lindsay.
A critic of rent regulation, Mr. Kristof once said, "It is essentially a middle-class rip-off of the most unpopular victim of our society -- the landlord." He blamed rent control for reduced construction, and the deterioration and abandonment of buildings.
 
Wide Housing Experience
 He was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College in 1942. From 1943 to 1946, he served in the Air Force as a first lieutenant. He then worked as a substitute high school teacher while studying at Columbia University, earning his master's degree and a doctorate in economics.
In 1952, he started work as a market analyst for the Federal Housing Administration and in 1955, he became a consultant for the State Rent Commission. The next year he was appointed assistant chief of housing for the United States Census Bureau. In 1960 he was named deputy director of planning and program research for the City Housing and Redevelopment Board and in 1963 was promoted to director. In 1967 he became assistant administrator of the City Housing and Development Administration.
Moving to the State Urban Development Corporation, Mr. Kristof became its director of economics and housing finance in 1968 and its vice president of planning and program development in 1977. He was also appointed twice as a member of the City Rent Guidelines Board, which sets rent rates for stabilized apartments.
As an international consultant, he worked in Africa and Barbados for the United Nations, in Thailand for the World Bank, in India and Bahrain for the Ford Foundation and in Brazil for Columbia University. He taught at Hunter College, Pratt Institute and Columbia and wrote many professional articles.
He is survived by his wife, the former Roseanne Miller, whom he married after the death of his first wife, the former Helen Reilly, and by a step-sister, Mary Maier of Rhinelander, Wis.

HEADLINE: End of Story?;
Hostages Go Free at Last, But Iran Bears Watching

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NOTHING marked the senselessness of hostage-taking so well as the release last week of Terry A. Anderson for no easily understandable reason or discernible gain for his Lebanese captors.
While there were scenes of joyous reunion as the last American captive of Beirut's dungeons blinked his way into the daylight and there were some sickening tales of abuse at the hands of the kidnappers, who remain at large, there was also a sense that the whole thing had been a grotesque exercise in futility. 
 The end of the hostage drama brought with it no measurable victory for any side that has played in Lebanon's violent hinterland, no political credit for the sitting American President whose predecessors toiled incessantly for the freedom of hostages, and no breakthrough in relations between the United States and Iran, whose 1979 revolution reinvented hostage taking as a modern terror weapon against "Western arrogance."
Perhaps the American obsession with Iran was over, and for understandable reasons: with the collapse of the Soviet empire, all the rules of East-West competition -- and Iran's role in it -- are changing. Moreover, after the American demonstration of force in the Persian Gulf war, the tectonic plates of power in the Middle East are realigning.
The Iran that drove the Reagan White House to distraction, and to indictments in the Iran-contra affair, was the Iran of an earlier era, even if it was hijacked by a populist religious revolt led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Shah of Iran was America's cold war bulwark against Soviet expansionism to the warm water ports of the Persian Gulf, to the bountiful oilfields along the gulf littoral and to the controlling shoreline of the Strait of Hormuz.
But the East-West struggle for the Iranian trophy, a vestige of four decades of containment policy aimed at Moscow, is all but dead with the end of the cold war. With it died the temptations that so obsessed Mr. Reagan's operatives on the National Security Council that they traded arms for hostages in an effort to ingratiate themselves with the scheming mullahs who had thrown out the Shah.
While many bystanders to the liberation of Mr. Anderson, who led the final march that included Alann Steen and Joseph J. Cicippio, were left wondering whether some new American-Iranian deal had paved the way for his release, many analysts of the Middle East were pointing to the more obvious reality that the end of the hostage crisis marks a surrender of Iranian radicalism to a changing power equation in the region.
The man holding the white flag is Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Khomeini acolyte and President of Iran, who is still trying to pull his country out of the devastation left behind by the Iran-Iraq war.
More than two years after Ayatollah Khomeini's death, President Rafsanjani is struggling against a radical majority in his Parliament to increase the pace of economic reform in Iran, to restart industries, to improve the country's human rights record, to attract Western investment and to coax back the many Iranians who fled, with their money, to London, Geneva and California.
Whether he succeeds next spring in the first parliamentary elections since 1988, when radicalism was at its zenith, may determine whether Iran's revolution ultimately succeeds or spins once again out of control, taking with it Iran's chances to re-emerge as a major regional power.
In January 1989, six months before he died, Ayatollah Khomeini sent a delegation to Moscow in what turned out to be his last attempt to play off East against West. At the time, Mohamed Javad Larijani, the architect of that Soviet gambit, warned visiting Americans that unless they moved quickly to reconcile with Teheran, the train carrying Soviet-Iranian relations might leave the station, and America, behind.
Today, such a ploy would only draw ridicule. But that does not mean Iran will be unimportant for American security interests, many analysts say. Though there is no longer any risk that Iran might fall under Moscow's sway, the economic strain from exploding population growth, moribund industries and agricultural production all make Iran a potential threat to its neighbors, principally Saudi Arabia, its chief rival for material and spiritual leadership of the world's one billion Muslims.
Will a resurgent Iran with a population of 100 million at the turn of the century be tempted to look across the narrow waterway that separates it from the Arabian Peninsula and covet the rich oil resources of the lightly populated Arab sheikdoms? Will Teheran's post-revolutionary leaders seek to acquire nuclear weapons in light of the nuclear competition that has broken out on Iran's flanks in Southwest Asia? Will Iran continue to employ assassination and terror as instruments of foreign policy? These are the questions that officials in Washington must come to grips with in evaluating future policy toward Iran. The Bush Administration has yet to produce its long-awaited new security arrangement for the Persian Gulf; whatever is in that arrangement, the role of Iran remains crucial to regional stability and, therefore, to American interests, most experts agree.
Mr. Bush is likely to move cautiously. If Iran's proxies in Lebanon clear the final hostage accounts by producing the two remaining German captives as well as the bodies of the two American hostages who didn't make it through their ordeal alive -- William Buckley of the Central Intelligence Agency and Lieut. Col. William R. Higgins of the Marines -- some analysts expect to see the longstanding trade embargo against Iran lifted. An upgrading of the diplomatic contacts with Teheran, now conducted through the Swiss, would likely follow, but these are small steps.
In the meantime, the landscape of terror that the hostages will leave behind in Lebanon now falls to the Syrians, the Israelis and the Lebanese to heal, and the task is anything but easy.
In a little-noted postscript to the final communique Mr. Anderson read on behalf of his kidnappers, he said: "The causes of this troubled episode are complex and difficult. It is these causes which must be addressed and eliminated."
If anything, he was referring to the outcry from Lebanon's dispossessed Shiite Muslims, whose radicalization helped create the synergy of political revolt, terror and kidnapping to which Mr. Anderson fell victim. Radicalized by years of disenfranchisement, invasion, warlord anarchy and impoverishment, this Shiite population -- which had become the largest of Lebanon's many competing religious groups -- was therefore susceptible to Ayatollah Khomeini's call to revolution and struggle against the Great Satan, America, and the Little Satan, Israel. Significant miscalculations by the Reagan Administration in trying to pacify Lebanon following Israel's 1982 invasion, as well as the ill-fated Iran-contra scheme, only prolonged Lebanon's agony and the long hostage internment, in the view of many analysts.
For better or worse, Lebanon's fate has been settled on Syria's terms and the tension in Lebanon today surrounds the incomplete task of disarming the remaining militia forces, including the Party of God warriors who protected Mr. Anderson's jailers. This would pave the way for the Lebanese Army to establish real security in the country for the first time since the civil war erupted in 1975.
If Syria and Lebanon are ever to persuade Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it holds in southern Lebanon, they will have to bring to an end the era of sanctuary in Lebanon for Palestinian and Iranian-backed guerrillas who attack through Israel's northern border. Southern Lebanon is steeped in the blood of Arab "martyrs," Israeli soldiers and their surrogates. The Lebanese held by Israel in its prison at Khiam, including Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, the Lebanese Shiite mullah kidnapped by Israeli commandos, are still hostages to this unresolved conflict, and their fate remains tied to Israel's demand to bring home the remains of its lost servicemen in Lebanon and to free an Israeli Air Force navigator, Ron Arad, who is believed to be still alive.
Thus a number of pieces must fall into place for the "complex and difficult" episode Mr. Anderson described to end, but his long-awaited emancipation was certainly among the most hopeful events to have occurred in Lebanon in many years.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Bush Picks A New Crew And Prays For Updraft

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN 1984, President Reagan and Vice President Bush won re-election by asking Americans if they were better off than four years earlier. In 1992, unless there is a quick economic recovery, the Democrats may well use that question to torment President Bush.
But as he moved last week to put himself and the White House in a campaign mode, the President showed signs that he plans an approach aimed at minimizing his vulnerability in the event the recession doesn't just go away. 
 "I really run on a wide array of questions," Mr. Bush said on Friday. "I hope that by the time this election is held, and I'm quite confident that by the time this election is held, the economy will be much, much better. And in many ways I could answer that affirmatively right now, because of world peace and because of a lot of other things."
While members of his new campaign team listened, Mr. Bush added, "I'm prepared to take my whole record to the American people."
The political strategists have begun plotting ways to make it safe for Mr. Bush to do what he said: run for re-election not on personal popularity and foreign policy credentials alone but also by answering the challenge to his domestic leadership.
Even at this early stage, the outlines of Mr. Bush's election strategy, as well as the problems he must solve, can be discerned in the politically bruising weeks since Labor Day, during which he has suffered about as much political damage, some of it self-inflicted, as any other President in so short a time.
One of Mr. Bush's primary arguments will be that the Democrats are not offering anyone as experienced as he is, nor offering any economic plan of their own.
"The real question is, 'Are you better off than you were 12 years ago?' " said Charles Black, the campaign's senior adviser. "Even if somebody answers, 'No, I'm not better off than four years ago,' they still have to answer this: 'Is there anybody else who can do better?' "
 
Suddenly, Contestable
 Mr. Bush is the heavy favorite for re-election. But between Labor Day and Thanksgiving, his position slid from unassailability to contestability. As members of his own party began to smell blood, Mr. Bush remained reactive.
He kept up small-bore events and foreign travel and resisted pressure to correct the disarray within his staff and the confusion in his domestic policies. All this suggested that he suffered from the politician's malady: an inability to recognize when virtues become vices.
Loyalty and a penchant for letting a moment ripen before taking action can be great assets. But Mr. Bush may have taken them to a damaging extreme by putting off a solution to the political liability created by John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and in delaying the formation of his 1992 campaign staff.
Friday's news conference, at which he named Samuel K. Skinner as his new chief of staff and introduced his campaign team, was supposed to address that problem.
But Democrats and conservative Republicans rushed to point out that a game of musical chairs was not going to fix Mr. Bush's troubles, and Bush aides reluctantly agreed.
Republican strategists, alarmed at how long Mr. Bush took to realize that the recession was causing serious problems, are trying to make the President seem more caring. During another Administration, the Doonesbury comic strip lampooned Jimmy Carter as having a "Secretary of Symbolism." Perhaps that is just what Mr. Bush needs.
Because he feels so comfortable with his position in the world, Mr. Bush does not seem to understand why people think him insensitive when he talks about things like unemployment from what he considers innocent, natural settings -- the golf course, the tennis court or his speedboat.
But getting Mr. Bush off the golf course has proved difficult for his image-makers and it is not clear whether the Bush campaign staff will have much more success in letting new voices penetrate the White House walls.
Mr. Bush has been listening to the voices to which he is accustomed -- the oil patch, happy with the price increase and secure market they got from the Persian Gulf war, and Wall Street, content to weather slumps if there is low inflation and stable interest rates.
But there are other voices shouting at Mr. Bush now, as they did last week on one of his not-yet-a-candidate swings, as he lunched on macaroni and hamburger casserole with workers at a Tropicana orange juice plant in Florida.
He had just given a speech about a capital gains tax cut, I.R.A. savings accounts and "successful positioning in foreign markets." The workers, most of whom make less than $10 an hour, wanted to talk about their jobs.
They wanted to know why he opposed a bill that would ban the hiring of replacement workers during a strike and why he was so bent on a free-trade agreement with Mexico, which they feared would cost American jobs. "We talked about the homeless and he said they were trying to do something about it," said Shirley Yeck, who culls oranges from a conveyor belt. "I don't know . . ."
But even if he is able to persuade voters that he shares such concerns, simply caring may not be enough. Incumbents run on achievements, not promises.
So while the White House works on specific economic proposals for the President's State of the Union Address in late January, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who was appointed general chairman of Mr. Bush's campaign last week, said the campaign will refine an argument that Mr. Bush has tried out on the stump recently: that foreign and domestic policy are linked.
"It's an argument I think we can pretty damn near prove, not just make," Mr. Mosbacher said, "by the increase we've seen in exports, by the degree of international competitiveness that we're building, by the sales of high-tech goods, on and on, that we've built through George Bush's efforts around the world."
For better or worse, Mr. Bush has established himself as a believer in the trickle-down theory that ordinary workers will benefit, eventually, by giving tax breaks to those people with enough money to invest. And he has been arguing that if Americans will just keep their chins up, the economy will get better.
That may be reasonable enough in a macro-economic sense, but it is not the stuff of a great campaign message, especially when Mr. Bush adds the curious line he often uses to reassure voters: "We're not going to do anything dumb."
These arguments could signal workers that Mr. Bush is willing for them to suffer for the greater good and, to the discomfort of many Republicans, they smack of Herbert Hoover's politically disastrous attempts to persuade Americans that if they were simply more confident the nation's economic problems would correct themselves.
 
No More Mr. Guerrilla?
 Mr. Bush is facing decisions about tactics. He waged guerrilla warfare against Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 with racial, patriotic and law-and-order images. But slash-and-burn campaigning might not go over well from an incumbent who has spent four years painting himself as the nice guy next door, flipping hamburgers in his backyard, dandling his grandchildren on his knee.
Mr. Bush could always try changing the subject. But that can sound plaintive, as he did on Friday when he said the 6.8 percent unemployment rate for November was lower than predicted.
"Please don't go into these little details," he told reporters. "Let's look at the big picture."

A Symbol of a Different Era Collapses

BYLINE: By CARLYLE C. DOUGLAS

 BODY:
THE story of Pan American World Airways can be read in its changes of address.
A little more than a decade ago, its logo was a beacon above the heart of mid-Manhattan, topping a tower that bestrode Park Avenue. Last week, as some of its 7,500 New York employees were moving to the company's new lodgings at Miami International Airport -- the equivalent of a flat above the store -- Pan Am died broke. 
 The company, which has been laboring for nearly a year to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, ceased operating abruptly, stranding hundreds of passengers waiting to board planes at Kennedy Airport in New York, and leaving in uproar the travel plans of thousands of people who had purchased tickets for flights in the near future. With the reorganization gone by the boards, the company's assets are to be auctioned off tomorrow in bankruptcy court.
There were a couple of obvious factors in the demise of the 64-year-old airline, which once dominated international air travel. There was the current bad economic weather, which has been particularly bumpy for the travel industry. Then there was the horror of the worst of terrorist bombings, the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in 1986. Travel agents say that people asking not to fly Pan Am often cite the bombing.
But last week, some questioned whether Pan Am was given a final shove down the chute by Delta Airlines, which under an agreement reached last summer had paid $460 million for Pan Am's Northeast shuttle and some of its European routes. As part of the agreement, Delta was to provide cash to keep Pan Am flying until it was reorganized as a smaller, Caribbean-oriented airline.
The collapse was precipitated when Delta announced that the extra $115 million it had put into Pan Am so far was the limit. A lawyer for some of Pan Am's unsecured creditors suggested that Delta had planned all along to let the company die after snapping up its best assets. Delta denied it.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Refugees Match Wits With Uncle Sam

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
THE lawyers who represent Haitian refugees being held by the thousands aboard Coast Guard ships and at the United States Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay had in hand a major legal victory. Yet they had a strangely solemn look about them as they emerged from a Federal District Court in Miami last Tuesday.
The court had upheld an injunction temporarily preventing the repatriation of the mounting population of Haitians, and it had granted the refugee advocates other concessions. But the advocates knew that the Government was far from having exhausted all its weapons, and that the most important one may prove to be time -- time in which to erode the Haitians' desire to reach America and thus persuade them to return to Haiti without being forced. 
 The case began in late October, one month after a violent military coup overthrew Haiti's first democratically elected president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrant Aristide. Since then, a combination of military reprisals against Father Aristide's supporters and starkly increased economic hardships growing out of aneconomic embargo have caused nearly 6,000 Haitians to flee in overcrowded boats for the United States.
The dispute between the Government, which has been intercepting the boat people at sea, and the advocates has been over which of the refugees are fleeing poverty, an insufficient cause for asylum under American law, and which truly face persecution.
 
New Tactics
 Now, while each side prepares to go all the way to the Supreme Court to determine whether the United States is making adequate efforts to assure that no bona fide political refugees are returned to a strife-torn Haiti, Washington has quietly begun to shift its tactics on another front.
The new strategy includes increasing the capacity of the camp at Guantanamo to more than 10,000 with a view to holding the line indefinitely against significant numbers of Haitians coming into the United States.
Meanwhile, other changes like a switch from kitchen-prepared chicken, rice and beans to the bland packaged Army rations known as M.R.E.'s suggest that the Government is also trying to assure that the courts will not be the only place where it is decided who is a political refugee and who has fled for purely economic reasons.
One official, in fact, expressed confidence that the Haitians at Guantanamo will eventually become discouraged and decide to return home, thus undercutting arguments that most of the refugees face danger from political persecution at home.
The official cited the case of the Haitian boat people who had been taken to Venezuela and Honduras as part of a burden-sharing plan conceived by Washington in the early days of the five-week-old exodus. Last week, many of them asked to return to their country rather than endure the uncertainty and isolation of the camps.
Now, reporters returning from Pentagon-authorized day trips to Guantanamo say small numbers of the nearly 5,000 Haitians there are beginning to make similar requests. "I can't imagine you won't begin to see more of the kinds of decisions that were made in Venezuela," said the official. "That is why it is important for the Administration not to cave in. If there is any caving in, this will just become a massive springboard to the United States."
 
Politicians Visit
 But immigration advocates have been expecting the Government to try to demoralize the would-be refugees, and they have already begun trying to counter such a strategy by encouraging visits by concerned American political and entertainment figures. This weekend, Jesse Jackson, Representative Charles B. Rangel and the filmmaker Jonathan Demme are visiting Guantanamo.
"One of our concerns right now is that these people are cut off from everything," said Cheryl Little, a lawyer for the Haitian Refugee Center of Miami, which brought the suit against the Government. "It is important not to let them feel neglected."
Ms. Little also expressed concern that as Christmas approaches, relations between the troops at Guantanamo and the refugees they are guarding could deteriorate "when the members of the Army realize they are not home with their families because of the Haitians."
Despite a strongly worded decision in the refugee advocates' favor by C. Clyde Atkins, a Federal district judge in Miami, both sides say the legal odds in the case will increasingly tilt in the Government's favor as it works its way through appeals.
Judge Atkins's decison, which barred the forced return of refugees until a more thorough screening procedure could be devised, was based largely on a United Nations protocol on refugees, rather than on American statutes. Officials involved in the case expressed confidence that eventually an appellate court will rule that such protocols are not binding.
But just as the Justice Department and Pentagon have shifted their tactics in the battle over the fate of the Haitian refugees, the advocates for the boat people have also laid contingency plans. These focus on taking the debate from the courts into the perhaps more sympathetic arenas of world opinion and domestic politics.
"U.S. courts are unduly nervous in founding decisions on international law relating to the human rights of refugees," Arthur C. Helton, an immigration expert with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said in a telephone conversation from Geneva, where he was campaigning for foreign support for the refugees.
Already, he said, the United States has come under international criticism for its handling of the Haitians. Citing the visits of Mr. Rangel and others and growing interest from other Washington politicians, Mr. Helton said, "We are winning the battle of moral outrage."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Fujimori Aims for a Head-on Collision With 'Shining Path'

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
PERU'S President and Peru's Maoist rebels appear to be on course for a major confrontation in 1992.
Marshaling the forces on one side is Alberto K. Fujimori, the mild-mannered university president who after becoming Peru's president 16 months ago suddenly worked Latin America's most rapid and most radical free market revolution. Last month, the determined leader turned from economics to counterinsurgency and issued a blizzard of decrees intended to give Peru's army a free hand in fighting terrorism. On a recent visit to California, Mr. Fujimori predicted that Peru would be pacified by the end of his term, in 1995. His advisers say by the end of 1993. 
 On the other side is the Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, the Maoist guerrilla group that took advantage of vacillating Peruvian presidents in the 1980's to spread terror into every region of this country. Convinced that a worker-peasant state dominated by an Indian and mixed-race power base will be achieved by the end of the decade, Luis Arce Borja, the movement's European spokesman, predicted recently to Lima's Expreso newspaper, "Nothing will stop the triumphal march of the Shining Path."
Gustavo Gorriti, a Peruvian journalist writing a history of the rebels, believes that "1992 is going to be much more violent, because we now have two locomotives running toward each other on the same track."
"Fujimori believes he is going to pacify the nation in two years," Mr. Gorriti said. "Sendero believes they are going to win in this decade. The meeting of these two radical convictions are going to produce greater violence."
In the clash, two issues of concern to Americans may be lost in the dust: human rights and cocaine interdiction.
On human rights, Mr. Fujimori often speaks with two voices. To win American aid before a September visit to the White House, he ordered police and military commanders to open bases to Red Cross visits and told the military to stop making terrorist suspects "disappear."
But addressing military audiences at home, he later attacked human-rights groups as "legal arms of subversion" and "useful fools" manipulated by terrorists. After Amnesty International charged that 250 people had "disappeared" since Mr. Fujimori took office, the President blasted back in a late November speech before air force officers: "The terrorists present themselves as victims before the world, using for their ends the efforts of institutions like Amnesty International and Americas Watch."
This fall, stung by earlier charges that their reporting had been one-sided, both human rights groups condemned many atrocities committed by the Shining Path who, to drive any other authority out of areas they control, have killed clergy, foreign aid workers and even housewives running slum soup kitchens.
But, noting that three human rights activists have been killed since 1989, the groups say the president's verbal attacks endanger them too.
The fight against the export of semi-refined cocaine also seems to be a low priority. The underpaid police are seizing coca base and paste at rates half those of last year. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration has had little success persuading the government to shut down air taxi companies that fly cocaine.
Many Peruvians believe that the Shining Path is a far greater threat than cocaine and that the focus of American aid should be the defense of Peru's democracy. Low salaries and poor equipment add up to low morale: Peru's army loses one officer a day to civilian jobs. This week, Hector Jhon Caro was dismissed as head of Peru's anti-terrorism police because 16 subordinates allegedly stole a $23,000 agency payroll.
The cost of Peru's "Fuji-shock" -- Mr. Fujimori's abrupt adoption of free market policies and reintegration into the world financial community -- has been greater poverty, and better Shining Path recruiting conditions.
"Schoolteachers' children are not eating three meals any more, tuberculosis is up, real malnutrition is up," said an American priest driving through a Lima shantytown daubed with Senderista graffiti: "Fujimori = Genocide."
A rise to power by the brutal Shining Path could destabilize the region the same way the ascendance of radical Shiites did in Iran in the 1970's. Believing their movement "a beacon for world revolution," Shining Path leaders hope to export Marxist revolt to Bolivia and Ecuador.
"Peruvian democracy is a conquest of the people, and the Shining Path seeks to destroy this democracy," said Carlos Tapia, a sociologist affiliated with the Socialist Left party. "But the political parties tell the military 'kill them quick, so we won't have to get our hands dirty.' "
So far, Peru's feuding politicians show little interest in forming a common front.
"Alan inocente, Alan presidente," supporters of Alan Garcia Perez chanted this week on learning that a supreme court judge had decided not to open a trial on embezzlement charges against the former president . The judge, an appointee of the former president, taught Mr. Garcia geography in high school. During Mr. Garcia's five years in office, Peru had 2 million percent inflation, but the 42-year-old politician is seen as a leading contender in the 1995 presidential race.
However, popular support for Mr. Fujimori is strong. A mid-November poll gave him a 58 percent approval rating; one among business executives gave him an even higher approval rate -- 95 percent. "Fujimori is our first president to get into the saddle on the terrorism issue," said an industrialist here, unconsciously using an image long associated with Latin American authoritarianism -- the man on horseback.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Pearl Harbor's Smoke, Hiroshima's Fallout

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
THE torrent of retrospectives on Pearl Harbor in the last few weeks shows how history continues to cloud the way the world's two most important economic powers see and treat each other.
For all the ways the United States and Japan have drawn closer together -- in political cooperation, economic interdependence, the exchange of rock 'n' roll and sushi -- there remains a troubling symmetry between the emotions surrounding Pearl Harbor and today. 
 In the United States, the images of Japan as sneaky, threatening and unfair that were flash-frozen by Pearl Harbor resurface now in talk of Japanese as samurai in business suits, out to do economically what they could not militarily. In Japan, where any sense of responsibility for the aggression of Pearl Harbor is dwarfed by the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, America now seems more like the decadent superpower once portrayed in Japanese wartime propaganda.
To some extent, both countries remain trapped by history and their selective memories. In the United States, for example, the sense of treachery at Pearl Harbor and the racist wartime depictions of Japanesecontinue to resonate today.
While wartime denunciations of Germany tended to focus on Hitler and always left open the idea of the "good German," anti-Japanese propaganda tarred all Japanese as subhuman or fanatical, according to John W. Dower, professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who studied such images for his book, "War Without Mercy." One cartoon comparing Nazi atrocities in Czechoslovakia with Japanese massacres in the Philippines showed Hitler standing over Czechoslovakia and a gorilla with Japanese features in the Philippines. Professor Dower finds traces of those attitudes in present-day portrayals of Japan's economic triumphs -- as in the headlines shouting, "Japan Invades Hollywood."
"We don't do slavering monsters, we do the sumo wrestler," he said. "Although these images are much more benign on the surface than the old ones, it is again the idea of the superman and of someone who doesn't play by the same rules."
Many Japanese still believe racism motivates much American behavior toward Japan, from the internment of Japanese-Americans during the war to the decision to drop the bomb. And many see the United States as particularly threatened by Japan's ascent because Japan is the first nonwhite economic superpower.
Cries of racism, however, can also be disingenuous in light of legitimate concerns about Japanese business practices. "That these images persist may have less to do with American racism, which, like Japanese racism, is abundant, than with the way Japan has prosecuted its postwar economy," said Richard J. Samuels, a professor of political science at M.I.T.
But Japan is no freer from historical distortions. The overriding lesson Japanese learned is that war brought them suffering, not that war made them do reprehensible things. In six years of living in Japan, this reporter frequently heard a proverb in response to questions about the war: "Let the past flow away like the river." In pursuit of forgetfulness, Japan's Government has allowed textbooks to be increasingly sanitized -- in just one infamous example, the invasion of China was called an "advance." An outspoken group of revisionist historians and politicians are even justifying Japan's conduct during the war, arguing that Japanese rule freed Asian nations from Western colonial domination, and maintaining that accounts of Japanese atrocities were exaggerated.
In the 1930's, as now, there were intense economic frictions. Japan saw itself a victim of protectionist policies triggered by a worldwide depression. Militarist leaders decided Japan would win by force raw materials it was denied through trade. Japan annexed Manchuria, invaded China, and drove into French Indochina. The United States issued an ever-tougher series of sanctions, which culminated in the summer of 1941 with measures that essentially cut off 80 percent of Japan's oil supplies. What Americans saw as principled protests against Japanese aggression in Asia, Japanese saw as a tightening economic vise. Pearl Harbor, to many, was an act of war, not of treachery, by a nation pushed to the brink.
Some Japanese intellectuals have long labored to raise public consciousness about the war, and 114 of them recently called for the uncensored teaching of history and an apology for Japan's brutality in Asia. Although such a resolution is before Japan's Parliament, President Bush's refusal last week to apologize for dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki made action on any such apology remote. Mr. Bush's comments stirred considerable anger in Japan, where the atomic bomb is seen as a war atrocity that effectively wipes the slate clean.
Indeed, most Japanese have failed to grapple with the question of individual responsibility for wartime acts and policies.
"Japanese history is dominated by the sense that the state dominated," said Carol Gluck, a professor of history at Columbia University who is writing a book about Japanese public memory of the war. "Japanese haven't faced up to the responsibility, complicity, incrimination of all of us in total war."
World War II not only shrouds Japan's past, but hovers over its present. Japanese aversion to war has become so deep that it nettles the very Americans who wrote the idea of renouncing war into Japan's postwar Constitution. Strong Japanese opposition to the Persian Gulf war and reluctance to dispatch military forces abroad even to play non-military support roles in United Nations peacekeeping efforts have angered Japan's Western allies.
These lingering sensitivities for Japanese, and the continuing wariness of Japan's Asian neighbors and former colonies, have hampered efforts to define a new world role for Japan commensurate with its economic might. Other than economic prosperity, Japanese shy away from preaching any political philosophy.
By contrast, memories of World War II continue to imbue Americans with a sense of strength and rectitude. Compared with those in most other countries, "Americans came out thinking this was a good war," Professor Dower said. "We were supremely confident in our future and our righteousness."
This legacy of the war is one thing that makes it difficult for the United States to confront weaknesses that some Americans and most Japanese believe are eroding America's relative world power. While the United States remains mired in a recession, there is little public discussion of the link between the economic malaise and the country's low savings rate, accumulation of debt, or failure to invest nearly as much as Japan in research and development.
"There is a huge denial in the U.S.," said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a former trade negotiator with Japan. "People want to believe that everything is O.K."
The war also encouraged a persistent American ethnocentrism. Even as images persisted of Japanese as sneaky, Americans needed to see their new postwar allies against Communism in a different light -- as a people who wanted to become more like Americans. A growing number of scholars, journalists and economists assert that this belief has blinded Americans to the fact that Japan's economy, in particular, is guided by fundamentally different rules and assumptions.
That argument remains hotly contested, but the debate makes clear that many people assume that a close alliance is possible only if nations are similar. "Different" means treacherous, alien or hostile.
"If you openly say the Japanese system is different, people say you will wreck the relationship," Mr. Prestowitz said. "It's precisely this insistence on similarity when no similarity exists which is making it impossible to deal effectively with the sources of friction between us."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
If Israel and the Arabs Can Pencil Each Other In

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHILE Israelis and Arabs were demonstrating last week that old habits die hard, there were two intriguing notes in their posturing over negotiations in Washington: nobody packed his bags and Americans seemed not to care.
The United States had invited Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians to Washington to resume the peace talks begun last month in Madrid. The meeting was originally called for Wednesday, but Israel, which for decades had said it would meet Arabs for peace talks any time, anywhere, decided to reject that date to protest Washington's unilateral invitation to the parties to meet in America rather than in the Middle East. 
 The Palestinians and other Arabs then returned the truculence; they said they were reluctant to meet on the day Israel suggested -- tomorrow -- because that is the fourth anniversary of the Palestinian uprising and it may be more important to commemorate it than to talk peace with the Israelis. Nevertheless, by last Friday, it appeared that the parties were likely to find a mutually agreeable date some time in the coming week.
This wrangling, though, is a reminder that the closer you follow these peace talks, the more confused you become. The best way to follow them may be to tune in once every few months (or years), because only in a long time frame can any real progress be measured.
After all, what really happened in Madrid? Stripped of the hoopla, what occurred was that 13 years after the Camp David peace process was launched, four parties that opposed it -- Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, along with Syria, Jordan and the Palestinians -- finally accepted it. That was not insignificant, since Camp David remains the only agreed framework for Arab-Israeli talks. But it may take another 13 years to reach firm agreements. Still, the important things to keep an eye on are not the procedural wrangles that will develop along the way. Better to watch the larger forces that brought these parties to accept something they would never have accepted before, and whatever else will be required to translate that acceptance into peace accords.
Neither Israel nor the Arabs turned up in Madrid by accident. All went because pressures growing out of the end of the cold war and the outcome of the gulf war made it impossible to say no to the American invitation: The Syrians have lost their Soviet patrons and need a relationship with Washington; the Israelis are besieged with Soviet immigrants and more in need of American aid than ever; the Palestinians and Jordanians, isolated and impoverished because they supported Iraq, are grasping for a lifeboat.
 
History's Lessons
 The central question is whether the external pressures and inducements are enough only to bring the parties to the table, or whether they will also prove sufficient to get them to sign agreements. If history is any guide, external pressure alone is necessary to produce Arab-Israeli agreements, but not sufficient.
One lesson of the Egyptian-Israeli treaty signed in 1979 is that only by triggering internal changes within the respective parties, motivating them to act on their own for peace, will concrete agreements be possible. Madrid has not triggered much change within the parties, except among the Palestinians, whose new messengers and more moderate message are now acceptable to a significant portion of the Israeli public. The state-run Syrian media, by contrast, still has not told its people that their own troops fought alongside America in the gulf war, let alone why their leaders have reversed four decades of policy and entered direct peace talks with Israel.
At the same time, Mr. Shamir has refused to acknowledge that the principle on which he initially rejected the Camp David formula is no longer viable: that Israel can indefinitely keep control of the West Bank without ceding anything at all to the Palestinians there.
These oversights are not accidental. Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, knows that once he acknowledges that change is afoot in relations with Israel, the Syrian people will ask for a lot of other changes in their lives too. And Mr. Shamir is afraid that if he offers the Palestinians a softer version of occupation he will inadvertently create a domestic constituency for the territorial compromise he still opposes.
The other sign that the parties are getting serious will come when they don't just talk to one another across a table in order to please the Americans, but when they talk to one another's publics in order to persuade them that they are sincere. There is something absurd about Palestinians, who talk to Israelis every day in Israel, refusing to speak with Israeli officials in Washington except in formal negotiating sessions. Do the Syrians really expect to get the Golan Heights back by doing less than what Anwar el-Sadat did in 1977 to get the Sinai back -- appeal directly to the Israeli people with a grand gesture?
But there was some good news last week; nothing might better get Arabs and Israelis to really start talking to one another, rather than to the Americans, than noticing where major American newspapers put the news of the absent peace talks last week: See page A39.
Arabs and Israelis alike might well find a message in the silence with which their bickering was received in America, which is preoccupied with its own domestic troubles, fascinated by the Palm Beach rape trial and, in the post-cold war world, rather bored with the Arab-Israeli feud. Recognizing this new reality could be the beginning of wisdom for all the parties, for it might strip the Arabs of any illusion that Washington will make peace on their behalf, and the Israelis of any illusion that after the cold war they remain a strategic asset so valuable to Washington that it will always extend massive economic aid irrespective of how Israel deals with the Arabs, or of competing interests that may arise.

HEADLINE: Rochester Schools Ban Military Recruiters

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Students in city schools will no longer get a pitch to join the Army on their way to the cafeteria.
The city school district board last week voted to ban military recruiters from its schools because of the Department of Defense's policy against enlisting gay and lesbian recruits. 
 The city schools are believed to be the first district in the country to prohibit military recruiters, according to the Department of Defense and the National School Boards Association.
"We realize this is just a little policy by a little school district and it isn't going to change the stance of the Defense Department," said a board member, Karen Grella. "But I think it sends a message that we don't support discrimination of any kind."
But military recruiters say the result may be fewer opportunities for the district's low income students.
 
'A Lot to Offer'
 "We offer students another avenue of opportunity," said Army Capt. Richard Threatt, who oversees Army recruiting in western New York. "We have a lot to offer and now I'm concerned some students may not have full access to it."
The board on Thursday voted 5-to-2 for the change, which prohibits recruiters from any organization that has "a stated policy which discriminates."
The board had been thinking about the change for more than a year.
Mrs. Grella said the presence of military recruiters undermined the school system's own policy against discrimination.
"How would it look to our students if we said discrimination is wrong, but in the military's case it's O.K.," she said.
Two school board members, Michael Fernandez and Frank Willis, who voted against the measure said they feared it would take economic opportunities away from some students.
But supporters, including the board's president, Catherine Spoto, poInt to a provision that will continue to allow school counselors to disseminate information about the armed forces, including how to contact recruiters off campus.
Captain Threatt, however, said that eligibility guidelines frequently change as do some benefits, and counselors may be hard pressed to keep up on top of their other duties.
 
No Plans to Change Policy
 "It won't hurt us," he said. "We will still get quality personnel from the Rochester area."
James Turner, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, said the department has no plans to change its policy on lesbians and gay men.

HEADLINE: Germans Follow Own Line on Yugoslav Republics

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's promise to recognize the independence of Slovenia and Croatia before Christmas has provoked a split among Western allies and has led Bonn into an unusual conflict with Washington.
The Presidents of the two breakaway Yugoslav republics visited Germany this week, and Mr. Kohl told both of them of his decision to recognize their republics as sovereign nations. Several other countries, including Sweden, Italy, Austria and Hungary, are likely to follow Germany's lead. 
 Mr. Kohl had previously maintained that his Government would recognize Slovenia and Croatia only if the entire European Community did so. He changed his position when it became clear that some members of the community opposed quick recognition.
French officials have criticized Germany for its willingness to recognize the two republics without further discussions about borders, human rights and other matters.
 
'Prejudicial for Europe'
 "We are striving to make our partners understand, starting with Germany, that it would be prejudicial for Europe as a whole," the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, said on Friday. "The attitude of unilateral recognition could be damaging for the community."
The French position, which is largely shared by Britain and the United States, is that recognition of Croatia and Slovenia should come only as part of an overall peace agreement.
American officials have said they oppose quick recognition because they fear that it would encourage other Yugoslav republics to press for independence, and perhaps also set an example for secession-minded provinces in other parts of Europe.
The United States has imposed economic sanctions against all six Yugoslav republics, hoping to force all of them to make concessions, while German sanctions apply only to Serbia and its ally Montenegro.
 
'Aggression Against Croatia'
 President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who was in Bonn on Friday, said he was amazed by the American position. "Taken objectively, that equals support for the aggression against Croatia, support for this barbaric war that is unparalleled in the world today," Mr. Tudjman said.
For a time, debate over Yugoslavia threatened to overshadow other topics to be discussed at the European Community summit meeting next week in the Netherlands. The issue is still likely to be discussed there, but government leaders have agreed to leave final decisions to a meeting of foreign ministers on Dec. 16.
At the heart of the dispute are two opposing perceptions of the Yugoslav conflict. American, French and British officials view it as a civil war between rival ethnic factions, while Germans and those who support their view see it as an attack by Serbian Communists on peaceful people whose only crime has been to vote democratically in favor of independence.
 
Historical Ties
 Germany has long historical ties, both glorious and shameful, to Slovenia and Croatia. Slovenia was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and many people there still identify with the German-speaking world. There has also been German influence in Croatia, and during World War II, Croatia was ruled by a pro-Nazi regime.
This aspect of Croatian history, and the fact that the Tudjman Government has refused to disassociate itself from the Croatian fascists who ruled the republic in the 1940's, has made European leaders unwilling to move quickly toward recognition.
German public opinion is strongly pro-Croatian and anti-Serbian. Newspaper cartoons portray Serbia as a giant brute attacking helpless victims, and campaigns to raise funds for Croatia have been quite successful.
But the enthusiasm in Germany has convinced some Europeans that its ultimate goal is to rebuild a sphere of influence that could stretch across the continent from Tallinn in Estonia to Zagreb in Croatia.
 
Plans for Embassies
 When European foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Dec. 16, it appears unlikely that they will reach a consensus, which would most likely lead Germany and its supporters to act by themselves.
Officials in Bonn are already making plans to open embassies in the Slovenian and Croatian capitals and to fashion aid packages for both republics. Germany is not considered likely to supply them with weapons, but the fact that they will have a measure of international legitimacy would make it easier for others to do so.
 
 
 
SPORADIC FIGHTING IN CROATIA
 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 7 (Reuters) -- The Yugoslav Army and Croatian forces fought sporadic battles in the breakaway republic of Croatia today.
Both sides said fighting was heavy around the central Croatian towns of Lipik and Pakrac but gave no details. The Croatian radio said three people were killed in an army attack overnight on the central town of Sisak.
On Friday, the Croatian radio said, 19 people were killed and 60 wounded in an attack on Dubrovnik that shattered a two-week-old cease-fire there.
A spokesman for European Community observers in Croatia said that the mission had lodged a protest with the army over the attack and that military would investigate the attack. The Yugoslav Army "promised a full investigation later," the spokesman, Ed Koestal, said. "A statement of regret and apparent intent to discipline certain people was received."
The Croatian radio said Dubrovnik was briefly shelled again today but reported no new damage.
The special United Nations envoy to Yugoslavia, Cyrus R. Vance, is seeking to arrange for the dispatch of United Nations peacekeeping troops to Croatia, but has warned that the force will not be sent unless a truce holds..
The fighting on Friday was the worst in weeks in a conflict that has killed thousands of people since Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia in June 25.

HEADLINE: Only Free Commonwealth Will Survive, Yeltsin Says

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Hours before the beginning of crucial talks among Russia, Byelorussia and Ukraine, the Russian republic's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, said today that only a commonwealth of fully independent countries -- not the confederation envisioned by the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- could emerge from the old union.
The idea of a union of sovereign states delegating some responsibilities to a central authority is dead, Mr. Yeltsin told members of the Byelorussian Parliament in the republic's capital, Minsk. 
 He said that even a looser commonwealth would probably be doomed without Ukraine, the second-largest republic, which last weekend voted to become independent.
"Ukraine is a powerful state," Mr. Yeltsin said, "and without its participation, not only will the configuration of any commonwealth change, but above all, the balance of interests, the economic potential and the political prospects of its members."
 
Yeltsin to Offer Alternatiives
 He added that Russia would propose several alternatives for a new community of states during the weekend's talks, which began in the Byelorussian city of Brest tonight.
In remarks made at the Minsk airport as he arrived for the talks,Leonid M. Kravchuk, the Ukrainian President, echoed Mr. Yeltsin's remarks on the fate of the union. "You can persuade Kravchuk, but you cannot persuade the Ukrainian people,' he said. "The old Soviet Union is doomed."
Last weekend, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly to break loose from Moscow. Still, despite this enormous setback, Mr. Gorbachev continues to be a tireless advocate of union, using every meeting and television appearance as a platform to warn of the disaster that will occur if the union dies.
The continuing disintegration has raised alarms here of a hard-line backlash, a fear heightened today by reports that Mr. Gorbachev had accepted the resignation of Gen. Vladimir Lobov, chief of staff of the armed forces.
According to the independent news agency Interfax, General Lobov, replaced by Gen. Viktor Samsonov, former commander of the Leningrad military district, resigned after Ukraine's vote to withdraw from the union called into question "the continued existence of a united military in the Soviet Union."
 
New Coup Fears
 Mr. Gorbachev and others have recently talked about the possibility of another coup attempt, perhaps involving the military and the old Communist Party apparatus, and most likely set off by popular protests against high prices and food shortages.
Today, in a meeting with American businessmen, the Soviet President reaffirmed his commitment to preserving the union. "I will take active efforts and reach out to the masses if necessary," Mr. Gorbachev said.
But his authority is slipping fast, as the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia meet without him this weekend at a Government villa outside Brest to sort out the future shape of the Slavic heartland.
Mr. Gorbachev said today that he pinned high hopes on the "Slavic summit," but as Mr. Yeltsin's remarks suggest, no outcome is likely to advance the cause of a larger political union.
"The participants in these talks are becoming fewer and fewer," Mr. Yeltsin said. "If it continues like this, there will be nobody around the table at all. Today, we see the failure of the idea of a half-federation, half-confederation, that would implicitly bind each state under a system of dual power."
 
Slavs and Muslims
 Without Ukraine, Russia would be left in a union made up mostly of Central Asian states, which have a different culture, religion and economic base than the Slavs. But if Ukraine chose to be a member of a reformed commonwealth, then a balance would be maintained between Slavs and Muslims, with the republic of Kazakhstan, which has a large Russian population, playing a key role.
On Monday, the Presidents of the three Slavic republics will meet in Moscow with Mr. Gorbachev and Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the Kazakh President.
The Slavic republics, though they share deep historic and cultural roots, are divided over important questions involving the transition to a market economy.
Russia's plans to liberalize prices this month worry its neighbors, who fear that scarce goods will pour across the border as sellers seek higher prices. And Russia is concerned about the dumping of rubles on its territory, as neighboring republics -- Ukraine in particular -- move toward creating their own currencies.
 
Accord Must Be Practical
 Mr. Yeltsin said that he expected the three would be able to iron out their differences, "as long as we do not ask the impossible of each other." Otherwise, he said, "any treaty, however correct, may just turn into another piece of paper.
"In the critical sphere of finances and currency," Mr. Yeltsin pledged that Russia would refrain from unilateral actions, "as long as it is not provoked by other republics," the Soviet press agency Tass quoted him as saying.
"An exceptionally complex situation has formed on the territory of the ex-Soviet Union," he said. "Therefore, it is important now to look for points of interaction with the sovereign republics rather than to panic."
Most republics have signed two-party treaties over recent months to guarantee continued trade links. Seven republics, including Ukraine and Byelorussia, signed an agreement fixing ceilings on certain food items that will continue to be subsidized under any new price plan.

HEADLINE: SENATORS ASK BAR TO AID TO AMMAN

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is seeking to block $45 million in American military assistance to Jordan for suspected violations of the international trade embargo against Iraq.
Most of the more than 3,000 tons of goods flowing into Iraq daily by truck from Jordan are food, medical supplies and other humanitarian aid permitted under the United Nations guidelines, Bush Administration officials say. These totals are just a fraction of daily consumption before the Persian Gulf war. 
 But Baghdad is also importing from Jordan communications equipment and spare parts for oil refineries, water treatment plants and electrical power generators, Administration officials said. Reporters traveling into the country along the only open highway saw goods prohibited under the embargo being trucked into Iraq, including newsprint, tractors, tires and crates of machinery that could not be identified.
Iraq is using cash reserves, some secret foreign loans and newly unfrozen assets in foreign banks to pay for the goods, which so far include very little, if any, military equipment, Administration officials said.
 
'Insignificant Leakage'
 The illicit imports represent "relatively insignificant leakage" that does not seriously weaken the embargo's bite, Administration officials said. Without oil revenue, Iraq is unable to support large-scale smuggling and the Administration believes that preventing Baghdad from selling oil for more than a year has had a devastating effect on the country's economy.
Senior American officials concede that they are reluctant to press King Hussein of Jordan, who is struggling to manage his country's feeble economy, particularly as the United States tries to broker a Middle East peace agreement.
"It's a hard balancing act to see how much pressure we can bring to bear without hurting him politically," said a senior Defense Department official.
To punish Amman for its tilt toward Iraq in the gulf war, Congress earlier this year blocked an Administration request for aid to Jordan. The legislation had a provision that allowed President Bush to restore the aid if he determined that Amman was helping the Middle East peace process. Mr. Bush invoked the clause in July for economic aid and last month for military aid, prompting the latest Congressional protest.
 
Barrier Is Built
 A spokesman for the Jordanian Embassy in Washington, Timoor Daghistani, said that Amman was "abiding by the letter of the sanctions." He said that Jordan had built a six-foot-high dirt barrier along the length of its eastern border with Iraq to discourage smuggling, and had increased army desert patrols.
Administration and Congressional officials said that some smuggling was also taking place along Iraq's borders with Iran, Turkey and Syria, but that these were very small operations.
Several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees American assistance, have raised concerns that military aid to Jordan should be suspended until Washington is satisfied that Amman is not breaking the embargo.
"There are substantial grounds to question whether Jordan is and will comply fully with the U.N. sanctions," said Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, in a letter sent last month to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
"I believe Jordan should be in full compliance with all international sanctions against Iraq before we resume military assistance," Mr. Pell wrote.
A State Department official said the agency was preparing a response to Mr. Pell's letter, but declined to give any details. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, defended resuming military aid to Jordan as a way to insure political stability in the current Government.
 
Bush's Stance
 President Bush released about $35 million in economic assistance in July, and in October sent a letter to Congress saying he was pleased with Jordan's cooperation in the peace process, and would move to release $20 million in military aid and $2 million for training. In addition, the Administration has proposed sending $57 million in aid for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, including $25 million for military assistance.
In his letter, Mr. Pell raised questions that Jordan may be serving as a conduit for exporting Iraqi sulfur, refined oil products, trucks and earth-moving equipment. Iraq may also be importing steel and communications equipment from Jordan, the letter said.
Iraq cannot sell its main export, oil, on the world market except for about 55,000 barrels a day to Jordan, which the United Nations tacitly approves to offset Iraq's prewar debt to Amman, Administration officials say.
A State Department official said that Jordan stopped exporting Iraqi sulfur and other goods, after Washington protested. Five American, British and Australian ships continue to inspect foreign vessels sailing into the Red Sea port of Aqaba. But there are no inspectors checking the 200 to 300 trucks that cross into Iraq on the main highway from Jordan every day.
Members of Iraq's Republican Guard have reportedly been given three pay raises since the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, insulating them to some extent from the pinch. There are no clear signs that the sanctions will topple President Saddam Hussein anytime soon.

HEADLINE: PEARL HARBOR REMEMBERED;
Bush, in Breaking Voice, Recalls Day of 'Infamy'

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Sniffling a bit and trying to hold back his emotion behind a lopsided smile, George Bush grasped the hand of Lewis Robinson.
"Nice to see you," the President said to the architect from Solana Beach, Calif. "What were you doing that day?" 
 Mr. Robinson, who was wearing a cap and name tag identifying him as a survivor of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, was a seaman first class on the battleship Arizona. The ship became a watery morgue for 1,177 sailors when she was sunk in the Japanese attack that sleepy Sunday morning 50 years ago.
"I was on liberty, trying to get back to the ship," Mr. Robinson told Mr. Bush, who was shot down by the Japanese as he was flying a torpedo bomber named Barbara in the South Pacific in 1944.
The two World War II Navy veterans were standing on the white crescent-shaped Navy memorial that arches above the sunken Arizona, with her rusting gun turret still sticking above the water in the harbor.
 
Emotional Time for Bush
 Only moments earlier, after observing a moment of silence at 7:55 A.M., the moment the attack began, the President had become teary as he finished a speech honoring the dead sailors of the Arizona. He had stopped for a moment, trying to regain his composure by fiddling with his note cards. But his voice broke as he finished the last line of the speech: "God bless America -- the most wondrous land on earth."
President Bush, who shies from personal and emotional content in his public remarks, had told his writers not to fill his three speeches today with personal memories about the day in 1944 when, as a 20-year-old pilot, his plane was shot down over the Chichishima Islands with the loss of his two crewmen. Mr. Bush bailed out, then had to paddle a raft for two hours with his hands, avoiding Japanese patrol boats, before his rescue by an American submarine.
He did recall a bit about the Pearl Harbor attack that persuaded him, when he was a student at Andover, to join the Navy.
"I remember exactly when I first heard the news about Pearl Harbor -- as I'm sure all of you do, too," he told a group of veterans and their families in a speech on the pier in Honolulu.
"I was 17 years old, walking across the green at school," he said. "My thoughts in those days didn't turn to world events, but mainly to simpler things: making the basketball team, entering college. That walk across campus marked an end of innocence for me.
"Like all American kids back then, I was swept up in it. I decided that very day to go into the Navy to become a Navy pilot. And so, on my 18th birthday -- June 12th, 1942 -- I was sworn into the Navy as a seaman second class."
 
Time to Forget Rancor
 Mr. Bush had set a difficult task for himself today. He wanted to give proper due to "the day of infamy," as he called it, paraphrasing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's memorable phrase. But he also wanted to strike a note that it was time to leave the "rancor" about the Japanese behind and move ahead with the Japanese as allies.
For many of the survivors of Pearl Harbor, it was a hard message to swallow.
"The shooting war is over, but the economic war has begun," said Mr. Robinson, after meeting the President.
Asked if he was happy that Mr. Bush had not apologized to Japan about dropping the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Mr. Robinson said: "Darn right. I would have been disappointed if he had."
But Mr. Bush was determined to use the day to talk about healing and to preach that the lesson of Pearl Harbor is that the United States should never succumb to isolationist tendencies.
 
Thanks to Japanese Leader
 In his final speech on the pier today, the President thanked the Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, for his statement about Japan's "responsibility" in starting the war.
"Much appreciated by the people of the United States of America," Mr. Bush said, describing it as "a thoughtful gesture."
Mr. Bush said that his reaction to returning to Pearl Harbor was a generous one, and he urged the other veterans to feel the same.
"I have no rancor in my heart towards Germany or Japan -- none at all," he said. "I hope you have none in yours. There is no time for recrimination.
"No, just speaking for one guy, I have no rancor in my heart. "I can still see the faces of the fallen comrades, and I'll bet you can see the faces of your fallen comrades, too, or family members.
"But don't you think they're saying, 'Fifty years have passed; our country is the undisputed leader of the free world, and we are at peace?'
"Don't you think each one is saying, 'I did not die in vain?' "

Excerpts of Bush Speech at Ceremony

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's address today to World War II veterans and military families on the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, as provided by News Transcripts Inc., a private transcription company. 
 Over 2,000 men died in a matter of minutes on this site a half a century ago. Many more died that same day as Japanese forces assaulted the Philippines and Guam and Wake Island, Midway, Malaya, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong. On that day of infamy, Pearl Harbor propelled each of us into a titanic contest for mankind's future. It galvanized the American spirit as never, ever before into a single-minded resolve that could produce only one thing, victory.
Churchill knew it as soon as he heard the news. He'd faced the Nazi conquest of Europe, the blitz of London, the terror of the U-boats. But when America was attacked, he declared there was no more doubt about the end. He knew then that the American spirit would not fail the cause of freedom.
The enemy mistook our diversity, our nation's diversity, for weakness. But Pearl Harbor became a rallying cry for men and women from all walks of life, all colors and creeds. And in the end, this unity of purpose made us invincible in war and now makes us secure in peace.
 
. . .
 Ironically, isolationists gathered together at what was known in those days as an American First rally in Pittsburgh at precisely the moment the first Americans met early violent deaths right here at Pearl Harbor.
The isolationists failed to see that the seeds of Pearl Harbor were sown back in 1919 when a victorious America decided that in the absence of a threatening enemy abroad we should turn all of our energies inward. That notion of isolationism flew escort for the very bombers that attacked our men 50 years ago.
 
. . .
 And now we stand triumphant for the third time this century, this time in the wake of the cold war. As in 1919 and in 1945, we face no enemy menacing our security. And yet we stand here today on the site of a tragedy spawned by isolationism. And it is here, and we must learn and this time avoid the dangers of today's isolationism and its economic accomplice, protectionism. To do otherwise, to believe that turning our backs on the world would improve our lot here at home is to ignore the tragic lessons of the 20th century. The fact is, this country has enjoyed its most lasting growth and security when we rejected isolationism, both political and economic, in favor of engagement and leadership.
 
. . .
 Fifty years ago we paid a heavy price for complacency and over-confidence. That, too, is a lesson we shall never forget. To those who have defended our country, from the shores of Guadalcanal to the hills of Korea, and the jungles of Vietnam to the sands of Kuwait, I say this: We will always remember. We will always be prepared -- prepared to take on aggression, prepared to step forward in reconciliation and prepared to secure the peace.
In remembering, it is important to come to grips with the past. No nation can fully understand itself or find its place in the world, if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories -- and disgraces, too -- of the past.
We in the United States acknowledge such an injustice in our own history. The internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry was a great injustice, and it will never be repeated.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
A Bush Campaign Chief Who Knows Questions

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Robert M. Teeter, the poll taker chosen Thursday to run President Bush's re-election campaign, knows what proportion of Americans favor the death penalty and how many voters think the country is in recession.
But do not expect him to lead the 1992 Bush campaign to focus on any abstract discussion of issues, with the candidate artfully trying to take the same positions that polls indicate are held by the American public. 
 Mr. Teeter himself works comfortably with candidates who hold many sorts of views. Describing an inclination that guides his own campaign advice, he says he has always made decisions about politicians on the basis of character and dedication rather than issues.
 
'Wiser Than the Pundits'
 "I don't think that's unique with me," he said in a telephone interview. "I think that's true of the voters. They are much wiser than the pundits who always bemoan the lack of issue voting. The voters really often have little idea of what the toughest problems will be, and they don't want to pay attention to every little nuance.
"They don't line up eight issues and decide which one they line up with more. They want someone they trust to make value judgments for them."
Issues, he continued, matter most "in the sense that the issues a candidate chooses to talk about, the priorities, give people insight into just what kind of a person that candidate is."
When Mr. Teeter was beginning in Michigan politics in the 1960's, poll takers were hired by campaign managers to provide a product. It was often more mysterious than bumper stickers or even television spots, but it was still a product.
Today, this 52-year-old poll taker is in charge, but not in the sense of studying printouts to figure out what Mr. Bush should be for or against. His approach is more, as Charles Black Jr., a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, puts it, "What is the candidate for that's going to work?"
Eddie Mahe Jr., one of the party's most respected consultants, says Mr. Teeter follows that with the question, "Who can be persuaded?" Mr. Mahe calls him a superior strategist and not merely a tactician, if perhaps "a little professorial." In the campaign, he said, Mr. Teeter will be backed by Mr. Black and Richard N. Bond in providing the "street smarts."
 
'The First Job'
 Polling will contribute to the shape of this campaign, but not immediately, Mr. Teeter said. "The first job is to put together a good campaign team, get good people in all the right jobs and organize them in a way they can work together."
"The next order of business to get the state political organizations set up," a task that has become more urgent with Republican primary challenges coming from State Representative David Duke of Louisiana and probably Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist.
"Then the third thing is to sit down and think through what the fundamental message of the campaign should be," Mr. Teeter said. Of course that will involve polling, but in his view polling will hardly be dominant. With an incumbent running for re-election, he said, "the biggest single thing you have running for you is your record."
If the economy remains bad, it may be the most important issue in the campaign, Mr. Teeter said, but "you play the cards you get dealt."
The admiration expressed by Mr. Mahe and Mr. Black, who calls Mr. Teeter the "wisest strategist in the party today," is widely shared among Republicans. But some conservatives, who refused to be quoted by name, argued that he was not conservative enough nor as quick to recognize values that appeal to conservatives as he was to those that appeal to, say, suburban moderates.
And he has something of a reputation as an ineffective manager, which Fred Steeper, who has worked with him for 20 years, attributes to a sense that some problems should not be solved in a hurry.
He built Market Opinion Research, a long-established Detroit company that produced marketing and political polls in Michigan, into the dominant Republican polling concern in the nation. He sold his shares in 1987.
And Mr. Steeper is an example of a Teeter management talent that aided the company's rise. He was one of Market Opinion Research's early recruits from the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, which provided trained poll takers who then insured high methodological standards at the company.
Not an academically trained survey researcher himself, Mr. Teeter brought two major strengths to Market Opinion Research polling. One was a curiosity about the wording of questions, about how they would sound and what people would hear. "He forces me to make the question more relevant and more interesting to the respondent," Mr. Steeper said. At Market Strategies Inc., a company he helped form after he left Market Opinion Research.
Mr. Teeter's other primary strength was an ability to identify and disregard data that did not seem to make sense, not to regard polls as political Scripture. Robert D. Ray, a Teeter client who was Governor of Iowa from 1969 to 1982, said, "He can read a poll and tell you what's wrong with it, and what's wrong with the answers and what to watch out for."
Mr. Teeter's father, Howard, was active in Republican politics in Coldwater, a small town in southern Michigan for which Mr. Teeter's consulting company, Coldwater Corporation, is named, and the son became involved at 25. That was in 1964, when his father was a delegate to the convention in San Francisco that nominated Barry Goldwater for President.
Howard Teeter recalled that just before the convention his son was at loose ends on vacation from a coaching job at Adrian College in Michigan. "I arranged for him to go" to the convention and "he ends up an assistant sergeant at arms," he said.
He went on to do advance work for Gov. George Romney's re-election bid that summer, and from there he went to the Republican State Committee. By 1967 Mr. Teeter had joined Market Opinion Research.
 
Gerald Ford's Assessment
 He polled for Richard M. Nixon, but the first Presidential candidate he was close to was Gerald R. Ford, in 1976. "His polling gave us, I think, the right issues to use, not only in the pre-convention against Reagan, but in the general election against Carter," Mr. Ford said Friday.
In 1980 he worked for Mr. Bush's ill-fated campaign against Mr. Reagan.
Mr. Reagan was no favorite of Mr. Teeter, and he said in March 1980 that he would not vote for the Californian in November. But he said he did. By 1984, he was the coordinator of Mr. Reagan's television advertising.
In Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign he provided much broader advice than he would as a poll taker alone, and he suffered in silence when others said he pushed Dan Quayle for vice president. It is a subject -- because it was a decision by Mr. Bush -- that he will not discuss.
When Mr. Teeter did not join the Administration, Washington found inconceivable the explanation that he did not like the city much and that he preferred to let his teen-agers, Katy and John, finish school in Ann Arbor. The conventional explanation here was that he could not get along with John H. Sununu, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, whose influence was soaring. Mr. Teeter said that they often disagreed, but that they got along fine.
Katy is now a freshman at Princeton University, but John's hockey at Ann Arbor Pioneer High School will still draw Mr. Teeter back to Michigan. So will his cottage at Coldwater Lake, where, his wife, Betsy, says, he loves to fish for crappies. "He doesn't catch much," she said. "Well, the fishing isn't as good as it used to be."
Those trips home will become less frequent as the campaign heats up. After all, Mr. Steeper's latest numbers on a survey question that he and Mr. Teeter popularized show that only 24 percent of the public says the country is going in the right direction and 68 percent say it is pretty seriously off on the wrong track.
Mr. Teeter offers no such doubts. He calls Mr. Bush "dedicated to public service in the best sense of the word."

HEADLINE: A.N.C. Figure to Lead Communists

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Despite initial reluctance from the African National Congress, its popular military leader, Chris Hani, was named today to lead the South African Communist Party as the party mobilizes support for what it hopes will be a Marxist future for South Africa.
Chris Hani, who is chief of staff of the congress's guerrilla wing, Spear of the Nation, was elected at the Communists' four-day congress to succeed Joe Slovo as General Secretary. Mr. Slovo, who is ailing, assumed the largely honorary role of national chairman. The congress was the party's first inside South Africa in 41 years. 
 Both Mr. Hani, who is 49 years old, and Mr. Slovo, 65, are expected to remain on the African National Congress's executive committee and its inner working group. The two organizations have been allies for more than three decades and, as Mr. Hani observed today, Communists are active in the congress leadership.
Mr. Hani's election seemed likely to reinforce the Communist Party's longstanding alliance with the African National Congress while bolstering its own identity. The popular Mr. Hani, who peppers his speeches with Marxist language, is especially popular with militant black youths eager for radical solutions to the economic inequities caused by apartheid.
At the same time, the Marxist-Leninist line taken by the party -- at a time when that ideology has been discredited elsewhere in the world -- seemed likely to raise fresh questions about how the congress would justify such close ties with the Communists in soliciting foreign investment and other Western support. The party's new constitution demands an end to "capitalist exploitation" and its replacement with undiluted socialism.
 
Mandela Advised
 In July, the congress refused to let Mr. Hani work full time for the Communist Party, contending that he could not be spared. Nonethless, Mr. Hani was nominated without opposition on Friday and confirmed today as the party's General Secretary.
At a news briefing today, Mr. Slovo said the congress's leader, Nelson Mandela, who is in the United States, had been informed of Mr. Hani's new post and did not object.
Mr. Hani told reporters that he hoped to have some ties with Spear of the Nation but doubted that he could remain as its chief of staff, the top military position.
"The position of General Secretary of the S.A.C.P. is a full-time job," he said. "Obviously, I've got to spend more of my time doing party work."
Mr. Slovo said Mr. Hani would probably lead the Communist delegation to the convention of political parties on Dec. 20 that is expected to launch negotiations on ending white-minority rule.
The South African Communist Party, which says it has a membership of 25,000, sees a glowing future for the future of Marxism there.
The congress delegates, by a 3-to-1 margin, voted to eliminate the word "democratic" from a principle committing the party to establish a "democratic socialist society" in South Africa. Some delegates argued that socialism was inherently democratic. Mr. Slovo, who wanted to keep the adjective, contends that Communism failed in the Soviet Union because it was not democratic.
 
De Klerk to See Gorbachev
 The ideological gap between the South African Communists and their former patrons in the Kremlin is expected to grow even wider when President F. W. de Klerk arrives in the Soviet Union on Friday and meets President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during a four-day visit.
Mr. Hani was the party's most prestigious candidate to replace Mr. Slovo, who is battling cancer of the bone marrow and wants to concentrate on his duties with the African National Congress. There was also pressure to choose a black to replace the Lithuanian-born Mr. Slovo, since most party members are black.
Mr. Hani, who was born in the Transkei in 1942, considered becoming a Roman Catholic priest before be was drawn into anti-apartheid politics. He joined the congress's guerrilla wing in exile in 1962, becoming chief of staff in 1987. Since the African National Congress suspended its armed struggle against white rule 16 months ago, Mr. Hani has become more active in political matters.
Mr. Hani was elected to the congress's National Executive Committee in 1974 and represents the congress's more militant wing.
Though his full name is Martin Thembisile Hani, he is known to friends and enemies alike as Chris.

HEADLINE: PEARL HARBOR REMEMBERED;
Veterans Talk of Horror of War and Forgiveness

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Dec. 7

 BODY:
"We watched them dig their graves and we watched their firing squads -- everybody had to fall out for that," said Arnold Bocksel, a 78-year-old survivor of the Bataan Death March, recalling the shootings and beheadings of hundreds of fellow prisoners along the 65-mile journey through the Philippine jungle.
Mr. Bocksel spent three and a half years as one of the about 27,000 Americans who, military records show, were taken prisoner by the Japanese during World War II. He was one of about 16,000 who survived captivity. 
 His vivid and painful recollections were part of the debate of the issues involving the United States and Japan during World War II discussed here at a conference sponsored by by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute and Hofstra University.
The three-day conference, which ended today with a memorial ceremony, was one of the many observances in the New York metropolitan area and across the country to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
 
Mayor Addresses Veterans
 In New York, at the Intrepid Sea, Air, Space Museum at Pier 86 on the Hudson River, Mayor David N. Dinkins addressed a group of veterans, including 21 survivors of Pearl Harbor.
The Mayor said he was speaking to honor all the victims of the attack, including 56 civilians. "They died not on battleship row, or Wheeler Field, but on the streets and in the houses in the city of Honolulu," he said. "That day they joined 2,400 other Americans from all branches of the armed services in a procession of martyrdom that this nation cannot, must not and will not forget."
 
Academics Debated Issues
 At the conference in Hempstead, historians and economists-- such speakers as Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.; Eliot Janeway; C. Douglas Dillon, the former Secretary of the Treasury; and Paul H. Nitze, the former Secretary of the Navy -- debated the causes of the war, Japanese-American internment camps, strategic policy, naval strategy and the events leading to Pearl Harbor.
Akira Iriye, a history professor at Harvard, reminded the several hundred students at the conference that Japan not only made war against the United States, but against all the peoples of Asia.
"Those people still remember the war strongly and emotionally," he said. "It was a war against humanity and Japan does owe them an apology."
Professor Iriye said that German historians had been more self-searching and critical of Germany's role in World War II, but the Japanese have "chosen to forget."
Stephen E. Ambrose, a historian who was a keynote speaker at the conference, said the 50th anniversary of American entry into World War II invited new study by " the fresh eyes of a new generation born since the war."
But as a member of the generation that fought the war, Mr. Bocksel, of Wantagh, L.I., said he attributed his survival to "faith and lots of luck."
"It was an emotional roller coaster," he said. "To be a prisoner of war is to enter a dimension that is entirely alien to anything you have ever experienced before."
"I forgive the Japanese for what they did to me," he said. " My personal religious ethic teaches me that. To me it's like a serious wound I've had that's left an ugly scar."

 
VETERAN BURNS JAPANESE FLAG
 CONYERS, Ga., Dec. 7 -- A World War II veteran placed a Japanese battle flag in a barbecue grill in the back of his pickup truck this morning and set it afire to mark the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The veteran, Bob Mensinger, burned the battle flag before a crowd of about 50 people at 7:55 A.M. The bombing of Pearl Harbor began at 7:55 A.M. on Dec. 7, 1941.
Mr. Mensinger said he wasn't trying to offend present Japanese citizens, but was remembering the 2,000 who died at Pearl Harbor.
City officials had asked Mr. Mensinger not to burn the flag and urged four Japanese-owned companies with plants here to ignore the event.
An official at one company, Seiji Ohmasu, general manager of Takahashi Works Company, said, "We are too busy to be angry."

HEADLINE: Violent Crime in Dublin Shakes the City's Serenity

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Dec. 7

 BODY:
A recent spate of iolent crime in the Dublin area has shaken the city's sense of security and its reputation as one of Europe's more peaceful capitals.
The crime rate here is hardly comparable with the rates of larger European or American cities. There is not a proportionately large drug problem here, and there is no widespread mayhem in the streets, even in the tougher parts of the capital area, where about a third of the country's 3.5 million people live. 
 But to the Irish, the problem is alarming, and the perception is growing that violent crime is markedly on the rise. On Friday a gang of masked men with shotguns ran through rush-hour shoppers in the center of the capital as they took about $18,000 from a security guard at a restaurant in fashionable St. Stephen's Green and about $5,700 at an antiques auction being held in Mansion House, which includes the residence of the Lord Mayor and is a short walk from Trinity College and the Parliament.
Two weeks ago, police officers and firefighters in suburban public housing areas have been stoned by mobs of young toughs. Youths also steal cars, joyride them up and down the streets to the cheers of bystanders, then set them afire to finish the show. Until recently, this was the kind of thing that people here thought happened only in Britain and America.
Two months ago a gang of youths leaving a pub around midnight beat a man senseless on the city's main avenue, O'Connell Street. A German camper was mugged and killed last summer in Phoenix Park, a few steps from the residences of President Mary Robinson and the American Ambassador, Richard A. Moore.
 
From Homicide to Hepplewhite
 The police, who have 3,900 officers in the capital area, are often accused of playing down crime. The state police weekly television program usually starts with reports of a homicide or rape, but quickly moves into descriptions of stolen lawn mowers, family jewels and Hepplewhite chairs, asking the public to phone in clues.
The most recent police statistics, for 1990, show that the overall crime rate per 1000 people was 24.8 nationally and 47.6 in the Dublin area. There were 35,453 "offenses against property with violence" in the nation, an increase of 2 percent. A sharper increase is expected when statistics are compiled for 1991, since the effects of the recession began to accelerate this year.
The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Sean Kenny, attributes the increase to the weakened economy. He said in a recent interview that he feared that tourism, one of Ireland's major money earners, would be hurt by a perception that Dublin is becoming more dangerous.
Officials are hoping for an increase in tourists from the United States next year. Last year, tourism from the United States dropped sharply. Americans were afraid of flying becuse of terrorist threats during the Persian Gulf war.
The crime increase is largely in suburban areas, but there also is a rise reported by residents in working class parts of north Dublin -- near the district where the film "The Commitments" was made, the commuter train station was recently set on fire by vandals -- and in wealthy areas of the inner city. In recent months, the houses of four American diplomats have been broken into; in one case, a senior diplomat was tied up by the robbers, who broke into his house at night.
 
The Price of Recession
 "Oh it's definitely on the rise," said a middle-aged Irishwoman. "It's the unemployment. They should put them to work, cleaning up the streets, things like that. At least when they come home at night, they'll be tired."
"The consequences of unemployment and isolation are well known," said The Irish Times in an editorial calling on the Government to "embark on the program of financial and political investment which is so clearly and so urgently needed."
There is little disagreement that the recession in the rest of Europe and the United States is the cause of the increase in unemployment, now 20 percent nationally and as high as 70 percent in some working class Dublin area neighborhoods.
The Government, after acknowledging in a parliamentary debate this week that crime generally had risen 8 percent in the first half of the year, announced that it was setting up a task force of Government department heads to deal with the problem. Other Irish have various ideas of their own.
As public outrage rose with the attacks on the firefighters and the police, Mayor Kenny urged people not to form vigilante groups. Instead, about 2,000 people marched peacefully Thursday night in the western suburbs of Ronanstown and Neilstown. Some youths in the area have said that the police harass them. But for now, virtually all the public sympathy is for the police and the fault is laid to thugs and the economy.

HEADLINE: Feinstein Says Use of Control Board Deserves Study

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
As the Dinkins administration struggled yesterday to squeeze a new round of budget cuts from New York City agencies, a major municipal labor leader said it was time to consider the merits of having the State Financial Control Board step in to oversee the city's fiscal affairs so the painful cuts might be stretched over more time.
In raising that prospect, the union leader, Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, appeared to be stepping up public pressure on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins to agree swiftly on a plan to address huge budget shortfalls in the coming years. 
 Governor Cuomo heads the control board and has said he would be reluctant to invoke its powers. Mayor Dinkins sits on the board and has vowed to resist its intervention at all costs.
Mr. Feinstein also seemed to be signaling to the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Felix G. Rohatyn, that he was so eager for the city to win the $1 billion in aid that Mr. Rohatyn has said could be provided by refinancing M.A.C. bonds that Mr. Feinstein would consider a stepped-up role for the control board. Mr. Rohatyn has said the control board would have to approve any aid plan.
It was far less clear whether Mr. Feinstein would actually welcome intervention by the control board, which could assume sweeping powers and essentially suspend normal collective bargaining. But the board could also give Mr. Feinstein a villain to blame if his union is required to accept more cuts.
 
Willing to Lose Face
 Frustrated at months of fitful talks with the city, Mr. Feinstein has repeatedly said he does not trust the administration to craft a plan of its own and has sought to involve the Governor and other state officials more closely. But he has not challenged Mr. Dinkins's insistence that the control board not take a greater role.
Speaking at a conference on city finances sponsored by the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group financed by businesses, Mr. Feinstein stressed that he was not calling for the control board to take over.
But he said that he now believed that the city's economic problems were so severe, consensus on how to solve them so lacking and the probable impact of further cuts in the city workforce so disruptive that every option should be explored, even if it meant some loss of face for the city or the Mayor.
"It seems to me that one of the things we'd better look at again is why a control board process is just an anathema," he said. Instead of dismissing the idea as something that scares everybody, he said, "we ought to re-understand and redefine and check again."
The control board was established during the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's to supervise the city's finances. It has broad powers to approve labor contracts and make harsh cuts to bring the budget into balance. Since the early 1980's it has had only oversight authority, but the board could resume binding powers if the city failed to balance its budget or appeared likely to fail.
If the control board resumed powers, the city could be freed from the necessity of balancing the budget each June, suspending the tight controls under which it has had to operate for the last decade. That might give the city more time to bring revenues and spending into line instead of having to make deep cuts all at once.
But Mayor Dinkins has repeatedly said that any such possible advantages were illusory and would be far outweighed by the stigma of ceding control of the city's spending decisions to others. The Mayor has said that deep cuts would have to be made in any case.
"Since the Financial Control Board has no greater power to manage or improve the city's fiscal condition than the powers the Mayor already has, Mr. Feinstein's suggestion shows a singular lack of imagination in identifying innovative solutions to the problems we face," the Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones, said yesterday.
Mr. Jones said that Mr. Feinstein was "trying to divert people from the real problems" and should concentrate instead on working with the city to bring down the cost of employee health benefits and make the workforce more productive.
Mr. Cuomo, wrestling to keep the state's own huge budget problems under control and settle the question of his presidential candidacy, has repeatedly said he would not favor a takeover by the control board as long as the mayor opposed it.
Several times yesterday, Mr. Feinstein expressed frustration at the stalemate over the budget, and at Mr. Rohatyn's and other fiscal monitors' reluctance to provide the M.A.C. aid, despite the administration's latest plan for cutting the budget further.
"The non-government government has decided that the four-year plan that the government government gave did not meet the non-government government's needs," he said.

HEADLINE: More Cuts Sought of New York Agency Heads

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The heads of all New York City agencies were summoned to special budget meetings yesterday because the plans they submitted last week for long-term cuts fell short of their targets, the city's budget director said.
The director, Philip R. Michael, said several of the agencies had submitted plans that relied too heavily on work-rule changes and labor concessions that they have no control over. He said the purpose of the meetings yesterday was to begin finding cuts that could be made without the help of municipal labor unions. 
 Mr. Michael declined to specify the targets, which have been requested both as part of the city's efforts to revise its long-term fiscal plan and as a contingency in case the state cuts its aid sharply in closing its own budget gap.
But some agency heads said they had been asked to cut at least 3 percent a year from their budgets for supplies, rent and other costs outside of salaries and to reduce their work forces by 8 percent a year over the duration of the plan, through attrition if possible. Some agencies are looking at cuts of up to 20 percent.
 
Beyond Worst Case
 "It's a horror-show scenario," one commissioner said during a break in the meetings yesterday. "It's beyond a worst-case scenario."
Mr. Michael said yesterday that layoffs were being considered in the last two years of the plan, but he would not give details. He said the revamped plan "emphasizes that attrition is the way to go, but it recognizes that due to managerial perogatives there could be layoffs that are necessary."
Mr. Michael called the plans being drawn up "speculative." Asked what chance they have of coming to pass, he said, "It's likely a lot of these cuts are going to have to be made."
The meetings, which were closed to the public, occurred against a backdrop of growing apprehension among state fiscal monitors and bond-rating agencies about the city's ability to come up with a workable plan to bring its spending in line with falling tax revenues over the next several years. The recession has decimated tax revenues, and the city is facing at least $7 billion in budget gaps over that period.
 
Scrambling for Magic
 Last month, Mayor Dinkins agreed to overhaul the five-year budget plan he unveiled on Nov. 6 after state fiscal monitors complained that it lacked specifics, failed to cut the work force enough and hinged on highly uncertain labor concessions and special fees.
A crucial piece of the Mayor's plan was $1 billion in aid that could be provided through the refinancing of bonds sold by the state Municipal Assistance Corporation. The chairman of the corporation, Felix G. Rohatyn, has repeatedly said he will not provide the aid unless the city gets a stamp of approval for its plan from the state Financial Control Board, which was set up in the 70's to oversee the city's finances and has had only advisory powers since the early 1980's.
Responding to criticism from the assistance corporation, city budget officials have been scrambling to find a magic formula that would put flesh on the Mayor's skeletal goals, avoiding politically unpopular layoffs or tax increases while satisfying Mr. Rohatay and state control board officials.
Adding to the complexity of the problem, the city's fiscal picture has changed since the November plan was unveiled because the estimates of the state government's budget gap for the next fiscal year have nearly doubled, to $3.6 billion, casting doubt on nearly $2 billion in extra state aid the Mayor was counting on. How the state will handle its deficit is still in question, but the city agency heads were laying out plans yesterday for the worst case, city officials said.

HEADLINE: Take Psychics, Add Malls, Watch Business Grow

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARSIPPANY, N.J.

 BODY:
For expatriate urban dwellers who have long believed the future was in the suburbs, now comes evidence that this is true, perhaps beyond their wildest dreams.
And like most things in the suburbs, the future is available at the mall. Nothing flashy, no thunderbolts, no Steven Spielberg. Just a few tables, perhaps booths for privacy and 8 or 10 astrologers or psychics to help the earth-bound see beyond the horizon. 
 But like most good malls and anything as vast as the future, organization is needed. And organization ultimately means office space, which must be leased. Which is how Adcom Inc., an advertising and marketing agency run by Vincent and Shirley Tabatneck, became Adcom Inc.-Psychic Fairs. That was 15 years ago, when they organized their first psychic fair at the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, and, it goes without saying, they never looked back.
"Willowbrook was one of our accounts, and at lunch one day we were talking astrology and metaphysics," Mrs. Tabatneck said. Willowbrook's response was, "Oh, what a great idea! A tearoom for mother."
So Mrs. Tabatneck, a one-time astronomy student at Fairleigh Dickinson University who turned from telescopes to charts, parlayed a lifelong study of astrology into a labor of love.
 
No Beaded Curtains or Incense

The future, then, truly begins not at a mall, but in a pleasant if nondescript office park just east of the 24-hour Par-Troy diner on Route 46. There, in a small suite of several undecorated offices, just beyond a tiny waiting room where, curiously enough, most of the magazines are at least a year old, the Tabatnecks keep tabs on a loosely knit nationwide registry of psychic consultants, each of whom must fill out an application and provide evidence of experience as a reader of minds.
Mrs. Tabatneck also does private consulting there, but note the absence of beaded curtains, burning incense, crystal balls or the soundstage gypsy trappings.
Mrs. Tabatneck is no Madame Arcati seeking communion with blithe spirits. She is as comfortable speaking the lingo of stockbrokers (many are clients) as she is speaking of the cosmic effects of a retrograde Mercury transit. (No it's not a car, it's a troubling planetary sign that means stay away from business deals for the present.)
"I'm not a fortuneteller," she said. "Fortunetellers can be psychics." But too often, she said, "they are the type of people who would tell you anything you want to hear, and cast out the evil spirits and have you bring water from your faucet."
This is not read-and-run, Mr. Tabatneck said. "Sometimes a person doesn't hit it off with a reader. After a few minutes, that person can decide it's not working and try another one." No charge for the one that didn't work.
Mr. Tabatneck said psychic fairs have fallen off a bit during the recession, and now Adcom has established a 900 number for readings by phone.
Because there is no national association of clairvoyants, the Tabatnecks weed out the fortunetellers through a word-of-mouth network.
But the questions persist: Is this entertainment or something more complicated? And who's to judge?
"The malls don't want to take a stand on this one way or the other," Mr. Tabatneck said. "Some states have laws that say it has to be advertised for entertainment purposes."
If it entertains, so be it. The Tabatnecks are true believers in the power of the cosmos, and they take their parapsychology seriously. After Willowbrook came Livingston and Menlo Park and Paramus Park and Nanuet and Cross County, as well as Florida, California, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania. At grand openings, grand reopenings or white sales, Adcom has been there with tables of perhaps 10 psychics, prepared to consult the stars, read palms or decipher tarot cards, for $15 a quarter-hour.
But if the future, in fact, is in the suburbs, does it stand to reason that the future also comes with a suburban tinge?
No, says Mrs. Tabatneck. People, wherever they are, still care about the same things: love and money. But she has noticed some changes recently.
 
Love, Money and Cuomo's Run
 "People are talking about going back with their ex-husband or ex-boyfriend. Everyone is into resuming relationships right now and it's the strangest thing.
"It's the AIDS situation, No. 1, and No. 2, it's the economic situation in the country," she said. "They also realized that the reasons they broke up in the first place were not real."
Taking chances, though, is something most people are poised to do when they visit a psychic. The question is: should they take it? Of late, some visitors have been politicians.
"They ask if they're going to make it," she said. "So far the only ones I've advised have been the ones I told were not going to make it. Although they are going to make it in the future."
And then there is the case of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
"I feel he's going to run. I feel he's really, really worried and really nervous about it. I still feel Bush is going to get in."
Gov. Jim Florio in '93? "I don't think so."
Phil Simms or Jeff Hostetler as the Giants' first-string quarterback?
Shifting in her chair, with a sensation of discomfort in her back, where Hostetler suffered some broken bones against Tampa Bay, she said: "I think it will be Simms."

HEADLINE: New York State to Install 3,000 More Prison Beds

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Saying they are out of space to handle an overflow of prisoners, New York State authorities began installing 3,000 bunks last week under an emergency $40 million-expansion program.
With no new prisons on the drawing board and with the inmate population still rising, officials said as many as 6,000 bunks might have to be added to the 57,000 beds now in the state prison system. The new bunks will be placed atop existing beds in medium-security dormitories. There will be no double-bunking in maximum-security cells. 
 The state is resuming double-bunking in prison dormitories although many prison experts maintain the policy often creates security problems. Many experts frown on double-bunking, claiming it heightens tension between inmates and guards, overcrowds sanitary and recreational centers and can even generate prisoner disputes over watching television.
 
Tighter Security
 Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, the state's top prison official, said that about 760 correction officers would be hired to tighten security and reinforce the 18,000 guards now on duty.
New Jersey and Connecticut have also instituted double-bunking to house larger prison populations created by surging crime rates in the 1980's and harsher sentences.
New York State authorities said their emergency double-bunking plan was prompted mainly to trim a growing backlog of almost 3,000 convicted and sentenced prisoners in New York City jails -- known as state-ready inmates -- who are awaiting transfers to state custody. The city's jail population had decreased sharply in the summer but a recent transfer slowdown because of the lack space at state prisons has brought the city's jails to the brink of overcrowding.
"We were getting a lot of flak from them," said Mr. Coughlin, the Commissioner of the state's Division of Correctional Services, referring to complaints from city officials about the transfer slowdown. About 60 percent of the state's inmates are city residents.
 
'A Grim Move'
 The state had virtually abandoned double-bunking earlier this year. Mr. Coughlin said the decision to resume the practice was a "grim move," and one he made reluctantly. But he said he did it because there was little chance of eliminating the overcrowding through quick legislative approval for new prisons or expanding alternatives to incarceration like probation and work-release programs.
"There was no light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
The city's 17 jails held 22,055 inmates on Friday, putting them at 98 percent of their capacity of 22,300. As recently as September, only 1,100 prisoners in New York City were awaiting transfer to state prisons. Last week the number swelled to almost 3,000.
The state prison population rose to 57,000 last week, about 9,000 inmates above the intended capacity.
Mr. Coughlin said that the first 3,000 beds would be in place by February.
State Health Department officials, he emphasized, had reviewed the plan and found that the tighter living conditions would not create any added risk of tuberculosis. A new strain of drug-resistant tuberculosis has killed 13 inmates and a guard this year in the state prison system.
 
Longer Mandatory Sentences
 In addition to the transfer backlog, officials attributed the recent overcrowding at state prisons to two other factors: slower turnover of prisoners because of longer mandatory sentences that judges must impose on recidivist criminals and the high unemployment in New York City, which has sharply cut the number of inmates who can be released into a work-supervision program.
Since June 1990, New Jersey has converted 680 cells into double bunks. The state's 15 prisons were designed for about 18,000 inmates and currently hold about 24,000, said Patricia Mulcahy, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections.
Ms. Mulcahy said about 3,300 prisoners are being kept in county jails and 3,000 are housed in trailers and in prison classrooms, gymnasiums and chapels that have been renovated into dormitories.
New Jersey has no immediate plan to expand double-bunking and would probably rely on more trailers outside prison buildings as an emergency measure, she said.
In Connecticut, about 7,500 of the state's 10,000 inmates are held in cells and dormitories with double bunks. William E. Flower, a spokesman for the state's Correction Department, said that Connecticut's 21 prisons were roughly at 100 percent of capacity and that three new prisons are expected to open in the next two years to ease overcrowding.
 
Inmate Disturbance in 1990
 Except for an inmate disturbance in 1990 at the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution in Enfield, Mr. Flower said that double-bunking had been extensively used without serious security problems in Connecticut.
New York State's prison population has climbed from 28,499 in 1982, when the state had 39 prisons, to a current 57,000 inmates housed in 68 centers. The system is intended to hold about 48,500 inmates. In recent years, overcrowding has been handled by squeezing more single beds into dormitories and temporarily converting closed psychiatric hospitals into prisons.
The state's budget shortfalls have shelved plans for large-scale prison construction. A medium-security prison for 750 inmates costs $80 million to build and $18 million to operate each year.
Richard H. Girgenti, the state's Criminal Justice director, said that about $40 million would be allocated in the current budget to cover the cost of the double-bunking program and the payments to New York City and counties for temporarily housing state inmates.
The state pays counties and New York City about $40 a day once a prisoner is certified as ready for transfer. However, the city has pressed the state for quicker transfers, claiming that it spends $158 a day to maintain each inmate.
New York City and counties are responsible for the custody of defendants who are awaiting trial or who have been convicted of misdemeanors with sentences of less than one year. The state incarcerates people convicted of felonies with sentences of more than a year.
State officials said the prison congestion stemmed partly from a law requiring repeat felony offenders to serve at least half of their maximum terms before becoming eligible for parole. The law, in effect since 1980 as a means of getting tough with criminals, has increased the average prison term for 50 percent of the state's prisoners.
Most first-time offenders can be paroled after serving one-third of their maximum sentence, thereby allowing a faster exodus from prisons.
State prison officials said they had expected to open up more space this fall by discharging 2,500 inmates to live and work in the city through a program called "Day Release." To qualify an inmate must be within six months of parole and have a job and a residence in the city.
Mr. Coughlin said that the program was cut back to 800 because most prisoners were unable to find work in the city.
Mr. Girgenti, who is Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's top aide on criminal-justice matters, said that as part of a plan to reduce overcrowding, the Cuomo administration would propose that the Legislature give judges more discretion to hand out shorter sentences for nonviolent and noncoercive felony crimes -- primarily drug possession convictions.
He said that the administration would also urge the Legislature to grant judges more authority to send drug offenders to rehabilitation programs instead of prisons.
Nine upstate prisons for men will get double bunks along with the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County, a women's prison. The double-bunking began this week at prisons in Ogdensburg and Watertown, both in the northern part of the state. The bunks are being built and installed by prisoners employed by the Correctional Division.
The return of double-bunking has raised concerns about health and security. "There are a lot of unnecessary perils associated with double-bunking," said Robert Gangi, the executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, a private body empowered by the Legislature to inspect and report on conditions in state prisons.
Mr. Gangi said he was "skeptical about claims that this kind of widespread overcrowding won't increase tuberculosis risks."
Bob Lawson, a spokesman for the the union that represents correction officers, Council 82 of the Security and Law Enforcement Employees, said the council was pleased that 614 officers who had been laid off this year would be rehired. "The bitter part of this is that double-bunking is extremely dangerous for officers," Mr. Lawson said, warning that the additional beds and crowded conditions made it more difficult to observe and control unruly inmates.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Moves to Standardize the Cleanup of Toxic Waste

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 6

 BODY:
New Jersey is about to chart the future of its industrial economy, its land and its water in a way no state ever has.
The vehicle is a set of guidelines being drafted by the state's environmental regulators to cover the cleanup of almost 200 toxic compounds. The guidelines represent a benchmark in environmental management and control, but just as important is their potential as a catalyst or an obstacle to development. 
 The Federal Government and the states have customarily applied cleanup standards case by case, which industrialists and regulators acknowledge can be slow and expensive. With the state overseeing thousands of sites and technology evolving, businesses say they are ill served by standards that seem to change in the middle of the game, sometimes forcing manufacturers to clean their properties more than once.
That is how New Jersey has approached toxic cleanup since 1983, when the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act took effect. The act requires contaminated industrial sites be cleaned before they can be transferred or abandoned. But it lacks specific standards.
 
Time for Standards
 "The science just wasn't there" at the time, said Lance R. Miller, an assistant commissioner in the State Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, who is at the center of the drafting of the guidelines.
But with scientific advancements, prodding by the courts and agreement among business people and environmentalists that setting standards makes sense, the department is preparing to submit draft regulations to its Commissioner, Scott A. Weiner, before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the President-elect of the State Senate, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said recently that the Legislature should consider revising the cleanup act so businesses would have more incentives to clean properties rather than abandon them.
Mr. Weiner said he recognizes the challenge before his department. Now, he added, it is time for clearly articulated standards, "generic guidance, but with the flexibility to apply that to a specific case."
Whether the new rules will help revive the state's faltering economy or stunt its growth has been debated since last spring, when something the department called its pre-proposals became public.
 
Ideally, a Spur to Growth
 Optimally, the guidelines could help encourage the kind of development that Newark, Camden, Trenton, Paterson and other cities desperately need to regain their status as centers of commerce. The rules could encourage new interest in waterfront reclamation and the widespread cleanup and preservation of aquifers. They could also set a pattern for other states and the Federal Government, which modeled its Superfund cleanup law on legislation adopted in New Jersey in the 1970's.
Industry spokesmen and some public officials, notably Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, applaud the goal, but warn that if the regulations are too stringent, cities will have little hope of keeping or attracting industry.
Environmentalists counter that if standards are too lenient, the state will have mortgaged the health of its citizens, the quality of its water and its open space for immediate economic gratification. Eventually, they say, the state and its citizens will pay a far higher price.
"Everyone wants to have a standard, but what standard do they really want?" said Rob Stuart, program director for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. The research group said the environmental agency's pre-proposals were seriously flawed.
 
Industrial vs. Residential
 The battle centers on basic issues. For example, should there be different standards of cleanliness for industrial and residential sites? Environmentalists say no. Business groups and some public officials say yes.
Hal Bozarth, a spokesman for the Chemical Industry Association, contends that there should be separate standards because a longtime industrial site is unlikely to be used for anything else. Mayor James of Newark concurs, saying that if an industrial site near housing can be made safe for its neighbors, it need not be cleaned beyond that standard.
"The City of Newark is not advocating a trade-off of public health protection for economic development," he said. But he added, "when industry leaves the city, there are fewer jobs and fewer ratables, which in turn potentially results in additional cases of homelessness, child abuse and drug abuse, and less money to address these problems."
Environmentalists argue that cleaning a site to meet only human health standards ignores that a safe standard for humans may be unsuitable for more susceptible organisms. Besides, they say, what about ground water runoff, blowing soil and other so-called pathways of contamination?
 
How Much Say for Towns?
 Other debates have centered on the right of towns to set their own rules within departmental guidelines and the use of deed restrictions. Industrialists favor deed restrictions that confer permanent industrial status on a site so that it need not be cleaned to a higher standard. They also argue that municipalities retain the right to determine which, if any, sites should be set aside for industrial use.
Edward Lloyd, director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Center in Newark, rejected that view. "We shouldn't take the responsibility for future generations," he said. "New Jersey isn't big enough to leave a particular area contaminated. Do we want to have signs up all around that say Personal Risk -- Do Not Enter?"
Mr. Lloyd said the draft proposals also raise questions about the future of aquifers. By allowing some contaminated aquifers to remain uncleaned, he said, the proposals "write off" a valuable potential source of drinking water.
James W. Hughes, a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, called the debate "a classic environmental and economic quandary."
Asked if he believed economic interests would carry extra weight in the debate over cleanup standards, Dr. Hughes suggested that economic interests were hardy perennials, and he pointed to the swings in business cycles and their effect on policy.
Comparing the 1980's and 90's, he said: "Every time we go through an explosive growth period we become complacent and standards start rising -- the quality of development, the size of development. We're so overwhelmed about managing new growth that the older cities' problems are put on the back burner.
"When we hit the down cycle," he said, "we hit a threshold change in attitude: 'Hey, we're desperate for economic change and planning!' "
"We do a lousy job of managing growth," he said. "We do a worse job of managing decline."
 
Where There Is Agreement
 "No one will object to goals of a perfectly clean environment," Dr. Hughes said. "But we're not the affluent society we once thought we were."
Which is not to say that the outcome in Trenton will necessarily favor one side over the other. "For the most part, all sides are talking about the same thing," Mr. Weiner said. "The environmental community is concerned about different degrees of risk tolerance in different settings. The industrial community said, 'Set the standards realistically, then let us figure out how to do that on the site.' "
The balance between environmental and economic soundness has never been easy to strike, and there are plenty of New Jersey business owners with complaints to prove it.
One is Avon Products Inc., which tried to sell a subsidiary in Belleville, near Newark, and ran afoul of the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act. When Avon and the state disagreed over cleanup measures, Avon balked. When the state sought to seize about $1 million Avon had posted for the cleanup, Avon sued, and the Appellate Division of Superior Court in Essex County stopped the seizure. The court also directed the state to come up with the guidelines it is preparing now.
After months of public hearings and private discussion, New Jersey's cleanup standards will soon be on Commissioner Weiner's desk in Trenton. The commissioner will be able to adopt some or all of the proposals, change them or reject them.
"This is not the end of the process," he said. "The standards have to be living, adaptive documents."

HEADLINE: A Corner of Camden Revives, Block by Block

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMDEN, N.J., Dec. 7

 BODY:
In some parts of this city, abandoned, crumbling homes dominate neighborhood blocks, the detritus of Camden's industrial decline and the exodus of thousands of residents that followed.
The vacant properties -- more than 3,500 scattered around the city -- are an eyesore for residents, targets for arsonists and a haven for drug dealers. 
 As this city of 87,500 residents tries to revitalize its economy, local groups are trying to rebuild their neighborhoods block by block. The task is enormous in a city where more than 10 percent of the housing units are vacant.
"It's a challenge," admits Sister Peg Hynes, president of the Heart of Camden, a nonprofit housing group in South Camden. "But we realize we can make a difference."
An outgrowth of the Sacred Heart Church, the volunteer group has rehabilitated more than 50 homes since 1984. It is among a half-dozen groups that have begun rehabilitation projects in neighborhoods around the city.
"It's a very monumental task to revitalize the neighborhoods of Camden," said Thomas A. Roberts, executive director of the city's Redevelopment Agency. "They're very tough, but they can be brought back."
The city's neighborhoods began declining in the 1950's with the departure of thousands of residents to the suburbs, some drawn by the promise of single-family homes and green lawns and others joining the so-called "white flight" as blacks moved in. Between 1950 and 1980, the city lost almost a third of its population.
"We had a lot of vacant buildings left," Mr. Roberts said. "They were eventually abandoned and the city came to own them."
Using volunteers from churches, schools and civic groups, the Heart of Camden volunteer group is refurbishing five blocks in South Camden, a racially mixed area near the Delaware River. At one time there were almost 200 vacant homes in the area, Sister Hynes said. Most being renovated have been vacant for a long time.
"We really have to gut them and start all over again," Sister Hynes said in an interview. "It takes a lot more muscle and a lot more time."
It can take months for work crews to refurbish the homes, replacing walls, installing sprinkler systems and upgrading the properties to meet building codes, Sister Hynes said.
 
Fresh Paint and a Garden
 Residents say the effort is making a difference. Freshly painted row houses now line Holcain Street, a narrow alley that was once filled with trash. Nearby is a fenced-in garden park.
"Nobody would have thought these houses could be brought back," said Herb Clayton, who has lived nearby on Jackson Street for 14 years. "They were almost ready to fall down."
The Heart of Camden acquires the abandoned properties from the city and sells the rehabilitated homes to low-income families at low cost.
"We're not in this to make money," Sister Hynes said, noting that the annual income for most families is under $10,000. "We're in this to help families find homes."
Eligible families receive interest-free mortgages with no down payment required. The average monthly mortgage payment is about $200, including taxes, Sister Hynes said.
Mayor Aaron A. Thompson said the city cannot afford to demolish all the abandoned properties. The city is giving priority to razing buildings left in ruins after an arson spree on a "mischief night" around Halloween.
While the city has concentrated on a $500 million waterfront revitalization project that includes a state aquarium, Mr. Thompson says neighborhoods will not be overlooked. "For us to grow on our waterfront and not in our neighborhoods would be a tragedy," he said.
Despite the scattered success of grass-roots organizations, critics say the city should play a larger role in rebuilding neighborhoods and demolishing vacant, dilapidated homes.
"They say we are building Camden block by block, but I think we are losing this city block by block," said Maribel Roman, a member of the Camden Churches Organized for People, which has asked the city to demolish or rehabilitate 58 abandoned properties by the end of the year. "We need help and we need it fast."

Owners Discover Spring Free-Agent Bargains Are Worth the Wait

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The glare of the Bobby Bonilla signing, the Mets' aggressive pursuit of Bonilla and Eddie Murray, and the Los Angeles Dodgers' lightninglike deals with Orel Hershiser and Tom Candiotti might have temporarily blinded viewers to the plodding nature of this year's free-agent market. But the fact is the pace of signings has been the slowest since the days of collusion.
No cries of Collusion IV have been heard -- how could there be when the lushest contract ever has been bestowed on Bonilla? -- but there could be another game afoot. Call it the K Mart Caper. 
 The seeds of the game were planted, perhaps unwittingly, last winter when a series of veteran but capable players were left to scrounge for jobs just before or during spring training. Willie Randolph, Candy Maldonado, John Candelaria, Gary Carter and Brian Downing were all forced to accept less money than they might have gained had they been signed in November or December and not been subjected to the Great Free-Agent Freeze-out.
 
Making Players Sweat
 A theory gaining support among players' representatives suggests that the results of those signings so impressed the owners that they have decided to expand the corps of free agents to be ignored, at least for now. They will wait until February, the theory goes, when they figure they will be able to get bargains, like people who shop at K Mart instead of Saks.
"The idea is to cut straight to the date they feel the bottom drops out from under these players," one agent said. "They'll get fewer years, less money, less guarantees, less bidding."
The first-flight free agents, of course, are not included in the K Mart group. That, however, doesn't exclude many players. As long as the Bonillas, the Candiottis and the Morgans are pursued vigorously and signed lavishly, the players would not have grounds to question the legality of the owners' tactics, as they did with collusion.
No one complained last winter about the delayed signings of the veteran players, who initially weren't even signed. They were invited to spring training with agreement on what their contracts would be if they won jobs.
Randolph, for example, signed for $500,000 with Milwaukee and earned an additional $400,000 in bonuses for number of games played, earning only $25,000 more than the year before. He hit a career-high .327, third best in the American League. Downing wasn't even invited to camp until March 28, then signed with Texas for $425,000. He picked up an extra $175,000 in bonuses for his number of plate appearances but still earned less than half of his 1990 salary of $1.25 million. He hit 17 home runs and batted .278. Gary Carter was invited to the Dodgers' camp in February, signed for half of his $1 million salary in 1990 and wound up playing in 101 games, many more than the Dodgers had anticipated.
In other words, the clubs saved money while getting significant production out of the players. The owners saw the light and liked what they saw.
"It's not an idea I would dismiss," Donald Fehr, head of the Players Association, said when asked about the possibility of the K Mart Caper. "But I'm not ready to conclude that that's what's happening. With those few exceptions, the market has been slow. We have to see if it's caution or if everything is going to be confined to a small group of free agents."
As the agent for Wally Joyner and Rick Sutcliffe, Barry Axelrod has had some action, but he also sees a difference in the clubs' approach this year compared with last year.
"I'm not going to say collusion, but there are economic concerns," Axelrod said. "Every team you talk to talks about severe economic constraints. It's like a de facto salary cap. I'm not saying baseball has said, 'Here's your salary cap,' but everybody seems to be saying they're working on a budget. They say we have $32 million to spend on our payroll."
 
More Waiting and Talking

General managers lament that players' agents have taken over the winter meetings. Last year, for example, 19 free agents signed during the meetings in Chicago; included were Terry Pendleton, Vince Coleman, Dave Righetti, Willie McGee and George Bell. Twenty-five signed the year before in Nashville, including Dave Parker, Jeff Reardon and Kent Hrbek. This year's meetings, which begin officially tomorrow, are also expected to feature free-agent signings, but the number depends on the owners' strategy.
General managers would prefer controlling the week; that is, be free to make trades and not be encumbered by waiting for this or that free agent to sign so that this team or that knows what its needs are. They nevertheless manage to make trades, sometimes exciting ones, like last year's swap of Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar for Fred McGriff and Tony Fernandez.
Barry Bonds could be the biggest name traded this week, if Larry Doughty, the Pittsburgh general manager, can find a team willing to offer enough worthwhile players in return while knowing the enormous sum it would take to keep Bonds beyond next season.
Most teams will scour the lobby of the Fountainebleau Hilton Hotel for pitchers. Prime targets include Chuck Finley of California, Erik Hanson of Seattle and Kevin Appier of Kansas City. The Cincinnati Reds, having already shored up their pitching staff, are prepared to trade Randy Myers for a hitter, preferably a leadoff batter.
Some teams would be willing to trade front-line outfielders for pitchers, meaning McGee would be available from San Francisco, and Mike Greenwell or Ellis Burks from Boston. The Giants had been prepared to trade Kevin Mitchell, but his arrest on rape investigation charges has interfered with that plan.
With the signing of Bobby Bonilla and Eddie Murray, the Mets have the most front-line players to trade -- Kevin McReynolds, Dave Magadan, Gregg Jefferies, Hubie Brooks. Philadelphia would like to trade Dale Murphy and/or Von Hayes.
As always, many more players will be talked about or rumored to be going elsewhere than will be traded. More, too, will be traded than signed as free agents.
 
A Major Minor Draft
 The major league draft of unprotected minor league players, which takes place tomorrow, isn't the most exciting event of the meetings, but it should probably receive greater attention. Look at the attention two of its graduates received last week.
In the space of 24 hours, Bobby Bonilla, draft of '85, and Mike Morgan, draft of '84, received contracts totaling $41.5 million. Mitch Williams, draft of '84, is also a free agent, and he, too, will sign a lucrative contract.
A year ago, George Bell, draft of '81, was a free agent and signed a $9.8 million contract. Early this year, Kelly Gruber, draft of '83, signed for $11 million. If that sort of thing continues, teams may start ignoring the draft; it's becoming too expensive, going well beyond the $50,000 a drafted player costs.
The success of those players, on the other hand, shows that teams can benefit from careful scouting and judicious drafting. Those players have received those millions because they have become stars -- well, at least in most cases.
Shane Mack hasn't gained millions yet, but he is the most recent worthwhile selection. Minnesota drafted him from the San Diego organization two years ago, and he has responded to the Twins' $50,000 interest by hitting .326 and .310.
The same day the Chicago White Sox drafted Bonilla from Pittsburgh, the Padres plucked Bip Roberts from the Pirates. The Pirates reacquired Bonilla in a trade seven months later. Roberts has been targeted for the Cincinnati Reds in a trade for Randy Myers, but if the Padres can get Barry Bonds from the Pirates, Roberts could return home, too.
 
Another Yankee Problem
 Oh what a tangled web the Yankees' spiderman has weaved.
For all of those clamoring for the return of George Steinbrenner as the Yankees' managing partner, two points of information:
*He created the fouled-up circumstances in which the club is immersed, first by causing his own exile, then by putting in place the people who have further befuddled matters.
*He, and not Robert Nederlander or Leonard Kleinman or Gene Michael, oversaw the 10-year deterioration of the Yankees. It was his team, not theirs, that finished last in 1990 with a dreadful 67-95 record.
Those points made, the relationship between Steinbrenner and Kleinman, the Yankees' chief operating officer, has created a deliciously ironical dilemma.
If Steinbrenner has any thought of being allowed to return from his personal Elba, he knows he first would have to induce Kleinman to drop his lawsuit against Commissioner Fay Vincent. Kleinman has indicated he would be willing to do that, but he would do it because he wants to be managing partner.
The lawsuit is Kleinman's bargaining lever to achieve his goal. I'll drop the suit, he could tell Steinbrenner, if you nominate me to be managing partner. But Steinbrenner has no intention of nominating Kleinman. He would want the suit to disappear so he could return as managing partner. Kleinman, though, would derive nothing from that combination of actions so why should he foresake the suit?
Kleinman would seem to have Steinbrenner right where he wants him.
Kleinman has become a thorn in Steinbrenner's side in another way. The owner brought Kleinman in as a financial officer, never intending for him to take on significantly greater responsibilities. But with Nederlander unwilling and unprepared to get into baseball personnel matters, Kleinman began insinuating himself into that area, even though he has no experience or knowledge about players. Recently, he, more than Michael, has served as the club's spokesman on personnel matters.
The development has not pleased Steinbrenner.

Winning the Heisman for God, for Country and for Iowa

 BODY:
The Heisman Trophy, the most prestigious award in college football, will be awarded on Saturday at the Downtown Athletic Club in Manhattan. One of the previous recipients was Nile Kinnick, a running back at the University of Iowa who became a national celebrity after winning the award in 1939. Kinnick's moving Heisman Trophy speech is included among selected letters to his family and entries from his diary in a recently published book, "A Hero Perished" (University of Iowa Press, $27.95).  
 After graduation in 1939, Kinnick began legal study to prepare for a political career, then entered the Navy Air Corps as a fighter pilot. He was assigned to the U.S.S. Lexington on its shakedown cruise. On a training mission on June 2, 1943, his plane -- later found to be defective -- went down in the Gulf of Paria, between Venezuela and Trinidad, and Kinnick was never found. He was 24 years old. The following are excerpts from his speeches, letters and diaries:
 
 
To the Family
PUB-DATE: January 16, 1939
 It is my belief that the essential thing to be gained from a college education is to learn to think, to think for yourself; to develop an active, alert inquiring mind.
It would seem quite natural that we should turn to the writings of the great minds of the centuries gone by to discipline and guide our own mode of thinking. However, the little experience I have had with Plato, Socrates etc., leads me to believe that the subject matter is of little consequence and interest.
The most important thing -- and I am sure I am right -- is to maintain an active, alert interest in everything going on about you. Analyze and think for yourself. Read and listen only insofar as it stimulates and aids your own thinking. Don't read and parrot back in the language of another; don't think and explain thru [sic] the already formed concepts of someone else all the time. Don't be afraid to grasp, develop and expound your own ideas. "An expert is often just a glib fellow away from home." Be alert, inquire, question, read, discuss, understand.
 
 
Heisman Award Address
PUB-DATE: December 6, 1939
 I consider my winning this award as indirectly a great tribute to the new coaching staff at the University of Iowa headed by Dr. Eddie Anderson, and to my teammates sitting back in Iowa City. A finer man and a better coach never hit these United States, and a more courageous bunch of boys never graced the gridirons of the Midwest than that Iowa team of 1939.
Finally, if you'll permit me, I'd like to make a comment which in my mind is indicative perhaps of the greater significance of football and sports emphasis in general in this country, and that is, I thank God I was warring on the gridirons of the Midwest and not on the battlefields of Europe. I can speak confidently and positively that the players of this country would much rather struggle and fight to win the Heisman Trophy than the Croix de Guerre. Thank you.
 
 
Commencement Supper Address
PUB-DATE: May 29, 1940
 We all seem to have the courage to face the physical forces of life -- sickness, poverty, unemployment, even war itself -- but how about courage of conviction, of morality, of idealism, courage of faith in a principle, tangible proof of which is slow in appearing. Herein lies that phase of these problems which we must meet by ourselves, unaided by any university-given tools. Here is that angle of the greater difficulty which most often has proven the weak point in graduates of the past.
 
 
To Arletta G. Clarke [Kinnick's grandmother]
PUB-DATE: April 29, 1941
 It is very sobering to realize just what the future holds for a boy of my age. On the other hand, it is a practical challenge to a man's courage and personal integrity. A man who talks but is afraid to act, who sacrifices principle to expediency whenever real danger threatens is not worthy to keep and enjoy what he has. He is not worthy of his background and heritage who kowtows to tyranny in order to cling to his temporary safety and comfort. This is no expression of oratory or emotionalism but cold, hard truth. I trust I will have the courage to act as I speak, come what may. It will not be easy -- but should, therefore can, be done.
 
 
To Nile Kinnick Sr.
PUB-DATE: June 29, 1942
 All the while that I was driving down here, my mind was thinking what I might do when this war is over. Almost entirely, my thoughts were of a farm and how much the soil and sun and crops appeal to me. My imagination ran rampant. Oh, for the farm where a man is truly independent, and where he deals with fundamentals, where the changing seasons bring changed work, and a man is out of doors all the time. It is on the farm that a man can devote his life to his investment and see the improvement and growth from year to year.
 
 
To the Family
PUB-DATE: April 14, 1943
 Happiness unshared is like a picture without those colors which give it warmth and meaning. Give a man one close friend, tried and true, and he is fortified against the world; make that friend a woman and there are no heights he cannot scale.
 
 
Diary Entries
PUB-DATE: January 18, 1942
 I must admit there is nothing I enjoy more than the companionship of a beautiful woman who also possesses breeding, grace, charm and wit. There have been a few such women in my life but not enough. There may have been a time when I was in love with love -- but no more. However, I shall not consider my mortal existence complete until I have loved and won a woman who commands my admiration and respect in every way.
 
 
PUB-DATE: May 23, 1943
 If you really want to win, never give a sucker a break. Press every advantage to the limit.
Safety in aviation demands a healthy respect for your aircraft, unceasing alertness.
 
 
PUB-DATE: May 24, 1943
 Realize that every close call with danger is proof of God's care and that the demands of a tough assignment are a challenge to your worth and courage. This kind of thinking knows no fear.
Learn to sleep soundly and efficiently regardless of circumstance if you would be a man of stamina.
 
 
PUB-DATE: June 1, 1943
 How I wish that I could sing and play the piano!
It is a sad mistake to try to be head man in everything you attempt.
The axiom "if it's worth doing at all, it's worth doing well" has its limitations. Stay on the ball most of the time, but learn to coast between moments of all-out effort.
People must come before profits!!

HEADLINE: The United Fates of Europe

 BODY:
The leaders of the 12 nations of the European Community assemble in the Dutch city of Maastricht tomorrow to propel Europe toward a united future. The road to Maastricht has been tortuous. Disputes rage because no nation finds it easy to sacrifice prerogatives. What's required is a common commitment to compromise -- no matter how painful.
On the agenda are economic and political treaties that would reshape Europe along lines only visionaries like Jean Monnet could have imagined after the bloodletting of World War II. The questions to be resolved are momentous, like whether to adopt a single currency, or impose a single standard for working conditions and workplace management. 
 The U.S., a bystander, has a strong rooting interest in Maastricht's success. European unity is the best guarantee that no member will ever again turn against its neighbor. It is also the best guarantee that Europe will prosper, providing a market for U.S. exports. What matters is not specific timetables but whether Maastricht keeps unification marching forward.
Underlying a host of economic and political disputes is a single, wrenching tradeoff: Members of the Community can reap benefits of closer cooperation only by sacrificing the privileges of independence.
Take the issue of a single currency. The purpose of replacing the pound, mark and 10 other currencies with one standard unit is to make trade between Paris and Athens as hassle-free as trade between New York and Houston. But, as Britain complains, monetary unity comes at a stiff price. Without its own currency, Britain couldn't have a monetary policy. In a recession, that would mean it couldn't lower interest rates to spur investment or devalue to spur exports.
Americans might wonder what the fuss is all about. After all, Texas doesn't have a monetary policy either. True, but Texas has something else: a security blanket called Washington. When the economy sours, Texans get Federal aid and pay less Federal tax. But if Britain hit the skids, the Community would provide minuscule help.
On the other hand, Britain exaggerates its current independence. The value of the pound is tied to the value of the German mark. In effect, that means London can't create pounds much faster than Germany creates marks.
Britain is on more solid ground when it opposes proposed Community regulations that are unjustifiably intrusive. Under the guise of protecting workplace health and safety, for example, it's been proposed that Germany's prohibition on Sunday retailing be extended to everyone else.
Other proposals would impose strict caps on deficits that countries could generate. Yet states within the U.S. operate budgets without Federal limits; instead, capital markets rein in excessive state borrowing.
The Maastricht summit meeting won't settle these issues once and for all. Nor need it try. The important point is that leaders define their needs narrowly, compromise at important junctures and push unification forward. As for the U.S., it cares less about who wins and loses individual battles than a broader outcome: treaties that commit members to a united fate.

HEADLINE: Making Taxation Fairer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The continued truncation of our progressive income tax rates at 30 percent is preposterous. Nor is Representative Dan Rostenkowski's timid proposal of an increase to 35 percent for a limited few the answer. 
 One category of taxpayers makes the inappropriateness of a 30 percent rate particularly striking. We have 60 United States billionaires and some 500,000 people with $5 million or more of accumulated wealth. The 30 percent rate only snowballs the accumulations. A traditional progressive income tax such as those in effect from 1950 to 1980 could bring in from this group alone additional revenues in the range of $15 billion a year. But the reach of an equitable income tax should go beyond those with vast accumulations and include those with high salaries and high earnings.
The Congressional Budget Office calculates that after-tax income, adjusting for inflation, of the richest 5 percent of the population has grown 60 percent over the last 15 years. It has not trickled down.
At the other end of the scale, 20 percent of all children and 50 percent of all black children live in poverty.
The 30 percent truncation was introduced with the Reagan "voodoo" economic package. If we are to restore the essential democratic precept of taxing according to ability to pay, we must return to the fairness of a traditionally progressive income tax.

HEADLINE: PEARL HARBOR REMEMBERED;
Recalling Pearl Harbor, Bush Urges an End to Rancor; 50 Years After Attack, Survivors Are Told to Forget Animosity

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Amid solemn ceremonies honoring the Americans who died in the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor 50 years ago today, President Bush told an assemblage of more than 2,000 survivors that the time had come to put aside their animosity toward Japan.
"I have no rancor in my heart toward Germany or Japan -- none at all," said the President, a former Navy pilot who was himself shot down by the Japanese in the Pacific in 1944. "I hope you have none in yours. This is no time for recrimination." 
 Mr. Bush added: "World War II is over. It is history. We won. We crushed totalitarianism, and when that was done we helped our enemies give birth to democracies." [Excerpts, page 24.]
The President's words were the climax of nearly a week of emotional events marking the 50th anniversary of the attack, which drew the United States out of its isolationism and into the war.
He spoke from a podium in a huge shed on Pier 8 at Pearl Harbor. Behind him, across the calm, sunlit waters, stood the gleaming white monument that straddles the sunken remains of the battleship Arizona, on which 1,177 Americans died during the attack.
Docked to his left, in a gesture that could only irritate modern Japanese sensibilities, was the battleship Missouri, aboard which the Japanese formally surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945.
 
Words of Reconciliation
 But Mr. Bush's words were clearly meant to foster reconciliation. He praised the veterans for their valor and restated American regrets over the internment of thousands of Americans of Japanese ancestry in the hysteria that swept the nation after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
And he warned against any relapse into political or economic isolationism.
"We stand here today on the site of a tragedy spawned by isolationism," the President said. "And it is here we must learn -- and this time avoid -- the dangers of today's isolationism and its economic accomplice, protectionism."
To the leaders of Japan "in particular" he said, "this solumn occasion should reinforce our determination to join together in a future energized by free markets and free people."
He spoke on a day much like the Sunday morning in 1941 when the attack began.
The sky was bright, a 10-mile-an-hour breeze wafted in from the east, and soft nimbus clouds hovered over the volcanic mountains of central Oahu, over which the Japanese naval bombers and torpedo planes swept out of the sky and wreaked death and havoc on the American forces and fleet.
The attack, which came in two waves and lasted nearly two hours, killed 2,335 soldiers, sailors and marines, and 68 civilians. Twenty-one ships, including eight battleships, were sunk or damaged, and 188 Navy and Army Air Forces aircraft were destroyed.
The ceremonies today spoke volumes about the complex relationship that has since developed with Japan. The aged veterans who returned to the scene of their youthful terror and herrorism carried Japanese cameras, and the television monitors they watched were made in Japan.
 
The Veterans' Last Hurrah
 For the veterans, now mostly in their 70's, it was a last hurrah, certainly the last time they would ever gather in such numbers.
The reactions of the assembled veterans varied.
Vern Ray Arnet, a retired Air Force colonel from Baltimore, who lost an older brother, Ray, on the Arizona, called the events "a wonderful thing -- I'm glad to see the American public rallying to the support of the military."
Bill Keyes, a 72-year-old veteran from Wethersfield, Conn., near Hartford, who was an infantryman at Schofield Barracks, said of the events, "It takes you right back."
A Navy veteran who would not give his name became upset when questioned and said, "I'd rather not talk -- it's too depressing."
The events began with a daybreak ceremony at the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, where 776 victims of the attack on Pearl Harbor are buried.
Mr. Bush, accompanied by his wife, Barbara, was introduced by Gerald Glaubitz, the national president of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.
At that ceremony, too, the President spoke against the racial animosities that the anniversary has aroused in some people. "Americans did not wage war against nations or races," he said. "We fought for freedom and human dignity against the nightmare of totalitarianism."
And, as he did at every place he spoke, the President lauded the Japanese-Americans who fought in the American armed forces during the war and expressed regrets to those interned "innocent victims who committed no offense."
But he also called for eternal vigilence, lest there be another Pearl Harbor. "The cause of harmony among nations is not a call for pacificism," he told the veterans at the cemetery.
From there, the President went to Pearl Harbor, about five miles east of downtown Honolulu, and went by barge to the Arizona Memorial, where the names of the 1,177 men who died in the sunken battleship are engraved in marble. Together, he and Mrs. Bush solemnly dropped flowers into the water above the sunken hull.
At 7:55 A.M., the exact time at which the Japanese bombers first appeared 50 years ago, there was one minute of silence as a new cruiser, the Chosen, glided past the memorial. Then, in a thunderous roar, three fighter jets of the Hawaii National Guard flew over.
Today's ceremonies capped nearly a week of commemorative events in Honolulu. It was a week for old soldiers, sailors and marines to reunite and to retell old war stories and stories of horror and heroism on the morning 50 years ago when the Japanese planes descended on the Hawaiian island of Oahu and permanently changed the history of the 20th century.
But the events, which included a jovial parade down Kalakaua Avenue in the Waikiki hotel area on Friday morning by more than 2,000 survivors, were tinged with complexity and ambiguity. This was particularly true for Hawaii, whose economy today is more tightly tied to Japan than any other state and whose politics are dominated by Americans of Japanese ancestry, or A.J.A.'s, as they are called. They make up 23 percent of Hawaii's population of 1.1 million, but they wield political power far out of proportion to that by virtue of the tightly knit Democratic political machine here.
The Japanese are crucial to the state's $11 billion tourism industry. One of every five visitors to Hawaii comes from Japan, and they typically spend more than four times as much money than American tourists.
For months before the anniversary, local business and political leaders worried that the commemorative events would rekindle anti-Japanese feelings, already running high in the United States because of resentment over Japan's economic prowess, and drive away the tourists.
There also was much discussion in Honolulu this week over whether Japan had properly atoned for Pearl Harbor. Earlier in the week Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe was quoted in The Washington Post as saying that Japan felt "deep remorse about the unbearable suffering and sorrow" it inflicted during the war. Today The Post quoted Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa as expressing "deep remorse," and Mr. Bush said he appreciated that statement.
But doubts have arisen about how strong the Japanese statements were. News reports from Tokyo published here Friday said that Mr. Watanabe used the word "hansei," which translates into "self-reflection" rather than "remorse." Mr. Miyazawa used the term "sekimin," meaning "deep responsibility."

 
 
JAPAN PRAISES BUSH SPEECH
 TOKYO, Sunday, Dec. 8 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Foreign Minister of Japan, Michio Watanabe, said this morning that he was "deeply moved" by President Bush's renewed call for reconciliation between Japan and the United States, and he restated Japan's "deep self-reflection" over its World War II aggression.
The Foreign Ministry, in its English translation of Mr. Watanabe's statement, quoted him as saying he was "deeply remorseful" over Japan's past actions, but the more usual translation of the words employed -- fukaku hansei -- is deep self-reflection or thinking twice about something.
Mr. Watanabe's statement has been the only formal statement issued by a government official for the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, but it was identical to one given earlier in the week to The Washington Post. Both the newspaper and Mr. Bush in a speech Saturday in Hawaii referred to that statement as speaking of Japan's deep remorse about the attack.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 10, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the memorial ceremonies at Pearl Harbor referred incorrectly to the new United States cruiser that sailed past the Arizona Memorial at 7:55 A.M. on Saturday, precisely 50 years after the Japanese attack. She is the Chosin.

D-Day for Mobile-Home Property Rights

BYLINE: By MORRIS NEWMAN

DATELINE: ESCONDIDO, CALIF.

 BODY:
CHARLES DuPONT owns a mobile-home park with about 100 spaces on an enviable site bordered one one side by an orchard and on the other by new one-family houses. Yet because of a rent-control law he has been unable to raise most of his rents beyond what tenants paid in 1986.
Mr. DuPont is one of eight owners of mobile-home parks in this city 25 miles north of San Diego who have challenged its rent-control law in court. Their cases, grouped together, have won a review before the United States Supreme Court, which has become increasingly willing to hear property-rights cases as its membership has taken on a more conservative cast. It is likely to hear the cases next month. 
 Property-rights advocates are hopeful that the court will decide one of the most controversial issues in rent control: whether government can restrict landlords from raising rents on rent-controlled property even after old tenants leave.
One of the eight cases, brought by Dr. John Yee, an Orange County physician who owns 159 mobile home spaces in the city, is of particular interest to property-rights theorists because many affected tenants own mobile homes that sit on rented land. For that reason, rental rates are reflected in the market value of the homes.
A locked-in low rent may be attractive to buyers and let a seller charge more for a mobile home, while a high rent may erode its value.
Under a law approved by local voters in 1988, rental rates on mobile-home spaces were rolled back to their levels of January 1986. Park owners cannot raise the rent without first making formal application to a rent-review board.
Mr. DuPont says that most of his tenants pay outdated, under-market rents of $210 a month and that their rents would exceed $400 "in a free market."
Yee v. Escondido started at San Diego County Superior Court, which ruled that the city's rent-control law was not a taking. An appeals court upheld that decision and the California Supreme Court declined to review the case.
The case has aroused wide interest among such leading property-rights watchdogs as the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento, which plans to file one of at least 12 "friend of the court" briefs expected in the case.
Richard Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago School of Law who has written extensively on rent control and the issue of "taking," said the court's decision has the potential to "alter the line between private and public, between the marketplace and politics." Mr. Epstein said the case could help to clarify the sometimes murky legal doctrine of unconstitutional "taking" of property.
Jerry Harmon, this city's Mayor, championed the rent-control measure three years ago as a City Councilman.
Because many mobile-home park residents own their homes and lease the land underneath, he said, they are vulnerable to the whims of landlords.
"Basically, they are people of retirement age who live on fixed incomes," he said.
The Mayor says that some park owners, in light of the recent housing boom in the area, want to raise rents, rid themselves of low-rent tenants and attract affluent new renters now streaming into the area.
BUT Robert Jagiello, the attorney for the mobile-home-park owners, says the solution chosen by Escondido voters three years ago represents an unconstitutional taking of property by the government.
Tenants whose spaces are rent controlled, he said, get a premium price when they sell their homes "and that premium represents a monetarization of the right to occupy the space."
By getting high prices for homes on rent-controlled land, Mr. Jagiello said, tenants take profits out of the hands of the land owners and keep the economic benefit for themselves.
Mr. Jagiello cited a recent case in Los Angeles, Azul Pacifico v. City of Los Angeles, in which a mobile-home owner testified she paid about $77,000 for a mobile home that she later traded in, getting only $5,000 for it. She had paid $77,000, he contends, not for the home itself, but for right to occupy the rented space on which it stood.
Mr. DuPont says his situation is analagous to that of a homeowner who invites a guest into his home and then cannot get rid of him.
"It is as if the Mayor came over and said, 'That guest can stay there for the rest of his life,' and can sell the right to stay in your house to anyone else," he said.
Defenders of the law say that tenants stand to lose the ability to sell their mobile homes profitably if landlords charge prohibitively high rents.
"The park owners can unconscionably raise the rents of their space, and the owner of the mobile home becomes unable to sell it," said Joan Gallo, the city attorney of San Jose.
She is one of several lawyers preparing a "friend of the court" brief for Yee v. Escondido in support of the law. In her view, a high rent on land that erodes the value of the property is a kind of taking in itself.
In recent years, California has been a cauldron of property-rights cases. In 1987, the High Court ruled, in First English Evangelical Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, that property owners have a right to compensation if government deprives them all economic benefit from their property, even if only temporarily.
And in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission of the same year, the court ruled that government may charge fees and make other demands of property owners only when there is a direct relationship between those "exactions" and the actual impacts of the private development on public areas.
Beyond issues of taking, however, the larger issue, according to Gideon Kanner, a retired professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, is whether rent control laws like the one in Escondido accomplish their aim: to protect the affordability of housing.
If lower rents lead to higher-priced mobile homes, Mr. Kanner argued, the law is a failure, since people who buy mobile homes in rent controlled-areas are likely to pay higher, rather than lower, prices. New tenants are not protected by the ordinance, since housing prices continue to rise, resulting in the same effect as that of landlords raising rent.
The only difference is that the beneficiary is the mobile-home seller, rather than the park owner.
"THE whole ordinance is irrational, because the intent was to lower the cost of mobile homes," said Mr. Kanner.
"But it does not preserve affordable housing," he continued. "It simply allows tenants to rip off landlords."
Mr. Epstein of the University of Chicago suggested that if government wants to ensure affordable rents to low-income tenants, the public should bear the burden collectively.
"Why does the landlord have to subsidize these welfare tenants?" he said. "That is an issue for society as a whole."
For the time being, Mr. DuPont tends his mobile-home park quietly as he waits for his day in the Supreme Court. Despite the high profile of the case, the mobile-home park owner says his relationship with tenants is usually friendly, although he avoids discussing the case with some people.
"I don't bring up the topic if I know there will be argument," he said. "Both of us understand this is a question that will be decided by a higher authority."

HEADLINE: America Is Only as Great as Its Shoppers

BYLINE: By Joseph Nocera; Joseph Nocera, a columnist for GQ, is working on a history of personal finance.

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
So there he was, the President of the United States, preparing to lead by example, offering to show us the way out of our economic morass. It was the day after Thanksgiving. The President had come to Frederick, Md., to go to the mall. It was a typical middle-income, middle-class mall, filled with Foot Lockers and Radio Shacks, Thom McAns and Fashion Bugs. The President headed straight for J. C. Penney. He bought four pairs of tube socks and a toddler's sweatsuit. He paid $28. None of the accounts I read mention whether he paid in cash or with a credit card. I'm guessing cash.
You see a thing like this and you don't know whether to laugh or cry. Tube socks? Twenty-eight dollars? This is how we're going to spend our way out of the recession? 
 I don't mean to suggest that we won't eventually spend our way into a healthier economy; we always have before. It's just that President Bush's performance lacked a certain, shall we say, conviction. He made no impulse purchases; he didn't browse through the mall all afternoon; and he didn't buy anything he couldn't really afford, but figured, ah, I'll use my credit card. He may have bought, in other words, but he didn't shop. The economists all agree that we're not going to pull out of this recession until we really start shopping again.
It's a funny way to think about it, I suppose. The economists usually prefer nice-sounding phrases like "an upswing in consumer spending," which lends a patina of respectability to the crass business of buying things. Consumer spending is shopping. An upswing in consumer spending is more shopping. Shopping is the Great American Pastime. Myself, I think we ought not be so sheepish about admitting it out loud.
Do you doubt me? Never mind Rodeo Drive or Fifth Avenue. What about Aspen, where, on a glorious midsummer's afternoon, sun shining against breathtaking mountains, the streets are lined with tourists, wandering from one pricy shop to the next? Santa Fe? Freeport, Me. (America's outlet capital)? Haymarket Square in Boston? Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco? The Galleria in Houston? They're all lined with tourists, wandering from store to store.
It can seem insane sometimes, this urge to shop, when there are so many other possibilities. It can also be impossible to resist. I had a free day in Chicago this summer, so I decided to drive out to Oak Park and take the Frank Lloyd Wright walking tour. There were maybe a dozen other people on the tour. Then I went down to Michigan Avenue, the heart of the shopping district. Thousands of people were strolling up and down the street, in and out of stores. They had this great, wonderful city at their feet and they were shopping. Then again, so was I.
As it happens, I live in a shopping town, though a small one. Our cute, revitalized downtown is lined with the kind of shops, as a writer once memorably put it, "where you can get what you want, but not what you need."
On Saturdays, our little streets are every bit as crowded as Michigan Avenue, as people come from miles around just to shop. The old-timers hate it, of course -- hate the way the hardware store has been pre-empted by a Benetton's. The newcomers sniff, the way locals always sniff at the tourist trade. But I think we're lucky. Our town has survived the Massachusetts downturn much better than most neighboring towns. We've been saved by shopping. The country has always been saved by shopping.
For better or worse, shopping is embedded in our culture. It is what we do. It has also been an engine of prosperity. Surely, the most important financial innovation in this century was the installment loan, which made it possible for Americans to buy things with money they didn't yet have. When the credit card arrived in the late 50's to further propel the economy, it was simply a more convenient form of installment loan.
Thirty-five years ago, in "The Affluent Society," John Kenneth Galbraith lamented the rise of the installment loan, the consumer society it was fueling, and the advertising that "creates the wants it seeks to satisfy." There was much truth in what he said, so much so that tens of thousands of Americans went out and bought his scathing indictment of their behavior, pushing "The Affluent Society" onto the best-seller list. And then they went right on shopping. And the economy kept right on growing.
It's when we stop shopping that we get into trouble -- when we lose our zest for the sport, fearful that we won't have the money tomorrow to pay for the things we can't afford today. So here we are, on a Sunday in December, 17 shopping days till Christmas. (And isn't that a phrase that speaks volumes about who we are?) I suppose we could plunk down $28 for tube socks as the President did. Or we could do something else. We could buy something big, something we probably don't need, something we'll have to pay off over time. We could shop till we drop. What the heck. That's what made this country great.

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
A Newcomer Meets the Hit-Making Machine

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WALKER; Michael Walker writes about pop music for The Los Angeles Times.

 BODY:
There are household names. Then there is Russ Irwin, a 23-year-old singer-songwriter from Dix Hills, L.I., whose ballad "My Heart Belongs to You" recently slogged its way up and down the charts. To promote the song and his debut album, "Russ Irwin," he has thus far played on the "Tonight" show, appeared briefly on ABC's "In Concert," taped two videos, endured a round of interviews with teen-age fan magazines and made personal appearances at a numbing litany of radio stations.
"Wichita Falls? In Texas? I was there," Mr. Irwin says over lunch in a midtown Manhattan resturaunt, a dusting of makeup from a magazine photo shoot clinging to his face. He is recounting a recent two-week promotional odyssey to radio stations. "I've been to Seattle, L.A., Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville, Chattanooga, Dallas, Abilene, Waco, Rockford." 
 All of this has been at the behest of Mr. Irwin's label, SBK Records, which has a reputation for spending lavishly on new artists. Mr. Irwin is one of the dozens of young, first-time musicians launched by record companies each year, and his experience offers a window into the calculated world of modern hit-making. While approaches vary, breaking a baby act like Mr. Irwin involves as much marketing as music.
Getting the public to recognize a new act is never easy, especially now. The record business is in a slump, and the charts are clogged with new releases by superstars like Michael Jackson, Hammer and Guns 'n' Roses, making it that much harder for an unknown like Mr. Irwin to get heard on radio, still the crucial factor in a record's success. Because of the recession, record buyers aren't making as many impulse purchases. Nevertheless, the successful debut albums of SBK's Wilson Phillips and Vanilla Ice have proved that, if marketed skillfully, first-time acts can score big.
The company's strategy has so far yielded hits. Although critically savaged, Wilson Phillips's debut album sold more than 5 million copies in the United States; Vanilla Ice's "To the Extreme" spent 16 weeks at No. 1 and sold more than 7 million copies.
SBK, which is considered a rare success among new record labels, hopes that Mr. Irwin's album will be its next hit. Aside from Jesus Jones's "Doubt," which recently sold a million copies after months of heavy promotion, SBK is between best-selling albums. Sales of the first Wilson Phillips recording have peaked, and the trio is only now in the studio making its second; Smokey Robinson's first album for SBK got off to a shaky start, and Vanilla Ice seems to have exhausted his tenuous appeal. The rapper's bid for screen stardom, "Cool as Ice," bombed spectacularly at the box office after its release in October. The latest Vanilla Ice single, "Cool as Ice (Everybody Get Loose)," crested at No. 81. SBK also announced last month that it was merging with Chrysalis and EMI Records, bringing layoffs to all three companies, although according to Don Rubin, SBK's vice president of artists and repertory, there are currently no plans to furlough any SBK musicians. Charles Koppelman, SBK's chairman, will head the combined companies.
The fact that "My Heart Belongs to You" squeaked into the Top 30 is no small accomplishment. But even with a minor hit, an album, a star producer (Phil Ramone, who handled some of Billy Joel's biggest albums) and a doting record company, Mr. Irwin's commercial success hinges on intangibles. Mr. Ramone points out that no matter what the album's artistic merits, or how skillfully it is promoted, it is the public that will decide "whether or not we've got the goods."
Mr. Koppelman signed Mr. Irwin after the singer played a handful of compositions on a piano in the label president's New York office in 1989, SBK's first year of operations. "His melodies, though not lyrically developed the way they should have been, had this thing that was very fresh to my ears," Mr. Koppelman says.
(SBK would not reveal the specifics of Mr. Irwin's contract. A typical deal for a first-time mainstream pop musician, however, could include an advance against royalties of around $30,000.)
Mr. Irwin studied both classical music and the music business at New York University. He is therefore far from an innocent. "My lawyer was surprised that I understood most of the jargon -- cross-collateralization, how publishing splits work," he says of his contract negotiations with SBK.
Mr. Irwin and the label hired a band to play on the record and to tour. Mr. Rubin says the label "wanted to create the self-contained feeling of a band." The ensemble rehearsed for six months while Mr. Rubin and Mr. Ramone monitored Mr. Irwin's songwriting progress.
The label arranged for Mr. Irwin to compose with a group of polished freelance songwriters, which he did, grudgingly. "I'm not a big fan of collaboration, as far as writing goes," he says. "I like to write my songs myself." In the end, Mr. Irwin wrote all but two songs on the album.
According to Mr. Rubin, about $50,000 had been spent by the time Mr. Irwin and his band entered the Power Station, a Manhattan recording studio, early last spring. They were there for three months. Hiring Mr. Ramone, with his connection to Billy Joel, another Long Islander, gave Mr. Irwin the benefit of a seasoned hand and also fit into the label's plans. SBK invokes Billy Joel's name freely in talking about Mr. Irwin. "The singer-songwriter mold was what we were looking for," says Mr. Rubin. "We used Billy Joel as a boilerplate example of what we were trying to go for with Russ."
Once the album was finished, SBK's promotional arm swung into action. "We had a major meeting where we picked the first single," says Mr. Koppelman. One option was to exploit Mr. Irwin's coltish good looks with the teen-age press.
"I said, fine, let's try it," says Mr. Irwin. But after being asked who he would most want to be stuck in an elevator with, Mr. Irwin balked, he says, and told SBK to try something else. ("I answered Clarence Thomas," Mr. Irwin says. "I don't think the interviewer knew who I was talking about.")
Because Mr. Irwin's songs range from plaintive ballads to snarling rockers, they can be played on several radio formats, from album rock to easy listening. SBK released "I Need You Now," a long number showing off Mr. Irwin's skill as a pianist, expressly to album-oriented rock stations at the same time "My Heart Belongs to You" was shipped to Top 40.
Mr. Koppelman and Daniel Glass, SBK's general manager, pleaded Mr. Irwin's case to more than 50 radio stations on a three-week promotional swing. "I wanted to explain that this is, in my view, a franchise artist for SBK, a young man with a lot of music yet to be made," Mr. Koppelman says. He made a similar junket for Wilson Phillips, though such appearances by company presidents are rare.
As a publicity stunt, the label handed out free copies of Mr. Irwin's single at the Hamptons exit of the Long Island Expressway over the Labor Day weekend. ("Those guys," says Mr. Irwin.) SBK also sent a promotional mailing to Long Island residents who had bought tickets to Genesis concerts. "We think the people who like Billy Joel, Phil Collins, are going to like Russ Irwin," explains Mr. Glass.
The label spent about $250,000 to record and promote the album, a portion of which will come out of Mr. Irwin's royalties when it starts to sell. According to an executive at SBK, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Mr. Irwin's launch was about half as costly as the splash that accompanied Wilson Phillips's debut.
The week of Sept. 14, "My Heart Belongs to You" entered Billboard's Top-100 singles chart at No. 91 after it was added to the play lists of 43 radio stations. Billboard recommended the song to radio programmers in a review that praised Mr. Irwin's "edgy vocals" and Mr. Ramone's production, and closed with the benediction: "Sounds like a smash." Five weeks later the song had climbed to No. 47 and garnered a special "Power Pick" award for its strong sales in some markets, particularly in the Northwest. "We sold 56 singles in Lewiston, Idaho," says Mr. Glass.
The song's progress slowed when it entered the competitive Top-40 section of the chart, and finally peaked at No. 28 in its ninth week. Then came the fall: No. 30, No. 55, No. 86. Last week, the single was lingering at No. 98 and the album had not appeared on the Top 200 chart at all.
What went wrong? Ballads, says Mr. Rubin, traditionally take longer to find a radio audience. By the time "My Heart Belong to You" was fading at the first stations that played it, there were not enough new stations, particularly in markets like New York and Los Angeles, adding the song to sustain its rise. Steve Wyrostok, the program director of Houston's KRBE, which was the first station to add the song to its play list, notes, "We really did believe in the record and it did fairly well -- it made it onto our Top 10. But ballads that turn out to be great performers tend to stay in the top three for five or six weeks. It never really reached that level. It wasn't in people's faces enough."
SBK is already moving on. In January, the label will release "Don't Like the Way You Look at My Love" (one of the songs Mr. Irwin did not write) and the scrabbling promotional process will begin again.
The single could do nothing at all. Then again, the record business has always taken heart in one of its truer aphorisms, that all it takes is one song.

HEADLINE: With Lottery Prizes, the Bigger the Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
M. R. Katurbus (letter, Nov. 22) argues that awarding 350 prizes of $100,000, instead of a single prize of $35 million, would make the New York State Lottery more attractive to would-be players, but does not take into consideration that New York State pays out its large prizes over a period of 20 years. 
 A prize of $100,000, spread over 20 years, means extra annual income of $5,000, or about $3,500 after taxes (with a 30 percent tax rate). The value of such a series of payments, assuming 5 percent inflation over the next 20 years, is $43,617. That's not the type of life-altering award that lottery players dream of; for most people, that might be enough to keep up with the rising cost of living.
With a jackpot of $35 million, on the other hand, a single winner is guaranteed more than $1 million net take-home pay every year for the next 20 years. With that kind of money, one can spend on luxuries previously only dreamed of and also dabble in investments with the goal of making even more money. I would rather get a shot at that kind of prize -- even if it means battling odds 350 times greater.

HEADLINE: THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT;
West Europeans Gather to Seek A Tighter Union

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, Dec. 8

 BODY:
In an atmosphere of great expectation tinged with no small apprehension, European Community leaders gathered here tonight for a crucial two-day summit meeting that should determine the region's place in the world well into the 21st century.
Their aim is to prepare the 12-nation community to compete with regional economic groups led by the United States and Japan and to exercise greater political influence in international affairs. To achieve this, they hope to speed up Europe's 34-year-old march toward political and economic integration.
They will therefore be taking up proposals to establish a single currency and a regional central bank, to move toward common foreign and security policies, to give more power to the European Parliament and to harmonize their approaches to social and environmental questions.
 
Nowhere Near Full Union
 The measures fall far short of creating anything resembling a United States of Europe. While some politicians like to evoke the centuries-old dream of full union, it is at least decades away.
Yet if approved, the changes will significantly bolster the community's existing plan to form a single regional market of 340 million consumers on Jan. 1, 1993, eventually turning what is already the world's largest trading bloc into the world's dominant financial power.
Adoption of the Maastricht agenda is far from assured. Britain, long the community's most resistant member, fears an excessive loss of sovereignty. Changes to the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which created the community, require the unanimous assent of its members, and a plan acceptable to Britain has still to be thrashed out.
Specifically, Britain remains at loggerheads with the others over how the community should manage its common foreign and security policy, over whether the 12 should move toward building an independent military capability and over when the community can dictate domestic policies.
Everything hangs on four negotiating sessions over the next two days, with the fate of the summit meeting probably unknown until late Tuesday or, as one European official put it, "the last five minutes." The meeting may even be extended to Wednesday if an accord seems within reach.
 
'Train Is About to Leave'
 "The train to European union is standing at the platform," Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany wrote this weekend, seemingly addressing Britain. "It is about to leave. Anyone who does not climb on board will not stop it from going. They will be left standing alone."
Yet, despite the real risk of an 11-to-1 deadlock, the mood was fairly upbeat as community leaders arrived in this ancient Dutch city tonight, with optimism bolstered by progress made in several disputed areas during a flurry of ministerial talks last week.
For instance, the 12 informally agreed to accommodate Britain's refusal to commit itself to a single currency by 1999. An annex to the planned treaty on monetary union should allow Britain to "opt out" if the British Parliament later blocks disappearance of the pound sterling.
Britain has also strongly objected to a passage in the draft treaty to be voted on this week that the community has a "federal" vocation, but that should no longer be an obstacle to agreement. Other governments now seem willing to change the wording to an endorsement of "ever closer union" -- if Britain makes concessions in other areas.
 
Britain to 'Give and Take'
 While wrestling with an anti-Europe group in his Conservative Party, Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, insists that he is ready to "give and take" to reach an "acceptable" agreement.
President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who have been the driving force behind this new stage of integration, have signaled that they too will show flexibility. "Britain is complicating the game," a senior French official said, "but we have never wanted Britain's exclusion."
Certainly, the two sides were much further apart when separate inter-governmental conferences on economic and monetary union and on political union began last December. Then, many governments were focusing more on the goal of union than how to achieve it. Now, under British pressure, a step-by-step approach has been adopted.
For instance, on monetary union, rather than rushing toward a single currency, community countries now accept the need for gradual "convergence" of their economies through a leveling of inflation rates and budget deficits. Similarly, before a regional central bank comes into existence, a less formal body to be known as the European Monetary Institute will be charged with coordinating the region's monetary policies.
Events outside Western Europe have underlined the community's limited ability to speak with a single, forceful voice. During the Persian Gulf war, while Britain and France sent troops to the front, the community as such lacked authority to act. More recently, the 12 have been embarrassed by their failure to settle the Yugoslav conflict.
 
Britain Wants a Veto
 Nonetheless, on the eve of the Maastricht meeting, major obstacles still stand in the way of broad agreement on foreign policy and security matters, most of them reflecting British reluctance. While agreeing that the community must act as a bloc if it is to have real power on foreign-policy questions, Britain is insisting that community positions be adopted unanimously, thus enabling it to retain a veto and avoid the risk of being outvoted.
On the sensitive question of regional defense, Britain favors strengthening a nine-nation military pact known as the Western European Union, but argues that French and German demands that it be integrated into the community could undermine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Britain is most prickly about not allowing the community to "interfere" in its domestic affairs -- specifically on police, immigration and judicial matters as well as on a broad array of social and environmental questions. Here again, it objects to community rulings through majority vote.
While Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl have much to gain politically from an agreement, both have warned that they will only go so far to appease Mr. Major. The French leader likes to remind London that he too has a veto right.
Mr. Kohl in turn believes that a stronger Europe must be a more democratic Europe, and to this end, he is demanding that new powers of "co-decision" be given to the 518-member European Parliament, which at present can discuss -- but cannot propose or block -- community laws.
 
Mitterrand Backs Kohl
 Mr. Mitterrand, who used to say the community's political authority should be exercised by governments rather than legislators or bureaucrats, has now agreed to back Mr. Kohl. Mr. Major may also accept the principle of "co-decision" with Parliament, but only in limited areas.
If the British, French and German leaders can work out their differences, most other problems will fade into insignificance. Jacques Delors, who as President of the European Commission will be the 13th person at the summit table, has complained loudly that his executive body will acquire little additional power, but he has neither vote nor veto.
Working in favor of an accord is fear of the consequences of failure. Any country considered responsible for a breakdown will inevitably face isolation and recrimination. Confidence in European currencies may slump. And the community as a whole could suffer a crisis of identity with long-term negative effects.
Born as a six-nation common market in 1957, the community has known many ups and downs over the years, including squabbles over British entry in the 1960's and economic stagnation in the 1970's. But since 1985, when it agreed to build a single market by the end of 1992, new momentum toward economic integration has also given it a stronger political voice.
The collapse of Communism and, above all, the unification of Germany abruptly changed the European scene in 1989 and 1990, but France was able to persuade its partners -- including Germany -- that the moment required the community to establish even more ambitious goals of unity.
 
Economic Union More Likely
 Many experts believe that the community will continue to advance more quickly toward economic union than political integration. Goods, services, capital and people should move freely in the region after 1992, while the prospect of a single currency and regional central bank before the end of the century will accelerate harmonization of economic policies.
With the United States, Canada and Mexico talking about a North American free trade area and Japan working hard to strengthen its trade ties in the Far East, European businessmen are strong advocates of economic union, convinced that otherwise they will be unable to compete. Already, many European companies are engaged in their own "union" through mergers.
Politically, though, community governments seem to have less of a mandate. Polls show that outside Britain, most Europeans have no clear understanding of what is at stake in Maastricht. They also suggest that ordinary citizens are far less enthusiastic than their leaders about ceding sovereignty to "foreigners."
Nonetheless, governments and businessmen agree that Europe's immediate future will be charted at Maastricht. It may be that no one emerges fully satisfied with the result -- going too far for some, not far enough for others. But, as one French official put it, "this is a process, and what isn't done now can be done later." In any event, the 12 plan to review any Maastricht treaty in 1996.

HEADLINE: DECLARING DEATH OF SOVIET UNION, RUSSIA AND 2 REPUBLICS FORM NEW COMMONWEALTH

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia declared today that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and proclaimed a new "Commonwealth of Independent States" open to all members of the former union.
In a series of statements issued after a two-day meeting at a Byelorussian government retreat, the leaders of the three Slavic republics declared void all efforts to create a new union on the ruins of the old one. But they called for the creation of new "coordinating bodies" for defense, foreign affairs and the economy that would have their seat in Minsk, the capital of Byelorussia, and decided to maintain the ruble as the common currency. 
 They declared that the "norms" and activities of the former union ceased as of the moment of signing, and that the new commonwealth assumed all international obligations of the Soviet Union, as well as control over its nuclear arsenal.
 
Gorbachev's Move
 "The U.S.S.R., as a subject of international law and geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence," the leaders declared. [Text, page A8.]
The action essentially stripped President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of his office and authority, and the immediate question was whether the tough and tenacious Soviet leader would resist -- and if he did, whether the military or other levers of power would support him.
The three cofounders of the new commonwealth -- President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine and Stanislav Shushkevich, Chairman of the Byelorussian Parliament -- were scheduled to meet on Monday with Mr. Gorbachev and with Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan and the unofficial spokesman for the Muslim republics of Central Asia.
 
Portents of Disaster
 Mr. Gorbachev had no immediate reaction. But in a taped interview with French television broadcast today, he argued fervently that the consequences of dismantling the union would make the war in Yugoslavia "a simple joke by comparison."
The Central Asian republics had all indicated an interest in retaining some form of union, and it was not immediately clear why Mr. Nazarbayev was excluded from the Byelorussian declaration, or how he would respond. Arriving in Moscow today, he declared that he was still in favor of preserving an association, and at least in maintaining joint control over the nuclear arsenal.
The predominantly Slavic republics declared that they drew their authority to dissolve the union from the fact that they were its original cofounders. They and the Trans-Caucasus republic, later divided into Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, were cosigners of the original 1922 treaty that created the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The "sphere of joint activity" assigned to the new commonwealth, however, resembled the functions that Mr. Gorbachev had sought for his new "union of sovereign states": responsibility for foreign policy, development of a "common economic space," "customs policies," transportation and communication systems, the environment and the battle against organized crime.
One major difference was that the three core Slavic republics, which together account for 73 percent of the population and 80 percent of the territory of the Soviet Union, were now inviting other republics to join, not to negotiate, a new association.
It was a stance certain to irritate the Muslim and Caucasian republics, but also one that stood to curtail the endless bickering that characterized inter-republican negotiations since the coup.
 
Clean But Dangerous Slate
 Another major difference was that the move to Minsk and the formal disbanding of the old union cleared the slate of old structures and bureaucracies, freeing the participating republics of the need to haggle with Mr. Gorbachev and the old ministries over the new order they meant to shape.
But the approach had its own dangers. If Mr. Gorbachev was one potential source of resistance, others included the potent military-industrial complex and the trade unions, which could feel threatened by new masters dedicated to reducing the budget.
Resistance could also come from national parliaments and nationalist movements, especially in Ukraine, which could see in the agreement a trick to revive the old union under a new sauce.
Yet the commonwealth appeared to be the most practical compromise. It disassociated itself from Moscow, it created a core of the most important republics, and it blocked the disintegration that threatened to destroy critical intra-republican economic ties.
 
Ruble Coin of Realm
 The agreements called for coordinated economic reforms, echoing fears in Ukraine and Byelorussia that the impending reforms in Russia would create havoc with their prices. They declared the ruble to be the currency of common commerce, and they called for mutual agreement before any new currency was introduced, responding to Russia's fear that a separate currency in Ukraine would flood Russia with excess rubles.
And they declared the Chernobyl disaster site a common responsibility, touching on the fears of all three republics that the damaged nuclear power plant would be left untended.
The leaders pledged that existing borders would remain open and unchanged, and they vowed to respect each other's sovereignty and "observe international norms of human and national rights."
On an issue that has raised considerable anxiety abroad, the leaders said they had decided "to preserve the joint command over the common military-strategic space and the single nuclear arms controlling body." There was no immediate indication, however, how the control would be shared.
Outlining the responsibilities of the central authority they proposed to form in Minsk, the agreement said: "The parties regard the following as the sphere of joint activity: the coordination of external political activity, the formation and the development of the common economic space, the European and Eurasian markets, the customs and migratory policy, the development of the transportation and communication systems, protection of the environment and ecological security, and the struggle against organized crime."
In a statement announcing the creation of the commonwealth, the leaders said that talks on forming a new union treaty had reached an impasse, while the withdrawal of republics from the Soviet Union had become a "fact of reality." The statement placed the full blame for the economic and political crisis at Mr. Gorbachev's feet, pointing out "the center's short-sighted policy."
The three leaders said the new commonwealth would be open to all members of the Soviet Union, "as well as other states sharing the aims and principles of this agreement."
A separate statement on joint economic policy declared that "preservation and development of close economic ties that have taken shape between our states is vitally important in order to stabilize the situation in the national economy and create preconditions for economic revival."
The key provision called on the three republics to coordinate their economic reforms, indicating that Ukraine and Byelorussia would follow Russia's lead in releasing prices and the ruble rate. The agreement, however, raised doubts that Mr. Yeltsin could follow his announced timetable, which called for prices to be freed on Dec. 16.
The proclamation appeared to culminate a process that began last spring, when Mr. Gorbachev finally abandoned efforts to control the union by force and opened negotiations with the republics on a new union treaty.
 
The Receding Center
 Kremlin hardliners threatened by the new arrangement staged the ill-fated coup in August. Instead of blocking the treaty, as they had intended, they undermined central authority and sent republics scurrying to declare independence.
Efforts by Mr. Gorbachev to renegotiate a new union treaty were repeatedly stymied, usually by fears among republics enjoying the first tentative taste of real self-government that any new political or economic agreement would somehow encourage the restoration of the "center."
In the end, it was the strong vote for independence in Ukraine that finally drew the curtain on Mr. Gorbachev's quest. Without Ukraine, both Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin agreed, there could be no meaningful union.
All through the week, Mr. Gorbachev railed against the Ukrainian decision. And in a rambling taped interview with Ukrainian television, broadcast today, he warned that "we are close to the limit behind which anarchy and chaos begin." Today's agreement confirmed anew the growing stature of Mr. Yeltsin as the prime arbiter of the fate of the former Soviet empire. If the Ukrainian vote was the catalyst for his decision, it was his decision to choke off spending by the center and to proceed with radical reform, with or without other republics, that first signaled the end of the central government.
The pain to Mr. Gorbachev, who launched perestroika almost seven years ago and fought a long and bitter political battle with Mr. Yeltsin, was obvious. Associates said his appeals for union were not a struggle for personal power, but an expression of the faith in a renewed union that had guided him throughout his courageous odyssey.
Yet even if Mr. Gorbachev was not immediately capable of appreciating it, the commonwealth that was being formed was not so different from the one he envisioned.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
White House Waits
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called President Bush at the White House today to tell him about the commonwealth agreement, but the White House declined to release details of that conversation or comment on the agreement.
"Yeltsin promised the President that he would send him additional information about the agreement and we're awaiting that information," said Bill Harlow, a spokesman for the White House.

HEADLINE: BACKING FOR CUBA IN SOUTH AFRICA

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The South African Communist Party concluded its first legal congress in four decades today with a spirited pledge of support for Cuba to offset the Soviet Union's desertion.
The party promised to mount a protest campaign "to expose the intrigues of U.S. imperialism against Cuba" and to raise funds for the Cuban people. 
 The solidarity expressed with Cuba was part of a package of resolutions approved at the party's four-day congress, at which hard-liners restored the party's lapsed adherence to Marxism-Leninism, an ideological orthodoxy that some other Communist parties have jettisoned, and dropped the word "democratic" from its endorsement of socialism.
The party's identification with Cuba, which some party officials say offers the closest model to what they want for South Africa, could discomfit its longstanding ally, the African National Congress, whose president, Nelson Mandela, has spent the last week in the United States seeking political and financial support.
But Chris Hani, the Communist Party's newly appointed general secretary, who also sits on the African National Congress's executive committee and is chief of staff of its military wing, said he doubted that it would object because, he said, "the A.N.C. does not hide its close bond with Cuba."
 
Role in Angola Cited
 Cuba has been popular with many militant blacks because its troops fought South African forces in Angola and because its policies are seen as improving the lives of poor Cubans.
Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Hani said Cuba had assisted the African National Congress and now needed help itself after being cut loose by the Soviet Union.
"The A.N.C. agrees with us that Cuba is an important part of the struggle of mankind for freedom, national liberation and social justice," Mr. Hani said. "The A.N.C. has got very strong links with Cuba."
The South African Communist Party said it would forge "close fraternal links" with surviving Marxist parties and would re-establish the "proletarian internationalism" of mutual support that was shattered when Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
"We want the Communist movement to regroup and reassert themselves," Mr. Hani said. "We don't want a situation where we have to fight in isolation."
The manifesto approved by the 413 delegates at the congress hailed the party as "the political vanguard of the working class, basing itself on the guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism" and said it had more members and support than ever before in its 70-year history.
After some debate, the delegates decided to describe their party as a vanguard party, a Leninist concept for a revolutionary elite, rather than as a mass party with broad appeal. Charles Nqakula, the party's new deputy general secretary, said a vanguard party did not mean a limited membership.
"Our definition of a vanguard party is a party of activists, not a party of sleeping members," Mr. Nqakula said.
Joe Slovo, the retiring general secretary, said Thursday that the party had signed up 25,000 members. According to Ronnie Kasrils, a central committee member, 75 percent of party members come from the working class, of whom 40 percent are unemployed. Most members are black.

 BODY:
Following are excerpts of a preamble and two declarations issued today by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia, as transmitted by the Soviet press agency Tass. The preamble was translated from the Russian by Reuters and the declarations were translated by The Associated Press: 
 PREAMBLE
 We, the republic of Byelorussia, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, . . . state that the U.S.S.R., as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality, is ceasing its existence.

 	 	 		. . .	 	With the aim of developing equal and mutually beneficial cooperation of the peoples and states, it has been decided to conclude special agreements in the spheres of politics, the economy, culture, education, public health, science, trade, the environment and other fields.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The members of the community . . . will strive for elimination of nuclear weapons and for total disarmament under international control. At the same time, the sides will respect each other's desire to achieve the status of nuclear-free zone and neutral state. It has been decided to preserve unified command of a common military-strategic space and united control over nuclear weapons.

 	 	 		. . .	 	From the moment of the conclusion of the agreement, the application of the norms of third countries, including the former U.S.S.R., on the territory of the states which have signed it, is not permitted, and the activity of bodies of the former union ceases.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
In New Social Era, Moynihan Sees 'New' Social Ills

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Professor Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a United States Senator with a history of flashy ideas, has a new one.
Or sort of a new one. 
 Or a new name for an old one, anyway.
For months, Senator Moynihan has been telling reporters, assistant cabinet secretaries, other senators and who knows who else that he thinks America is undergoing the kind of shift that has not happened for 100 years or so, into what he is calling the era of "post-industrial social policy."
 
A New Social Phenomenon?
 For the last 100 years, he argues, the central concern of social policy has been to blunt the destructive effects of industrialization, particularly unemployment.
While those problems clearly persist -- and have grown in the current recession -- Senator Moynihan contends that they are being overshadowed by a rise in welfare dependency so severe that it constitutes a new social phenomenon. He likens the current efforts to understand it to an earlier generation's first, fumbling attempts to measure and ameliorate unemployment.
"We think we have a new social condition," he said in a get-together that was not so much an interview as a tutorial, filled with digressions about 19th century economists, statistical sampling techniques and the like.
"Just as unemployment was the defining issue of industrialism, dependency is becoming the defining issue of post-industrial society," he said.
In talking about welfare dependency, Mr. Moynihan is also referring to related problems like family disintegration, failure in the schools and criminal behavior. Arguing that America knows precious little about the causes of these problems or about solutions for them, he has introduced legislation that would require the Government to produce an annual dependency report, full of new statistical gauges that he hopes will bring insights and increased attention.
Senator Moynihan said he could no more specify the kind of statistics that would be produced than Benjamin Franklin could diagram the internal combustion engine, but he said he hoped they could answer questions like: Why do people go on welfare? How do their children do in school? How do the problems in Oklahoma differ from Ohio's?
 
Focus on Dependency Is Goal
 "I don't know what I don't know, but I want to know a lot, lot more than we do now," he said, conjuring up a future in which the periodic issuance of dependency figures generated headlines and convened Cabinet meetings the way unemployment numbers do now.
Senator Moynihan's reputation as a trend-spotter is such that few people dismiss out of hand his proclamations, however grandiose. But some critics are quick to distinguish between the majority of welfare recipients, who spend little time on the rolls, and the smaller though substantial group for whom welfare becomes a way of life.
Others argue that Senator Moynihan's use of phrases like "post-industrial" deflects attention from large and troubling trends in the economy, including the erosion of wages for unskilled workers about which he has himself expressed concern. Those trends, they say, are responsible for some of the dependency problem.
Still others have grown weary with what they see as the Senator's record of posturing as a visionary while failing to offer solutions.
"I think Moynihan takes the figures we provide and, perhaps to emphasize his point, sometimes simplifies them for effect," said Professor Greg Duncan, a University of Michigan economist whose research is frequently drawn on by Senator Moynihan. Nonetheless, Professor Duncan said, "by and large he's concerned about the right thing."
Of course, Senator Moynihan has been worrying out loud about the rise in dependency and the collapse of the family since at least 1965, when, as a Labor Department aide he issued an explosive paper subsequently dubbed "The Moynihan Report." In it he highlighted government figures showing that a quarter of black children were being born to single mothers -- a condition he called new and alarming.
 
'We Were Right'
 The report was condemned by many blacks and liberals, who said it "blamed the victim," and for decades the condition of the black family was seldom discussed in political and academic circles.
In the meantime, the situation grew much worse: 26 percent of all American children were born to single mothers in 1988, and among blacks the figure was 64 percent.
It is not hard to detect in Senator Moynihan's current statements a note of pride in vindication. "We were right," Mr. Moynihan wrote in a September issue of the magazine America.
Now he argues that welfare dependency is so entrenched and extensive that it represents not just the worsening of an old problem but the emergence of a new, qualitatively different one. While in the past welfare dependency has fluctuated with economic conditions, he argues, it now may have reached such proportions that it has taken on a momentum of its own.
To push his case, Senator Moynihan has become a press agent of sorts, for a statistic that was drawn from a research project called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics at the University of Michigan. It concludes that 22 percent of all American children born in the late 1960's spent at least a year on welfare before the age 18. Among blacks, the figure was 72 percent.
Senator Moynihan argues that European countries are experiencing a similar onslaught of dependency, noting that about 29 percent of births in England are to unwed mothers.
In calling for the generation of new statistics, Senator Moynihan contends that it is easy to forget how little the nation once knew about cycles of wide unemployment -- a concept that baffled the world when it first arose with industrialization in the 19th century.
 
The Cart Before the Horse?
 Significantly, he says, policy makers addressed unemployment before they even knew how to measure it. Federal unemployment insurance was passed in 1935, but the first annual unemployment statistics were not published until 1946. Similarly, he says, America has been providing for dependency, through welfare, while knowing little about it.
Among those who would add caveats to Senator Moynihan's current pronouncements is Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group.
"The key development in poverty trends in the 1980's was not increases in dependency, but the erosion of wages," he said.
This draws no argument from Senator Moynihan. "That's why we need more data."
Professor Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University, shares Mr. Moynihan's view that a new social condition has emerged. But he calls it more mysterious than the rise of unemployment, and he doubts that new statistics will do much to correct it.
 
Search for Answers
 While few people question Senator Moynihan's talents for publicizing the problems of dependency, his critics say his record in offering solutions is less impressive. A 1985 article in Washington Monthly magazine showed that Senator Moynihan had a long record of reversing his positions on plans to combat dependency. "He's struck out on finding the answers," it concluded.
In 1988, Mr. Moynihan was the principal author of the Family Support Act, which requires some welfare mothers to attend work or training programs. Since then, he has alternated between celebrating the law as a revolutionary move and playing it down as a humble first step.
"He's unusual among Washington policy makers in that he focuses on the problem and not the solution," said Mr. Mead, who finds the trait a strength and a weakness. "He's not able to say he advocates anything."
Senator Moynihan shrugs off such criticism.
"I plead guilty," he said. "There are worse things to do than trying to identify a problem."

HEADLINE: Skinner Faces Task of Injecting Oil Into Rusty Domestic Policy Machine

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
As Samuel K. Skinner takes charge of the White House staff, he inherits a domestic policy apparatus that has atrophied from disuse.
An Administration's proposals to solve domestic problems, like the recession, unemployment, homelessness and the soaring cost of health care, do not come out of thin air. An organizational structure is needed to encourage the development, refinement and discussion of proposals before they can be translated into action, current and former officials say. 
 And while Democrats continually criticize Mr. Bush's domestic policy, some of the sternest critics of the policy making process are Republicans in the White House itself and elsewhere in the Administration.
They complain that John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff for the last three years, and Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, have trampled on other people in the Administration who are nominally responsible for formulating domestic policy: the White House Office of Policy Development, the White House Office of Policy Planning and the Domestic Policy Council, an advisory body of eight Cabinet officers.
 
Darman as 'Choke Point'
 A top aide to President Bush said Mr. Darman has been "the choke point on domestic policy," blocking fresh ideas that come through the pipeline in his zeal to preserve the 1990 budget agreement. Another Administration official said the domestic policy process was suffering from "oxygen depletion." A third official said that O.M.B. now stands for "One Man Band."
And a fourth said that Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman allowed few of the "family squabbles, the healthy dust-ups over policy" that used to occur in the Reagan Administration.
The officials all insisted on anonymity, recalling occasions when Mr. Sununu or Mr. Darman had scolded them for speaking to journalists. Indeed, the fear of leaks to the press is a major reason that Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman have contracted the circle of those involved in making policy.
 
Skinner's Challenge
 Mr. Sununu's resignation as chief of staff takes effect Dec. 15, but he will stay on as a counselor to the President with Cabinet rank through March 1, 1992. His departure might enhance the budget director's influence. But some officials say they think Mr. Skinner will try to open up the policy making process, as he did at the Transportation Department, so that Mr. Bush will be exposed to a wider range of opinions and recommendations.
Mr. Skinner, viewed as far more receptive than Mr. Sununu to new ideas, has vowed to change the staff he will inherit and its method of operation, if he discovers problems. But whether he can invigorate domestic policy is an open question, given the financial constraints and Mr. Bush's lack of strong ideology.
In his book "Presidential Decision Making," published in 1980 by Cambridge University Press, Roger B. Porter, who is now assistant to President Bush for economic and domestic policy, said: "A good decision-making process cannot guarantee good or wise decisions. It can, however, provide the means for the President to make his decisions intelligently and not ignorantly."
The Domestic Policy Council is theoretically the chief engine for formulating and coordinating domestic policy in the executive branch, on everything from health and education to crime, drugs and the environment. William P. Barr, the new Attorney General, is expected to become the council's chairman on Nov. 26, White House officials said. The council was headed by his predecessor, Dick Thornburgh, from August 1988 to August of this year.
 
Plea by Thornburgh
 In an interview, Mr. Thornburgh said the council "was underutilized by the White House, the President and the people who served him," and Mr. Thornburgh left no doubt that those people included Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu. But he also emphasized that it was "the President's call" to define the council's role.
In a memorandum more than a year ago, Mr. Thornburgh pleaded with Mr. Sununu to give the council a more active role as a catalyst for the formulation of domestic policy initiatives -- "a specific agenda based on the values and principles" Mr. Bush espoused in the 1988 Presidential campaign.
"At a time when the domestic agenda is obviously going to be at center stage, for the next two years at least, I am inclined to think a more active role for the D.P.C. should be an option given careful consideration by White House staff and the President himself," Mr. Thornburgh said in the memorandum, dated Nov. 15, 1990.
Mr. Sununu did not answer the memo except to tell Mr. Thornburgh, "You're doing a great job; keep up the good work," said an Administration official. The council has generated proposals for clean air legislation, tenant management of public housing and limits on medical malpractice lawsuits.
 
A Rusting Machine
 Administration officials said there was nothing inherently wrong with the structure of the domestic policy machinery -- the same basic structure President Ronald Reagan created in April 1985 to foster participation by a wide array of Government agencies. But "unused muscles atrophy," a Bush Administration official explained.
President Bush is ultimately responsible for his own domestic policy. Several officials suggested that the policy making process would be more dynamic if Mr. Bush paid more attention to it and articulated his priorities more clearly.
Mr. Bush's domestic policy is enshrined in, and constrained by, the 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes, set limits on Federal spending and prevents shifting money from the Pentagon to domestic programs.
"The budget agreement is the hieroglyphic that orders our universe, and Darman is the only cryptographer who can crack the code," said one official, noting the law's rigid, arcane rules and Mr. Darman's formidable staff of more than 500 at the budget office.
Thomas Bruce, a spokesman for the budget office, said there would be no formal response to the unfavorable comments about Mr. Darman.
 
Nebulous Health Policy
 The Bush Administration's difficulty in formulating health policy illustrates its neglect of the established policy making machinery. In his State of the Union Message in January 1990, Mr. Bush announced a Domestic Policy Council review of soaring health costs and the problems of 34 million people with no health insurance.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, studied the issue exhaustively and prepared a package of recommendations, but they have not been formally discussed or analyzed by the Domestic Policy Council. Meanwhile, Mr. Darman has set up a little shop in the Office of Management and Budget to sift through all proposals for overhauling the nation's health-care system. Hounded by Democrats, Mr. Bush now says he hopes to have "a comprehensive health care plan that I can vigorously take to the American people" in the 1992 campaign.
In his 1980 book, Mr. Porter, the White House aide, said there should be more than one channel for transmitting policy advice and recommendations to the President. He strongly endorsed a system of "multiple advocacy," to expose the President to competing arguments and to avoid the suppression of conflicting views.
Members of the White House staff and Presidential appointees in several Cabinet departments said the ideal described by Mr. Porter has been impossible to achieve because Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu have so dominated the formulation of domestic policy.
The White House Bulletin, a newsletter published daily by Paul Roellig, a former White House aide under Presidents Reagan and Bush, reported this week a widespread feeling in the Administration that creative ideas were unwelcome if they came from officials outside "the Sununu-Darman axis."

NHK of Japan Ends Plan for Global News Service

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 8

 BODY:
Japan's semiofficial broadcasting giant, NHK, is abandoning its plans to start a worldwide 24-hour news service to compete with the Cable News Network and the British Broadcasting Corporation.
NHK's proposal for a Global News Network had promised to become Japan's first journalistic voice around the world, an Asian counterpoint to Western-dominated broadcasts. While industry analysts were skeptical whether the broadcaster could assemble the journalistic talent for such an undertaking, few of them had doubted that NHK, formally known as Nippon Hoso Kyokai, could find the money to take on its American and European rivals. 
 But on Friday, at a luncheon for foreign correspondents, Mikio Kawaguchi, NHK's new chairman, said that while the project "seemed feasible until the summer," further investigation showed that "setting up GNN is totally out of the question."
 
A Question of Costs
 With Japan's economy slowing, Mr. Kawaguchi said, NHK now feared that it could not afford to spend up to $800 million a year on the Global News Network.
Although the time frame had never been specified, if the new satellite network had been started it would have propelled NHK into the broadcasting big leagues, especially against the BBC, with which it is most often compared. The Global News Network was the idea of NHK's former chairman, Keiji Shima, a newsman-turned-executive who ruled NHK with an iron hand and had long complained that CNN was "trying to force U.S. news on the rest of the world."
Because Mr. Shima was so committed to the project, which he proposed last year, NHK was expected to proceed with the Global News Network. NHK was to provide eight hours of programming a day, specializing in coverage of Asia. Eight more hours would have been provided by a partner in Europe and another eight hours would have come from a partner in the United States. The BBC and ABC were often mentioned as possible partners, but no definite agreements had been reached.
All of the broadcasts would have been in English and the headquarters of the project would have been in New York -- presumably to be in a more central time zone and to further distinguish the network from NHK's news operation in Japan.
The project ran into trouble, however, as soon as Mr. Shima was forced out of office earlier this year in a bizarre scandal involving accusations that he lied to the Japanese Parliament over his whereabouts during the failed launching of an NHK satellite. Mr. Shima had testified that he attended the launching in the United States; it later turned out that at the time he was involved in a sexual liaison with an NHK employee.
 
Journalistic Limitations Seen
 Though the reasons offered for canceling the plans were largely financial, many of those familiar with the project say the real problems were journalistic. In times of world crisis -- most recently during the Persian Gulf war -- NHK's own news reports seemed well behind other news organizations. In fact, the network had to rely heavily on CNN, which it rebroadcasts on one of its channels, and on ABC, with which it has had a long relationship.
In Asia, NHK is still regarded with some suspicion because of Japan's years of colonial rule over Korea and Taiwan, then known as Formosa. Several countries sharply limit satellite broadcasts from Japan, saying that they fear cultural domination from their former colonial ruler. Mr. Kawaguchi noted the other day that because of restrictions in Asia, "it is quite questionable whether we can get enough news to cover eight hours."
The conservative network has also run into news-gathering problems in Japan. Although it raises its money largely from subcriptions paid by Japanese viewers, NHK is closely tied to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and it has gained a reputation for moving very slowly on reports that seem potentially embarrassing to the country's leadership. Its news programming in Japan has steadily lost market share to privately run networks.
Nonetheless, NHK now runs an increasing number of English-language broadcasts in Japan, including one nightly general news program and one focusing on business and finance. Mr. Kawaguchi said that "we will keep the concept or spirit of the Global News Network," but added that he had concluded that "as a business, it is not feasible."

HEADLINE: U.S. Communists' Meeting Has Its Own Fractionalism

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Communist Party of the United States of America, its meeting hall decked with mementoes of its glory days in the 1930's, its leadership surrounded by guards and its membership bitterly divided, ended its quadrennial convention in Cleveland Dec. 8 after repudiating the policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Boris N. Yeltsin and other former comrades.
There was no indication, however, that the former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union or the current President of the Russian Republic noticed or cared. 
 At the end of the convention, the party leadership, under criticism as "fossilized," told 600 fractious delegates that the party would "struggle to defnyend the living standards of Americans and change the political direction of the country," a convention spokesman said. During the gathering, the leadership also showed it had the muscle to silence or shut out many of those who wanted to change thw party's own political direction.
 
Hotel Command Center
 Unlike the hard-line leaders of the failed Soviet coup, who tried and failed to secure the nerve centers of an entire nation last August, the leadership of the party here had to secure only the sixth floor of the Sheraton City Center. They succeeded, with the help of armed Cleveland police officers, hired at the request of party leaders.
This accomplished, Gus Hall, party chairman since 1959, took to the floor on Friday for a three-hour speech, vowing to continue the struggle for socialism and excoriating the dissidents in his own ranks -- a group that includes some of the country's best-known Communists, Angela Davis among them.
"Factionalism is usually the work of the enemy from within," Mr. Hall told the convention, which represented 3,000 dues-paying party members. "The fight against factionalism is a fight against alien concepts and alien practices with the party."
The dissidents smiled sardonically about the irony: the leader of a party whose members were once persecuted by police, and whose ideas were once denounced as an "alien ideology" issuing the same denunciations and calling on police to protect him.
 
Dissidents Stay Private
 But few dissidents, who are largely from Northern California, New York, Minnesota and Massachusetts, would talk to a reporter. "We don't want to air our dirty Lenin in public," said one.
Even Michael Bayer, the head of the convention's press committee, said that the dissidents had a significant following, though he added, "I doubt it numbers 10 percent" of the dues-paying membership. One dissident, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said that their actual numbers were as high as 900 nationwide.
There were enough of them in Cleveland to fill a 250-seat hall at the Convention Center, across the street from the hotel. Dissidents spent the weekend shuttling between the hotel and the convention center carrying news bulletins to comrades who were excluded.
But there were not enough of them to dislodge Mr. Hall from the leadership.
The two groups were divided by a variety of issues. One was their response to the Soviet coup. Both opposed it, but the dissidents think Mr. Hall's condemnation was late and ambivalent. A second was their analysis of the collapse of Soviet Communism.
"It's like driving somewhere in a car," said one dissident who also spoke only on condition of anonymity. "What matters is where you're going. A few little clinks and rattles don't bother you, as long as you know where you're going. But when the transmission and the gearbox fall out, you have to worry about the car and how it's made."
But Mr. Bayer rejected the notion that the vehicle of Communist social organization had broken down.
"This is human error," he said, explaining the events in the Soviet Union. "They dismantled the social and economic mechanism and they didn't replace it with anything."
The weekend's internecine warfare seemed an anachronism, more suited to the 1930's, when there were bitter doctrinal disputes and American party members flocked to the Soviet Union to build Communism, than to the end of 1991, when Soviet citizens are flocking to the West or begging capitalist to invest in their country.
 
Odd Convention Scene
 It was doubly surreal in the happy-talk setting of the hotel. In the lobby tearoom, a tuxedo-clad pianist played "As Time Goes By," a foreign businessman discussed sites for a new Honda plant, the people wearing the badges of "disenfranchised delegates" talked about dumping the leadership and the hard-liners' yellow-ribboned "security" officials walked around, whispering into walkie-talkies.
Despite the bitterness, memories of the past were poignant for several generations at the assembly.
Ms. Davis, who joined in 1966, did not attend the convention but sent her fellow party members a wistful letter.
"Like many comrades, I still feel very much connected to the popular progressive struggles of our time," she wrote. "But I do not feel that as a party we have maintained a vital link to those realities."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Effort Seen To Lower Prime Rate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Many analysts expect the Federal Reserve Board to follow its move last Friday easing monetary policy with additional moves in a few weeks to bring down the prime rate, now at 7.5 percent. That would put more downward pressure on long-term interest rates, including home mortgages.
But after 30 months of watching the Fed push down short-term rates, investors and economists are becoming more convinced that lower rates alone cannot quickly put the economy on track. 
 True, the Fed's rate reductions are probably preventing a more severe economic downturn. But its control over long-term rates -- and the influence of interest rates in general on economic activity -- is limited, so monetary policy alone cannot quickly restore consumer spending and confidence.
 
Not a 'Jump-Start'
 "Every drop in rates helps a little, but I don't think that lower interest rates -- even lower rates for long-term bonds, which have been slow to fall -- are going to jump-start the economy," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., an affiliate of Chase Manhattan Bank.
While businesses are using less than 80 percent of existing capacity and consumer spending is sluggish, Mr. Fine said, there is not much incentive for companies to borrow and expand, though lower rates do help corporate profits and make some expansion projects slightly more attractive.
In the housing market, another part of the economy that is sensitive to rate changes, mortgage rates are already well below the levels of 10 percent or more that prevailed in 1988, a year in which the economy grew by more than 3 percent and about 1.5 million housing units were started.
 
Weakness in Housing
 Despite the steady drop in mortgage rates to as low as 8.5 percent for fixed-rate loans and below 6 percent for adjustable-rate mortgages, construction of new homes remains weak, at an average annual rate of just under 1.05 million units in the three months that ended Oct. 31. Home-building activity is up only slightly from the first three months of the year, when new units were started at an annual rate of 915,000.
While new construction is not booming, mortgage lenders say borrowing activity is increasing, particularly among homeowners who can lower their monthly payments by refinancing old high-rate mortgages. On a $100,000 fixed-rate mortgage, for example, each 1/8-point reduction in the mortgage rate reduces the monthly payment by nearly $10.
"I'm encouraged by the increased activity, but the housing market is still being held back by questions about the economy," said Jerry Butler, a managing director at the Countrywide Funding Corporation, a mortgage banking company in Pasadena, Calif. "Too many people are wondering whether they will still have a job next month."
One problem for the housing market is that long-term interest rates have not declined nearly so much as short-term rates. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds -- the benchmark for fixed-rate home mortgages and long-term corporate borrowing -- is about 7.84 percent, down only about 1.3 percentage points from 9.17 percent in April 1989, when the decline in short-term rates began.
In that same period, the Fed-controlled rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market -- a closely watched benchmark for rates like certificates of deposit and the prime -- has fallen to about 4.5 percent, down from 9.84 percent in April 1989.
The relatively small drop in bond yields has puzzled many analysts, particularly since it comes at a time when inflation is expected to remain low, which would normally increase the demand for long-term bonds, driving up their prices and lowering their yields.
One reason may be a widely circulating fear that Congress and the President will not make tax cuts and stimulative spending until after the Fed has eased monetary policy further. Such tardy fiscal stimulus, combined with the Fed's previous easing of monetary policy, could make for more inflation late next year or in 1993.
 
Strength in Notes
 Among other explantions for high bond yields, Robert Andres, a partner at Martindale Andres & Godshalk, an investment advisory firm, noted that investors have generally done better with intermediate-term Treasury notes than 30-year Treausry bonds. Consequently, he said, the bond market lacks enough traders and speculators to buy bonds and push long rates back down to the 7.5 percent level that prevailed for much of 1986 and 1987.
Stephen Smith, an executive vice president at Brandywine Asset Management, noted that the high level of Treasury bond yields reflects in part the availability of higher bond yields in Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, combined with the weakening of the dollar.
Mr. Smith and other analysts also blame high Treasury bond yields on selling by Japanese investors, who were major buyers in the middle and late 1980's.
Thomas G. Gribbon, a senior Treasury bond trader at Nomura Securities in New York, said there had been substantial selling of Treasury bonds, including zero-coupon issues, this year. But he noted that in recent weeks, the selling has become more sporadic, and its impact has probably been exaggerated by Wall Street rumors.
Whatever the amount of Japanese selling, it has been enough to reduce the price of long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds to such a level that their yield is now higher than that of the same bonds with interest coupons intact. Late last week, the 30-year zero-coupon issues were offered at about 9.25, or $92.50 per $1,000 bond, to yield about 8.18 percent.
 
Many Corporate Issues
 While the decline in bond yields may be a disappointment to economic policy makers, it has been well received by corporate treasurers. Last week, more than $6.1 billion of new corporate bonds were offered, led by the first long-term public offering by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company since 1985. The weekly total was more than half the average monthly volume for the year.
Investment bankers expect another active week as corporations try to take advantage of lower rates and complete their offerings before investors and securities dealers begin retrenching for the holiday season.
Several companies are poised to issue securities when the 30-year Treasury bond yield drops to 7.75 percent, a level reached briefly Friday.

Last Day For Dallas Times Herald

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The Dallas Times Herald, the city's oldest daily newspaper, ceases publication today after slowly losing ground in advertising and circulation for more than a decade against its archrival, The Dallas Morning News.
The A. H. Belo Corporation, the Dallas-based company that owns The Morning News, announced yesterday that it had bought most of The Times Herald's assets, including presses and circulation lists, for $55 million. 
 Antitrust law would normally prohibit such an acquisition by a direct competitor, but John Buzzetta, principal owner and publisher of The Times Herald, said yesterday that in the last year he had unsuccessfully approached more than 100 prospective buyers. Late last week, the Justice Department approved the sale of The Times Herald, which was established in 1879, to The Morning News.
 
An Intense Rivalry
 On Sunday morning, Mr. Buzzetta told Roy E. Bode, editor of The Times Herald, that the paper was closing, and Mr. Bode began summoning his staff to prepare for the final issue.
"While it wasn't unexpected, I didn't know it was going to hurt this much," said Molly Ivins, a Times Herald columnist. Comparing the two papers, she added, "The Herald had the guts and the writers; The News had the money and the circulation."
In fact, both papers had moments of excellence, and their intense rivalry -- one of the few remaining battles between independently owned newspapers in the same city -- had enriched Dallas since The Times Herald began to challenge the pre-eminence of The Morning News in the early 1970's.
The Times Herald won Pulitzer Prizes in 1964, 1980 and 1983, The Morning News in 1986, 1989 and 1991.
In the late-1970's, The Times Herald's Sunday circulation briefly overtook that of The Morning News, the city's Republican and more conservative newspaper. The Herald's traditional readership was Democratic and blue-collar.
But The Herald eventually succumbed because of a local economy that has been depressed for five years and the inherent disadvantages of being the smaller, traditionally afternoon paper in an era when few cities can support two dailies.
Last month, The Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock was sold to its rival, The Arkansas Democrat, and closed. But in that case, The Democrat had successfully shifted from afternoon to morning publication and overwhelmed the city's long-dominant paper, The Gazette.
The Herald had tried the same approach, but it failed.
 
Investment by Times Mirror
 In 1970, when The Herald was acquired by the Times Mirror Company, owner of The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, it trailed The Morning News in overall circulation but had the lead in Dallas County. The two papers essentially divided the city's newspaper advertising.
Times Mirror invested heavily in The Times Herald in the mid-1970's and turned it into an all-day paper, which put it head-to-head with The News in the morning.
But in 1980, Times Mirror acquired The Denver Post, which was locked in a battle with The Rocky Mountain News, and it named the publisher of The Times Herald to manage The Denver paper as well. At about that time, The Morning News was roused by The Times Herald's aggressiveness and proved to be a sleeping giant.
The momentum began to turn against The Times Herald, and the paper never recovered.
 
Sold Twice in the 80's
 Times Mirror sold both The Times Herald and The Denver Post to William Dean Singleton, chief executive of Media News Group Inc., in the mid-1980's, and Mr. Singleton sold The Herald to Mr. Buzetta and a group of investors in 1988.
In recent years, The News's advantage in circulation had become a rout.
The Times Herald's daily circulation was 201,000, compared with 407,000 for The News, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Sunday circulation of The Times Herald was 289,000, compared with 618,000 for The Morning News.
Similarly, in 1990 The Morning News had 62 percent of total newspaper advertising, and the gap was widening because in hard economic times, when advertising is scarce, the dominant paper tends to get more. For instance, The Morning News had nearly 68 percent of the classified advertising for the first 10 months of the year, compared with 63.5 percent in the period a year earlier.
Mr. Buzzetta said The Times Herald would not declare bankruptcy and would use the $55 million purchase price to pay suppliers and provide 60 days' severance pay to its 900 employees.
He said his equity partner, Equitable Capital Management, and its bank, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, had cooperated in the negotiations. He said the price he had paid for the paper -- reported to have been $140 million -- was excessive, but declined to say what he had paid.
"We're obviously selling for less than we paid," he said.
In 1989, Belo formed a partnership with Universal Press Syndicate, which removed all of its syndicated columns and comic strips from The Herald. The move stripped The Herald of some of its most popular features, including "Dear Abby" and "Doonesbury," and the paper sued on the grounds that Universal did not have the right to cancel its contracts.
Though The Herald lost the court battle, it appealed. Belo announced yesterday that the matter had been settled through payment of $1.5 million to The Herald.
 
Belo Declined Joint Effort
 A year ago, Mr. Buzzetta tried to persuade The Morning News to agree to merge the production and business aspects of the papers in a joint operating arrangement that would have allowed The Times Herald to survive as a news organization. But Belo declined, on the grounds that such a deal was not in the financial interests of its shareholders.
Burl Osborne, publisher and editor of The Morning News, said that paper estimated that about 135,000 of The Herald's daily circulation and 165,000 of the Sunday circulation did not subscribe to The News.
Mr. Osborne said The News would offer jobs to some Herald employees and add some of the paper's syndicated features.

HEADLINE: Environmentalists Assess Corporate Pollution Records

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The Mobil Corporation may be responsible for cleaning up wastes at 47 sites under the Federal Superfund program, a fact not disclosed in the company's annual report.
A subsidiary of the Amoco Corporation tried to install hazardous-waste incinerators on Indian lands, ostensibly to avoid state and Federal emissions regulations. 
 The American Cyanamid Company releases four times as much toxic waste into the environment per $1,000 of sales as the average chemical company.
These nuggets of information -- not denied by the companies involved -- are in a series of environmental profiles being published by the Council on Economic Priorities, a nonprofit group in New York that monitors social policies of large corporations. The reports are intended to appeal to socially conscious investors and to encourage companies to minimize pollution.
The council's reports are part of a growing effort by public interest and environmental groups to examine and publish analyses of the vast amounts of environmental data that the Government has required companies to file in recent years. Early next year, the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based organization that conducts investment research for university endowments and pension funds, will publish statistical summaries of the environmental performance of all 500 companies in the Standard & Poor's index.
Both organizations sell their research, but are operated on a nonprofit basis.
While not refuting many of the specific statements in the council reports, the companies contend that the documents distort their environmental performance by dwelling largely on past problems.
Other groups are digging into environmental data as well. Friends of the Earth, for instance, issued a critical 112-page study of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company's environmental performance in August in response to television advertisements the company has run that depict animals applauding Du Pont's decision to use double-hull oil tankers. The group said the Du Pont study was the first of a series of reports on what it calls "corporate environmentalism."
The new reports come in addition to the annual compilations of toxic emissions issued by Citizens Fund, another public advocacy group.
Industrial companies are required by the Government to report their emission levels for several hundred chemicals believed to be toxic, even if the emissions are within permitted limits. Citizen Fund aggregates the plant-by-plant data submitted by the companies and characterizes the chemical as acutely toxic, cancer causing or linked to birth defects. Since the data were first published three years ago, many major corporations, including Du Pont, Mobil and the Monsanto Company, have announced programs to cut their emissions sharply.
Some officials of environmental groups have said that publication of the toxic emission data has had a more powerful effect on reducing pollution than 20 years of regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency. William Reilly, the administrator of E.P.A., described the data as "one of the most important tools we have to reduce toxic emissions."
 
Range of Environmental Criteria
 The new reports go beyond toxic emissions to look into data concerning E.P.A. enforcement actions and fines paid, Superfund liabilities reported in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and published accounts of environmentally related incidents. Alice Tepper Marlin, the director of the Council on Economic Priorities, said the reports came in response to requests by users of the group's other research services.
"The environment has emerged as the No. 1 concern with much of our audience," she said. The group also publishes "Shopping for a Better World" and "The Better World Investment Guide," both of which rank companies on a variety of social criteria, including advancement of women and minorities, animal testing and charitable giving.
Margaret Carroll, executive director of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, said investors were beginning to realize that sloppy environmental policies could hamper the financial performance of companies. "This is not so much a moral or ethical issue as one that potentially affects the bottom line," she said. "There may be indications in the data of future liabilities."
One example, said Scott Fenn, another official of Investor Responsibility, is Superfund liabilities. Legally, each company involved in a site is liable for the complete cost of cleanup, although in practice the cost is usually spread among several companies.
Knowing that one company has dozens of Superfund liabilities and has paid large fines for environmental violations could help an investment manager evaluate it against another that has little liability and few fines.
Ms. Tepper Marlin said the 35 companies covered in the first set of reports were given an opportunity to review the findings and supply additional material.
 
Mobil's Protest
 A sampling of the companies involved indicates they are uncomfortable with the council's analysis, even when some of their responses are included in final drafts. In a letter to Jonathan Schorsch, the council's project director, Mobil described its profile as "incomplete and unwarranted."
In particular, the company objected to the council's use of published accounts of environmental incidents without any effort to check the underlying facts. "Conclusions reached in the profile appear to be based, at least in part, upon a combination of limited factual information and unproven newspaper allegations, media perceptions and incomplete reports," the company said in a six-page letter to the council.
At Amoco, Walter R. Quanstrom, the vice president for environmental affairs and safety, "commended" the group for including many of the company's comments, but questioned what he called a misplaced emphasis on a small subsidiary.
Mr. Quanstrom said it was true that the company's Waste-Tech Services unit opened negotiations with some Indian groups about building incinerators on their land, but said the company backed away from the proposal and none was actually built.
"Waste Tech represents less than one one-hundredth of Amoco's revenues, but they have a whole page on it," Mr. Quanstrom said. "I think that is a wee bit overplayed."
Mr. Quanstrom of Amoco said he had observed a trend toward measuring the environmental performance of companies much the way financial performance has long been analyzed. "I think what we're going to do is develop some rules," he said, "so that apples are measured against apples."
Charlotte Cuff, public affairs director for American Cynamid, said that the council had not used most of the material her company provided in support of its position and that the council added allegations after the company reviewed an early draft. The report, she said, "should have little credibility as a source of information."
The Council on Economic Priorities plans to profile an aditional 100 companies next year and plans to be monitoring 500 by 1996. The individual reports are available on a sliding- fee scale ranging from $20 for individuals and small nonprofit institutions to $100 for corporations.
The Investor Responsibility Research Center, in contrast to the 20- to 50-page reports issued by the council, confines its statistical summaries to two pages.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Some Holiday Traditions Fall Victim to the Recession

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS the advertising industry's recession continues, its traditional holiday-time largesse toward employees has noticeably diminished.
A growing number of shops across the country, particularly in the Northeast, are reducing or even eliminating holiday bonuses, parties and other special seasonal rewards for employees. Some, though, are trying to make up for that, by offering alternative compensation. And some, hoping to turn thoughts to those less fortunate, are encouraging agency-wide charitable activities. 
 That is to not to say that the Grinch will be visiting every address on Madison Avenue; many agencies are adhering to their annual holiday plans. But the pervasiveness of the cutbacks is yet another reminder of the industry's economic plight.
For instance, most of Young & Rubicam Inc.'s agencies are canceling general staff bonuses, a spokesman said. Last year, there were cash bonuses, typically about 5 percent, based on salaries.
Although the general bonuses have been eliminated, the spokesman added, Y.& R. intends to continue "a fairly aggressive program of incentive bonuses," the spokesman said.
While bonuses will still be awarded at the Leo Burnett Company, a spokesman said, the agency's annual contribution to its employees' profit-sharing fund will be cut slightly. It is only the second time that has occurred since the fund was established in 1943.
At DDB Needham Worldwide's New York office, managers will not get the bonuses -- 1 percent of salary -- they received last year, a spokesman said, adding that all other employees will receive them. At the agency's Chicago office, he continued, the 1 percent bonus that everyone received last year has been modified; it will be given only to employees who earn less than $50,000 a year.
In lieu of a cash bonus at McCann-Erickson Inc., a spokeswoman said, employees will receive extra vacation days; offices will close at noon on Dec. 24 and reopen on Dec. 30.
Several agencies giving employees time off are asking them to devote that time to altruistic pursuits.
Dec. 20 will be "J. Walter Volunteer Day" at the six nationwide offices of J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., a spokeswoman said. Under the program, which began last year at Thompson New York, employees will have the day off to perform volunteer work for local charitable organizations.
The New York office of Thompson's sibling agency, Ogilvy & Mather, is adopting the program this year, a spokeswoman said, sponsoring a "corporate service day" on Dec. 17. Several agencies in Philadelphia plan a similar program, called "the heart of advertising."
Other agencies are making donations of cash rather than time. For the second consecutive year, BBDO and Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc. will each donate to charities money that was earmarked for office parties, spokeswomen for those agencies said.
One agency maintaining its holiday traditions says that continuity is particularly welcome in a year like this.
"People are working really hard, and they look forward to it all," said Joseph P. Mack, chairman and chief executive of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York, where employees will receive their regular bonus, a week's salary and a party.
"If we can afford it," he added, "it's the first thing to do."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
A New Movie House Revives Memories Of the Good Old Days

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
Before the multi-plexes of the 1970's and 1980's, before the advent of art theaters in the 1950's, moviegoing in Manhattan was something else.
Walking into the lobby of the old Roxy Theater, which stood at the corner of Seventh Avenue and 50th Street, was like entering the reverie of the manicurist played on the Roxy screen by Alice Faye. Here was Sleeping Beauty's castle, the pilasters of its towering keep molded in plaster, its trysting alcoves equipped with drinking fountains, staffed by ushers who looked as if they had been shanghaied from the chorus of "The Student Prince." 
 Like so many great movie theaters built in the 1920's and 1930's, the Roxy represented a particularly American kind of decadence, exotic but clean-cut and family oriented.
Only one other theater could lord it over the Roxy: Radio City Music Hall, when movies accompanied by stage shows were its principal source of income. Radio City was Manhattan's class act. It was vast and vaguely totalitarian in its efficiency. It was also a monument to the forgetfulness it could offer at modest prices to more people (6,000) at a single sitting than any other theater in the country.
It wasn't a place to encourage the rowdies. Its thick carpets absorbed all thought of horseplay. Also anxiety. The sheer size washed the brain, making the patron feel small, comfortably infantile.
Theaters then were named the Paradise, the Riviera, the Albee, the Fox and (on Chicago's North Shore) El Teatro del Lago. They were names to suggest escape, or to celebrate the buccaneers who built them.
In this era of multi-plexes, with common lobbies sometimes serving as many as 9, 10 or 12 theaters, going to the movies is no longer an esthetic experience in itself. Indeed, it's often as infuriating as a visit to the Department of Motor Vehicles, when you don't know which queue you're in until you get to the head of the line.
There will be no doubt about that at the Lincoln Center Film Society's spanking new Walter Reade Theater, which opens today and which may well be the most inviting new movie house to open in New York in years.
The theater doesn't turn back the clock all the way to the 1920's, but it accommodates our romanticized moviegoing past without denying the practicalities of the present.
The Walter Reade has the style of an art house, updated for our time. It acknowledges that the movies we watch today are a mix of the contemporary and the classical, those films that make up the heritage that didn't exist, or wasn't yet recognized, when the old movie theaters were new, or even middle-aged.
It's a handsome, comparatively small (268 seats) but spacious house of nervy character, seemingly unencumbered by the sobriety and uplift of its high-art context. It has its own entrance (off the plaza of the center's new Samuel B. and David Rose Building), unattached to any Walter Reade 2 or 3, or even to the Film Society whose headquarters it shares.
When you buy your ticket, $7 for each of its four different daily shows ($5 for Film Society members), you know that you are going to the movies, not to a museum. That's not to put down museums, but to emphasize the successful way in which the Walter Reade bridges the gap between art and commerce.
There is even a lobby concession stand: popcorn, soda and brownies, though no hot dogs and sauerkraut as yet. The theater's seats, which would seem to be as big and comfortable as those in M-G-M Air's first-class, are equipped with holders for drinks. No need to plop the paper cup down on the floor, first to be forgotten, then to be absently kicked over to drench the running shoes of the person in front.
These are only the amenities, though. It's the auditorium that counts, and the Walter Reade's is no shoe box with a smallish screen at the far end. Its screen is big and dominant, the ceiling high and the room's length in agreeable proportion to its width. The floor is sloped in front, then sharply raked to provide good sightlines from virtually every seat. It will take someone seven feet tall with a pumpkin-shaped head to obscure the subtitles here.
The decor is as eclectic as the theater's programming policy, and discreetly suggests the more florid look of the Ziegfeld Theater, the 1,151-seat house built by Walter Reade Jr., the exhibitor for whom the Lincoln Center house is named.
Reade died in 1973 in a skiing accident in Switzerland. He was a tall, flamboyant man, who wore a white carnation in his buttonhole and liked to be recognized. He would appreciate the fact that he is now identified with Manhattan's most attractive, most elegant small house, as well as with the Ziegfeld, which has evolved into the best big theater in the city.
The Ziegfeld and the 1,525-seat Astor Plaza are the last two theaters in New York where it's possible to see a film such as "Lawrence of Arabia" in the only way that it can be seen, on a large screen that reveals its original glory. Though they are relatively new, the Ziegfeld and the Astor Plaza evoke the memory of the great movie palaces that were designed to compete with each other, not with television and home video.
To assert itself, especially during the Great Depression, each theater developed its own magical personality. Movies came and went, but the theater was a continuing presence in the community. It might lure you in, even if the current attraction didn't.
Movie palaces were convenient. You entered and left at your own whim. Films were shown around the clock; there was no nonsense about intermissions. Tickets were cheap and, in summer, there was air-conditioning.
To be honest about them, though, they were not always the best places to see movies. They were drafty. Dust accumulated on the plaster cupids. The light on the screen was often dim. As time passed them by, they turned into barns. Conceived to have more character than the films they presented, they eventually became grotesque. When audiences dwindled and expenses rose, they had to go.
There are sound economic reasons for multi-plexes, but not for the manner in which most of them have been designed and run. We've leaped from a time when movie theaters had too much character to a time when most have none at all. Up to a point, a movie theater should be anonymous. The film is the thing, but too much anonymity also palls.
To understand the possibilities, compare two large West Side operations, the Worldwide Cinemas, which has six theaters that are efficient and comfortable, though the space is huge, with the Chelsea Cinemas, an eight-theater complex that has all the charm of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
There are balances to be struck, sometimes beautifully, as at the Angelika Film Center, six theaters and a big airy lobby in a magnificent old Stanford White building. Also, the Film Forum, three spotless theaters that show, week in and week out, a greater variety of consistently interesting films than any other complex in Manhattan (though I know one man who goes there mostly for the great espresso).
The upscale standbys remain: the Cinema 1, the Cinema 2, the Baronet, the Coronet, the Lincoln Plaza, the Beekman and the fine old Paris Theater, now called the Fine Arts.
It is this group to which the Walter Reade belongs. New York's newest even has a screen curtain, something that I thought had gone out of style. The Walter Reade's deep green draperies mask the large white eye that, before the show starts at other theaters, stares out to accuse you of possibly wasting your time. There is nothing emptier than a movie screen without shadows.
The Walter Reade's bill today: Sergio Rubini's "Station," a new film from Italy; Euzhan Palcy's "Sugar Cane Alley" (1983), and the splendiferous "On the Town," directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, which will be shown twice. "On the Town" originally opened here as the 1949 Christmas attraction at -- where else? -- Radio City Music Hall.

World Cup '94: Genie Is Out of the Bottle

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
In less than one hour yesterday at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden, 141 national soccer teams were efficiently matched with their alibis, with their worst nightmares, and with their impossible paths to glory.
When the 1994 World Cup qualifying draw was done and the hostess, Barbara Eden, the actress, had mispronounced the name of her last soccer celebrity, delegates from six regions of the world wondered aloud if they would ever reach the shores of the United States in 31 months' time for the greatest sports spectacle of them all. 
 "England, Holland, Poland and Norway gave problems to Italy," said Sepp Piontek, an official with the Turkish Soccer Federation. "Our group could not be much worse."
 
22 Will Qualify
 After nearly two years of home-and-home qualifying matches, 22 of these nations will qualify for the first World Cup ever in the United States. Germany, as the defending champion, and the United States, as the host country, hold automatic berths, avoiding the pratfalls but also the toughening that comes with an arduous qualification process.
Yesterday, some preplanned emergency maneuvering by FIFA, soccer's international governing body, avoided potential disaster on a global scale. When the little ball that contained the name of Iraq was plucked at the worst conceivable moment, that country was immediately removed from Saudi Arabia's group and safely placed with China. Soccer tantrums can be as violent as those over oil, or territory.
"Over all, the groups are well-balanced," decided Franz Beckenbauer, who was coach of the West German team that won in Italy in 1990. "It would be difficult to choose between one and another."
Still, there were interesting matchups, from a purely soccer standpoint: Argentina was matched with Colombia, Paraguay and Peru in Group A of South America, competing for only one guaranteed spot and another berth that would require two more qualifying games; evenly matched Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Wales (plus Cyprus) would have to travel to the remote Faroe Islands, to play on that tiny nation's brand-new, first grass field, and the fractured Soviet Union was matched with chaotic Yugoslavia, Hungary, Greece, Iceland and Luxembourg, in a wide-open grouping that could produce a surprising survivor among its two qualifiers.
 
Europeans Not Pleased
 As usual, the loudest post-draw whining came from the powerful European sides, who found many things wrong or worrisome with their draws.
The delegations from England and the Netherlands agreed to a summit on Jan. 26 in Amsterdam to discuss security arrangements for the naughtiest fans on the continent.
"It's not as much of a headache as it was three or four years ago, I hope," Graham Kelly, general secretary of the English Soccer Federation, referring to the prospect of fan violence. "At least we're not in with Ireland this time."
The travel agent for the Northern Ireland Soccer Federation could not believe his misfortune at drawing the only seven-nation grouping in Europe, including not one, but two, of the new Baltic nations. Lichtenstein was an 11th-hour dropout from the draw because of this very same threat.
"This is a nightmare in logistics," said David Segel, who must arrange round trips for the Northern Ireland team to both Latvia and Lithuania. "Who in Latvia is going to do a deal with us?"
The Italian delegation, completely remade after a loss to Norway in qualification matches for the 1992 European championships to be played next summer in Sweden, liked its group, but began lobbying immediately to be headquartered in New York City for the 1994 World Cup. It did not seem to matter to the Italian Soccer Federation president, Antonio Mattarese, that the sites for the World Cup have not been selected yet, and that Giants Stadium has not yet been recognized as a viable venue.
"Coming to America and not playing in New York would be a big affront to the Italian community, " Mattarese said.
Mattarese took another look at Italy's grouping, with Scotland, Portugal, Switzerland, Malta and reborn Estonia. He was not concerned.
"This group won't cost us any sleep at night," he said. If it did, Mattarese would be as unemployed as his predecessors.

Foreman Fires Away As Ellis Sees Fireworks

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RENO, Dec. 8

 BODY:
There's no recession in the George Foreman market. Foreman, who will be 43 years old next month, made $5 million on Saturday night for taking batting practice against a jut-jawed target disguised as Jimmy Ellis.
That was how easy it was for the 257-pound Foreman at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, where he stopped Ellis at 1:36 of the third round of a scheduled 10-round bout. 
 Ellis, a linebacker for the Los Angeles Raiders for part of the 1987 National Football League season, during the strike, was a willing accomplice in the assault and battery Foreman committed on him.
Ellis kept moving forward, absorbing the thudding punches Foreman threw at him, while trying unsuccessfully to damage big George with punches of his own.
 
Deflecting Throws
 Foreman largely deflected the blows with his gloves or caught them on his forearms. Then back to the attack he would go.
With an almost insouciant air, Foreman would throw a volley of punches and then step away so as to cue Referee Richard Steele to take mercy on Ellis and stop the fight. Steele declined to be that gracious.
So Foreman kept bludgeoning the 27-year-old Ellis. Foreman threw big looping shots that seemed to be on delayed tape. But those punches camouflaged his better weapons: the short snapping uppercuts, the left hook and clubbing right hands that move at far greater velocity and from close quarters.
By the first round, Ellis was bleeding from the bridge of his nose. A round later, he was bruised under his left eye and was wobbling like a tipsy sailor from the impact of Foreman's combinations. Ba-boom, ba-boom: Foreman kept hitting Ellis and Ellis tried to act like the toughest man in Reno.
But he fooled no one, least of all Foreman. It was a mismatch. Ellis did not have the tools or experience to deal with Foreman. All he possessed was a big-league quotient of courage, insufficient for keeping big George at bay.
Late in the second round, Steele made a move as if to stop the fight, but appeared to change his mind at the last instant. That Ellis was in need of the kindness of strangers like Steele was clear from how he navigated at the bell ending the second round.
 
Going the Wrong Way
 With a dazed expression, Ellis started toward Foreman's corner, which was already occupied. That was when Ellis's trainer, Lonnie Bennett, retrieved his fighter and walked him back to the proper corner.
By the third round, Foreman was driving Ellis backward with his pistonlike jabs to the head. Ellis's face was reddening from the battering.
A computer punch count indicated that Foreman landed 40 of the 49 punches he threw in the third round. When he assayed the 48th (a left hook) and 49th (a jab) punches in the round, Steele decided that Ellis had finally had enough and called an end to the bout.
"I hit him with a lot of hard shots," Foreman said in the ring afterward. "He must have been a helluva football player. He hit me hard a few times. He had no respect for his elders."
 
Experience Counts
 What he did have was the face of a loser: a purplish welt beneath his left eye, a crusted fleck of blood on the bridge of his nose and red discolorations on his forehead.
"A good experience," Ellis said afterward. "I'm still learning. I have a lot of room to improve. And I'll be back."
Back to football would seem the better part of valor for Ellis, who earned $325,000.
Foreman (70-3, with 66 knockouts) said that he wanted to meet the winner of the Feb. 7 match between Ray Mercer and Larry Holmes. Meanwhile, Ellis (16-1-1, 15 knockouts) can research headache remedies.

Francois Mitterrand
President of France
 Francois Mitterrand, who at the age of 75 is now in his 11th year in office, has long been a strong advocate of greater European integration. He argues that it will be good for Europe but also, perhaps more importantly, for France. He believes that by belonging to a strong economic bloc, France can withstand competition from the United States and Japan and keep the power of a united Germany in check.
As a Socialist, he was an ardent anti-Gaullist, and when he became President in 1981 he immediately set about applying Socialist policies, including the nationalization of banks and other strategic industries. But when his program proved disastrous, he began applying orthodox monetarist policies that revived economic growth. 
 Since his re-election to a second seven-year term in 1988, he has dedicated his energies to accelerating European union.

HEADLINE: Recession Surprise: New York Hotels Are Packed

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Never mind the recession: in New York City this holiday season the bright lights at hotels are likely to read 'No Vacancy.'
For Robin Breakiron and Vicki Malik, friends from Uniontown, Pa., who arrived on Saturday, finding a room was something like a relay race. The adrenalin flowed. Their credit cards were at the ready. 
 "We've spent the last two hours flagging cabs and going from hotel to hotel to hotel," said Ms. Breakiron, looking haggard but steely eyed as she struggled through a throng of tourists at the Marriott Marquis hotel just north of Times Square.
"For the price you pay in New York, we never expected this," complained Ms. Malik. Having found no rooms at the Marriott or the Hilton, the two women hailed another cab, this time for yet another hotel and sped off into the neon glow of a Times Square night.
Their ordeal was shared by thousands of unlucky, last-minute or unprepared visitors to Manhattan. At a time of terrible fiscal problems, devastating job cuts and early indications that Christmas shoppers are in advanced recessionary trauma, something happened over the weekend that seemed a reminder of the New York of old.
 
Glimmer of Reassurance
 Almost every Manhattan hotel reservation was used, and every room full. While that came as a shock to Ms. Breakiron, Ms. Malik and many others, it may offer a small glimmer of reassurance to a a troubled city.
"Considering that the only thing that has been used up in New York over the last year are unemployment insurance benefits, this has be considered a nice surprise," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Of course, those who arrived on Friday and Saturday came during one of the busiest weekends of the year. From after Thanksgiving to Christmas, when the tree at at Rockefeller Center twinkles, department store displays dazzle and Broadway boasts of its hits, Manhattan has always filled with tourists and shoppers, even during the worst of times.
Early December also brings conventioneers, who combine days of shop talk with nights of holiday cheer. Among those competing for hotel space last weekend were 5,000 anesthesiologists and 3,500 shoe executives.
"This period is known around the world as a particularly delightful time to be in New York," said Greg Gibadlo, director of marketing for the New York Hilton Towers, at 53d Street and Avenue of the Americas. The hotel has 2,042 rooms. Every one was filled on Friday and Saturday.
Still, the crowds at reception desks on Friday and Saturday represented something more than business as usual for New York.
One reason is that the hotel industry, following the overbuilding that created gluts of new office space and condominiums, is completing its biggest surge of construction since before World War II.
That means there are more rooms to fill. According to Pannell, Kerr & Foster, a Manhattan accounting firm, eight large new hotels have opened in Manhattan since the beginning of 1989, with 3,541 rooms. The New York City total now is 64,621 rooms, and two more hotels, with another 700 rooms, are scheduled to open in 1992.
 
Room Rates Have Fallen
 For the first time in memory, room rates have declined, falling to an average of $134.50 a night during the first nine months of 1991 from $140.33 during the same period a year earlier, according the accounting firm.
"The city has been doing a lot better since the late fall," said Stephen Brenner, a Manhattan broker of hotels who also analyzes demand for rooms. He said that Manhattan hotels, which averaged 75 percent occupancy in 1989 and 1990, would fare slightly worse for all 1991, but that the last six weeks of the year were showing a "nice surge."

HEADLINE: Repeal Vote On New Tax Coming Soon In Hartford

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A vote to repeal Connecticut's three-month-old income tax could come Monday, but legislators who gathered at the Capitol today to put the final touches on the plan said its details were still not finished and might not be until hours before the vote.
Some of the details are small -- like whether the sales tax rate should rise to 8 percent or 8.25 percent from 6 percent. Others are big -- like whether to allow cities to raise money through video slot-machine gambling, the final shape of $200 million to $300 million in state spending cuts and, finally, how to close a gap in the plan that has been estimated at $300 million to $500 million. 
 Those decisions could be politically pivotal as leaders of the repeal movement try to raise their anti-income-tax majority to the two-thirds they would need to override Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s certain veto.
And enough lawmakers have given themselves wiggle room on the question to make it interesting, saying they hate the income tax but will only vote for an alternative that makes sense for the state.
 
Each Piece Carries Votes
 To each of the unresolved questions are attached some potential votes. For example, video gambling could raise revenues for troubled cities like Bridgeport and Hartford -- and gain some crucial urban Democratic votes. But other legislators, including many of those who are lukewarm on repeal, say that including the gambling part could harm the package's chances by introducing something that some lawmakers oppose almost as much as the income tax.
Given the wave of public anger about the 4.5 percent flat-rate tax on adjusted gross income, which began coming out of residents' paychecks in October, legislators on both sides of the issue say the pressure to act quickly on the tax issue is enormous.
The plan sketched by repeal leaders is for a vote to repeal by the House on Monday, followed by the Senate late Monday night or Tuesday. They assume that Mr. Weicker would be prompt with his veto, setting up the showdown on overriding it for Thursday or Friday.
With the state's economy generally perceived to be worse off, or at least no better, than it was during last summer's budget impasse, and with the holiday retail season near its peak, any sign of uncertainty or deadlock now about the fiscal future could dampen buyers' spirits even further.
 
Eyes on Shopping Days
 "The last thing we need is to be here debating this on the second-to-last weekend before Christmas," said Representative Jonathan Pelto, the political director for the state Democratic Party, which has majorities in both the House and Senate.
A major focus of the weeklong debate is expected to be just how bad Connecticut's economy is, and what effect turning the tax code upside down in the middle of the fiscal year might have on businesses or customers. And reports last week on the ravages of the recession could bolster the arguments on both sides.
The Connecticut Department of Labor said that although the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell in October to 6.3 percent from 6.7 in the previous month, jobs continued to evaporate. Since February 1989, when total employment peaked in the state, 106,000 jobs have disappeared, a 6.2 percent drop, in a non-agricultural work force that now totals about 1.6 million.
Another report issued by an economists' group called the New England Economic Project said the new wage tax had taken what was already the worst recession since the 1930's and made it worse.
"What you have is substantial amount of discretionary purchasing power that is being pulled out the economy," said the report's author, Edward J. Deak, a professor of economics at Fairfield University. "That's helping to depress consumer spending."
Another economist, Ronald F. Van Winkle of West Hartford, said he believed that whatever lawmakers do this week could end up a wash for the economy as a whole. He said that while reducing taxes by $300 million or more, as the repeal plan calls for, would stimulate the economy, the tax cuts are being matched by state spending cuts that would hurt the economy by reducing the total demand for goods and services.
"It's more of a political issue than an economic issue," he said.

Buy Down the Red Army

BYLINE: By LEON V. SIGAL

 BODY:
Are the U.S. and its allies willing to spend $1 billion to get rid of the Soviet threat?
That's not a pitch for some exotic new weapon. It's for severance pay to induce Soviet officers to retire. 
 It's not a crazy notion when one considers that the U.S. is still spending $300 billion a year on defense, roughly half of it to deter a Soviet attack on Western Europe. Cutting that budget in half would free up substantial resources to meet domestic needs -- but only if the Soviet threat evaporated. Taking a billion from defense for a bonus for Red Army retirees could buy a lot more security than $150 billion worth of arms.
For decades, the Soviet armed forces stirred neighbors' worst fears. Their sheer size, some 3.4 million strong, prompted Americans to allocate trillions of dollars to keep them at bay. Now, with Soviet disunion, those forces are falling apart. Funding for new arms is sure to be cut sharply and salaries won't keep up with soaring inflation. The troops already complain about short rations.
Next year, funding for the Red Army will depend on the largesse of the republics. But they have to bring their budgets into balance and get inflation under control; they can't afford to maintain a huge army. The republics with the largest troop contingents on their soil, Russia and Ukraine, are looking for ways to reduce them drastically.
Most short-term draftees would be only too happy to go home early. But career officers have no place to go. Many of those returning from Eastern Europe lack jobs and housing. Russia's Vice President, Aleksandr Rutskoi, himself a former army colonel, broke with President Yeltsin over military budget cuts last week, warning, "You cannot endlessly play with people who bear arms" because it "may end in disaster," implying another coup.
Restiveness in the upper ranks is a major reason that Ukraine, which has joined Russia and Byelorussia in a commonwealth, is talking about building its own 400,000-man army. Ukraine now has 1.2 million men at arms on its territory, about a third of them natives of Ukraine and all of them now on Ukraine's payroll.
Apart from the ultra-nationalists, Ukrainians know they can't afford even a 400,000-man army and that such an army, larger than united Germany's, alarms their neighbors. While they'd like to make sharp cuts in the armed forces, they worry about large numbers of retired officers, underpaid and ill housed, with nothing to do but growl in their beer and plot revenge.
That's where America and its allies can help. Retraining for civilian jobs might work. But it's expensive, slow and inefficient. Civilians in a Moscow think tank have a better idea -- severance pay of $1,000 in hard currency for every officer and non-com who leaves the army.
The officers would be free to do what they wanted with the money -- build or buy housing, spend it on Western goods, start a business, even drink it away. A thousand dollars would go a long way in today's depressed Soviet economy, and could provide a stimulus to growth.
About a million men and women in the Soviet armed forces would qualify. At $1,000 a head, it's possible to buy down the Red Army for about $1 billion. To assure that the money is not misappropriated, a foundation with a board of Soviets and Americans would oversee disbursements.
Congress has already had the sense to allocate $400 million from next year's defense budget to help the Soviets store and dismantle their nuclear warheads. An additional $1 billion in severance pay would go far toward eliminating the Soviet threat altogether.

Middleman's Mistake

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If President Bush can get the Arab states to negotiate directly with Israel, the talks will make progress. If he lets Secretary Baker become the middleman carrying messages and finally recommending the settlement -- the "peace process," a phrase coined by Henry Kissinger nearly two decades ago, will fail.
So far, despite the great debt of survival owed to America by the Arab states, Secretary Baker has not been able to arrange talks other than "through" the U.S. That's because Arab leaders believe the Americans can pressure the Israelis to give up the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and in the end part of Jerusalem. 
 Only when the light dawns on Arabs that the only way any territorial compromise can be achieved is to stop using U.S. intervention as a crutch -- and to deal directly, face to face, with the nation they cannot defeat or forever ignore -- will business begin. Israelis are ready to deal with people who are ready to deal with them.
Apparently the Arabs -- especially Syria's dictator, Assad -- are not ready. That explains the fussing about venue: the Israelis want home-and-home meetings, as befits equals, while Arab leaders insist on some far-off setting using America as permanent middleman.
President Bush is acceding to the Arabs' wishes. His invitation to Washington, presented to Israel as an insulting summons, contained language showing that the U.S. would tilt toward Syria on stripping the high ground of the Golan from Israel's defense.
And on the West Bank, our meddling middlemen have an opening deal in mind as a first step toward imposing a grand bargain that American soldiers would be forced to police. In return for Israel giving up the right to live on land that both Arabs and Israelis claim -- "freezing settlements" is the phrase -- Mr. Baker will arrange an end to the Arab boycott and throw in the sweetener of repealing the U.N.'s Zionism-is-racism resolution.
There is no deal there. It's a dead end. The economic sabotage is unlawful, an act of war to be condemned and not treated as a bargaining chip; and the U.N.'s resolution is an abomination, a moral burden to the Arabs and the old Soviet bloc. Israel would be crazy to hand over the key to its territorial security for the cessation of a couple of evil deeds. Yet Mr. Baker persists in pretending this guaranteed non-starter is the basis for a serious negotiation.
Thus, we have been drawn in as a middleman and blocking conduit, thereby undermining our goal of encouraging direct talks; and our opening intercession is a loser. Is there a way to get this back on the track?
Fortunately, three pressures are pushing in the right direction.
In Israel, the infusion of educated brainpower from the old Soviet empire and the strength of racial diversity brought by the Ethiopian Jews offer new confidence and renewed sense of mission to the Jewish state.
Long term, the wave of immigrants is a great economic and diplomatic asset; nearly a half-million people have been absorbed, live under roofs, and two-thirds have jobs. Short term, with 200,000 more expected this year, immigration is also a headache; in November's elections, most unemployed arrivals will vote against the party in power, putting Likud under internal pressure to seek peace progress.
In the U.S. too, politics can be a force for good sense. Candidate Bush wants a deal to run on, which he cannot get by bullying an isolated Israel; moreover, in a close race, the difference between minuscule support of Jewish-Americans for Goldwater and the much bigger vote for Nixon and Reagan could affect the outcome in key states. Mr. Bush will want to claim that he has accomplished the start of long-sought direct negotiations.
In the Arab world, if Syria remains bellicose, a joint venture on the Golan can await Assad's successor. But Palestinian Arabs are at last eager to attain the autonomy the P.L.O. disdained at Camp David long ago. Tired of being pawns, Palestinians will reach for more self-determination in association with Jordan and cooperation with Israel than can be found in any Arab dictatorship.
A quartet of self-ruling Palestinian cantons in a barrier-free West Bank is the way to Arab dignity and Israeli security. The world can help by embargoing arms to the area, but interference with direct dealing will only botch the prospects for peace.

HEADLINE: It Isn't Cold War II

BYLINE: By Suzanne Berger and Kenneth A. Oye; Suzanne Berger and Kenneth A. Oye are, respectively, professor and associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The cold war is dead, but the cold war mentality is not. As America observed the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, we heard familiar arguments in debates about U.S.-Japan relations.
These cold war arguments, which demonize Japan, have arisen as economic tensions between both countries have also regenerated a World War II mindset: once again, Americans say the Japanese have motivations and aspirations that differ fundamentally from ours. 
 Do we really need to conjure up foreign enemies to explain away our own economic deficiencies?
Analysts who counted nuclear arsenals in the East and West and evaluated the appeal of Communism to European countries and less-developed societies are switching their attention to Japan's economic threat. They are comparing it, wrongly, to cold war strategic competition.
For example, a C.I.A.-sponsored study that involved the Rochester Institute of Technology's president says: "Japan is an economic superpower whose world dominance appears inescapable and incontrovertible, absent some dramatic unified reassertion of Western intent, coupled with an equally dramatic economic resurgence. Mainstream Japanese . . . are creatures of an ageless, amoral, manipulative and controlling culture -- not to be emulated -- suited only to this race, in this place."
Polls seem to echo this thinking. While by 1990, only 33 percent of the American public and 20 percent of its opinion leaders characterized the Soviet Union's military power as a critical threat to the U.S., 60 percent of the public and 63 percent of opinion leaders called Japan's economic power such a threat.
A PBS "Frontline" program opened and closed with an American auto parts manufacturer calling for a "Desert Storm for the economy." The narrator declared that victory in the gulf disguised the fact that the U.S. is fighting, and losing, a war with Japan.
A noted political scientist, Samuel Huntington of Harvard, says America "is obsessed with Japan for the same reasons that it was once obsessed with the Soviet Union. It sees that country as a major threat to its primacy in a crucial arena of power." He argues that we have as much reason to struggle to remain the world's No. 1 power as we did throughout the cold war.
But are the stakes really the same? Should we be willing to be less well off in order to preserve our position? America didn't sacrifice blood and treasure in the struggle against Communism because of an abstract commitment to No. 1 status. Of course, we took pride in our role as world leader, but our sacrifices were borne, not to preserve our pre-eminent rank, but to contain the military expansion of a nuclear power that had occupied Eastern Europe and possessed global ambitions that threatened freedom.
During the cold war, national security analysts contended that either side could gain only at the other side's expense. That approach is now being used to define U.S.-Japan relations. But even at the height of the cold war, the U.S. and Soviet Union did not wholly see things as your-gains-are-my-losses; on the contrary, they successfully acted on mutual interests. Both sides minimized risks of nuclear war, sought to reduce nuclear proliferation and avoided direct conventional military conflict.
Thus, it is entirely misleading to invoke the metaphor of war to characterize today's U.S.-Japan relations.
Japan poses no ideological challenge the way Communism did. Whatever may be said about the successes of Japanese lobbyists, the Japanese way of life in no way compares to the appeal of postwar Communism to parts of Europe and the developing world.
Japan poses no military danger. There are no indications that it wishes to abandon the pacifist foreign policy that has contributed so much to its economic success.
But of course there are major economic issues that both sides must face squarely. Trade negotiations have significantly improved access to Japanese markets for such American exports as beef, citrus, cellular telephones and financial services. Nonethless, formal impediments on imports of rice and informal bars to other products and services remain firm.
Japan is leaping ahead in semiconductors and in the development of advanced materials, superconductivity and optoelectronics, according to a 1990 Commerce Department report. This lead gives Japanese companies the power to control prices and to deny U.S. companies access to technologies.
While Japanese companies are investing heavily in the U.S., there are real concerns about whether they will locate enough headquarters and research-and-development facilities in America, thus creating high-wage jobs and new skills, or mainly assembly plants. Will these be companies in which Americans will be permitted to rise to the top?
There are also concerns about whether U.S. investors are getting a fair shake in Japan, and whether intellectual-property rights and patents are being respected there.
During the Persian Gulf war, questions arose about whether Japan was doing enough; today, we ask whether it is doing its part to reconstruct Eastern Europe. Questions are also arising about whether Japan is doing enough basic research and paying its fair share for U.S. basic research that results in Japanese products.
We need to press Japan to address these issues before they dominate Presidential politics, because that may well heat up counterproductive cold war rhetoric.
In negotiations with Japan, however, our goal should not be to diminish Japan's economic status but to improve our own. We seem to be losing sight of this need.
Robert B. Reich, who teaches political economy at Harvard, asked opinion leaders to choose between a 10-year scenario in which our economy grew at 2.5 percent a year while Japan's grew at 6.5 percent, and another scenario in which our economy grew at 1 percent and Japan's at 1.1 percent. A majority preferred slower growth -- if only Japan could be held down, too! This thinking is no prescription for economic growth.
And it suggests that if we do have an enemy, it is not Japan but ourselves. The resources that might remedy our economic decline lie in our own hands, but we have been unwilling to devote them to productive purposes.
We should raise our investment level from 14 percent of the gross national product, not because Japan invests 27 percent but because higher investment will ultimately improve the American standard of living.
We should fully commit the resources necessary for educational excellence, not because Japanese primary and secondary schools are good but because investment in human capital is crucial to improve the nation's economic performance.
We should create fiscal incentives for American corporations to look beyond the next quarter's profits, not because Japanese companies look decades ahead but because long-term thinking is the key to reducing the costs and improving the quality of American products.
America does not need to scapegoat Japan, but to rebuild itself. The use of World War II and cold war imagery deflects attention from this basic point.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
GORBACHEV REJECTS MOVE TO DISCARD KREMLIN ROLE; U.S. KEEPS LINK TO MOSCOW

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 9

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today rejected the right of the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia to dissolve the Soviet Union, adding to the uncertainty over the fate of the Soviet lands.
"The fate of our multinational country cannot be decided by the will of three republican leaders," Mr. Gorbachev said in a statement read on the evening television news. "This question can only be resolved through constitutional means with the participation of all sovereign states and taking into account the will of their peoples." [Text of statement, page A18.] 
 He said the proclamation of a new "commonwealth of independent states" by the three Slavic republics should be treated as only a proposal, to be discussed alongside his proposed new "union of sovereign states" by republic parliaments and a full Congress of Peoples' Deputies.
 
Power Flows to Republics
 Under the Soviet system, ultimate power lies in the Congress, which in practice delegates its responsibilities to the Supreme Soviet, or legislature, of the Soviet Union. But since the failed coup attempt last August, the central Soviet Government has disintegrated and increasing power has fallen to the various republics and their leaders.
There is no obvious body such as the United States Supreme Court to decide differences between the central Government and republics and therefore any decision may have to be worked out politically rather than judicially.
Demonstrating that he did not intend to vanish quietly from the political stage with his vestigial union, Mr. Gorbachev declared that the Slavic leaders' annulment of Union laws was "illegal and dangerous," and the speed with which they proclaimed the new commonwealth "baffling."
 
Annoucement Is a Surprise
 Mr. Gorbachev's statement was issued at the end of a tumultuous day in which he and leaders of other republics, foreign diplomats and the press tried to sort out what the unexpected proclamation by the Slavic leaders meant.
Mr. Gorbachev and the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, questioned President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic for more than an hour, then met with presidents of other republics. The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, met with foreign diplomats, while reporters dogged them all at every step.
It emerged during the day that the announcement on Sunday was not anticipated by anyone outside the remote Byelorussian retreat where Mr. Yeltsin, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine and Stanislav Shushkevich, the leader of the Byelorussian Parliament, agreed to declare the Soviet Union dead and to join in a new commonwealth that would be open to other former republics.
Mr. Nazarbayev, who serves as unofficial spokesman for the Muslim republics of Central Asia, made no effort to conceal his irritation at not being consulted. "Shaping interstate relations on the basis of national-ethnic principles is a vestige of the Middle Ages," he muttered.
Mr. Nazarbayev also declared his support for Mr. Gorbachev, saying that the Soviet leader had yet to exhaust his potential. "The country needs him," Mr. Nazarbayev said.
 
Commonwealth Idea Defended
 One of Mr. Yeltsin's aides confessed that they had tried to reach Mr. Nazarbayev on Sunday, but that there were only two telephones at the retreat and that they were unable to reach the Kazakh leader. The aides said Mr. Gorbachev was informed by telephone only after the agreement was reached.
Mr. Yeltsin's lieutenants, as well as the Ukrainian and Byelorussian leaders, argued that there was no alternative to the replacement of the doomed union with a new commonwealth.
In several separate interviews, they reiterated the basic argument of the agreement Sunday that efforts to forge a new union had reached a dead end and that only the new commonwealth could preserve their republics' separate independence and safeguard their links, open borders and mutual responsibility for the Soviet military.
The day's turmoil gave no immediate indication how the competing claims to the former union could be resolved.
For now, the lines seem sharply drawn. The three Slavic leaders declared that the old Soviet Union was dissolved on Sunday and that all the old laws and institutions were void. But Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Nazarbayev and some political movements insisted they were not and reduced the Slavic leaders' proclamation to a mere proposal.
 
What May Follow
 Nobody appeared to believe that Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Shushkevich would try to impose their new commonwealth by force. Nor did it seem likely that Mr. Gorbachev would consider using his powers as Commander in Chief to oppose them.
Most probably, given the developments since the August coup attempt, the three Slavic leaders will use their proclamation as authority for speeding the process of choking off the central authorities and beginning regional changes.
A commentary on Russian television speculated that Mr. Gorbachev himself could be eased out on a golden parachute, perhaps as Commander in Chief of the joint armed forces or as representative to the United Nations.
Mr. Gorbachev's proposal to convene the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, the 1,800-member assembly elected in 1989, was supported by several deputies, who began gathering the necessary signatures.
After the coup, it was Mr. Gorbachev who bullied the Congress into surrendering its powers to an interim State Council of republic presidents, and the deputies had to struggle to win a provision that they could reconvene if one-fifth of their number signed a petition.
 
Future of Republics' Deputies
 But given the considerable sovereignty assumed in the interim by most republic governments, it is hard to visualize how deputies from republics like Ukraine can be persuaded to attend a new session.
The reaction of other republics was also difficult to guess. The three co-founders of the commonwealth appeared to presume that most republics would eventually be compelled to join for economic reasons, and if they did not, the Slavic giants in any case controlled 80 percent of the land and most of the wealth of the old union.
For now, only the Armenian President, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, has expressed "full support" for the Slavic initiative and declared his readiness to join the new commonwealth. But Russian officials speculated that once Mr. Nazarbayev got over his pique, he would probably advise the Central Asian republics to join.
While rejecting the authority of the three republics to dissolve the union, Mr. Gorbachev was cautious not to reject totally the first agreement on any kind of association that Ukraine has joined in, and one that appeared to resolve many of the most serious problems facing the republics, including the future of nuclear weapons, the ruble and open borders.
"The agreement has its positive moments," Mr. Gorbachev said in his statement. "The Ukrainian leadership, which previously showed no activity in the negotiating process, has joined it."
It was Ukraine's overwhelming vote for independence that previously appeared to torpedo any hope of a new union agreement. But in agreeing on a new commonwealth with Russia and Byelorussia, the new Ukrainian President, Mr. Kravchuk, signaled that he was prepared to form an association as long as it was totally disassociated from the old "totalitarian center."
"The document stresses the need to create a single economic space, operating on coordinated principles with a single currency and finance-and-banking system," Mr. Gorbachev continued. "It expresses readiness for cooperation in the field of science, education, culture and other spheres. It suggests a definite formula of interaction in the military-strategic field."
 
Unanimity Is Elusive
 All these issues had been central to the union agreement Mr. Gorbachev was seeking. But the negotiations on his treaty seemed to stumble repeatedly on the reluctance of several republics, chiefly Ukraine, to have any dealings with the old center, and on the impossibility of achieving unanimity among the disparate republic leaders.
Yeltsin aides suggested that this latter problem was also central in prodding the three Slavic leaders, who are closer on the fundamentals of a new association, into forging a core commonwealth.
Pavel Voshchanov, Mr. Yeltsin's press secretary, said the republics had developed different approaches to human rights, democracy and economic changes. "Gorbachev hoped that the attractive power of the Union would help overcome all of these difficulties," he said. "This did not happen, however."
By contrast, Mr. Voshchanov said, Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia, for all their differences, had more in common in their vision of the future, and so could more easily overcome their differences.
 
View of Muslim Republics
 Such arguments, however, did not offset the widespread impression that the Slavic republics were setting themselves apart from all others, and especially the Muslim republics of Central Asia. These republics have all experienced a growth of Islamic awareness in their populations, which could be fanned by a sense that they were being slighted by the Slavs.
It was also not immediately certain that the Ukrainians, especially the more fiery nationalists, would accept the proposed commonwealth.
Reports from Kiev said Mr. Kravchuk came under immediate fire from some hard-line nationalists in the Ukrainian Parliament. The Reuters news agency quoted one of them, Stepan Khmara, as having said: "I caught my breath when I heard about this agreement. It is Kravchuk's first big political mistake. Ukraine should not be signing any agreements of any kind with Russia."
But the major grouping of opposition forces, Rukh, supported Mr. Kravchuk. The president of Rukh, Ivan Drach, said, "I think it is a correct tactical move on the chess board."

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
Noting Uncertainty in New Union, Washington Takes Cautious Path

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that while it was ready to work with the projected commonwealth of former Soviet republics, it did not plan to break relations with the central Government of Mikhail S. Gorbachev or recognize the new commonwealth.
The sudden announcement on Sunday of the new commonwealth by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia was viewed by Washington as a hastily arranged initiative, inspired by 
 President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, and one that did not seem to be fully thought through. While American officials were careful not to criticize Mr. Yeltsin, they said his instincts for change sometimes run ahead of his ability to carry them out.
Although American officials said there was nothing objectionable in principle to the formation of the new commonwealth, they expressed concern whether the new entity would be able to assume control of the former Soviet Army and whether it would be able to develop the coordinated military, economic and foreign policy to which its architects aspire.
 
Adjusting U.S. Policy
 The overall sense in the Administration was that events were now moving too quickly in the Soviet Union to anticipate the outcome, and that American policy would need constant adjustment in the weeks ahead as the old Soviet Union disintegrates and as its constituent parts try to sort out some new form of alliance.
Given that appraisal, Administration officials stressed that their tentative opening to the new commonwealth, which has not yet sought formal American recognition, did not exclude continued dealings with Mr. Gorbachev. Senior officials said the United States would not sever ties with Mr. Gorbachev until the Soviet people themselves did.
That is, Washington will continue to deal with Mr. Gorbachev as long as he is exercising some authority and can influence events, which still appears to be the case given his ties to at least some of the Soviet armed forces -- and because of the possible future role he might play as the various political leaders and republics sort out the competing union treaty, which has been pushed by Mr. Gorbachev, and the new commonwealth scheme, which seems to hold out no role for him.
American policy appears neither to prop up Mr. Gorbachev artificially, nor intentionally contribute to his decline. Since Mr. Yeltsin and other republic leaders still saw some benefit in dealing with Mr. Gorbachev, Washington would as well, officials said.
"I would just say that we don't really know the status of the center at this point," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said. "Secretary Baker yesterday commented that the old Soviet Union as we knew it is no longer in existence, but the picture of the new situation is not quite so clear."
Mr. Fitzwater added: "We have good relations with the republics and with President Gorbachev. We feel we are well positioned to be a partner in these events as they do unfold, and we will take it one step at a time. We are prepared, obviously, to work with whatever government emerges or whatever form of confederation emerges."
While all of this gets sorted out, the issue about which Washington is not taking a wait-and-see attitude is the future of Soviet Union's arsenal of 27,000 nuclear warheads. Government spokesmen stressed today that it was imperative that these missiles remain under a unified command.
 
'Control Is Important'
 "We do not want to see a proliferation of independent nuclear states," the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said. "We note with interest the reference to a single unified command in the statement made in announcing the commonwealth. Such control is important."
American officials said that when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d travels to Ukraine, Russia and Byelorussia next week, he will offer American aid and technological assistance to help these republics to either efficiently store, destroy or transfer to a centralized command any of their nuclear weapons. Congress has already appropriated $400 million for the United States to use on such tasks.
While most of the 27,000 Soviet nuclear weapons are stored in the Russian republic, some 5,000 other long-range missiles and mobile missiles are dispersed among Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan.
Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Yeltsin had assured President Bush that all Soviet nuclear weapons were under control, during the half-hour telephone conversation they held on Sunday. But given the level of confusion right now in the former Soviet Union, American officials are hardly reassured.
 
Noting Two Positives
 The positive side of what happened on Sunday, American officials and analysts said, is twofold. On the strategic level, the Soviet Union's ability to project power in a sustained way beyond its borders, or threaten American interests, will be greatly diminished. Whatever loose confederation emerges will not be likely to have the sort of coordinated defense, foreign affairs and economic policies, or unified military and defense modernization programs of the old union.
The main danger it presents is that it will be too chaotic, or as Mr. Baker warned on Sunday, there could be a civil war, or "Yugoslavia with nukes."
The other positive point, officials say, is that the principles that the founding declaration of the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia laid down on Sunday at least said all the "right" things from an American point of view.
It was clear that the republic leaders had paid attention to the guidelines the Administration had laid down as the conditions for extending diplomatic recognition to the newly independent Ukraine and were deliberating trying to incorporate them in their charter to gain American approval.
"We are pleased that the commonwealth communique that was issued yesterday reflected the five principles that we set forth on Sept. 4," Mr. Fitzwater said.
 
Rights and Freedoms
 He noted, for instance, that the commonwealth declaration said the parties guarantee the rights and freedoms of all citizens irrespective of nationality. It said they take ethnic minorities on their territory under their protection, that they respect one another's territorial integrity and inviolability of existing borders and that they guarantee the fulfillment of international obligations that accrue to them from treaties or agreements by the former Soviet Union, including both foreign debts and nuclear treaty obligations.
The problem, though, American officials say, is whether they can actually agree among themselves on the detailed arrangements that would be required to bring such principles to life.
"Their statement of yesterday clearly represented the lowest of lowest common denominators," said Dimitri K. Simes, a Soviet expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "It is obvious that many details have yet to be resolved. And negotiating questions of trade, military controls and debt is going to be very difficult, especially against the backdrop of a rough winter."
As the economic situation deteriorates there is going to be a great temptation for them to use one another as scapegoats and establish protectionist policies, Mr. Simes said, "so it is too early to say whether this commonwealth is a transit station on the road to chaos or a transit station on the road to something more fundamental."

HEADLINE: Japan Bond Deal Breaks Ground

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
TOKYO, Dec. 9 --
In a first for the Japanese corporate bond market, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation said today that it would issue bonds at the same price to all investors, rather than offering discounts to preferred customers.
This unusual approach to an underwriting in Japan, like most changes in Japan's financial markets, was induced by an outsider -- in this case Morgan Stanley & Company. It pushed for the change and will co-manage the offering with Nomura Securities, N.T.T.'s traditional underwriter. 
 This will be the first time an American securities house will lead a domestic Japanese securities underwriting, breaking the lock that Japan's major securities firms have held on the market.
 
An Underwriter's View
 "This idea is long overdue in Japan," said Mark A. Seigel, a Morgan Stanley executive who helped organize the deal. "This is the primary method used in the United States and Europe."
A Nomura official said, "We hope the introduction of the new system will increase market transparency and stimulate the Japanese corporate bond market."
Although the terms have not been announced, it is expected that N.T.T. will issue 50 billion yen, or $390 million, in bonds, with a maturity of from 6 years to 10 years. The interest rate is likely to be about 1.25 percentage points above the rate for 10-year Japanese Government bonds, which is currently below 6 percent.
The announcement that Government-owned N.T.T. was planning to experiment with a system common in the United States and Europe represents a modest step toward making Japan a genuinely world-class financial market. It was also one of those seemingly technical developments that speaks volumes about how coddled Japan's financial markets remain in many respects, despite their enormous growth.
Salomon Brothers tried to be lead manager of bond issues by two Japanese companies early last year and was met with howls of criticism from Japanese securities executives. A senior Nomura official said of Salo mon's deals, which involved a complex series of steps, "This is like bringing AIDS from New York." The companies eventually dropped the deals, and Salomon Brothers never got the underwriting.
Under the method being introduced, the underwriters will start the process by canvassing major investors to test their interest in the securities. By the time the issue is ready, the underwriters should have a good feel for what the market is prepared to pay. A price will then be set, and all the investors will be sold their bonds at that price. Later, the bonds will trade at market prices.
Currently, there is almost no standard corporate bond market in Japan. Japanese corporations have been issuing large amounts of Eurobonds, as well as bonds that are convertible into stock or bonds with stock warrants. But they have sold few on the domestic market, in large measure because of a 20 percent withholding tax here and rules that subtly encourage them to take bank loans instead of issuing bonds. The N.T.T. issue is expected to be greeted more enthusiastically, in part because N.T.T. is such a blue-chip company and because the new pricing system insures investors will be treated fairly.
In general, underwriters here have sold corporate bonds to investors at discounts of varying size. According to Morgan Stanley officials, the Japanese underwriters would determine their discount based on how good the customer was. The result has been a primitive corporate bond market, where there is little trading and where pricing is at times unrealistic.
"Market pricing for debt securities is not a well developed concept in this market," said John S. Wadsworth Jr., president of Morgan Stanley Japan.
 
A Giant Blue Chip
 N.T.T. is 75 percent owned by the Japanese Government and is one of the world's largest industrial concerns, which gives the new pricing concept a big push in Japan.
At a time when capital is proving scarce, NTT was encouraged to pursue the new method as a means of opening up a potentially big new source of financing. But Morgan Stanley officials said that it was unlikely the concept would catch on quickly because the market has so far to catch up.
For instance, the creation of a large corporate bond market depends on trustworthy corporate rating agencies. None of the major agencies in Japan is taken seriously by securities professionals, and only 14 industrial concerns here, including N.T.T., have ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's, two of the major American rating agencies.
"What we hope is that this will develop a level playing field in the market, but it still has a long way to go," Mr. Wadsworth said.

HEADLINE: Harkin Yearns for Grand Old Democrats

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DURHAM, N.H., Dec. 4

 BODY:
In an overheated room that smells faintly of wet boots, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa is mixing it up with the next generation.
"I want to challenge this country just as John Kennedy challenged me," he tells the students who have gathered to hear him at the University of New Hampshire. "I want to challenge the American people like Franklin Roosevelt challenged us in 1932." 
 "I believe in running a Harry Truman-type campaign," he continues. "A lot of people say you've got to be a little more like a Republican. You've got to walk a little more like a Republican, talk a little more like a Republican. But as Harry Truman said, any time you run a Republican against a Republican, you're going to get a Republican as President."
Other Democratic candidates may wring their hands over the party's recent agonies; Senator Harkin would rather dwell on happier times. Forget Michael S. Dukakis. Forget Jimmy Carter. And forget, if you will, Lyndon B. Johnson. The Senator's party is the party of grand old Democrats from Roosevelt to Kennedy.
 
Back to the Basics
 "What we Democrats have got to do is go back to our traditional roots and heritage and what the Democratic Party really stands for," he said. "What the Democratic Party basically stands for is economic health and jobs."
As he shuttles between diners and auditoriums, soliciting support in the New Hampshire primary to be held on Feb. 18, Mr. Harkin offers voters a benevolent vision of goverment, one that is willing to help those who help themselves. He advocates a massive program modeled on the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, which, he says, will put millions of people to work rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. And he calls for a new version of the G.I. Bill of Rights, which put World War II veterans through college; under his version, students would have their tuition paid by the Government in return for a term of service with a conservation corps or a health service corps.
A combative speaker with an earthy style, the 52-year-old Senator is a self-described populist with just the right sort of resume to suit his politics. His father was a coal miner who died of black lung disease. His mother died when he was 10. The family was too poor to pay for college, so he attended Iowa State University on an R.O.T.C. scholarship and then served five years in the Navy.
Campaigning against the man he refers to as George Herbert Walker Bush, Mr. Harkin makes frequent use of his impoverished Midwestern background. "Unlike Bush," he said at a recent forum on health care, "I understand what it's like not to be able to afford health care. I don't have to read about it in any books."
While President Bush seems most comfortable on the golf course or in his mansion at Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Harkin is genuinely at home in a blue-collar world. He has put this skill to use in his campaign with a series of photogenic "work days," one day laying water pipes, another hauling in lobster pots off the coast.
In his most recent visit to New Hampshire, Mr. Harkin donned a pair of knee-high galoshes to slog around a frozen wetland with members of the local Audobon Society. The wetland was one of thousands in the country that could have been developed under new regulations proposed, and then retracted, by the Bush Administration.
As the Senator emerged from the icy marsh trailing a group of glum reporters with wet feet, he announced buoyantly, "Tommorrow, friends, we're going into a coal mine."
Mr. Harkin frequently extols the virtues of straight talk, and insists that even if the voters do not agree with him, at least they will know his positions on the issues. "One thing about me," he says, "you won't have to wonder where I stand."
On many issues the Senator's positions are, in fact, hard to confuse: he is straightforward in support for a national health plan, for example, and he advocates cutting carbon dioxide emissions from all sources in the nation by 20 percent by the year 2000.
But, when pressed on the mechanics of many of his proposals, Mr. Harkin can be as obfuscatory as any of his rivals. When he is asked, for example, how he plans to finance the public works projects he is proposing, he offers this answer:
"Implicit in that question is the assumption that we're poor, we're broke. Well, let me disabuse you of that notion. We may be 14th out of the 16 industrialized in what we spend on education. We may be 10th in infant mortality. But guess what? We're the richest country in the world. The money's there, we've just got to start spending it smarter."
 
Some Different Reactions
 What the Senator lacks in the way of detail he often makes up for with sheer optimism. "Don't tell me we can't find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, for AIDS, for cancer," he said recently. "I do not believe these are incurable diseases -- not at all."
To many Democrats, Mr. Harkin's proposals and his pugnacious style are inspiring after years of party-sanctioned timidity.
"I like the man's enthusiasm, his can-do attitude," said Preston Mears, an agent for the Department of Agriculture, who heard the Senator speak recently in the basement of the Econo-Lodge in nearby Salem.
Other Democrats, however, see Mr. Harkin's "big government" plans as a recipe for the party's defeat next November. And still others question whether Truman's "give 'em hell" style is really suited to the complexities of the 1990's.
"It's like, 'Wake up, this isn't the 50's any more,' " said Michael Rosenthal, a senior at the University of New Hampshire. "He's presenting this Utopian vision of America; I started having visions of parades. That didn't really turn me on."

HEADLINE: Cuts in Public Jobs May Hurt Blacks Most

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 9

 BODY:
On a winter morning 17 years ago, James L. Smith, a father of eight, began working for the city of Chicago and inching his way, ever so slowly, toward the middle class.
Over the years, Mr. Smith moved out of a crumbling and dangerous public housing project and saw all his children off to college. He himself had never gotten further than high school. 
 "I was pulling myself up by my own bootstraps," he said. "And all my kids have good jobs. That's because I was able to work. I was able to take care of my own. I thought I had it made."
Then two weeks ago, the 57-year-old Mr. Smith was notified that the city was laying him off because of budget cuts.
"It's hard enough for a young black man to find a job, let alone a black man my age," he said. "I feel like the system hit me in the head with a baseball bat."
 
A Sad, but Common, Tale
 His is a common story these days, a sad tale that can be heard in black, white and Hispanic homes across the country as recession-shrouded governments order hundreds, even thousands of employees laid off. Nearly 1,000 Chicago city workers, for example, are to lose their jobs by Jan. 1.
But several public policy experts fear that blacks will now suffer disproportionately from government layoffs because they have historically found more job opportunities in government than in private industry. And others say the Ronald Reagan and Bush Administrations have helped create an atmosphere of such hostility toward affirmative action that government officials may feel that they can reduce the opportunities for blacks, at least at the Federal level.
That unease was illustrated late last month when C. Boyden Gray, the White House legal counsel, circulated a draft of a statement calling for the abolition of all affirmative action programs and regulations built up since 1965. The White House later disavowed the statement, and on the same day President Bush signed the civil rights bill.
 
'Critical Route of Mobility'
 Gary Orfield, a professor of education and social policy at Harvard University and an author of "The Closing Door: Conservative Policy and Black Opportunity," published this year by the University of Chicago Press, said that government employment has been "an absolutely critical route of mobility for blacks."
He said many blacks were able to take advantage of the rapid expansion of government, especially on the local level, in the 1960's.
At about the same time, private industry, pushed by the civil rights movement and Federal affirmative action policies, began to open its doors to increasingly significant numbers of black workers and to give them jobs with more responsibility and salaries large enough that they could step up into the middle class.
But, Mr. Orfield said, "all kinds of changes have been working since the beginning of the 1980's that have slowed progress. And now with the recession, we're going through another set of savage cuts."
Martin Kilson, a professor of government at Harvard University, said he believed that the black middle class would survive the storm of layoffs. "The black middle class is resilient," he said. "Racial marginalism has always forced a resiliency on it. They run harder to stay in the middle."
"In the meantime," he went on, "many people will be hurt. A sharp ceiling comes down during times like these on 15, 20 years of progress. And for a group that only got a foot on the middle-class ladder in the last generation, that's a nasty blow."
 
Bottom Rung of Ladder
 Even before the 1960's, there were government jobs available to blacks, but typically they were on the bottom rung of the ladder: janitors, clerks, postal workers. Still, it was a ladder, and blacks climbed it in disproportionate numbers because there was often no place else for them to go.
It has been in America's cities where blacks have made their deepest inroads in government employment. But the gains could be overshadowed by statistics like those that came out in October in a survey of 50 cities by the United States Conference of Mayors.
The survey found that nearly 60 percent of the cities had either laid off employees, were considering it or had made cuts through attrition or by leaving positions vacant.
Baltimore, for example, has reduced its work force by 1,037 since July 1989. Bridgeport has laid off about 500 of its 4,200 workers and cut another 200 or so job through attrition over the past two years. And Detroit laid off 502 of its 19,500 employees in April, 300 of them police officers; roughly two thirds of the officers were black.
In the 1991 and 1992 fiscal years, New York City has laid off or planned to lay off about 5,000 of its 234,000 workers. Leland T. Jones, Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, said that at least half of the laid-off workers were either black or Hispanic.
 
Risks for Blacks
 Roger Wilkins, a history professor at George Mason University, said the layoffs and cuts in Federal programs, which not only gave benefits to the poor and working class but also employed them, could knock many blacks off the already slippery road to the middle class.
"It's always been said when the economy gets a cold, blacks get pneumonia," he said. "I think a substantial portion of blacks who lose their government jobs will truly risk falling out of the middle class and may never return."
Blacks, of course, are certainly not the only ethnic group ever to use government employment as a boost up, said Jonathan Leonard, an expert on affirmative action and a business professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
"In Boston, city employment was a major avenue for Irish-Americans to start upward mobility," Mr. Leonard said.
Before the 1960's, about 10 to 15 percent of blacks were middle class, said David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization in Washington that specializes in issues involving blacks. Today, about 33 percent of blacks are middle class, he said.
According to figures compiled by the Federal Office of Personnel Management, minority members made up 27.5 percent of the Federal work force as of Sept. 30, 1990, as against 21.8 percent of the civilian work force. For blacks alone, the figures were 17.1 percent of the Federal work force and 10.3 percent of the civilian work force. Blacks make up 12.1 percent of the United States population.
In Chicago, the layoffs are the first significant ones since 1985. The number and percentage of minority workers affected in the latest round is unclear. A spokeswoman for Mayor Richard M. Daley said the city did not yet know precisely who would be laid off.
But Roberta Lynch, director of public policy for the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees in Chicago, said, "The layoffs are almost certain to have a disproportionate impact on the minority community because the public sector has a greater concentration of minority professionals."
"Even if minorities and whites were to lose their jobs in equal numbers," she said, "it would have a bigger impact in the minority community than it would in the white."
Others disagree. Mr. Bositis of the Joint Center said current governmental cutbacks were due to the recession. Once the recession eases, he said, governments will expand their services, and their job rolls, as they have for more than two decades.
For some black families, working for government has become a kind of family recipe for a better life, a recipe that until recently had helped Ramona Samuels, of Chicago, climb well into the middle class.
Then last July, she was laid off from her $40,000-a-year job as a personnel expert in the city's housing department.
"I know at least 35 black professionals who worked for the city and are now laid off," she said. "A lot of us were first-generation professionals."
Local governments, in particular, have provided employment opportunities for blacks. This is not just because of Federal pressure, or a desire to do good, but it often a matter of simple arithmetic. As more and more blacks migrated from the South to the cities of the North, their voting strength increased, forcing the local governments to pay more attention to their needs.
"Private employers deem themselves responsible to only the market place," said Mr. Wilkins, of George Mason University. "But public employers are responsible to the public. They have more pressures on them to be fair."
 
A Longtime Dream
 For Mr. Smith, who has worked for 17 years for the Chicago Department of Human Services, first as a street worker and most recently in the central office processing forms, becoming part of the middle class has been a longtime dream. His job with the city got him "pretty close," Mr. Smith said.
He was making $25,000 a year, not a great sum but enough to move out of public housing into an apartment complex with a swimming pool and young doctors and nurses as neighbors.
Then in October, the city sent him a layoff notice. Because of his senority, however, he was able to transfer to another job. Although his salary was cut by 12.5 percent, "at least I was still bringing home a paycheck," he said.
Then three days before Thanksgiving, he received another layoff notice. His last day was today.
His wife, Arnethia, said that when her husband called her with the news, "we were both in shock."
"He started there from scratch," she said. "Now that he's making a decent salary, they want to take it away from him. That's not right."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Representatives Vote to Repeal First Wage Tax

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 9

 BODY:
A majority of the members of the House of Representatives voted tonight to repeal Connecticut's first tax on wages, which has enraged residents since it was approved three months ago. But the vote was short of the two-thirds margin needed to override a veto promised by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
The battle on the tax between the Governor and the Legislature is expected to rage through this week at least, and perhaps into next year. Mr. Weicker, a third-party Governor who proposed the tax in February, stood by it through three budget vetoes last summer and has vowed to defend it again by vetoing the bill passed tonight.
The vote in the House was 86 to 63, or 15 votes short of the two-thirds majority of 101 votes needed to override the Governor's veto. The Senate would also have to pass the bill and provide a two-thirds margin to override a veto if the measure is to become law.
Repeal leaders said after the vote that the fight was not over and that a strong vote in the Senate on Tuesday could still swing some House votes toward repeal.
"When the Senate vote comes through well over two-thirds, the pressure on the House members will be very strong," said Representative Reginald L. Jones, a Republican from Darien who led the repeal forces in the House debate, which raged for more than five hours before the vote.
 
Raising Other Taxes
 The repeal plan, which critics attacked as financially unbalanced and cruel to the poor, would raise most other taxes and cut state spending by about $213 million to compensate for the $1 billion that would be lost by eliminating the wage tax.
Repeal leaders released the final elements of their plan to replace the income tax just hours before the debate began, giving no time for public comment or analysis. But because the pivotal vote will actually come with the attempt to override the veto, probably later this week, the details were ignored by many speakers anyway. Some focused their comments on the next legislative elections, now only 11 months away, or on the broad philosophical issues of taxation, representative government and whether it is nobler to vote one's conscience or to mirror the will of one's constituents.
It was clear that many lawmakers viewed the importance of the day's work in larger terms than the success or failure of one piece of legislation. Many spoke of the huge rally on Oct. 5 that drew tens of thousands of tax protesters to the Capitol grounds and the vast unrest that those people represented.
"We can't just dismiss 50,000 people who came to protest," said Robert M. Ward, a Republican from North Ford. "Please vote with me to repeal."
If the repeal bill survives, it would restore much of the tax code that existed before August. But the measure has a handful of twists that would give some money back through tax cuts, take some away through spending and service cuts and leave some in place.
 
7 Percent on Capital Gains
 The state sales tax, now 6 percent, would go up to 8 1/4 percent, with the last one-quarter percent tacked on to pay off last year's deficit. And while the tax on wages would be revoked, the previous taxes on other types of income would be restored in a way that would hit more people -- and some people much harder.
Capital gains from the sale of assets or stock would be taxed at 7 percent as before. But for the first time, gambling income would also be taxed at that rate. Gambling income in the state is expected to go up next year when the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe opens a casino.
An earlier version of the bill approved tonight would have expanded the the state's gambling franchise with the introduction of video-slot machines. Of that gambling revenue, about $60 million a year would have been channeled back to local government to aid distressed cities. But gambling opponents amended the bill on the floor to eliminate the slot machines.
The budget bill would cut about $213 million from the $7.6 billion budget for the year that ends June 30. The single biggest reduction -- $50 million -- would come from the state's contribution to general assistance welfare.
 
Cuts in Welfare
 Under current law, the state pays 90 percent of local welfare costs. The House bill would cut that contribution to 45 percent, leaving towns the option of making up the difference themselves or cutting benefits.
The House bill would also tax income from dividends and interest at a sliding scale of from 5 percent to 10 percent. That is similar to the old law, but with a tax cut at the top, which was previously 14 percent. Income from rents and royalties would be taxed for the first time under that schedule, erasing many of the gains.
Debate on the plan echoed the elements of give-and-take embodied in the proposal. Supporters said that ending the system of wage-tax withholding would bring help the economy as residents opened their wallets. Opponents said the cuts were simply too harsh.
"This is a very mean-spirited budget whether individuals want to believe that or not," said Representative Ernest E. Newton II, a Democrat from Bridgeport, who voted against the repeal plan.

HEADLINE: Domino Founder Seizes Command

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Thomas Monaghan has returned to the pizza business.
Religious faith played the major role in Mr. Monaghan's decision late last week to return to the helm of Domino's Pizza Inc., a spokesman for the privately owned company said today. 
 "God will help him find the way," said Mike Jenkins, Domino's public relations director. "He believes he's being told that he must continue building, that he must continue in the pizza business."
And a tougher business it is, with rising competition and, for Domino's, scant profits.
Mr. Monaghan abruptly took command again as president on Friday. He left the current president the option of becoming a franchisee, and he reshuffled three other top managers.
 
'Once He Decided . . .'
 Mr. Monaghan started thinking about the move on Thursday, said Mr. Jenkins, who explained, "Once he decided that's what he wanted to do, he made the management changes to complement his style."
A Roman Catholic who grew up in an orphanage and became fabulously wealthy from the franchise pizza delivery business he founded in 1960, Mr. Monaghan, 54 years old, suddenly gave up active management of Domino's two years ago. He was putting the company on the auction block, he said, so he could devote more time to charitable causes.
The $1.2 billion price tag, however, failed to attract any serious buyers.
"The recession changed his mind for him," Mr. Jenkins explained. "No one wanted to buy it, except on the cheap. If he couldn't sell it, he felt he was meant to take it over again."
Mr. Monaghan's change of heart with respect to pizza apparently occurred as part of a larger spiritual reawakening. A one-time connoisseur of vintage automobiles and classic architecture, he has started fasting on bread and water each Wednesday and Friday and is putting many of his earthly possessions up for sale.
"He read a book, which inspired him, that said if you purchase things for pride, that's sinful," said Mr. Jenkins. "He's determined that he's done a lot of that, and for that reason he's going to get rid of a lot of things." Mr. Jenkins identified the book as "Mere Christianity" by C. S. Lewis, which Mr. Monaghan read last February.
Mr. Monaghan has already sold three houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, Mr. Jenkins said. Thirty cars, including a Bugatti bought for $13 million, will be sold soon. And construction on Mr. Monaghan's new $5 million house has been halted, Mr. Jenkins said, but it may be completed in some form "so it's not a complete waste."
In an interview three weeks ago in The Detroit News, Mr. Monaghan said that he might sell his Detroit Tigers baseball team, too, if he found the team to be a source of excessive pride. "None of the things I've bought, and I mean none of them, have ever really made me happy," he was quoted as saying.
The newspaper also reported that Mr. Monaghan said he would not have married his wife, a Lutheran, if he had known she would not convert to Catholicism. Mr. Jenkins said Mr. Monaghan had promised his wife to give no more interviews for a month, and was therefore unavailable for comment.
 
The Majority Rules
 As the owner of 99 percent of Domino's stock, Mr. Monaghan has the right to install the managers of his choosing. The remaining 1 percent of the stock is scattered among several owners, including the actor Tom Selleck, who portrays a Detroit Tiger in a movie about baseball in Japan.
When Domino's was put up for sale two years ago, four Monaghan associates were thrust into top management. Their careers changed abruptly again on Friday with the boss's decision to come back. None were available for comment.
David Black, 42, who twice wasnamed top Domino franchisee of the year before being asked to join the corporation, was replaced by Mr. Monaghan as president. Mr. Jenkins said Mr. Black was deciding whether to become a franchisee again.
John McDevitt, president of Mr. Monaghan's commercial real estate enterprise, has been named Domino's vice president of finance and administration, replacing Tim Carr in those positions, although Mr. Carr will continue to be Domino's treasurer and a vice president.
Douglas Dawson, who was Domino's vice president of international development, will keep his post as corporate secretary for the Tigers.
 
Tough Times in Pizza
 Domino's has 5,200 franchise stores in this country and 466 overseas. Last year franchisees took in revenue of $2.65 billion, according to Pizza Today magazine.
But the same economic weakness that depressed Mr. Monaghan's asking price for Domino's has made conditions tough in the pizza business. Last year, Domino's had revenues of $1.2 billion but netted a profit of only $5.4 million.
Meanwhile, competition in Domino's segment of the pizza market, home delivery, has grown. Pepsico's Pizza Hut -- with restaurant and delivery sales of $3.8 billion in the United States, compared with about $2.5 billion for Domino's -- has seized 24 percent of the delivery business since it entered the field in 1985. Domino's share, meanwhile, has dropped to 50 percent from 60 percent.
 
Domino's Still Expanding
 But the pizza industry continues to grow, and Domino's is still expanding to capitalize on a market in which the average American buys and eats seven pizzas a year.
Domino's boasts of delivering an average of one of those pizzas a year to every American. While filling in neighborhood coverage gaps in the nation's cities and penetrating small towns, the company is also opening new franchises overseas.
Although the pizza maker has traditionally emphasized speedy delivery, the company is also now stressing that quality is not sacrificed for speed. The company recently gained exclusive rights to sell pizza on Marine Corps bases.
The nation's third-largest pizza maker is Little Caesar Enterprises, owned by another Detroit-based entrepreneur, Michael Ilitch, who also owns the Detroit Red Wings hockey team.

HEADLINE: In a Time of Deficits, Florida Ponders The Unpopular Idea of an Income Tax

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 6

 BODY:
In a state that owes its rapid growth almost as much to its image as a tax haven as to its warm weather, officials are trying to avoid something that most of Florida's 13.5 million residents are dead set against: a personal income tax.
The Florida Legislature is to convene for a special session on Tuesday, and its mission will be to slice $622 million in spending from the state's $29.5 billion budget to comply with the state constitution's requirement of a balanced budget. 
 But even when those cuts are made, Florida's tax structure will probably still be unable to meet the state's ever-growing needs, and Gov. Lawton Chiles and other state officials know it.
"The reality is that it just won't work any more," T. K. Wetherell, a Daytona Beach Democrat who is House Speaker, said in an interview here. "Something has to give. You can't have a tax haven and at the same time tell people you're going to provide them with a utopia down here. You're going to have to do things that affect the quality of life, and that doesn't mean only palm trees and sunrises. It means cutting medical care and schools, too."
Or it means enacting new taxes. But politicans in Tallahassee are well aware of what happened when New Jersey raised several taxes and when an income tax was put in place in Connecticut: New Jerseyans voted out many incumbents and Connecticut voters are threatening to do the same.
Florida, whose population grew by nearly 50 percent during the 1980's, is now one of only seven states with no form personal income tax. Instead, it has relied on a sales tax, now at 6 percent, for about two thirds of its general revenue. Most of the rest comes from licenses, corporate income taxes, and levies on alcohol, cigarettes, gasoline and betting.
As long as residents and visitors were able to spend generously, Florida was able to get by on a tax system developed more than 50 years ago, when the state was the least-populated in the South. But the deepening economic recession, which has brought a slackening of tourism and slowed the purchase of consumer goods, has forced officials of what is now the nation's fourth most-populous state to scale back their revenue collection estimates by 5 percent this year.
Doug Cook, the state's Budget Director, estimates that the budget deficit for the 1992-93 fiscal year, which starts July 1, could be $1.7 billion. That gap is likely to widen: new residents continue to flock to Florida at a rate of nearly 1,000 a day, and many are elderly retirees, immigrants from Latin America and other groups that require more social services than the rest of the population.
"Unlike New York and California, our service level is so low to begin with, and our growth so high, that even if we hold even, we've got a hell of a problem," Mr. Cook said.
 
Large Need for Services
 Florida has the highest percentage of people 60 years old or older of any state, more than one of every five residents. It also has a rapidly growing population that is 18 or younger, which in recent years was reflected in annual increases of 100,000 or more in school enrollments, requiring the state to pay for new classrooms and teachers.
Per capita, Florida residents pay from 15 to 20 percent less in state taxes than the nationwide average, according to Federal Government statistics. As Mr. Wetherell put it, "not only do we not have an income tax, we don't have much of an inheritance tax, the real estate taxes are half what they are in Northeastern states," and there is an exemption from taxes on the first $25,000 of the value of a home.
But Floridians still appear to expect most of the same services as residents of other states. Governor Chiles's "reality budget," which calls for teacher layoffs, cutbacks in health care programs and delays in opening new prisons, has drawn protests from advocacy groups and voters who supported the Democrat in last year's election.
One obvious way for the state to increase revenued for such programs would be to institute a personal income tax, which economists say could immediately generate more than $3 billion a year if such a tax were no more than the national average, 2.4 percent. But that would require first a cumbersome constitutional amendment and then a vote by the Legislature, which is also dominated by Democrats.
As both the Governor and the Legislature know, there is little public support for such a move. The Florida Opinion Poll, published in June by Florida newspapers owned by The New York Times Company, found that while 74 percent of Florida voters think they will be paying a state income tax by the end of the decade, only 25 percent said they would vote for such a proposal.
"It's not in my plans now," Mr. Chiles said of a state income tax during an interview at the Capitol, his pet dog asleep on a sofa at his side. "I'm not going to waste my time with something that's not going to happen."
 
Proposal on Exemptions
 Instead, political leaders and business groups seem to favor eliminating or scaling back many of the exemptions to the sales tax, like those on groceries and medicine that deprive the state of more than $2.7 billion in revenue each year. There has also been talk of instituting some sort of value-added tax, which would impose a levy on each stage of production and sale of products, and some conservative analysts have suggested fiscal restraint as the solution to the budget deficit.
"We're really not in a crisis situation," said Randall G. Holcombe, an economics professor at Florida State University here. "The temporary problems we are facing now are due more to spending than to our tax structure. Taxes have been going up faster than income, but our problem is that spending is going up faster than taxes."
Mr. Chiles has repeatedly said he will veto any tax increase unless it is preceded by a thorough reorganization of the state government, involving the shrinking some state agencies and the combining of others. He said voters would accept new taxes only if "we can tell them they are getting their money's worth."
"I'm going to have one shot at this, and I don't want it to be a patch job," he said. "The long-term problem is that Florida is operating with both an antiquated delivery system and an antiquated revenue system. We need to reform that delivery system and then we want to look at major tax reforms."
The Governor favors a new system that relies more on local initiatives and eliminates overlapping programs.
Senator Gwen Margolis, a North Miami Beach Democrat who is president of the Senate, said she expected the tax and budget issues to dominate the Legislature's regular session, which begins in January. She, like Mr. Chiles, talked of a gradual effort to persuade voters to accept a more broadly based tax system.
"Since we have so many constitutional prohibitions, the entire issue is extremely difficult," she said. "People don't rise up and say 'tax me, tax me.' They have to be sold on the need for new taxes and shown that a major erosion of their life is happening."

U S West Plans to Cut 6,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
U S West Inc., the Colorado-based regional telephone company for 14 states, said yesterday that it planned to lay off or give early-retirement incentives to about 6,000 employees, or nearly 9 percent of its work force. The company also said it would sharply lower the value of $1.7 billion of real estate holdings on its books.
As a result, U S West will take a $590 million charge against earnings that is likely to slice its full-year profits in half. The earnings penalty, known as a non-cash charge, means that the company will perform an accounting entry that does not require new money or the setting aside of special funds.
 
Similar to Other Bell Moves
 Even though U S West had not previously announced that it expected a charge, analysts did not express surprise at the announcement. Other of the so-called Baby Bells have either taken or are considering similar charges. 
 The Nynex Corporation, the major provider of local telephone service in New York and New England, for example, said last month that it planned to reduce its work force by 9,900 and take a $550 milion charge, most of it for severance pay and other costs.
Kenneth M. Leon, a telecommunications analyst at Bear, Stearns, said, however, that some elements of the U S West charge were peculiar to the company. "This is just part of the cleansing of the 1980's, tidying up after the merger and acquisition boom," he said. "U S West had gotten into the real estate market to a greater extent than other Baby Bells, so this charge is actually a positive development."
 
Lower Earnings Seen
 Mr. Leon reduced his 1991 earnings estimate for U S West to $1.35 a share from $2.80 a share. But he raised his 1992 earnings estimate to $3.15 a share from $3.05 a share.
U S West's shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed at $34 each yesterday, down 50 cents.
All of the seven Bell regional holding companies, as well as the GTE Corporation, must compete against a growing number of smaller, often more efficient telecommunications companies. The smaller competitors can pick off the local phone companies' most lucrative business customers while leaving the local carriers with the job of providing phone service for residential customers, a business that has slower growth and is more tightly regulated.
Although U S West's annual growth for local telephone lines is only 3 percent, it is one of the highest among the Baby Bells.
But U S West also has a tougher competitive situation because it has more land and fewer people than other Baby Bells. Based in Englewood, Colo., it serves more than 25 million people in the states of Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. That coverage area is roughly 40 percent of the United States land mass.
U S West has agreed to new incentive-based regulation from state regulators. In return for a lower rate of return for the company and more stable bills for ratepayers, U S West has received more pricing flexibility and less stringent regulation. But a weak Western economy, plus the lower rates of return, have served to flatten profits and revenue.
 
How the Charges Break Down
 Last year, U S West earned $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion the year before. Revenue in 1990 was $9.96 billion, compared with $9.7 billion the year before.
About $150 million of the fourth-quarter charge relates to work-force reductions. The 6,000 employees will be off the payrolls over the next three years in a still-to-be-determined combination of layoffs, early retirement and attrition. About 1,000 temporary workers may be hired next year, said Howard P. Doerr, U S West's chief financial officer.
Roughly $320 million of the charge will come from reducing the book value of 57 buildings that U S West has in its portfolio, a reduction to about $1.2 billion from $1.7 billion.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Set to Combat Middle Age

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The World Trade Center, still sleek on the outside, is unmistakably aging on the inside and in need of hundreds of millions of dollars in renovations if it is to hold its place in a competitive real-estate market.
Some of its shortcomings are subtle -- by today's computerized standards, for example, the elevators that climb the 20-year-old, 110-story twin towers of the center do not move efficiently. 
 But others are far more glaring. The center's claustrophobic underground shopping concourse has none of the stylish innovations that have brought light and color to newer malls, including some nearby.
 
A 10-Year Program
 To correct these problems and others, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the buildings, is about to initiate 10 years of renovations, spending $500 million to $800 million to spruce up one of the most prestigious and lucrative jewels in its far-flung empire. The Trade Center -- with much of it commercial office space -- earned $409 million last year, about $110 million more than its operating costs.
How much the Port Authority spends on renovations, authority officials said, will depend in part on how much tenants are willing to contribute.
Some changes will take place far from the public eye. The building's electrical system must be upgraded to handle growing demands from new technology like the fax machine. The center's vast air-conditioning hub will also need attention. Situated five stories underground, the refrigeration plant contains seven monstrous machines capable of cooling 50,000 houses. There, center managers say, more machines must be added to counteract the heat that will be generated by the new electrical wiring that is planned.
But other modifications will be in full view, like the extensive international food court that under preliminary plans would be constructed adjacent to the outdoor stone-floored plaza between the twin towers. The complex's first Japanese restaurant -- long sought by its numerous Japanese tenants -- is to open within months in the underground shopping concourse.
Though most specific plans are subject to approval by the Port Authority's board, the agency's highest-ranking officials, including its chairman and executive director, are firmly committed to the project.
"No matter how good-looking the building is, if we can't meet the needs of our business tenants, they won't stay," said Stanley Brezenoff, the executive director of the Port Authority. "We feel as though we're a vital complex, we're competitive now, and this is really an effort to remain competitive and strong in the future."
Though stung by the recession, the trade center is hardly in disrepair. Port Authority officials emphasize that the complex, despite some aging parts, is safe and running smoothly. And with 11 percent of its space vacant -- albeit more unleased space than it has had in years -- it is still far healthier than lower Manhattan as a whole, which has 20 percent of its commercial office space open.
The center is now such a money maker that its revenues pare much of the annual, gaping deficit for the PATH rail line, which the agency took on as part of the deal in the 1960's that allowed it to build the towers.
 
Victim of Its Own Success
 The trade center has in some ways become a victim of its own success. By reviving lower Manhattan, it helped draw in new competitors like the World Financial Center, which opened in 1985.
Like other new office developments in the region, the World Financial Center presents restless businesses with an attractive alternative to the twin towers. Add to that mix a sluggish real-estate market, and the center has little choice but to upgrade.
"Not only do businesses want a good financial deal, they want a high quality building with all the amenities," said Mr. Brezenoff, the Port Authority executive director. "I've personally gotten involved in talking with tenants in order to hold them here and attract them here. I didn't expect that, but it's necessary."
The trade center must also devise a way to attract the residents of Battery Park City, TriBeCa and even Hoboken, N.J. -- people who were not part of the neighborhood when the towers went up and who see the the 64-store shopping concourse as a congested passageway to the subways and PATH trains.
"There are cheap stores in there," said Carol Graham, who works at Kyowa/Saitama Bank on the 60th floor of Tower One. "I never shop there."
Others complain that the dimly lighted concourse is too difficult to get around, too packed with banks and too sparsely populated by restaurants. And it seems to pale in comparison to the Winter Garden, the spectacular glass atrium in the World Financial Center ringed with upscale shops and snappy restaurants.
"You come to the World Trade Center and you expect the concourse to be something fantastic, something you might find only in New York," said Keith Rakow, a translator at Daiichi Kangyo Bank, on Tower One's 48th floor. "Really, it has no more character than an old suburban mall."
Trade Center officials have already added some trendy tenants aimed squarely at young professionals -- among them a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop and the Tie Rack. More are on the way. And an effort is being made to turn some of the blander storefronts into bouquets of color and light. There is also serious talk of the food court, as well as construction to let in sunlight.
Of more pressing importance are the center's 250 elevators -- 99 are in each tower, with the rest spread among the Vista Hotel, the United States Customs House and three other office buildings. Known as the buildings' vertical transportation system, the elevators carry 50,000 center occupants and 70,000 visitors each day.
At the time the center opened, the elevators were considered revolutionary because they borrowed the concept of express and local service from mass transit. While they move quickly, once you get on, the elevators are notoriously slow to get to prospective passengers. "Tenants don't accept waiting times beyond 30 seconds," said Robert C. DiChiara, the general manager for program development for the center, who adds that the expectations are reasonable.
 
An Efficiency Problem
 The problem -- one of efficiency, not safety -- lies in the outdated electrical switches, housed in small closets around the complex, that act as elevator traffic cops. The solution, Mr. DiChiara said, would be replacing the switches with new microprocessors that reduce waiting time and give passengers a smoother ride. The Port Authority is seriously studying the option, Mr. DiChiara said.
Another problem is electricity. As tenants turn on thousands of computers, fax machines and photocopiers each morning, they are demanding more electrical power than planners ever imagined. For now there is enough electricity to go around, but center managers say the towers are rapidly approaching their limit.
Again, relief will come deep underground, this time in a small room where snarls of fat wires known as feeders transport electricity into the building from a nearby Consolidated Edison sub-station. Under current plans, additional feeders would be added and new circuit-breakers and wiring would be installed to circulate that new power throughout the towers, said August K. Preschle, the general manager of the trade center.
 
A Prestigious Magnet
 For all the flaws conceded by its own managers, the trade center is still a prestigious magnet for airlines, shipping companies, brokers and foreign banks. And only the Sears Tower in Chicago is taller.
"It's a very famous building, even in Japan," said Toru Kukihara, president of Fuji Bank and Trust Company, the center's largest Japanese tenant. "Most of the Japanese people know One World Trade Center and Two World Trade Center."
And though she complains that the concourse is "a drag," Adrienne Brown, a receptionist at a law firm in Tower One, said the complex still inspired awe.
"I am so amazed, just by the height, the view of the skyline," said Ms. Brown, who works at Brown & Wood on the 58th floor. "I can't believe I work in the World Trade Center."


GRAPHIC: The complex is so big that a wide-angle lens is needed to get a relatively unobstructed view of all seven buildings in a single photograph. The lens, aimed to the west, tends to make straight features like buildings and streets appear to be bent.

Resignation Controversy At Kidder

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Charles Peabody, a banking analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, has left the Wall Street firm amid a controversy that his recent research critical of the Chase Manhattan Corporation had been suppressed.
He left his post last Tuesday to become a founding partner of East Shore Partners, Springfield, N.J., a new securities firm specializing in research and trading in banking securities. 
 Mr. Peabody, who is 36 years old, declined to comment on a report by the columnist Dan Dorfman in U.S.A. Today yesterday, which said that Mr. Peabody left Kidder because the firm put pressure on him to drop an unfavorable report on Chase Manhattan. "I left on my own terms under what I thought were amicable conditions," Mr. Peabody said.
Helen Platt, senior vice president for corporate communications at Kidder, said "we deny categorically that we supressed any report by Charley" and added that "the firm did not pressure him to resign."
Mr. Peabody said that as a relatively small new firm, East Shore was "uniquely positioned" to comment on the changes in banking, partly because it does not expect to be a significant underwriter of new bank securities, or a trading partner with banks, two important sources of profit for larger firms.
"There is going to be a lot of volatility in the banking industry as the strong get stronger and weak disappear," Mr. Peabody said.
Mr. Peabody's most recent research on Chase was not published by Kidder, but was disseminated to investors at a conference in November sponsored by Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a New York based newsletter.
At that meeting, and in later talks with investors, Mr. Peabody said Chase's earnings and stock price were due for a sharp fall as the company increased its reserve for loan losses, and incurred additional expenses from another round of employee layoffs.
Mr. Peabody said Chase's holdings of deeply troubled commercial real estate loans would continue to increase and that the bank did not have enough reserves to handle losses of 30 percent to 40 percent on the troubled loans.
Mr. Peabody said he planned to use the knowledge gained in bank research in other areas. Earlier this year, for example, he noted that comments by Citicorp officials about their credit-card business during the disappointing back-to-school selling period were an early warning of weak consumer spending patterns that were continuing.
East Shore, which now has six partners and employees, has a sales and trading office in Melville, L.I., in addtion to its Springfield, N.J., office.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Short-Term Rates Move Lower

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Short-term interest rates continued to fall yesterday, as traders and investors bought Treasury bills and notes on the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board would lower key rates again soon.
That expectation helped increase demand at the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills; rates on those securities fell to their lowest levels in more than 19 years. 
 On Friday, the Fed signaled that it had lowered its target for the overnight Federal funds rate to 4 1/2 percent after the Government reported that non-farm payroll employment fell by more than 240,000 jobs during November.
Normally, analysts said, the Fed might want to delay further easing until it could determine if the economy was responding to lower rates. But with Congress and the Bush Administration apparently moving to create ways to stimulate the economy, the Fed is under pressure to apply more monetary stimulus soon, the analysts said. And the next meeting of the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee is only a week away.
"Personally, I would like to see some patience, to allow the Fed some time to see how the reductions in rates they have engineered since August are working," said Samuel J. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. "But given the politics of the moment, they will probably ease."
 
Treasury's Bill Auctions
 That sort of thinking was prevalent at the Treasury's bill auctions yesterday.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.21 percent, down from an average rate of 4.39 percent at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the auction on Aug. 21, 1972, when the rate was 4.058 percent.
Meanwhile, bids on new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 4.20 percent, down from the 4.39 percent average at the auction a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a new six-month bill since the auction on June 12, 1972, when the rate was 4.187 percent.
Prices of long-term bonds, after posting early gains, fell back on a report from the Reuters news service that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady reportedly told Republican governors attending a closed-door session in Salt Lake City that the Administration would push for an aggressive economic growth package in 1992.
Bond traders are fearful that the combination of an overly stimulative fiscal package and easy monetary policy will refuel inflation and erode the value of long-term fixed-income securities.
Mr. Kahan and others said the Fed was also worried about that scenario, and might be trying to avoid it by easing monetary policy again soon.
"By easing again this month, the Fed may be hoping for a little pickup in the economy early next year that would obviate the need for any fiscal stimulus package," Mr. Kahan said.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 1/2, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.78 percent, compared with 7.80 percent late Friday. Earlier in the session, the benchmark issue had traded as high as 102 25/32.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at 101 31/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.21 percent. And the 5.50 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 27/32, up 1/4 point, to yield 5.04 percent.
Activity in the investment-grade corporate bond market was highlighted by a $1.206 billion offering from the General Motors Acceptance Corporation of securities backed by auto-loan receivables.
The 5.70 percent securities, which carry a final maturity of Dec. 15, 1996, have an average expected life of 1.88 years. They were priced at $99.906, to yield 5.814 percent, 73 basis points, or 73 one-hundredths of a percentage point, more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 5.50 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard and Poor's Corporation.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager on an offering of $150 million worth of 30-year first mortgage bonds by the Arizona Public Service Company.
The 9 percent bonds, which are non-callable for 10 years, were priced at $98.875, to yield 9.11 percent, 1.30 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
The securities, which have a final maturity of Dec. 15, 2021, are rated Baa-3 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
The activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was sluggish, traders said. Prices of most quoted issues were up by about 1/4 point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most widely quoted bonds were unchanged at the close of a quiet session.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures) 

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98,936	97,877	Discounted Rate	4.21%	4.20%	Coupon Yield	4.33%	4.36%	High Price	98,941	97,882	Discounted Rate	4.19%	4.19	Coupon Yield	4.30%	4.35%	Low Price	98,936	97,872	Discounted Rate	4.21%	4.21%	Coupon Yield	4.33%	4.37%	Accepted at low price	31%	8%	Total applied for	$36,756,950	$39,147,080	Accepted	$10,291,640	$10,203,475	N.Y. applied for	$32,967,300	$36,278,805	N.Y. accepted	$8,835,175	$9,338,280	Noncompetitive	$1,548,910	$1,041,895

HEADLINE: ALBANY NOTEBOOK;
And Cuomo Chooses: (Budget? Duty? Ego? Gore?)

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 9

 BODY:
"It's as simple as that," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was saying today, explaining how the state budget mess continues to control his decision on whether to run for President.
But to many who watched Mr. Cuomo in the last two months, little has seemed simple about his decision making. Those who have dared to read the Cuomo tea leaves have found a muddy brew of contradictory signals in their cups. 
 Last week, for instance, Mr. Cuomo convinced many political analysts that he had decided to run because three of his top advisers had begun setting up a shadow campaign organization.
But today, Mr. Cuomo suggested strongly that he could not announce his candidacy without a legislative agreement to close this year's budget gap, a message that seemed to provide a disincentive for Republican legislators to reach a compromise.
 
Knocking Opportunity
 "If the negotiations aborted or we don't have a current year plan, under those circumstances I couldn't in good conscience declare a candidacy," he said in an interview on WAMC-FM radio in Albany. "It seems to me to be inappropriate to ask the nation for a grander opportunity of public service when I have not yet adequately dealt with the one to which I'm already committed."
Thus just as Mr. Cuomo seemed to be edging toward a formal declaration, he continued to reinforce a rationale for why he could not run.
For Mr. Cuomo, there is a certain logic to all of this. The Governor says he wants to run but is prevented from doing so by his sense of duty to the state. Realizing that time is growing short, he has decided to make all possible preparations to run an effective campaign if he decides to enter the race.
But the country is cynical these days about politicians who claim to place duty ahead of ambition. And many political analysts have long viewed Mr. Cuomo's protracted deliberations as a calculated strategy to dominate the political news as a non-candidate while shortening his campaign for the Democratic nomination.
On the other side, some longtime Cuomo advisers in Albany believe that Mr. Cuomo has never had a deep desire to run for President, and does not now. But unable to resist the ego gratification of a Presidential draft, they say, he revived speculation about his ambitions and then took a self-indulgent political joyride.
Now, these advisers speculate, Mr. Cuomo needs an excuse not to run and has found it in the state budget. Even some of his aides have theorized that Mr. Cuomo wants to make a convincing case that the budget is the only reason he cannot run and that he does not suffer from self-doubt, skeletons in the closet or lack of support.
Those aides guessed that Mr. Cuomo may be trying to advance the perception that he truly wants to run, and thus approved the highly public effort by the State Democratic Party Chairman, John A. Marino, to lay groundwork for a campaign.
 
Rumors, Rumors, Rumors
 The only thing more prevalent here and in Washington than theories about Mr. Cuomo's intentions are the rumors about when he will say something and what it might be.
Last Friday, Mr. Marino's switchboard lit up with calls from reporters who had heard that Mr. Cuomo and his son, Andrew, were making courtesy calls to the announced Democratic candidates telling them of the Governor's plans to run.
On the same day, Harold Holzer, a press secretary to Vincent Tese, the state's Economic Development Commissioner and a Cuomo confidant, got calls from reporters who had heard that Mr. Tese had canceled a weekend golf outing in Augusta, Ga., because he wanted to be around for Mr. Cuomo's announcement. Mr. Tese had canceled his golf trip to be with his family, Mr. Holzer said.
For several weeks, the rumormongers were saying that Mr. Cuomo wanted to announce a running mate at the same time he announced his candidacy, and that Senators Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas were the leading contenders. Another tidbit, which was just as inaccurate as the others, had Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, an announced Democratic candidate, visiting the Executive Mansion for a job interview several weeks ago.
Other rumors crop up almost hourly predicting that Mr. Cuomo will make an announcement on a particular day this week or next week. One of them is likely to be right.
"It's so out of control that I'm not spreading any more rumors," Mr. Holzer said. "That's a saturation point I've never reached before."
 
Fears for Credit Rating
 Mr. Cuomo, who discussed the budget with legislative leaders and their aides in an hourlong meeting tonight, said today that the absence of a state budget would create not only a logistical obstacle to his candidacy but a political obstacle as well. He predicted that further delay would damage the state's credit rating, which is already the third lowest in the country after those of Louisiana and Massachusetts, and give his potential opponents more ammunition about his New York record.
"How can you run for President if you're leaving behind a state whose credit is failing?" he asked. "I cannot use Washington as an excuse for not having a budget here."
Another factor weighing on Mr. Cuomo and his advisers is the jury in the Federal fraud trial of Assembly Speaker Mel Miller. If Mr. Miller is convicted, Mr. Cuomo's budget negotiations with the Legislature could be thrown into chaos as a leadership fight develops in the Assembly.
"That would be everything," said one Cuomo adviser. "Talk about a kicker."

HEADLINE: In Switch, Business Groups Favor Keeping New Taxes

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Business groups that adamantly opposed Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8-billion tax increase 18 months ago warned today that New Jersey would collapse if the taxes were eliminated.
In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, the state's most powerful business associations, the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the New Jersey Association of Business and Industry, predicted "chaos" if the taxes are withdrawn and accused the Democrats of undertaking a "scorched-earth policy" for moving to repeal the taxes. 
 The dramatic reversal by the business groups paralleled that of New Jersey Republicans, who opposed the taxes when they were enacted and campaigned against them to win overwhelming control of the Legislature last month, but who now accuse the Democrats of being irresponsible for trying to repeal them.
 
The Wave of Voter Anger
 Republican members of the Appropriations Committee boycotted the hearing today at which the tax-repeal measures were debated.
The Republicans also refused to attend a general session of the State Assembly at which the same repeal package was to have been introduced.
The Senate committee hearing was held to consider five related bills that would repeal the $2.8-billion increase in state sales and income taxes at the end of the current budget year next June 30. Ending the tax increases would mean that the next Legislature, in which the Republicans will hold two-thirds majorities in both houses, would have to restore all or part of the taxes or face the prospect of sending the state into bankruptcy.
The alternative, cutting billions of dollars out of the next budget, is widely viewed as impossible. By one measure, overcoming a $2.8-billion cutback in revenue through job cuts would mean eliminating every one of the 65,000 jobs in state government.
The turnaround in attitudes toward taxes came only a month after the Republicans' runaway election victory, which resulted almost solely from voters' anger over the tax increase voted by the Democrats in the Legislature at the urging of the Governor.
Although Republicans campaigned relentlessly against the entire tax increase, once the election was over they said they would cut only a part of it, a one-cent increase in the sales tax that accounted for about $590 million.
Then the Democrats announced that they would seek a rollback themselves, in the lame-duck session they will control until the Republicans take over next month.
 
Labor and Business Agree
 When the repeal package came before the Senate committee today, representatives of the American Federal of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations testified against it, as did the Communications Workers of America, which represents 38,000 state employees, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents an additional 10,000.
They were joined by James Morford, vice president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, who said that removing the revenues the taxes produce would have severe effect on government services, create uncertainty and unpredictability and adversely affect the business climate in the state.
Bruce Coe, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said that repealing the taxes or adding a "sunset" provision to them would throw the state into "chaos."
Asked if he trusted the incoming Republican majority to act responsibly in reinstating taxes to keep the government going and the economic climate sound, Mr. Coe smiled and replied, "Who was it who said that no man is safe and his property secure when the Legislature or the Congress is in session?"
The committee chairman, Laurence S. Weiss, a Democrat of Woodbridge, said the hearings would resume on Wednesday and the repeal bills would come to a vote on Thursday.
 
The Republicans Are Missing
 The repeal of all or a substantial part of the tax package in the Senate is considered likely.
Predictions are harder to come by in the Assembly, where the Speaker, Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne, accused the Republicans of willfully impeding the legislative process and threatened to have them dragged back by the sergeant at arms or state police, if necessary, to get a quorum.
Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, the minority leader and the lone Republican to appear for the Assembly session today -- he reported himself officially absent -- said Republicans would not attend any session unless the Democrats mustered a quorum on their own.
"If the Democrats wish to ignore the will of the people and continue the error of their ways, they will do so without our help," he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Bleak Season For Natural Gas

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
THE futures market for natural gas and the market for shares of natural gas companies have both just about written off the winter of 1991-92 as another disappointment for the long-depressed industry.
The contract for January gas in the spot market fell again yesterday, by 4 cents, to $1.94 for one million British thermal units, from a peak of $2.33 on Oct. 15. The plunge has coincided with several weeks of unusually warm weather in the East. 
 And after a selloff in the last month, shares of a group of large independent natural gas producers, including Enron Oil and Gas, Anadarko Petroleum, Burlington Resources and Cabot Oil and Gas, are up 8 percent for the year, compared with an increase of 14 percent in the Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrial company stocks.
Two years ago, many analysts and producers figured that the end was near for a period of gas oversupply dating from the early 1980's. The dominant view is that gas prices are likely to remain depressed, with the yearly average spot price not rising much above $2 for one million B.T.U.'s before 1995, from about $1.40 this year.
Timothy J. Curro, energy analyst at UBS Securities in New York, said, "I don't think a very strong case can be made for the price of natural gas for the next three or four years."
Ronald J. Barone, a managing director and analyst at Kidder, Peabody in New York, said, "This is the worst year for gas prices in a long, long time."
Rising output from areas like the Gulf of Mexico, the Mobile Bay region of Alabama and the Anadarko Basin in Arkansas and Oklahoma helps explain the ample supply. So do the recession and warm winters, which have curbed demand.
Advances in drilling technology, including seismic studies that give geologists a clearer gauge of likely reserve sites and improvements in completing wells, are another factor. Production is up, even though the number of rigs drilling for gas plunged to 299 in the week ended Dec. 6, from 495 a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
Also, big inventories remained in pipelines and storage tanks this fall after one of the warmest winters of the century last year.
Supplies also increased as a result of tax credits that Congress approved last year for gas drillers. Drillers are now receiving credits of 87 cents for one million B.T.U.'s of gas produced from coal layers, called coal-seam gas. Another tax credit, equal to 52 cents for one million B.T.U.'s, has sharply expanded drilling in tight-sands areas, where gas is locked in dense rock formations.
William A. Johnson, president of the Jofree Corporation, an energy consulting firm in Houston, forecast last month that tax-subsidized gas produced in the United States would rise to 5 percent of total gas output in the next few years, from 2.4 percent this year. Subsidized gas "is a major culprit currently driving down prices" and could send spot prices below $1 next summer, he said.
The prevailing gloom among gas producers is a striking reversal from the optimism of 1989, when the shares of many independent producers soared by more than 50 percent. The popular view then was that production would gradually fall, especially in the abundant Gulf of Mexico fields, and that demand would be raised by the Clean Air Act and new gas-fired electricity plants being built.
"We were very bullish on prices a few years ago," said Robert W. Harvey, head of domestic natural gas consulting at McKinsey & Company in Houston. His view is a centrist one in the debate over gas supplies and future prices. He sees prices rising barely above $2 in 1993.
"A couple of years ago, people acted on the belief that the gas bubble's demise was imminent, and they drilled more," he said. "We've seen a complete reversal on the score. The bearish view that has swept the industry today may be the first sign that a correction is possible in gas prices over the next two to four years."
Some analysts are more bullish. Paul R. Leibman, a principal at Petrie, Parkman & Company in Denver, said that falling drilling rates should cut into supplies within the next three years. "We actually see a tight gas market in the '93-'95 period," he said, with prices rising to $2.50 per million B.T.U.'s.
Indeed, some independent producers like Tom Brown Inc. in Midland, Tex., have acquired gas reserves at bargain prices in the last few years in the hope that prices will rebound.
"I want to be there with a big pile of reserves when the market turns," said Donald L. Evans, chairman and chief executive. "But with a recession and what looks like a mild winter, there is not a lot of reason to feel like gas prices will move to higher levels soon. We're hoping for '92, but it might not be before '94."

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Learning to Survive After Mate Loses Job

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: NORWALK, Conn.

 BODY:
A FRIEND of Judith Guthman recently confided that her husband had been downsized. This is corporate-speak for fired. Mrs. Guthman knew that joblessness was happening to thousands across the country, 241,000 last month alone. Everyone knows someone who's been downsized. That's how dread of the future spreads.
Mrs. Guthman knew the standard rationale for job-chopping, the need to cut costs by cutting people, especially middle management. But until recently Mrs. Guthman had no idea of the familywide impact of this modern Darwinism on the husband, on the wife, on their emotional and physical relations, on the children and on everyone's values and expectations for the future. (Not to mention the wrath directed at political incumbents.) 
 Which is how about 20 women happened to gather at Norwalk Community College the other morning for an unusual new one-day course: How to Survive the Holidays and Beyond When Your Husband Is Looking for Work. "Everybody feels this mounting vulnerability," said Mrs. Guthman, who works in the college's continuing education department. "You see friends picked up right and left by these immense impersonal forces. It's really a fundamental restructuring of society."
Randy Nelson, a psychotherapist and one of the teachers, saw it similarly. "The Northeast," she said, "is an area brimming with anxiety. If I have a job, will I lose it? If I lose my job, will I get another? If I get another, will I lose it too?"
The teachers were women who were psychologists, counselors and writers, most of whom had experienced the pain of living with an unemployed spouse. The students were nearly two dozen wives, youthful to middle-aged, whose husbands have brought involuntary unemployment into their well-maintained, well-mortgaged homes in affluent communities named Greenwich, Darien, Westport and Fairfield. It's a new phenomenon among white-collar workers raised in an economic culture promising to reward hard work and company loyalty with lifetime employment on the success ladder. Now they don suits and ties only for rare job interviews.
The wives were attentive, taking notes, nodding and expressing intense reluctance to be identified. They described suddenly sullen husbands isolating themselves, which worried the wives, frightened the children, and corroded the family.
The scene was eerily similar -- down to the uneaten doughnuts -- to sessions in community colleges and church basements across the Midwest eight years ago when farm wives would secretly gather with church counselors to whisper about their troubled husbands. In those days local banks cut costs by tightening the screws on many farm families, who were only doing what their parents had always assured them would insure success: work hard and everything will take care of itself.
In the Norwalk class, Bernadette Kenny, a onetime victim of downsizing who now helps train dismissed workers to find new work, described the familiar scene. One day the workers are called in and turned out for reasons having little if anything to do with their work. She recalled one manager who had devoted his entire life to one company before being fired, surveying the ruins of his career and repeating, "It isn't fair."
The women were warned their unemployed spouses will experience grief, anger, a sense of betrayal and denial, and possibly be consumed by silent, useless wonderings over what they could have done differently. "Don't try to figure it out," advised Gilda Dangot, whose salesman husband has been twice unemployed. "Chances are your husband did nothing wrong. It's someone else's fault and he's probably still working."
The women were advised to be supportive, not blaming; to share their fears even if he doesn't reciprocate; to steer husbands into all-male support groups to counter destructive isolation and to temper the temptation toward Pollyanna-ism with an understanding of his embarrassment and the unaccustomed and demeaning powerlessness of job-seeking in a buyer's market.
Teachers also suggested organizing politically and re-inventing year-end holidays, making them less a time of excessive spending and more a time of investing attention in each other through inexpensive games, renting movies, making clothes, even exchanging massages.
"Yes, unemployment is unpleasant," said Ms. Dangot. " But I'm not alone. We may emerge stronger. And joblessness is not terminal."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Argues Its Case, But Wall St. Is Bearish

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Calling 1991 a "disappointment" and an "aberration," John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman, argued the company's case before Wall Street analysts yesterday at an unusual briefing in which the company's top five executives detailed plans for decentralizing the world's largest computer maker.
But in Wall Street's eyes, yesterday's presentation fell short. 
After hearing the company's cautious 1992 earnings forecast, skeptical Wall Street investors hammered I.B.M.'s stock, sending it down $3.875 to a nine-year low of $85.125 yesterday in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
"After the presentation, a lot of analysts returned to their offices and began cutting their earnings estimates," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. He said many analysts decided that their projections were too high after the International Business Machines Corporation said its revenues were expected to grow at a single-digit rate next year.
 
Disappointed Analysts
 Other analysts said they had a negative view of I.B.M. because they still did not see the company making fundamental changes to control costs, despite its plans for decentralizing its operations and cutting its payroll by 20,000 next year. As such, a number of portfolio managers decided to sell the stock because any significant earnings growth seemed to await improvements in the economy.
"The key for me is the overwhelming view that I.B.M. is trying to grow its way out of its problems, and really nothing's changed," said Stephen K. Smith, an analyst at Paine Webber. "That's not what people want to hear. I.B.M. still continues to see the mainframe through rose-colored glasses."
The briefing followed the company's recent disclosure that it would break itself up into a federation of competing businesses. Yesterday, Mr. Akers reiterated that the company was considering a variety of options, including eventually selling portions or perhaps all or several of its businesses, seeking new investments and joint ventures and taking its top executives out of the day-to-day operations of its newly independent companies.
When I.B.M. disclosed two weeks ago that it planned to cut its work force by at least another 20,000 employees next year through a program of incentives and early retirements , it said it was setting aside $3 billion to cover the costs of the changes.
Mr. Akers said yesterday that the plan for radically changing I.B.M.'s structure and freeing its individual businesses to act with more autonomy, detailed last week, would re-energize the Armonk, N.Y., company.
"We are about to close the books on the most difficult year in the history of the information-technology industry," Mr. Akers said. "We're embarking on a very different I.B.M. than you and I have known all of our professional lives."
Saying that I.B.M. planned to increase its return on equity, which is now about 14 percent, to 18 percent over the next three years, I.B.M.'s chairman challenged the company's Japanese competitors. He argued that they would soon find I.B.M. was a tough competitor in many equipment and component markets.
"The strategy of the Japanese has been to attack the suppliers of their competition," said James Magid, a financial analyst at Needham & Company. "I.B.M. recognizes that system is open at every level and that they have to be a major participant at all levels of the business."
Despite the bearish Wall Street analysts, some appeared favorably impressed by Mr. Akers's aggressive performance.
A number said that they saw meaningful long-term changes at the company and gave Mr. Akers credit for making hard decisions and implementing the corporate restructuring.
"It was a good meeting," said Jay P. Stevens, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "This is the first time we've ever seen the C.F.O. stand up there and present real business models."
Frank Metz, the company's chief financial officer, said that I.B.M. expected the computer industry's revenues to grow 7 percent to 10 percent next year and that he believed I.B.M. would increase its revenues by 7 percent to 8 percent. He said, however, he had based the company's business model for next year on a growth rate of 6 percent.
 
Roster of Executives
 Yesterday, in rapid-fire order, analysts heard from Mr. Akers; C. Michael Armstrong, senior vice president in charge of world trade; Terry R. Lautenbach, who is responsible for the company's American business; Jack D. Kuehler, the company's president, who is in charge of I.B.M.'s personal systems and technology businesses, and Mr. Metz. They all outlined the problems the company faced and its new plan to gain ground in an increasingly competitive computer industry.
Then the company's top officers spent an hour answering questions from analysts, trying to show that I.B.M.'s management was grappling effectively with the striking changes that have forced it to rethink its fundamental approach.
Mr. Akers said that if earnings growth did not return by the middle of next year, the company would take a hard look at a new round of cost-cutting.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A Forecast for '91 Spending Is Revised to Show a Decline

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Advertising spending in the United States will decline this year for the first time in 30 years, a leading industry forecaster said yesterday, calling it the largest drop in that closely watched barometer of economic activity since World War II.
For the year, spending will total $126.7 billion, Robert Coen, senior vice president and director of forecasting for McCann-Erickson U.S.A., said at the opening session of the 19th annual Paine Webber Conference on the Outlook for the Media. That would be a 1.5 percent decline from the $128.6 billion spent last year, and it marks the second time that Mr. Coen has slashed his 1991 estimate. Last December, his forecast stood at $136 billion, up 4.6 percent; in June, he trimmed it to $132.6 billion, up 3.1 percent. 
 "It was a disastrous year," Mr. Coen said, speaking of 1991 in the past tense, as if that would hasten its departure. He attributed the decline to "the fact that the Persion Gulf war hit early in 1991, when companies had realized they really were in a recession."
Following Mr. Coen's semiannual forecast at the conference, which continues this week at the McGraw-Hill Building in midtown Manhattan, came more deeply pessimistic predictions from John Perriss, chairman and chief executive of the Zenith Media Worldwide subsidiary of Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. He estimated that domestic ad spending would fall 2.9 percent this year, then rise by only modest amounts through 1994.
Not since 1961, when ad spending fell eight-tenths of 1 percent, have American advertisers spent less to pitch their products than they did the previous year. Larger declines occurred in the early 1940's, when wartime shortages of consumer goods, coupled with a scarcity of paper for newspapers and magazines, resulted in sustained spending reductions in both local and national advertising. For instance, in 1942, ad spending plunged 4 percent from 1941.
Mr. Coen's forecast, coupled with a cut in his estimate for 1992 spending, comes amid mounting evidence, from layoffs to losses, that the advertising business is nowhere near emerging from the slump that began two years ago.
Local advertising has continued to be the laggard in spending this year, Mr. Coen said, adding that among media carrying such advertising, newspapers have fared most poorly, because of shortfalls in classified and retail advertising. These categories will be down 6 percent this year, he continued, to $26.7 billion, compared with declines of 1 percent for local television and 3.5 percent for local radio.
Mr. Coen's forecast for '92 now calls for total ad spending of $134.6 billion, up 6.2 percent from '91. That assumes a 3.5 percent rise in inflation and real economic growth of 2.4 percent. In June, he had estimated a more robust gain of 8.5 percent, to $144 billion.
A sharp rebound is likely, Mr. Coen said, because of an expected economic recovery as well as the quadrennial spending gains brought by the Winter and Summer Olympic Games and a Presidential election.
Mr. Coen, perhaps the country's most widely followed forecaster of ad spending, has been tracking those trends since 1948. Other forecasters, however, are less optimistic for '92, primarily because they expect advertisers participating in Olympics marketing programs to use already-budgeted money, rather than to raise total ad outlays.
One is Mr. Perriss of Zenith, who forecast growth in '92 of eight-tenths of 1 percent, including inflation.
"My message is really a pretty bearish message," he said. "While 'doom and gloom' is too strong, I do not see '92 as anything like a bounce-back year."
A second gloomier forecast comes in a survey to be released today by Myers Marketing and Research, a consulting firm in Parsippany, N.J. It calls for an ad-spending gain next year of 4 percent to 6 percent before inflation, or an increase of zero to 2 percent, accounting for inflation.
For spending outside the United States, Mr. Coen continued to paint a rosier picture. This year, he said, total ad spending overseas should total $152.6 billion, up 5.5 percent from 1990, though that figure, too, was reduced from an earlier estimate of a 6.1 percent gain.
For '92, his overseas estimate was $161.5 billion, or up 5.8 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher in extremely quiet trading on world currency markets yesterday.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $369.30 an ounce, off 10 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold slid 5 cents an ounce, to a late bid price of $368.70. 
 Analysts said the dollar failed to get much help from unsettling developments in the Soviet Union, where three Slavic republics have proclaimed the creation of a new commonwealth of independent states.
The dollar is typically considered a haven in times of world turmoil. But in this case "there seems to be eternal optimism that the situation in the Soviet Union is going to work itself out," said Mike Malpede, an analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.
 
Effect of European Meeting
 John McCarthy, chief dealer at ABN-AMRO Bank International in New York, said the landmark summit meeting of the European Community in Maastricht, the Netherlands, was keeping the dollar in check. Western Europe's leaders are seeking to resolve remaining disputes over monetary union, among other political issues, ahead of the creation of a single market in 1992, and traders are waiting for any comments that could influence currency trading.
Many market participants said a chronically stagnant United States economy would force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again before the end of the year. That prospect is also dampening enthusiasm for the dollar. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
Activity was particularly quiet. "Holiday trading has set in," Mr. McCarthy said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.52 yen, to 128.18 yen. Later, in London it was quoted higher, at 128.40 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 128.27 yen, up from 127.95 yen on Friday.
In London the British pound fell to $1.8067, from $1.8095 late Friday. In New York it cost $1.8128 to buy 1, less expensive than Friday's $1.8167.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5705 German marks, up from 1.5675; 1.3875 Swiss francs, up from 1.3845; 5.3680 French francs, up from 5.3590; 1,188.00 Italian lire, up from 1,187.00, and 1.1358 Canadian dollars, down from 1,1364.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $370.75 an ounce, from $367.90 bid late Friday. In Zurich, it rose to $370.60, from $367.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong gold was unchanged, closing at $368.18.
Silver prices slid. On the Comex, silver bullion settled at $4.011 an ounce, down from $4.020 on Friday. In London it slipped to $4.06 an ounce, from $4.07.

A Plan to Cover Early Retirees

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
LARGE companies that promise extensive medical benefits to future retirees could save enormous amounts if the Medicare eligibility age dropped to 60 from 65. But the change, which was proposed by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is strongly opposed by small businesses, which typically do not provide extensive retiree health benefits.
Mr. Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, whose bill would be paid for by raising the Medicare payroll tax paid by employers and employees, has said that Congress is unlikely to enact sweeping changes in health policy until after next year's elections. But debate on the measure could become part of the broader issue of a national health insurance system. 
 Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said comprehensive national health insurance would cost about $70 billion a year, about 10 percent of national spending on health care. The Rostenkowski proposal would cost about $25 billion. Mr. Stark said the Medicare eligibility plan was not intended to be a back-door approach to national health insurance but was aimed at the many uninsured retirees under age 65.
"This is not a proposal to creep up on folks and expand Medicare," Representative Stark said. "This is to cover those early retirees."
The General Accounting Office estimates that the total liaibility of all private employers for retiree health care was $335 billion this year. The G.A.O. testifed last month that the amount would have dropped to $99 billion if the age-60 rule had been in effect.
Concern about the issue is growing because all private companies are required to evaluate and report their promises for retiree medical benefits under a new accounting rule that takes effect in 1993. Companies with older workers and generous health plans, like American Telephone and Telegraph, General Motors and I.B.M., have already announced liabilities in the billions of dollars.
Not surprisingly, executives at several large companies said they supported the age-60 concept.
"The Rostenkowski bill would reduce our post-retirement medical liability by about 25 percent, to $450 million from $650 million," said Dr. Jacques Sokolov, vice president and medical director at the Southern California Edison Company.
Walter B. Maher, the Chrysler Corporation's health-care spokesman in Washington, said that the proposal "is certainly a step in the right direction."
Labor unions also support the bill, which would increase the financial security of nine million people who rely on retiree health insurance. Meredith Miller, assistant director for employee benefits with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that because of medical cost inflation, many employers were asking retirees to pay for a larger portion of their coverage. And some unions have accepted limits on retiree health benefits as a trade-off for other improvements, like wage increases. "Our immediate concern is to try to bring some relief to this area as soon as possible," Ms. Miller said.
Most industrial workers retire in their early 60's, some when employers cut payrolls or close factories. But Mr. Maher and others noted that lowering the Medicaid age would probably encourage workers to retire early voluntarily. This is one reason the National Association of Manufacturers opposes lowering Medicare eligibility, said Sharon Canner, an assistant vice president at the association. She added, "Since there are fewer new entrants in the work force, we want to encourage people to work longer."
G. Lawrence Atkins, director of employer benefits policy at Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, a Washington law firm, said the Rostenkowski bill would reduce the obligations of one of his clients by 30 percent. But he said that transferring costs from companies with large retiree health-care obligations to those with lesser obligations was a form of Government "industrial policy" that could be unpopular.
Just how unpopular was made clear by John J. Motley, chief lobbyist in Washington for the National Federation of Independent Business. He said that small businesses paid three-quarters of their taxes in payroll taxes, which have "no relation to the profitability of the firm." Raising the payroll tax is "a prescription for disaster in terms of jobs," he said.
"This bill creates winners and losers," said Neela Ranade, vice president for welfare benefits counseling at Actuarial Sciences Associates, a unit of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. She suggested that the Rostenkowski proposal might attract wider support if employers had to pay "a flat dollar amount based on the numbers of active and retired employees, plus a percentage of payroll" so the burden would be heavier at large companies with many retirees.

HEADLINE: Broadway Prices Going Up And Down

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The price of orchestra seats at "Miss Saigon" and "The Phantom of the Opera" will rise to $65 from $60 starting March 9, the producer Cameron Mackintosh announced yesterday. On that date the $100 top-price ticket for "Miss Saigon" will be dropped and a new $15 ticket-price scale will be initiated for "Miss Saigon" and his other musicals, "Phantom," "Les Miserables" and "Five Guys Named Moe," which is to open on Broadway in April.
The top orchestra price at "Miss Saigon" and "Phantom" will be raised "to make available the new low-price seats," said Alan Wasser, Mr. Mackintosh's general manager in the United States. Mr. Mackintosh was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. 
 The new price for the $100 front-mezzanine seats at "Miss Saigon" will also be $65, "to be more in keeping with the mood of the country," Mr. Wasser said. He added, "We also have a sense that people were thinking that all orchestra seats to 'Miss Saigon' were $100."
Referring to the $15 tickets, Mr. Wasser said: "The economy is absolutely a factor in this. People are hurting because of it, and we see some indication that it's affecting our advance sales. We wanted to do something to get people in who haven't been able to afford the shows."
If advance sales in lower price ranges are weakening, there is no sign of it now. According to weekly Variety, attendance is 100 percent at "Miss Saigon," 101.7 percent at "Phantom" (including standing room), and 94.4 percent at "Les Miserables," now in its fifth year. "Miss Saigon," which opened last spring, will recoup its $10 million investment in January.
"Middle-price tickets are the hardest to sell," Mr. Wasser said, "and in watching our advance sales, we've noticed a falling-off of attendance in our lower-price tickets." Mr. Mackintosh introduced at $15-ticket policy at the Los Angeles production of "Phantom" five months ago, "and our advance increased $800,000," Mr. Wasser said.
 
Rear-Mezzanine Bargains
 The lowest regular-price seats at "Miss Saigon" have been $30. In March, 197 of the 1,761 seats at the Broadway Theater, where the show is playing, will be available at $15 for the rear mezzanine. The lowest prices at "Phantom" have been $35; in March, 82 seats will be available for $15. The price of about 200 obstructed-view seats in the orchestra at "Phantom" will not be affected; they cost $50 and $37.50.
The top price for "Les Miserables" will remain at $60; the lowest price has been $30, and in March, 88 seats will be available for $15. Tickets for "Five Guys Named Moe" will be $15 to $55.
Mr. Wasser said that the Mackintosh musicals had never been sold at the half-price TKTS booths run by the Theater Development Fund, but that there had been half-price student discounts for some seats and reduced-rate coupons offering discounts of one-third.

State of Game? Not the Same Everywhere

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Dec. 9

 BODY:
As the rhetoric between small markets and large markets in major league baseball continues to heat up, Commissioner Fay Vincent added his own chilling message today by echoing the fears of teams outside of New York, Chicago and California and citing the potential for a drastic falloff in national television revenues after contracts with CBS and ESPN expire following the 1993 season.
"The present salary situation is out of hand and small-market franchises cannot compete in this environment," Vincent said here today during his state-of-the-game address at the annual winter meetings. 
 He noted that local cable television and radio deals allow the most prosperous club to generate revenues in excess of $100 million per year, while the club with the smallest annual revenue brings in less than $40 million a year.
"And yet small-market franchises must compete on the field and in the player-compensation arena with the larger market teams," he said. "Small-market clubs simply have no choice but to arrange their payrolls on an entirely different scale."
 
An Unhappy Prospect
 Vincent, concerned not only about the size of player contracts, but also their lengths, talked as well of the potential danger of committing to pacts that run beyond the 1993 expiration of the national television contracts.
"If the deal were to be made today, during the worst media advertising recession in recent history," he said, "we would be looking at the unhappy prospect of accepting at least $4 to $5 million less per club per year than in the present contract."
Executives from small-market teams concurred with Vincent.
"I never in my wildest dreams expected this last escalation," said the Minnesota Twins' general manager, Andy MacPhail. "I didn't think the envelope would be pushed any further. When we negotiated Kirby Puckett's contract in 1988, the highest contract was $3 million. Now we've almost doubled that and we're only in December 1991. It's making it unmanageable for us, no matter how good our farm system is or how much bottom fishing we do in the Rule 5 draft."
He was referring to the draft by big league clubs of players from the minors.
 
'Don't Have Resources'
 MacPhail said that this was not necessarily a criticism of large-market clubs, because recent signings like the $29 million, five-year deal signed with the Mets by Bobby Bonilla do not test the bottom lines in bigger cities. "But we just don't have the resources," MacPhail said. "That's just a fact of life."
As if to prove his point, MacPhail said the Twins, once very hopeful of re-signing free-agent pitcher Jack Morris, have all but shut down negotiations with him because of the current market.
"We were close and tried to get it done before the market established itself," MacPhail said. "Then Bonilla, Morgan, Candiotti and Hershiser signed and the market moved. But our bottom line didn't change."
Fred Claire, general manager of the Dodgers, on the defensive after signing Candiotti, a free agent, for four years at $15.5 million, argued that, despite the angst, small-market clubs cannot deny their successes. "The Twins are the world champions," he said. "The Pirates won their division two years in a row. Money has never equaled winning. You can't buy a pennant. I think the basis of the game still comes back to the basics: scouting, growing your own."
Those are principles that the Dodgers are dedicated to, Claire insisted, but he also pointed out that sometimes things happen. As an example, he said, the Dodgers could not re-sign pitcher Mike Morgan because they did not want to commit to more than three years and Morgan insisted on a four-year deal after Milwaukee lured back the free-agent pitcher Bill Wegman with a four-year, $9.5 million deal.
"It's not a case of finger-pointing, but Mike Morgan goes off because Bill Wegman signs a four-year contract, in a small market," Claire said. "I don't fault Milwaukee for that. But does it have an impact? Yes. Those are just the truths. So if the small markets look at the big markets and say, 'You are the villains,' well, I guess, everyone's entitled to their view, but I don't think it's fair."
Vincent, while citing the potential for much smaller national television contracts after 1993, did say he believed the current baseball networks were not doing as poorly on their deals as indicated by network officials. (CBS has estimated it will lose $282 million before taxes by the time its four-year, $1.08 billion contract expires. ESPN is also claiming substantial losses on the four-year, $400 million deal, which also started in 1990.)
"The CBS affiliates were in disarray and I believe the CBS executives made a sound, innovative and strategic judgment to hold the network together and to keep the affiliates in place by cornering the sports market," Vincent said. "CBS bought time and patience from its affiliates by making the baseball deal."
As for the cable affiliate, Vincent said: "Where would ESPN be without baseball? There are only so many tractor pulls and billiard matches you can televise."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Yankees lost left-handed pitcher RAFAEL QUIRICO from their Columbus roster in the draft of minor leaguers. He was taken by the Giants. Quirico, 22 years old, was 12-8 with a 2.26 earned run average for New York's Class A Greensboro club.

Bowl Game To Top All Bowls

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
JOE PATERNO was saying that, sure, as a coach and a competitor he would like to see a national championship game between the two top college football teams in the nation. Such an event has been in the news recently since the Home Shopping Network has offered the National Collegiate Athletic Association the not inconsiderable holiday package of $33 million for a proposed Jan. 18 game in Tampa Stadium, with the money being distributed among the 106 Division 1-A schools.
Paterno grew up in Flatbush in the 1930's, and remembers the games between 26th Street and Avenue R, when it was first down and two sewers to go, and you wanted to see who was best in the neighborhood then, too. In those days the two biggest obstacles, he recalled, "were cars driving down the street and the people calling the cops because we were too noisy." 
 He moved on to Marine Park, where he and his friends didn't have much equipment. "We put towels in our knickers and sweaters and woolen hats for padding," he said. "Sometimes we'd use leaves for padding, too. But leaves can be itchy."
The rest is history: Paterno played quarterback at Brown University and then became head coach at Penn State. He is in town for the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame dinner tonight at the Waldorf-Astoria, and will be honored with that organization's Distinguished American award.
"I remember three years when we were undefeated and won bowl games, and didn't get ranked No. 1 in the polls," he said. "That was in 1968, 1969 and 1973. We were beaten out by Ohio State, Texas and Notre Dame. And it was hard for my kids. I wish they'd had a chance to prove they were the best."
It may be a similar case this year, with Washington and Miami, the two top-ranked and lone major-college undefeated teams in the nation. Washington will play Michigan in the Rose Bowl and Miami meets Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.
While there are national championship games, and a playoff structure, in most college sports, including the most wildly popular, the wildly propagandized March Madness wackiness, and there is also a playoff in Division I-AA football, there is and never has been anything like it in Division 1-A, the top level of competition.
The reason is, the bowl games. Many schools believe that they would lose money if they left the bowl bounty. Right now, for example, the Big 10 and the Pac-10 split $10 million from their traditional Rose Bowl game.
There are a number of people in academia and out who deplore the commercialism of college football and believe that it has gone too far. One of them is Ed Marinaro, the actor, who is being inducted into the Hall of Fame tonight, having been a star running back at Cornell, coming in second in the Heisman Trophy award in 1971. "It's enough," said Marinaro about the college football scene. "I mean, how far away from the classroom are they going to get? What's next? All-year-round football?"
Paterno and Marinaro agree that what might be even more destructive for classroom participation than the long college season is the freshman eligible rule. "I was on the freshman team at Cornell and it was great for me to get adjusted to a new way of life," said Marinaro. Paterno said: "I heard the Ivy League is planning to make freshman eligible, too. If that happens, it's all over. They're the last bastion."
Such bastions in college sports have been toppling like mad. Once there were four bowl games at the end of the season, for example; now there are dozens. And it isn't just television that is to blame. It is the colleges, because the money is just too good to resist.
It is true that many schools, like many households, are in an economic crunch, and it is true that many schools believe that sports are the geese that can lay golden eggs for them. But in many instances much of the sports earnings go back into the sports programs, and little filters into the libraries and chemistry labs.
But there is no stopping college sports now. And it is not just for the sake of competition, which is Paterno's stated concern, but for the lovely lucre that is envisioned at the end of this gridiron rainbow.
Yet somehow one clings to a bizarre dream that one day a brace of college presidents will rise up and shout: "No more! We are the models for the youth we teach, and we will demonstrate to them that money isn't everything. Priorities are all!"
Then we wake. Rest assured that that championship game will be played, if not this year, then next year. Or the year after. And with all the bowl games intact, too.
Let the geese begin.

HEADLINE: Out of the Soviet Wreckage

 BODY:
Recognizing that further disintegration can lead to common suffering, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia have wisely banded together to form a new commonwealth. Americans can only hope that by doing so, the three Slavic republics of the former Soviet Union can stave off ethnic and border strife, prevent beggar-thy-neighbor economic nationalism and keep control of nuclear arms.
Mikhail Gorbachev had hoped to hold all 15 republics together in a renewed confederation, a result that the West once fervently rooted for. But Ukraine's overwhelming vote for independence last week dashed that fading hope. The task now is to build a new association of republics from the bottom up. 
 The Commonwealth of Independent States, vague though its initial formulation may be, provides welcome evidence that the three Slavic republics recognize they can't go their separate ways. But the commonwealth will last only if detailed agreements are promptly reached, and carried out, to reverse the dangerous downward economic slide and to control the armed forces.
The leaders of the three Slavic states still have many obstacles to overcome if their common struggle against chaos is to succeed.
One is the upsurge of narrow nationalism unleashed by democratization. The commonwealth's leaders have themselves played to the flag-wavers at times, which has impeded their ability to come together. Boris Yeltsin's assertiveness after he became President of Russia, for instance, intensified separatism in Ukraine. And that raised the risk of conflict between Ukrainians and Russians that could tear apart the new commonwealth -- and Ukraine along with it.
Another obstacle is a restive military. The three republics have now pledged to "insure unified control over nuclear weapons and their nonproliferation," but they didn't say how. Nor did they say how they would cut, yet control, the armed forces on their territory.
A third obstacle is the exclusion of non-Slavs from commonwealth deliberations. Although the agreement remains open to all member states of the former U.S.S.R., the belated invitation may not appeal to those initially left out.
The exclusion of Kazakhstan, with a population 40 percent Slavic, is particularly worrisome. It, along with the three commonwealth members, has long-range nuclear-tipped missiles based on its territory.
The immediate obstacle to success is economic. That the three republics have agreed not to erect trade barriers against each other is essential. But are the republics prepared to enforce contracts negotiated with businesses in another republic?
Similarly, the joint pledge of price decontrol is well intentioned. But if Russia proceeds with the price decontrol planned for next week, it will take coordinated steps to insure that desperately needed food and goods are not sucked out of Ukraine to take advantage of the suddenly higher prices in Russia.
Unless Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia can harness nationalism to the task of opening up their economies, the new commonwealth may soon go the way of the old union.

HEADLINE: Peru's Rebels Driving Church Underground

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
On a nameless street in a shantytown here, a tiny kitchen had a cozy, snug feeling, and little touches of Americana -- a Betty Crocker cookbook in the bookcase and a yellowing photograph of the occupant's parents when they ran a New York delicatessen.
But as the white-haired American priest rested in his easy chair, conversation in the kitchen revolved around topics that were far from settling: alarm whistles, escape ladders, canceled Masses, closed-door weddings, death threats, and priests executed after "people's trials." 
 "We are halfway to the Church of the Catacombs," said the 63-year-old priest, one of 438 American Roman Catholic missionaries in Peru, the largest concentration outside the United States.
The persecution of the Christians of modern-day Peru does not come from the Government, as it did in ancient Rome, but from the Shining Path, a brutal and fanatical movement that feeds on the nation's numbing poverty.
Ninety percent of Peruvians profess to be Catholics, but church leaders long believed Shining Path's leaders when they boasted that the Catholic Church would be "the revolution's dessert" -- a final dish to be consumed after the annihilation of Peru's political, military and economic authorities.
But the terrorists, increasingly confident, are skipping courses. And in a nation where foreigners account for two-thirds of the 6,200 priests and nuns, foreigners are taking the brunt of the attacks on the church. Since May, Shining Path has killed two Polish priests, an Australian nun and an Italian priest and has severely wounded a Spanish priest.
"In this crucial stage of the struggle, the clergy is using the religiosity of the people to confront the Maoist guerrilla war," Luis Arce Borja, the Shining Path's European spokesman, said in an interview with El Expreso, a Lima newspaper, in November. "All great revolutions have had to confront the most rightist clergy. And that is what is happening now."
The Shining Path opposes church social activities like schools, soup kitchens and work programs because they deaden the people's revolutionary ardor.
American churchworkers agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they not be photographed or identified by name. "Sendero is in New York, and under no circumstances can you use my name," warned the priest from New York, using the group's Spanish name. "This could be brought back here. If they decide to have a people's trial, that's the end."
The Brooklyn-born priest said he had seen the Shining Path's influence expand in his own neighborhood this year. "Sendero Luminoso is infiltrating everything -- parish organizations, confirmation classes, the Faith and Happiness schools," he said. Near his house, a church wall was marked with Sendero's telltale red paint: "Yankees out of Peru." An American nun said that two times daily, a Sendero scout sits on a hill above her church-run Faith and Happiness school, "monitoring the comings and goings."
To minimize risks to individual leaders, church groups increasingly are run by semi-secret councils, rather than by high-profile presidents. Parish programs are now called "community programs."
"We had a chapel dedication the other day, and we didn't mention who helped in the construction," the priest said. "We no longer advertise confirmation programs. It's only by word of mouth."
For personal protection, the American said he has adopted a deliberately erratic way of life.
"I never tell people in advance if I will turn up at Mass or at a parish meeting," the priest said. "My neighbors will never tell a stranger where I live.
"If strange people show up at Mass," he added, "I always develop stomach cramps and leave immediately.
"The people are suffering, they are hungry," he continued. "The people feel the Government has abandoned them. The people are saying, 'What is the alternative?' That's the scary thing."

Text of Gorbachev's Statement on a New Commonwealth

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Following is the text of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's statement issued here today and provided by Tass, the Soviet news agency:
On Dec. 8, 1991, the leaders of Byelorussia, the Russian Federation and Ukraine signed in Minsk an agreement to found a commonwealth of independent states. 
 As the country's President, the main yardstick with which to evaluate this document is the measure to which it satisfies the interests of security of its citizens, meets the tasks of overcoming the present crisis and the preservation of statehood and furtherance of democratic reforms.
This agreement has its positive moments.
The Ukrainian leadership, which previously showed no activity in the negotiating process, has joined it.
The document stresses the need to create a single economic space, operating on coordinated principles with a single currency and finance and banking system. It expresses readiness for cooperation in the fields of science, education, culture and other spheres. It suggests a definite formula of interaction in the military-strategic field.
But this is a document of special significance. It touches very deeply on the interests of the peoples of our country, of the entire world community, and hence calls for a comprehensive political and legal evaluation.
 
Illegal and Dangerous
 In any case, it is clear to me that the agreement directly proclaims the end of the U.S.S.R. Undoubtedly, each republic has the right to withdraw from the Soviet Union, but the fate of our multinational country cannot be decided by the will of three republican leaders. This question can only be resolved through constitutional means with the participation of all sovereign states and taking into account the will of their peoples.
Illegal and dangerous is the assertion about the termination of all-union legal norms, which can only boost chaos and anarchy in society.
The speed with which the document appeared is baffling. It was not discussed either by the citizens or the Parliaments of the republics on behalf of which it was signed.
Even more significantly, it happened at a time when the republics' Parliaments are discussing the draft treaty of the union of sovereign states, drafted by the U.S.S.R. State Council.
I am deeply confident that in the present situation it is necessary for all Supreme Soviets of republics and the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. to discuss the draft treaty of the union of sovereign states and the agreement signed in Minsk. As the agreement puts forward a formula of statehood, which is in the competence of the Congress of Soviet People's Deputies, it is necessary to convene the Congress. Besides, I do not rule out holding a nationwide referendum on this question.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
SOVIET ATOM ARMS WORRY EUROPEANS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Since it has been clear for several months that the "mighty, indivisible, indestructible" Soviet Union was a thing of the past, its formal unraveling has not come as an unsettling surprise to Western European leaders trying to decide here today how to knit their own countries more closely together.
The Soviet Union began falling to pieces immediately after President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and other leaders of constituent Soviet republics faced down the hard-line coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev it August. Though the coup failed, it weakened Mr. Gorbachev, and most West European leaders now apparently believe that his power cannot be restored. 
 "I think the Soviet Union has been coming apart for a long time, hasn't it?" the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said today. He added that the agreement announced in Brest on Sunday to form a new commonwealth of the three Slavic republics with its capital in Minsk may have been the final blow. "I think it will be some time before we see the new pattern at all clearly," Mr. Hurd said.
Though neither the heads of government nor their foreign ministers spent much time today discussing events in the Soviet Union -- the foreign ministers discussed it over dinner, according to their spokesmen -- they are not without concern about them. They worry, as they have since last August, about who will insure the control and safety of the Soviet nuclear and conventional arsenal that belonged to Moscow.
 
Doubts About Assurances
 And they cannot yet be sure how seriously to take the assurances of Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Byelorussia that the nuclear weapons in their territories will remain under strict, joint control.
The British Prime Minister, John Major, described the nuclear question as "critical" today, but another official said: "Reassuring noises are coming out of the Soviet Union. I wouldn't say this is something where there's an urgent concern, but it's something we want to keep on top of."
Mr. Major also said he and others here would be concerned about human rights and the question of who would take responsibility for Soviet debt.
But a larger question, one overshadowed here today by the problems of how and when to agree on a single European currency and strengthen political cooperation among the 12 European Community member states that their leaders were discussing, is what they can do to channel change in the East into constructive channels.
 
Impotent in Yugoslav War
 Though they are talking about European political union, the community leaders have not yet been able to agree even on any meaningful way of stopping Yugoslavia's long decline into civil war right on their doorsteps, and they do not want to see the Soviet Union become "Yugoslavia with nukes," as the American Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, put it in a television interview over the weekend.
A Danish Foreign Ministry official said there was some concern among the leaders here about "total dissolution," and a British official said Mr. Major would send a representative to Kiev, Minsk and Moscow later this week to size up, among other things, what the Soviet Army planned to do about the latest developments. "Who pays them, and and is there a body that finances them?" this official asked.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany would like to see the community put together a logistical task force this weekend, putting soldiers, railway workers and other experts in civilian clothes to rush supplies of milk, sugar and other food supplies to cities like Moscow and Leningrad before shortages become so critical that they create social unrest, according to German officials.
But the European Community, long a bulwark against the threat of Soviet Communism, was not designed as protection against its collapse. The foreign ministers will not meet formally to discuss the subject until next Monday in Brussels, according to officials.
One thing they must not do, some of the Europeans feel, is build up such a tightly federated political and economic structure that Eastern European countries, and possibly Ukraine and even Russia one day, will have no hope of ever becoming a part of what Mr. Gorbachev used to like to call the "common European home."
 
Requests for Membership
 But asked today how the community would deal with a request from Ukraine to join its ranks as a full member, one European official pointed out that Austria had already applied, that the Scandinavian countries probably would soon, and that their applications would be dealt with first. Eastern European countries get only a limited association status and lots of advice.
A $325 million European Community package of grants to help the Soviet Union avoid economic ruin was delivered to Moscow earlier this year. Now that it appears that the country no longer exists, community officials will probably have to decide where to direct a $520 million line of credit and $1.56 billion in credits for food and humanitarian aid that they were still trying to negotiate with Moscow today. A spokesman for the community's Executive Commission in Brussels said the foreign ministers would probably channel these more through the republics.

HEADLINE: U.N. Passes Voluntary Register to Curb Arms Sales

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
At a time when the international arms trade may be starting to grow again after a sharp decline, the United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly today to establish the first register of international arms sales.
The aim of the register, which won strong support in the wake of the Persian Gulf war, is to curb the international traffic in arms by publicizing transactions and identifying potential trouble spots by showing where arm stocks are increasing. 
 Although the resolution calls on all nations to provide the world organization with an annual list of all imports and exports of arms, it does not require them to do so. Nonetheless, diplomats say most countries are likely to comply with the register because of the overwhelming support it has received and particularly because of its support from Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union, which together account for about 70 percent of the international arms trade.
The register will initially apply only to sales of heavy arms, like tanks, armored fighting vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft and attack helicopters, that can be used to seize and hold territory.
China, a major arms producer, refused to take part in today's vote, even though it participated in talks with the other four permanent members of the Security Council in Paris last summer on curbing arms sales to the Middle East. China offered no explanation for its stand. But some diplomats said the Chinese action might reflect the importance that arms sales has acquired for China as a source of foreign currency as well as resentment at the pressure to go along with the register from the United States and other Western supporters.
In today's vote, 150 countries approved the resolution establishing the register and procedures for gradually expanding its scope to cover not only heavy arms shipments but also lighter weapons, arms production and national weapon stocks. While no nation voted against, Cuba and Iraq abstained.
During the debate in committee, many developing countries complained that the register would discriminate against poorer nations, which import their arms, by requiring them to disclose their purchases while protecting richer nations with indigenous arms industries against revealing their military strength.
As a result, the resolution calls on the Secretary General to set up an expert group to report next year on ways of extending the register to include lighter arms as well as production sites and national weapon stocks. This could transform the register from a list of arms sales into one for conventional arms that includes transfers.
Purchases by developing countries account for about 75 to 80 percent of the international arms trade, which peaked at $57 billion in 1987 before declining, according to the latest report of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
The United States earned $14 billion from selling arms overseas in 1988, the last year for which Government figures are available, accounting for 29 percent of the world market. According to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, world arms exports fell 13 percent from $57 billion in 1987 to $49 billion in 1988, the lowest level in 10 years. But in average terms, the agency says, sales have been declining 3 percent a year since 1983.
"For the first time in history, perhaps, the favorable prospects for controlling the transfer of conventional weapons appear to outweigh the negative," Prof. Stephanie Neuman, an arms control expert at Columbia University, said in a paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Professor Neuman attributes the downward trend to the increasing sophistication of weapons, deteriorating economic conditions and "the new political order."
But at a recent meeting of arms control scholars at Wisconsin University, Michael Klare of Hampshire College said Iraq's defeat in the gulf war might encourage developing countries to shift from their preference for large tank and infantry formations to a greater emphasis on aircraft, helicopters and precision-guided munitions.

HEADLINE: Spurning Fine-Tuning;
Any Fixes Washington Might Do to Help Could Just as Well Harm, Economists Say

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats alike are hard at work seeking ways to pump up the American economy and let the good times roll again.
That is what prominent economists used to think Government was all about. But now the economics establishment has generally lost confidence in the ability of the Government to fine-tune the economy, afraid that anything that Washington might do would be as likely to harm as help. 
 Heeding his political advisers, President Bush is nevertheless hard at work formulating an anti-recession tonic, something more effective than buying socks at the mall.
And judging from Administration testimony before Congress, the medicine is likely to blend in a little something for everyone who is feeling the pain.
Democrats and Republicans in Congress appear eager to use the occasion to mix investment incentives for dispirited businesses with some combination of savings and payroll tax breaks for the middle class. Everything from a capital-gains tax reduction to expanded retirement accounts to accelerated public works spending has its champions.
But where did these ideas come from? Why is it assumed that government can cure what ails the American economy?
It's no secret that many of the President's economists, along with much of the economics establishment, fear that economic stimulus of any kind is as likely to harm as help.
In part, the misgivings are based on the conviction that allowing Washington to renegotiate last year's deficit reduction deal is akin to inviting Imelda Marcos to window shop at Gucci. But it also reflects fundamental intellectual doubts about the value of fiscal measures in fighting economic downturns, as well as the more specific worry that any pre-election fix would undermine long-term efforts to increase savings and growth.
As recently as the early 1970's most economists thought they knew how to take the sting out of recessions. A decline in the inclination of businesses and consumers to spend, they said, could leave a gap between the total demand for goods and the economy's capacity to provide them. And while the gap would eventually close without government intervention, eventually could be a very long time indeed. What was needed to offset swings in private demand, they argued, was some combination of tax cuts and government spending, plus an increase in funds available for bank loans.
 
Keynes Followers Unfazed by Deficits
 The size, timing and the proper mix of fiscal and monetary stimulus have always been a matter of fierce debate. The intellectual heirs to the great British economist John Maynard Keynes emphasized the merits of reducing taxes and increasing government spending; the resulting budget deficits, they argued, would pose no burden to society as long as the extra demand for goods and services could be met from farms and factories that would otherwise be idled.
Followers of Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago much preferred to rely on monetary measures. They were convinced that business cycles could be smoothed away simply by requiring that the Federal Reserve keep the growth in the supply of money on an even keel. But the two camps grudgingly shared an intellectual framework of how the economy worked, as well as an implicit belief that stabilization policies could be perfected.
The last two decades on a roller coaster of recession and growth, however, have shaken public faith in economists' capacities as scientists of stability, and speeded a parallel drift within the profession. Virtually all economists would still use fiscal and monetary tools to offset Depression-magnitude swings in demand. But there is no longer anything approaching a consensus on the virtues of intervention in a crisis of current dimensions, where unemployment remains low by historic benchmarks.
The ranks of orthodox monetarists have declined. But as the non-monetarist Robert Gordon of Northwestern University notes, their core idea -- that steady-at-the-helm works best(if not always very well) -- has been filched, not abandoned. Pragmatists like Robert Hall of the Hoover Institution in California have convinced the Federal Reserve Board to change course infrequently, and to aim at a simple and easily measured target: the rate of growth of total spending in the economy. It is really the Keynesians, with their enormous investment in the concept of fine-tuning with fiscal policy, who have suffered most.
One striking challenge came from "supply-side" economists, most notably Arthur Laffer, who contended that the sheer waste and perverse incentives associated with high tax rates created opportunities to cut tax rates without cutting tax revenues. There was thus no need to think of fiscal policy as a mechanism for fine-tuning: The fiscal spigot could and should be left wide open to spur economic growth.
Supply-side economics did not work as Mr. Laffer and his disciples expected. After the big income tax cut of 1981, the budget deficit ballooned to levels unprecedented in peacetime. But neither did it confirm the Keynesian view that wide-open deficit spending would lead to uncontrolled inflation.
 
Foreign Lenders Stepped In
 Substantially increased government borrowing to finance the deficit did not "crowd out" private borrowers because foreign lenders proved ready and willing to make up the difference. Moreover, collapsing energy prices and sharply increased world competition in manufactures kept inflation to a pleasing minimum. And while few research economists were converted to the supply-siders' cause, stable (if relatively slow) growth of the Reagan years certainly undermined public confidence in the logic of fiscal fine-tuning
The boldest critique of Keynesian theory from within the economics establishment has come from Robert Barro of Harvard. When the Government cuts taxes or increases spending it borrows to cover the extra deficit. Thus in the process of cutting taxes today, Mr. Barro said, the Government is creating a future liability -- the added debt -- that will have to be financed by raising taxes tomorrow. And taxpayers are likely to respond by curtailing current spending, offsetting the direct fiscal stimulus.
Mr. Gordon of Northwestern probably speaks for most policy-oriented economists in dismissing the Barro critique as "aerie fairie" theory, hardly related to how people actually behave. But its sheer ingenuousness has made it the grist of a hundred academic journal articles and a thousand graduate school classes. Mr. Hall of the Hoover Institution argues that the Barro punchline -- that the consequences of fiscal stimulus might be both complicated and unintuitive -- "has shifted the ground" under the Keynesian monolith and made it fair game for more practical-minded critics of fine-tuning.
Gregory Mankiw of Harvard lays out a smorgasbord of these qualms. Once the need for fiscal stimulus is recognized, he notes, it may take months to pass the necessary legislation. Hence the full impact may only hit the economy after the recovery is under way and the stimulus is no longer welcome. Even if the stimulus does hit in timely fashion, public fears that it will ignite inflation may push up interest rates and slow business investment.
That should not be a significant problem if the public is convinced that the spending or tax stimulus is indeed temporary and will evaporate by the time offices and factories are running full tilt. But such convictions do not come easily to a public grown cynical about Washington: "Whenever I hear a politician say 'never again' I don't believe it," Mr. Mankiw, the Harvard economist, said.
 
Drawbacks In Tax Cut
 John Taylor, who just returned to Stanford University from President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, points out that a credible temporary cut in payroll or income taxes would have its own drawbacks. If the increase in take-home pay is scheduled to last just a year or so, research suggests that just 20 or 30 cents out of every extra dollar will actually be spent; the rest would end up as private savings. And while there is nothing wrong with people saving more, it is no virtue in this context: most of the intended stimulus would be lost, even as the budget deficit rose.
The bang from a buck of direct government spending -- say, highway construction -- is far greater than the punch from a tax cut. But Mr. Mankiw noted that the time it took to put a workable spending plan in place increased the likelihood that the stimulus would come too late.
Some economists who might otherwise take a chance with fine-tuning offer specific objections to a fiscal fix in the current climate. Mr. Taylor, for example, believes that the nation's core economic problem remains slow growth in productivity -- a condition that is worsened, if not caused, by Americans' historically low rate of savings. And he fears that any tampering with the deal to cut the deficit in half by the mid-1990's will dim the prospects for a collective turn toward thrift. "We ought to be thinking about the long term," Mr. Taylor said.
Would it be possible to devise a fiscal package that mollifies the skeptics' most pressing concerns? Two unrepentant Keynesians, the Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Francis Bator of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, think part of the answer is a one-time increase in Federal aid to states and localities. Much of the money, they believe, would be used to restore spending on public investment projects in progress that have been delayed by the budget pinch.
That need not conflict with long- term growth objectives, Mr. Bator argues, since "we need the increase in public investment." And pressure to extend the program beyond a year should be containable because state and local government revenues will rise with the economic recovery.
Neal Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, seconds the motion for increased public spending because he doubts there is any easier way to light a fire under private spending. In this third year of the economic slowdown -- output, he notes, has barely budged since 1988 -- "businesses and consumers have become allergic to risk."
Mr. Hall of the Hoover Institution points out that the temporary nature of a tax break can cut either way. While people would probably spend little of a one-time income tax reduction because it would have little effect on their lifetime purchasing power, businesses would likely jump at a one-time chance of a tax credit on new investment they had planned to make next year or the next.
Mr. Hall (who, incidentally, is no fan of fiscal fine-tuning) thinks it would even be possible to devise a stimulus package that does not increase the national debt. One might, for example, pair a 5 percent tax credit for business investment in 1992 with a special 5 percent tax surcharge on business investment in 1993. There would presumably be no revenue loss over the two years. Moreover, the kick in 1992 would be even larger than from a simple one-time tax break because businesses would have a greater incentive to accelerate investments already in the works.
 
Also a Risk In Sitting Tight
 Could even the most carefully crafted stimulus misfire? Might public confidence -- and public spending -- fall in response to a pre-election fix? Might the last best hope for convincing Washington to keep government outlays within sight of revenues be lost? Almost anything is possible, Mr. Bator of the Kennedy School concedes. But "it would be an odd reaction," he said, one out of tune with the "empirical regularities of the past."
He argues, moreover, that there is a parallel risk in sitting tight. If the economy slips deeper into decline, the demand for relief could overwhelm an orderly effort to stabilize the economy without sacrificing long-term productivity goals. A deeper slide might not be likely, Mr. Bator says, "but do you want to take a chance?"
Official Washington plainly does not. And economists who would rather stay the course are rapidly losing their influence.

HEADLINE: Japan Leaders Are in Disarray On Troop Role

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and his five-week-old Government have been thrown into disarray by a string of embarrassing setbacks that culminated today with the sudden collapse of legislation to let Japan participate in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Japanese officials said this evening that the peacekeeping bill, which would have authorized the first dispatch of army troops abroad since World War II, was dead. 
 Analysts said the hopes of passing a peacekeeping bill were engulfed by a tide of anxiety among Japanese that the bill would be seen as a first step on the road to rearming. The fears reached a peak in the last week with the observance of the 50th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
 
Measure's Future Unclear
 Some officials said the peacekeeping-forces bill may be revived late next year, after parliamentary elections, but no one would predict even that for sure.
The measure's failure doomed Tokyo's hopes of using the occasion of President Bush's visit next month to proclaim its readiness to play a new international role commensurate with Japan's status as an economic superpower.
Even before the latest developments, there has been considerable criticism of Mr. Miyazawa, who has been described as aloof and equivocal in handling a range of problems. His popularity has plummeted only a month after he took office.
"It is not clear where the command post is," one commentator said this week in The Japan Economic Journal. "We cannot see what the Prime Minister's office is thinking. What does he intend? How is he carrying things out? We cannot understand either his purposes or his proposals."
Among the other setbacks for Mr. Miyazawa was the failure last week of a proposed measure in Parliament to express regret over World War II on the Pearl Harbor anniversary. The measure died in the midst of partisan squabbling, and misgivings among rightists over apologizing to the United States.
Also besetting the Prime Minister is Japan's sagging economy, which has widened the budget deficit and forced the Government to decide whether to borrow, raise taxes or both. The Parliament has been haggling over this issue for weeks.
The Prime Minister, who was forced to resign as Finance Minister in 1988, has also been hit with revived charges that his office received questionable payments from the scandal-tainted Recruit Company, which was at the heart of the financial scandals of 1988 and 1989. A package of reform bills also seems to be dead.
Finally, there has been scant progress in getting Japan to yield in its longtime ban on the import of rice. The United States has charged that the ban threatens to undermine international trade talks. American officials are worried that Mr. Bush's visit could thus be seen as accomplishing little.
The peacekeeping bill had been put together as a response to widespread criticism that Japan gave only money to the war against Iraq, and not personnel. Despite Japan's contribution of $13 billion for the war, many Americans said Tokyo should have done more.
Only a week ago, senior aides to Mr. Miyazawa were confidently predicting that the measure would be approved in the opposition-controlled upper house of Parliament. The bill had passed the lower house.
The peacekeeping measure would have authorized up to 2,000 troops to participate in United Nations operations. To win approval among uneasy lawmakers, the bill said Japanese troops would only carry small arms and only use them in self-defense.
Japanese voters had mixed feelings over the idea, supporters of the bill acknowledged. Polls showed they overwhelmingly believed that Japan had to do more than contribute money to the cause of keeping peace, and that they backed sending navy minesweepers to the Persian Gulf earlier this year.
But polls also showed they opposed sending Japanese troops abroad, even under United Nations auspices. China, South Korea and Singapore -- former victims of Japanese military aggression -- also expressed their misgivings in recent weeks. Japanese Defense officials were also nervous about sending poorly trained troops into Cambodia, their probable first mission.
The measure was approved by the lower house last month, but only after scuffling broke out as Socialists and Communists tried to prevent a vote. In the upper house, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was optimistic because it had won the nominal support of the tiny Komeito, or Clean Government Party.
But it turned out this week that Komeito's support -- crucial in the opposition-controlled upper house -- was shaky, in part because the party is having its own problems. It is always good politics in Japan to be in favor of peace, and Komeito apparently began to worry over the last few days that its pro-peace image was being tarnished.
The bill was declared dead after a bout of complicated legal maneuvering in which it was decided that the current session of Parliament would adjourn in 11 days, leaving no time, officials said, for the bill to be debated further and passed.

HEADLINE: Buchanan, Urging New Nationalism, Joins '92 Race

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, entered the race for the Republican Presidential nomination today with a biting attack on foreign aid and President Bush's "globalist" passions, and with a plea for a new nationalism.
Mr. Buchanan cast his candidacy as a crusade for a party and a country forsaken by its President. He asserted that Mr. Bush had abandoned conservative precepts, lost touch with the nation and become consumed with world affairs, while Americans struggle with recession and increasing economic competition from abroad. 
 The candidate contended that the end of the cold war had heralded an era of nationalism that requires a new focus on American interests and American needs.
"It is time to end these routinized annual transfers of our national wealth to global bureaucrats who ship it off to regimes who pay us back in compound ingratitude," said Mr. Buchanan, declaring his candidacy in this capital of the state that will hold the nation's first primary of the 1992 campaign. "It is time to phase out foreign aid and start looking out for the forgotten Americans right here in the United States."
 
Economic Issues Cited
 Mr. Buchanan, who like any challenger has limited resources for a battle against a sitting President, is centering his campaign on the Feb. 18 primary here. Many analysts say New Hampshire's stricken economy could make voters particularly receptive to an anti-Bush appeal, and a recent poll for The Boston Globe suggests that Mr. Bush's support among Republicans today is not overwhelming.
Still, Mr. Buchanan, a onetime aide to Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, acknowledged to reporters that his candidacy was "a very long-shot thing."
His best hope, he said, would be a replay of 1968, when Eugene McCarthy pulled 42 percent of the vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, a humiliating blow to President Lyndon B. Johnson, who ultimately withdrew from the race. But Mr. Buchanan acknowledged that Mr. Bush would not easily give up the fight.
At the very least, Mr. Buchanan will make life difficult for a President who has a clear sensitivity on his right flank. Today, for example, Mr. Buchanan put the blame for the recession squarely on the White House and its 1990 budget deal with Congress, which caused Mr. Bush to renege on his pledge to foreswear new taxes.
"Why am I running?" he asked. "Because we Republicans can no longer say it is all the liberals' fault. It was not some liberal Democrat who declared, 'Read my lips no new taxes,' then broke his word to cut a seedy backroom budget deal with the big spenders on Capitol Hill."
Mr. Buchanan added: "What is the White House answer to the recession that was caused by its own breach of faith? It is to deny that we even have a recession. Well, let them come to New Hampshire."
 
An Isolationist Ideology
 Still, Mr. Buchanan's speech often seemed less focused on the troubles of New Hampshire than on the commentator's conservative ideology, which critics assert has grown increasingly isolationist.
He said the United States needed to re-examine all the alliances and institutions of the cold war, established to guard against "Communist enemies that no longer exist." He warned of new economic challenges on the world scene, posed by "the rise of a European superstate and a dynamic Asia led by Japan."
Mr. Buchanan added, "With a $4 trillion debt, with a U.S. budget chronically out of balance, should the United States be required to carry indefinitely the full burden of defending rich and prosperous allies who take America's generosity for granted as they invade our markets?"
The United States should always be ready to help in times of natural disaster, he added, but should start to reorder its priorities to reflect the concerns of the home front. Mr. Bush, he said, "is a globalist, and we are nationalists. He believes in some pax universalis; we believe in the old republic. He would put America's wealth and power at the service of some vague new world order; we will put America first."
 
Some Editorial Support
 This isolationist tone of past movements in the United States has prompted some deep misgivings among many of Mr. Buchanan's fellow conservatives. But cheering Mr. Buchanan on are the editorial pages of The Manchester Union Leader, which described him today as the "conservator of the principles of the 1980's Reagan revolution that began in New Hampshire and swept the nation."
The commentator's foreign policy views have put him in the same politically awkward position as the Democrats: he opposed the war in the Persian Gulf, which was eventually widely supported in the public opinion polls.
Mr. Buchanan said he supported cuts in both the tax on capital gains and in taxes people pay for Social Security. He said it was time for the President to call back Congress and push through a major tax cut program. "I'll tell you what I won't do," he said, alluding to a recent Presidential trip widely ridiculed as a futile gesture of economic faith, "I won't go to J. C. Penney's and buy four pairs of socks."
Mr. Buchanan is the second challenger to enter the Republican primary; State Representative David Duke of Louisiana, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, entered the race last week, although he said he would not compete in New Hampshire. Mr. Buchanan had little but disdain for Mr. Duke, saying he was looking forward to going head-to-head with the former Klansman in the South to determine "who's the true conservative."
Mr. Buchanan's announcement was interrupted today by a protester chanting, "Act up, fight back, fight AIDS." The protester was quickly and forcibly ushered from the hall.
After announcing his candidacy, Mr. Buchanan embarked on some sidewalk campaigning, accompanied by a small band of supporters bearing signs like "Watch out, George Bush -- Pat Buchanan doesn't brake for liberals."
Since the town was Concord, the sidewalks were crowded with politicians, journalists and lobbyists, including Ralph Nader, who was in town to lead a crusade for term limits, new campaign finance laws and other political measures. "Hey, Pat," Mr. Nader called, and the two men exchanged greetings.

HEADLINE: U.S. WEIGHS PLANS FOR FOES OF IRAQI

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is reviewing military options on how the United States would respond to a coup in Iraq by senior members of the Iraqi armed forces, Administration officials said today.
The Administration has received recent intelligence reports of "serious strains" in the Iraqi leadership and wants to insure that President Bush is not caught without a plan of action, as he was during a coup attempt in Panama in October 1989, a move that preceded the invasion by United States forces two months later. 
 The military options, prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the last three weeks, would prepare the United States for a situation in which key officers in Iraq's armed forces might request support from Washington in an attempt to seize power from President Saddam Hussein.
The options are to be reveiwed on Thursday at a high-level meeting of the so-called deputies committee of key Cabinet departments, which is headed by Adm. Jonathan T. Howe, the deputy national security adviser.
 
Timing of Military Plans
 The planning comes as Mr. Bush's re-election bid is about to be begin, and it seems likely to prompt critics to suggest that Mr. Bush is contemplating a foreign venture to divert attention from his domestic political troubles, or to insultate his re-election campaign from charges that the otherwise successful American military effort in the Persian Gulf war last winter failed to dislodge Mr. Hussein from power.
Some Democrats and Republicans have been urging the President to take stronger steps to remove Mr. Hussein and to avert a new humanitarian crisis in Iraq, where United Nations sanctions have led to widespread malnutrition among the poor, a condition that Mr. Hussein appears to be exploiting.
The military options were provided by Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President's top military adviser. They were reviewed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney before being sent to the White House late last week.
One potential dispute that emerged from the military review of coup "scenarios" posed by the White House centers on the issue of whether United States ground forces would be needed to back a successful coup attempt against Baghdad's current leadership.
 
White House Preference
 The White House wants a military solution based only on air forces and naval forces, officials said, while General Powell is said to believe strongly that the removal of Mr. Hussein cannot be guaranteed under any coup scenario without committing American ground troops, a decision that would present a politically debilitating and risky condition for the White House.
A classified discussion paper from General Powell is said to point out the difficulties of confronting the four Republican Guard divisions that ring Baghdad. While United States air forces might be sufficient to assist an Iraqi military coup by destroying and tying down loyalist forces, air power alone could not deal with every contingency or guarantee a final victory over Mr. Hussein, as one official described the military argument.
The military review did not appear to be prompted by intelligence information indicating that Mr. Hussein's top officers were actually plotting against him.
"We have had intelligence information very recently that indicated some serious strains" within Mr. Hussein's inner circle, an Administration official said.
 
'Armed Conflict'
 One intelligence report, received after Mr. Hussein changed defense ministers last month, described an incident of "armed conflict" between rival security forces of the new Iraqi Defense Minister, Ali Hassan al-Majid, a cousin of Mr. Hussein, and the relative he replaced, Hussein Kamel Hassan, who is Mr. Hussein's son-in-law.
The "conflict" resulted in "injuries and some deaths and was carried out in a revenge fashion" by Mr. Hassan's forces, the official said. The official added that other intelligence reporting indicated a general disaffection with Mr. Hussein among Iraq's traditional Sunni Muslim elite, which dominate the merchant class, the army and the upper ranks of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party.
By undertaking this review, however, the Administration may be hoping to foster the planning of a coup by keeping Mr. Hussein's regime under tight economic sanctions and by taking intrusive steps to remove or destroy all vestiges of Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, as well as laboratories and factories taking part in ballistic missile work.
The military review was conducted in response to two specific scenarios posed by the National Security Council staff, officials said. Under one scenario, Iraqi military commanders began a coup attempt that bogged down and then asked for American assistance. Under a second scenario, Iraqi military leaders signaled to Washington they were ready to depose Mr. Hussein if the United States would provide support, particularly air support, since the Iraqi Air Force remains grounded as part of the allied cease-fire conditions imposed last winter.
To be successful in the removal of Mr. Hussein, General Powell is said to have forcefully argued, United States ground troops would be necessary and warned that the consequences of failure would undermine the long term gains United States foreign policy achieved with the gulf war victory.

HEADLINE: California Proposes Cutting Aid to Poor

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The Governor of California has proposed sweeping changes in welfare policy in the nation's most populated state that would slash grants to long-term recipients, use increased benefits as a way to encourage certain forms of behavior and limit payments to indigent families who move here from other states.
Similar proposals are on the table in several other states, but none would affect as many people, involve as much money or inspire the kind of heated debate that is likely to occur here on sensitive issues of race and class. 
 While other states are seeking to overhaul welfare policy in a legislative setting, California will go the route of the ballot initiative, the populist approach to governance here that has been growing in popularity since the success in 1978 of Proposition 13, which cut property taxes here and led to a nationwide taxpayers' revolt.
 
Wise Political Move
 Circumventing the Legislature and going directly to the public with his ideas, national experts say, is a wise political move on Mr. Wilson's part and one likely to generate widespread interest across the country in coming months.
"This is in keeping with the whole tenor of the times," said Isabel V. Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research institute in Washington. "There is a strong feeling out there on the part of the public that too much money is going to people who don't play by middle-class rules and this is an attempt by the Governor to tap into those feelings."
Ms. Sawhill, and others of varying political disposition, predicted that the measure, which the Governor called the Taxpayers Protection Act of 1992, was likely to qualify easily for next November's ballot and fare well with voters, who are likely to turn out in large numbers in a presidential year.
Ms. Sawhill said that complex issues like welfare reform were "far too complicated to be decided by referendum," and often wind up in court for just that reason, but that voters have been left little recourse in recent years by politicians who have failed "to keep in touch with where the public is on value issues."
 
Policy of New Paternalism
 Governor Wilson's proposal includes many elements of what has become known in policy-making circles as the new paternalism, a menu of welfare changes that urge paying the poor less, asking them to do more, and persuading them to bear fewer children. Along with other broad changes in California's budget-making process, the initiative includes the following:
*Overall grant levels under Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the state's largest welfare program, would be reduced 10 percent -- from $663 a month to $597 for a mother and two children. The A.F.D.C. program here currently costs $5.6 billion a year, and the cost is split by the state and the Federal Government.
*Grants would be reduced an additional 15 percent after six months -- to $507 a month -- for any family headed by an able-bodied adult. California now has the fourth-highest A.F.D.C. payments in the nation, behind Alaska ($891), Hawaii ($666) and Vermont ($679). After the 25 percent reduction, California would drop to 14th, state officials said.
*Grants would not increase for additional children, as they do under current law.
*Families moving here from out of state, who now account for 7 percent of the 2.2 million people collecting A.F.D.C., would be limited to grants equal to those in their former state for 12 months. After that, these new residents would qualify for full California benefits.
*Teen-age mothers would be entitled to grants only if they lived with their parents or legal guardians, with the payments going directly to the older generation.
*Teen-age parents would receive an additional $50 a month if they were in school and have the same amount subtracted from their grant if they dropped out.
*Food stamp allowances for A.F.D.C. recipients would increase $20 a month. And the amount of money an individual could earn before a reduction of benefits would remain at $694 a month.
*In the future, the annual A.F.D.C. grant level would be tied to the state's financial health and be part of the budget process, which is not the case now. Grants would go up and down according to a formula that includes state tax revenues and welfare caseloads.
 
Proposal Introduced on Monday
 Governor Wilson, a moderate Republican, introduced his proposals on Monday before a friendly Chamber of Commerce audience in Glendale, Calif. Today, on a visit to a minority-owned construction company not far from Sacramento, the state's capital, he amplified his ideas and defended a program that state officials said would save $600 million a year.
Mr. Wilson said the state was "on course for a train wreck" because the cost of entitlement programs, by the year 2000, would exceed California's tax revenue. Asked if his proposals did not echo some of the rhetoric of David Duke, the former Ku Klu Klan leader who lost the Louisiana governor's race last month, Mr. Wilson said that it was easier to trade epithets than to deal with "harsh reality," but that he intended to do the latter.
Mr. Wilson's proposal comes at a time when California, like most of the nation, is reeling from recession and facing recurrent budget deficits, limited tax revenue and growing caseloads for social services. Last year, with a $14.3 billion deficit, the largest ever for a state, Mr. Wilson raised taxes here by $7 billion and, with legislative approval, cut A.F.D.C. payments by 4.4 percent. But new deficits loom and both the Republican Governor and the Democratic-controlled Legislature agree that Californians are taxed to the limit.
In recent weeks, in a variety of national and local forums, Mr. Wilson has hammered at the theme that California's financial emergency is caused by an influx of indigents and immigrants, who have a huge need for government service, and a simultaneous exodus of working taxpayers, who are fleeing smog, traffic, urban chaos and the nation's highest housing prices.
Today, advocates for the poor condemned the Governor's plan and lawmakers, in large measure, lined up in predictable partisan configurations.
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a San Francisco Democrat, said that the problems of California "go beyond the cost of welfare families" and that "finding a scapegoat" was easier than "finding a solution." By contrast, Senator Ken Maddy, a Fresno Republican and party leader, said the proposed cuts "very well may be necessary if we're going to survive as a state."
The political potential of the situation was perhaps best summed up by B. T. Collins, a Republican Assemblyman from suburban Sacramento who briefly served as chief of staff in Gov. Edmond G. Brown Jr. 's administration. "Boy, is this gonna sell," Mr. Collins said, pointing particularly to the provision capping grants if women have more children. "That alone assures its passage. That just drives people crazy."
That sort of popular ethos was not lost on the state's leading Democrats. Robert Forsyth, spokesman for David A. Roberti, president pro tem of the State Senate, noted that Republicans had to avoid "a subtext that is racist" in discussing welfare changes. But the Democrats had as heavy a burden, Mr. Forsyth said, in seeking balance between "their philosophical constituencies" and the "growing middle-class economic woes."

HEADLINE: Depositors' Yields Slip Even Further

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The decline in yields on certificates of deposit and bank money-market accounts steadily gained momentum in the last week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, the publication in North Palm Beach, Fla., that specializes in covering interest rates.
"The speed and the size of the current decline is intensifying," Robert K. Heady, the publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. He said banks had been racing to bring down their cost of funds before the Federal Reserve reduced its discount rate again; however, a high-ranking Fed official suggested yesterday that the Fed's policy makers were unlikely to take urgent action on rates when they meet next week. Mr. Heady said he thought the unusually low current yields would move even lower by mid-February, possibly by another 25 or 30 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
 
Sees 4.5% on 6-Month C.D.'s
 He said that the nationwide average yield on six-month certificates of deposit probably would be less than 4.50 percent. New York banks have cut yields by about 14 basis points, to 4.16 percent, he said. 
 In the case of money-market accounts, the largest cuts were made by Astoria Federal Savings Bank and Bank of Tokyo Trust, which both cut yields by 26 basis points.
The Bank of Tokyo Trust was also the leader in cutting its three-month certificates of deposit by 45 basis points and its six-month certificates by 35 basis points.
For the New York commercial banks, the average yield on money market accounts was 4.18 percent, down 6 basis points. The average yields on those banks' three-month and six-month certificates were, respectively, 4.16 percent, down 14 basis points, and 4.26 percent, down 11 basis points.
 
 
Cuts by Savings Institutions
 At savings institutions in the New York area, yields were cut to 4.83 percent, down 9 basis points, for money market accounts; to 4.83 percent, down 10 basis points, for three-month certificates, and to 5.00 percent, also down 10 basis points, for six-month certificates.
The Monitor said the average yields at 20 major banks outside the New York area had been cut by 8 basis points, to 4.47 percent, on money-market accounts, and by 14 points, to 4.55 percent, for six-month certificates.
By comparison, at the Treasury Department's weekly bill auction on Monday, the three-month bill was auctioned at an average discount rate of 4.21 percent.

HEADLINE: New Mayor of Nation's Capital Finds Sober Reality Dulls Bright Promise

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
In the 11 months since Sharon Pratt Kelly replaced Marion S. Barry Jr. as Mayor of the nation's capital, sober reality has dulled some of the sheen of her bright promise of change and supplanted some of her do-it-yesterday eagerness.
Mrs. Kelly -- she was Sharon Pratt Dixon until this past weekend, when she married James R. Kelly 3d, a businessman who has homes in New York and Los Angeles -- took office in early January promising to "clean house." She was eager to deal with the drug-driven crime bedeviling the city. She could hardly wait to wrestle the bloated City Hall bureaucracy she inherited from Mr. Barry, whose 12-year tenure ended with him bound for prison on a drug conviction. 
 But it is now apparent that solving the problems facing the District of Columbia, which is desperately short of money and stunned by a horrific spree of robbery and murder, is going to be no easier or more readily accomplished than solving the problems facing any other troubled American city.
For reasons beyond her control, some of the problems here have grown worse since Mrs. Kelly took office. Other problems have been worsened by her administration's mistakes.
 
No Major Erosion Yet
 There is no wholesale souring on the new Mayor, a Democrat and the first black woman elected to run one of the nation's major cities. But the expectations of many people here had soared with her ascendancy, perhaps soared too much, and now they have begun to chafe with disappointment.
Despite the disappointment, polls indicate that Mrs. Kelly has not yet suffered major, irretrievable erosion of her political base. And in recent weeks she has moved to shore up that base, aware that the sort of problems she faces has seriously weakened the political strength of some mayors, including David N. Dinkins of New York, and has led to the defeat of others, like Kathryn Whitmire of Houston.
One of the major problems here is crime. The drug-driven murder wave has intensified, claiming some 400 lives thus far this year. And increasing numbers of them are innocent bystanders, shot down for no apparent reason.
Moreover, the municipal bureaucracy remains bloated and resistant to change. Employment, housing, health and education problems have grown worse as the nation's economic recession reduces revenue, forcing a shrinkage in government social programs just as rapid expansion is needed.
A few nights ago the disappointment over the new Mayor's achievements thus far boiled over when she talked about crime and other issues with 300 members of the Citizens Association of Georgetown. Along with other white enclaves in this predominately black city, Georgetown gave Mrs. Kelly the edge she needed to pull off a suprising victory in the 1990 mayoral election.
"You have my support but you also have my anger," Clifford L. Brody, a government consultant, told the Mayor, his voice rising. "We think it can be done better."
Mrs. Kelly replied that she heard his message "loud and clear" and was moving determinedly to solve the city's problems. She spoke of her recent proposal to attack crime not just by putting more police officers on the street, but also by reaching out to troubled young people with more education and training programs.
"But we're looking at something that's going to take awhile to solve -- not forever, but awhile," she said, caution edging in where once there had been boundless optimism.
The Mayor's critics concede the money squeeze has left her with no funds to expand old government programs or institute new programs. But they contend that she has made matters worse by feuding with the City Council and by allowing her top aides to feud among themselves.
"She's fallen short by any measure, even though she's had a lot of very tough things to deal with and has made some progress here and there," said Joslyn Williams, the head of the city's Democratic Party. "A lot of people feel frozen out. They don't know where to turn."
Still, the first year of Mrs. Kelly's four-year tenure has not been without some successes. For example, she has been able to persuade Congress, which by law has the final say over most District matters, that the city merits the Federal support that was denied in the waning days of the Barry administration. Lawmakers have responded with more money, including an extra $100 million to help the city pay its debts, and an increase in the annual appropriation for services the city provides the Federal Government.
"The feeling about the city, as far as Congress is concerned, has gone from the dead of winter to a bright spring day," said Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on the District of Columbia, who is a former Mayor of Richmond. "Given what she's had to work with and all the problems she faced right from the beginning, I'd say she's off to as good a start as could be expected."
In an effort to shore up her political support, Mrs. Kelly has appointed one of the city's top political operators, Ted Gay, whose task is to establish contact with community groups and improve constituent services.
"Naturally, she was weak in this area," he said. "She came in as an outsider, someone who wasn't supposed to win, had no big organization. It takes time. We'll get it done."
Perhaps most importantly, Mrs. Kelly has moved forcefully to defuse the crime issue, which polls show is what most worries the average citizen.
Last month, after a particularly heinous murder in which a woman riding home on a city freeway was shot to death by a man who the police said "just wanted to kill somebody," the Mayor made a prime-time television appearance in which she announced that the city would increase police presence on the streets and reach out to troubled youngsters with special education and training programs.
Community centers will be established at which social workers will assist and advise families with crime-prone children and offer more health services for teen-agers with drug problems, as well as programs to curb teen-age pregnancy.
Curfews will be imposed in neighborhoods that have an unusual crime wave, and the age at which juveniles can be prosecuted as adults for serious crimes will be lowered a year, to 14, with bail provisions tightened.
The number of homicide investigators will be doubled, to 110. Additional officers will patrol the city by foot, with the number doubling in public housing projects, where much of the city's worst crime occurs.
Mrs. Kelly estimated the cost of her anti-crime plan at $20 million. She proposed paying for it by taking money from other programs and by seeking grants from the Federal Government and private foundations.
Given time and resources, the Mayor says, she will make good on her promise to clean house.
"But I don't have any instant solutions to our problems," she said in an interview. "What I offer now is hope. We can eventually get the job done."

HEADLINE: Poor Find Going Broke Is Too Costly

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORGANTON, N.C.

 BODY:
Almost a million Americans went bankrupt last year, but others were not so lucky.
Many Americans are too poor to go bankrupt. 
 Unable to afford court costs and lawyers' fees that can total $1,000 or more, many poor people lose possessions that a bankruptcy filing could save, and find themselves subject to unnerving or even illegal pressure from collection agencies. They also stay buried under their financial misfortunes, unable to enjoy the rehabilitated credit histories that bankruptcy affords the more privileged.
"There are probably a million people in the country who would like to file for bankruptcy, but can't afford it," said Gary Klein of the National Consumer Law Center, which advises lawyers on consumer cases.
 
Law's Uneven Application
 As this recession, like others, has led to record bankruptcy filings, most attention has focused on the legal maneuvers of troubled titans like Donald J. Trump and Drexel Burnham Lambert.
But while bankruptcy laws are also supposed to more modest earners who fall on hard times, allowing them, too, to reorganize or cancel their debts, the system is not working for people like Bob and Amy Davis of Morganton.
In this small town in a low-wage valley of furniture factories, poultry farms and textile mills, the Davises have been virtually without work since last summer, when Mr. Davis's attempt to open an auto repair shop collapsed under the weight of the recession.
With three young children suffering from a rare genetic disease called Albright's syndrome, the Davises owe more than $15,000 in medical bills. Creditors have repossessed their car, the bicycle they gave their son last year for Christmas and the bed they gave their daughter.
The Davises finally sought the help of a bankruptcy lawyer, who tallied their debts on a piece of adding machine tape that stretched four feet. They totaled $26,073.26.
 
Legal Fees Are Too High
 Lawyers say that filing for bankruptcy could erase most of that debt. But when the Davises learned it would cost about $600 in legal fees, plus $120 in court costs, to declare themselves officially broke, they found it a luxury they could not afford.
"The laws are really strange," Mr. Davis said. "If we had the money to file, we'd just pay the bills."
Unable to find work as a mechanic, Mr. Davis now gets occasional jobs in one of the few businesses in this area that seem to be booming: he works as a "repo man," taking back cars from debtors like himself.
Poor people seeking bankruptcy protection face at least three problems.
Some just do not have the income to pay their debts even if their obligations were reduced under a bankruptcy proceeding. Others do have the income that might save their cars, appliances or sometimes even their homes, but they cannot afford the legal fees, which range from $400 to $1,500 and sometimes must be paid in advance.
Added to that is a third financial problem: debtors must pay a $120 filing fee, since bankruptcy courts refuse to waive fees for the indigent, as other courts will. A 1973 ruling by the United States Supreme Court upheld the bankruptcy fee, which was then $50, declaring that there is no constitutional right to bankruptcy.
In an angry dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall termed the ruling "disgraceful" and said, "No one who has had close contact with poor people can fail to understand how close to the margin of survival many of them are."
 
It's Expensive to Be Poor
 Some advocates argue that the problems poor people face in getting bankruptcy protection are just part of a larger pattern of credit inequities that make it expensive to be poor. Unable to get conventional financing, for instance, many poor people buy televisions or appliances on weekly payment plans that drive up their costs dramatically.
"It tends to create a cycle of poverty," Mr. Klein said.
In the year ending June 30, there were 811,206 personal bankruptcy cases filed in the United States, a 23 percent increase over the previous year and a record.
Of those, 621,324 were under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, typically used by the poorest debtors. This requires them to sell off their property to pay their creditors, while, in exchange, the court cancels the debt that remains. Under this proceeding, debtors are allowed to keep a certain amount of property, which varies by state but averages about $12,000.
In the case of the Davises, who have few possessions to sell, lawyers say the court would simply cancel most of their debts. "Medical bills -- boom -- gone," said John Vail, who runs the nearby Catawba Valley Legal Services office.
The remainder of the nation's personal bankruptcies were under Chapter 13, which allows debtors to retain more of their possessions, often including their homes, in exchange for making reduced but steady payments.
 
A Matter of Triage
 Only about half the nation's Legal Services offices handle bankruptcies, citing a shortage of lawyers. Mr. Vail, who takes bankruptcy cases only when doing so can save a home, said he turns away as many families as he helps.
"It's triage," he said, adding that there are "a lot of folks we don't do anything for."
Some scholars have urged that bankruptcy be made an administrative procedure, dispensing with the need for lawyers. Under current law, people are allowed to represent themselves, but the proceeding is a technical one that even lawyers sometimes find confusing.
Among bankruptcy's intangible but important benefits is the protection from harassment that it promises. The law bars collection agencies from soliciting from those who have declared bankruptcy.
When a collection agency called Sue Bottiggi, of North Andover, Mass., it threatened to take not just her possessions but her children.
Ms. Bottiggi's husband left the family in late 1989, and her 11-year-old daugther was subsequently hospitalized with emotional problems. But when Ms. Bottiggi told a collection agent that she could not afford to pay off a $1,600 Visa bill, she said, the agent calmly, illegally and falsely told her that she would be taken to court, where a judge would probably put her children in foster care.
Eventually, she told her divorce lawyer of the calls. Threatened with a suit, the collection agency agreed to pay Ms. Bottiggi $10,000 and the bank erased her debt.
 
Pressure From a Collector
 The Davises have been relying on the $407 monthly disability checks that two of their children receive, plus $107 a month in food stamps. In addition to treating the children's Albright's syndrome, a hormone problem that has left them with learning disabilities, Mr. Davis ran up his own medical bills with a heart attack and lymph node surgery.
Before the family changed to an unlisted telephone number, Mr. Davis said, one collector called and "said he didn't care if he harassed me enough to give me another heart attack, he was going to get his money."
Mr. Davis now works the other side of the collection line, earning $50 for each car he repossesses. He said several debtors tried to stop him with fists, and one drew a gun. "There's quite a few of them I do feel terrible for," he said, "but if I don't do it somebody's going to."

HEADLINE: Panel Steps Up Census Dispute With Bush Official

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The tug of war over politically volatile census data erupted into an angry confrontation today as a House subcommittee chairman said Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher had "put himself outside the law" by refusing to appear and turn over the full set of alternative census counts subpoenaed by the panel.
Although Mr. Mosbacher's aides appeared before the subcommittee today and agreed to turn over half of the adjusted counts, the chairman, Tom Sawyer, Democrat of Ohio, said, "No Cabinet official has ever failed to appear before the Legislature when withholding subpoenaed documents." 
 Alternately pale and flushed with anger, Mr. Sawyer, who heads the House Census and Population subcommittee, told Mr. Mosbacher's aides that he would "take under advisement" whether the partial data they offered would be acceptable, or whether he would seek to have Mr. Mosbacher held in contempt of Congress.
If Mr. Sawyer chose to take that course and won approval from a majority of the full House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, his fellow Congressional Democrats would be faced with the ticklish but enticing prospect of taking an obscure dispute on the census and using it to embarrass a chief political adviser of President Bush. The President named Mr. Mosbacher last week as general chairman of his 1992 re-election campaign.
After the hearing, the Democratic Party chairman, Ronald H. Brown, issued a statement accusing Mr. Mosbacher of "hiding" and saying his "contempt of Congress is surpassed only by his contempt for the standards of accuracy and fairness in the first place."
But at the Commerce Department, aides argued that the Department had complied with the subpoena by providing half the available national data to the committee. In mid-November, before the subpoena for the full set of data was voted, Mr. Sawyer had said half the data would be acceptable.
"We felt we are fully in compliance," said Michael R. Darby, the Department's under secretary for economic affairs. "This is not a reasonable thing that's going on here." Commerce aides said the subpoena voted by the committee did not specifically require Mr. Mosbacher to appear today.
At issue are computer tapes with the adjusted population counts, a second full set of data compiled by taking the original count, comparing it with the results of a later survey of 171,000 households and using statistical models to adjust the final counts to compensate for an estimated census undercount of 3 million to 5 million people.
In July, Mr. Mosbacher, whose statistical advisers disagreed over which data to approve as the official 1990 figures, ruled that the original census enumeration would be designated as the official numbers, and that the alternative, adjusted figures, would be used for analysis and possible adjustment of subsequent population estimates.
Mr. Sawyer has said he is seeking the adjusted counts for scientific study on ways to improve the census process before the year 2000, but the political subtext of the request was clear. Although the official, unadjusted census data has already been used to allocate Congressional seats among the states, state legislatures are free to bypass the official numbers and use the adjusted figures, if they can get them, to draw in-state legislative maps.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rose in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
The nation's foreign trade deficit, which includes services and investments as well as goods, climbed to $10.5 billion in the July-September quarter, the Government said today.
The deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of the nation's performance with the rest of the world, followed rare back-to-back quarters of surplus. In the first two quarters, the perennial merchandise trade deficits were offset by contributions made by the allies to pay for the Persian Gulf war. 
 The allies' contributions fell by 60 percent in the third quarter to $4.6 billion, however, and were not enough to offset a 33 percent increase in the merchandise trade deficit to $20.5 billion.
The current account measures not only merchandise but also imports and exports of services and investment between the United States and other countries.
Many analysts predicting that this year's current account deficit could dip to $20 billion or less, as the war payments and lower imports resulting from the recession create a big improvement over last year's $92.12 billion deficit.
But analysts said the big jump in the third-quarter deficit was an ominous sign of things to come as the war payments stop and as demand for United States exports slows because of economic sluggishness abroad.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Mozart's Money Misunderstanding

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
POOR Mozart. Everybody who saw the movie knows genius went unrewarded, that the composer of "Don Giovanni" and "The Magic Flute" lived hand to mouth and died a pauper. In fact, say William Baumol, an economist at New York University, and Hilda Baumol, an economics consultant in New York, everybody got it wrong.
In a paper written for the Mozart Bicentennial Symposium at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, the husband-wife team calculates that Mozart's income in the last decade of his life was thoroughly middle class by 1990's standards -- a remarkable achievement for a time in which most wage earners lived at the raw edge of subsistence. 
 Mozart, moreover, was not alone in his good fortune. His was a golden era for composers in German-speaking Europe , the Baumols say, one in which a serendipitous convergence of factors favored the flowering of musical culture. They believe that the fragmentation of central European states along with changes in the technology of music virtually assured that economic growth would generate financial windfalls for composers.
First, the question of how much Mozart made and what it was worth. According to Volkmar Braunbehrens, a biographer of Mozart, the great composer's annual income during his Vienna years (1781-91) fluctuated between 800 and 3,800 Austrian florins. But these numbers omit much of his earnings from teaching, performance and publication. The Baumols figure Mozart's total take averaged 3,000-4,000 florins a year during the period.
Translating Mozart's 1780's income in florins into 1990's dollars is a matter of educated guess work because data on 18th-century prices and consumption habits are sparse. Moreover, no matter how carefully the index is constructed, comparisons across centuries have limited meaning because the goods available have changed so radically: there is, for example, no way to figure the value in florins of the few dollars' worth of antibiotics that might have saved Mozart from his fatal bout of typhoid fever.
The Baumols plow ahead, however, with striking results. They use the long-running Phelps Brown-Hopkins index for the cost of living in Britain to compare 1786 British pounds with 1989 pounds. Then they convert pounds to florins on the 18th-century end, and pounds to dollars on the other.
It seems that the 1786 florin could buy roughly as much as $10 in 1989. Thus 3,000-4,000 florins were worth $30,000-40,000 -- less than Madonna makes from a single concert, but not a bad deal for a serious artist in his 30's. The figure looks even better when one remembers that the purchasing power of the average wage in Mozart's Vienna was, at very most, one-seventh the average in America today. Mozart's income was thus enough to qualify him for Vienna's upper middle class.
The Baumols believe it was no accident that the place and time that nurtured Mozart also brought forth the likes of Beethoven, Schubert, Hayden and Gluck. Rarely, they say, has the economics of musical composition been so fortuitous.
The existence of 1,800 separate German monarchies meant that 1,800 royal courts could covet musical performance, both as a means of conspicu ous consumption and a way to relieve boredom. Moreover, by the conventions of the time, the only good music was new music -- nobody wanted to hear that dreary old stuff from Bach and Handel if they could afford something original.
This rich market for composition was made yet richer, the Baumols contend, by changes in popular taste and in the technology of musical instruments. The new "galant" style was far easier to play than the traditional contrapuntal style, opening performance to amateurs and reducing the cost of professional productions. And the invention of the fortepiano, an instrument as loud as the harpsichord yet as subtle as the clavichord, made it possible to play the new music for much larger groups. By no coincidence this was the era in which concert hall music, paid for by subscription, became a bourgeois pastime.
This cheery history still leaves the matter of Mozart's grim burial to explain. The Baumols, ever resourceful, think that the story of Mozart's consignment to a pauper's grave is based on a misunderstanding.
It seems that Emperor Joseph II of Austria thought that burial pomp had no place in the rational modern world. And for a while, Viennese society humored him: everyone but the aristocracy ended up in mass graves, where they were dumped without ceremony after church services. Later, the Baumols report, the bones were dug up and reburied in private ossuaries.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
Chaos Looms Over Soviets, Gates Says

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, warned today that the fragmented Soviet Union faces the most severe instability this winter since the civil war that followed the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, including the possibility of a reversion to authoritarian rule in some regions.
Describing the volatile political situation as "dangerously unstable," he cited many internal crises, including the collapse of central authority, continued decay and disintegration of the Soviet Army, uncertainty over the control of the Soviet arsenal of 30,000 nuclear weapons and the potential for conflict between various republics in the next year or two if aggressive, xenophobic regimes emerge from the current political turmoil and economic privation. 
 Mr. Gates's testimony before a House subcommittee, in part a distillation of intelligence assessments recently prepared for President Bush, underscored the delicate and confusing position the Administration faces as it struggles to adjust American policy to fit a moving target.
The Administration said on Monday that it was ready to work with the new commonwealth of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia, which was formed on Sunday, but made no move to formally recognize it or to break ties to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, at least for the moment. No policy changes were announced today, as officials continued to wait for events to unfold.
 
A Grim View
 In the most comprehensive Administration analysis of the current Soviet crisis, Mr. Gates told the Defense Policy Panel of the House Armed Services Committee:
"The economy is in a free fall with no prospects for reversal in sight. Severe economic conditions, including substantial shortages of food and fuel in some areas, the disintegration of the armed forces and ongoing ethnic conflict will combine this winter to produce the most significant disorder in the former U.S.S.R. since the Bolsheviks consolidated power."
During grueling confirmation hearings last fall, Mr. Gates was questioned extensively about his long-held view that the prospects for a peaceful transition to democracy in the Soviet Union were not good, and his grim assessment today was consistent with that view. But he also noted that the disintegration could in some ways prove beneficial for the United States and the West.
None of the splintering republics, he said, "either individually or collectively, has the desire or ability to pose as great a threat to U.S. security as did the U.S.S.R. for so many decades."
"Indeed," he said, "most republics of the former U.S.S.R. are trying to reduce their defense burdens, join Western economic and security structures and forge cooperative relationships with the United States."
President Bush sought today to assure the American public that the United States was responding adequately to the volatile situation.
"I'm proud of the way we've handled the evolution in the Soviet Union, and right today it is extraordinarily complicated," he said in a speech in Chicago, without elaborating.
 
Remarks by Strauss
 Robert S. Strauss, the American Ambassador to Moscow, was at times more upbeat, at times more pessimistic than Mr. Gates in less formal remarks made in Washington today.
In a breakfast meeting with the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations, Mr. Strauss praised the fledgling commonwealth of Soviet republics for embracing principles the United States finds "positive," but expressed doubts over whether it had the popular support necessary to survive.
"This new commonwealth that we hear about, God only knows where it's going to end up," he said.
Even more worrisome, Mr. Strauss noted, was what he called the possibility that disgruntled remnants of the Soviet military might stage a coup. Calling the military a "wild card," he said, "We haven't heard a word from the army over there, and there are millions of men that are terribly unhappy and frustrated and hungry and homeless and families are disturbed." He called the situation "made to order for any of several first-rate demagogues they have."
Mr. Gates, while praising Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, for his articulation of "bold economic reforms," added, "It remains to be seen whether he can carry them out."
 
Uncertain About Gorbachev
 In the closed session that followed his opening statement, Mr. Gates was careful not to rule out a future role for Mr. Gorbachev or to criticize Mr. Yeltsin, people who attended the briefing said.
"His prognostication for Gorbachev's success in pulling something out of this was very low," an American official said. "But when people tried to press him questions about Gorbachev, I honestly don't think either he or the agency knows."
Despite their close working relationship via telephone during the Persian Gulf crisis and during other Soviet political developments, Mr. Bush has not tried to speak with Mr. Gorbachev since the republics of Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia announced their confederation on Sunday, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said today.
Nor has Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d spoken to his Soviet counterpart, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, or to any of the foreign ministers of the republics, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said.
Still, she added, Mr. Baker, who is scheduled to leave for Moscow on Saturday night, will meet with Mr. Shevardnadze on Sunday night and with President Gorbachev on Monday.
 
'Immediate' Nuclear Concern
 Mr. Gates told the lawmakers that although the Soviet military threat had dramatically diminished and that military "readiness is at its lowest level in decades," of "immediate concern" was the danger that the Soviets will not be capable of maintaining safeguards as they reduce or dismantle much of their nuclear arsenal. Until now, he noted, the Defense Ministry and General Staff had guaranteed safeguards through an elaborate system of central control.
"But the center is evaporating before our eyes," he said in the starkest portrayal of the Administration's concern about control of Soviet nuclear weapons. "Those who designed the control system never anticipated this."
Even extraordinary physical security measures, elaborate codes and fail-safe methods "become ineffective if the guards or their commanders are suborned, corrupted or simply disappear."
 
Worry Over Technology
 Mr. Gates also expressed concern that the former Soviet Union could emerge as a major new source of nuclear and other weapons technology for developing countries in exchange for hard currency. He said that such technology could come particularly from republic and local governments with high concentrations of military equipment and little else that was marketable.
"Even if republic governments retain tight control over their arsenals, economic conditions will tempt them to sell weapons to the highest hard-currency bidder," he said.
He also speculated that among the tens of thousands of scientists, engineers and medical doctors emigrating annually from the Soviet Union, some may find a market for their expertise in countries in the developing world that are striving to acquire new weaponry.
As for the internal political situation, Mr. Gates expressed concern that economic reform would lead to inflation and unemployment that could overwhelm democratic forces in the Soviet republics.
"The possibility cannot be ruled out that such circumstances could produce a return to authoritarian government -- whether led by reformers desperate to feed the people and stave off an explosion, or by nationalists driven by a xenophobic, atavistic vision of Russia," he said.
 
Trying to Keep Pace
 Events were moving so quickly that Mr. Gates said he had drafted his remarks -- his first public statement on the Soviet Union since assuming the nation's top intelligence post last month -- on Saturday thinking that it was "bold and forward-leaning." But he added that he had to make substantial changes on Monday to reflect the most recent events.
Underscoring the uncertainty, he has short-circuited the lengthy interagency analysis process and ordered his analysts to draft 10 brief assessments of the Soviet Union this month.
The classified reports range from food and fuel needs and ethnic conflict to the disintegration of the armed forces and the strategic threat. While some have already been delivered to the White House, intelligence officials said that others would have to be substantially rewritten to reflect the quick pace of events.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Small Shops Move to Hire Top Directors

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
TWO smaller New York agencies known for their originality are seeking to break out of the pack by hiring two executives with similar reputations as creative directors.
One is Bergelt Litchfield Inc., the home of humorous radio commercials that urge commuters to ride the Long Island Rail Road by dramatizing the drudgery of driving. Bergelt has hired Cary Lemkowitz, formerly of Young & Rubicam New York, as its president and executive creative director. 
 The other is Frankfurt Gips Balkind Advertising, whose witty advertising for the New York Restaurant Group includes a television spot in which professional waiters mangle famous lines from plays and movies to demonstrate that "no one's ever discovered a great actor at Smith & Wollensky. Only great steak."
Frankfurt has hired Marty Cooke of Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. as its executive vice president and creative director.
The appointments are the latest in what has been an almost frantic round of hirings at agencies searching for top creative talent. Among the familiar names changing jobs: Gordon Bowen and Parry Merkley, who left Ogilvy & Mather New York for, respectively, McCann-Erickson New York and Doremus & Company; Nina DiSesa, who left McCann for J. Walter Thompson Chicago, and Eric Weber, who left Y. & R. New York for Foote, Cone & Belding in Chicago.
The reason for the rondelay is the continuing advertising industry recession. Agencies are increasingly eager to land the key creative people who they fervently hope will produce campaigns that sell products and attract clients.
"Creativity is the critical issue," Jane Cavalier, Frankfurt's president, said yesterday.
Since September, when Mr. Lemkowitz left Y. & R. New York, where he had been an executive vice president and creative director, there has been intense speculation over his next stop. He earned his reputation there for campaigns like Metropolitan Life's "Get Met, It Pays" advertising, featuring the "Peanuts" characters, and Citizen Watch's "Citizen, Citizen, Citizen" commercials, but, he said, "it was time to turn the page."
Mr. Lemkowitz, who is 43 years old, characterized his new post as "an opportunity to focus on creativity and be involved with all the clients."
In keeping with what he called a desire to "be entrepreneurial," he is being made a principal in Bergelt, which has about 40 employees and around $35 million in billings from clients that also include Villeroy & Boch and the Association of American Railroads.
Mr. Lemkowitz, whose appointment takes effect immediately, succeeds Dick Raboy, the president and creative director. David H. Venghaus, Bergelt's chairman, described it as "an amicable separation," adding that he had been "looking to bring in the next wave of management."
A primary reason, he continued, was a belief that Bergelt, unlike shops like Deutsch Inc., Kirshenbaum & Bond and Omon, "is not getting into some of the presentations I think we should be."
Signing Mr. Lemkowitz "is like hiring a name brand," he added.
At Frankfurt, the decision to hire Mr. Cooke, 39, stemmed from a desire to "position ourselves as the great creative force that's missing in New York right now," Ms. Cavalier, the president, said. Effective on Jan. 6, she added, he will replace Frankfurt's acting creative directors, Bryan Buckley and Frank Todaro, who will continue as consultants.
Mr. Buckley and Mr. Todaro were top creative executives at Buckley DeCerchio Cavalier, which was merged into Frankfurt in August to form a shop with about 35 employees and around $49 million in billings from clients that also include Giant Carpet and the Comedy Central cable television network.
"For me, this is like a start-up without all the angst of going through a start-up," Mr. Cooke said yesterday in an interview from Toronto, where for 14 months he has served as creative director of Chiat's Canadian operations.
Among the campaigns he has worked on, at Chiat and at Scali, McCabe, Sloves, are Nynex's pun-filled "human cartoons" telephone directory ads and Reebok's surrealistic "U.B.U." ads.

HEADLINE: President Mingles With the People In Chicago as Economy Is an Issue

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 10

 BODY:
President Bush chose a trip to the middle of America today to make the oft-debated political point that he is, too, in touch with the average person.
In trips to the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr. Bush waded happily through mobs of commodities and financial futures brokers on the frenzied trading floors, perhaps the nation's most vivid examples of robust capitalism. Later, speaking to the Illinois Farm Bureau Federation, he waxed enthusiastic about the moral and social values of rural America. 
 In between, the President ducked into the Billy Goat Tavern, a seedy downtown bar favored by reporters and construction workers, for a cheeseburger-and-Coke lunch with five ordinary people assembled by the White House's image consultant, Sig Rogich.
 
Choice of Tavern
 Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, said the White House chose the Billy Goat, a hamburger-and-a-beer joint tucked gloomily beneath Michigan Avenue, "because we needed a place to go to lunch," and not expressly for political reasons.
Mr. Bush ate his cheeseburger and potato chips off a wax-paper place setting. He was overheard discussing the economy, unemployment, Pearl Harbor, the Soviet Union and Chicago real estate with the three men and two women who were his guests, but only snippets of the chat were audible to nearby reporters.
One of two sheet-metal workers who had lunch with Mr. Bush, Jim Mancini, later told reporters that Mr. Bush "seemed like he was very concerned in trying to find a way" to revive the nation's slumbering economy, but was "kind of confused" as to how to proceed.
Mr. Bush spent much of the day working hard to persuade audiences that he would "do my level best," as he said at one point, to shake the economy out of its slump. But like Mr. Mancini, many who heard him seemed to have a mixed response.
As Mr. Bush entered a private meeting on the nation's economy with some of the city's top leaders at the Board of Trade, he said he was "not happy, nor is anybody, with the state of the economy," adding that it needed the "kick" of a legislative package of stimulants that he is now putting together.
He made the point more emphatically later in a speech at the mercantile exchange, where he blamed Congress for many of the economy's current problems.
"I've asked Congress for three years to pass a series of growth initiatives -- job-creating initiatives," he said. "And the economy has turned sluggish. People want action. And I want action -- action to help people, action to make things better now and in the future."
But Mr. Bush offered no hint today of what measures he might favor to improve the economic climate beyond a litany of ideas -- including banking deregulation, tax-free savings accounts for first-time homebuyers and a cut in the tax on capital gains -- that he has previously proposed and has often berated Congress for not addressing.
 
Economy Is Called 'Awful'
 One executive who attended another private session on the economy with Mr. Bush, this one at the Mercantile Exchange, Louis A. Holland, said that bankers and others told the President that the economy was "awful."
"We really didn't get any strong feeling from him as to what would be proposed, so I think it's going to be more of the same," said Mr. Holland, a managing partner of the investment firm Holland Capital Management. He nevertheless called the session a "net positive," saying: "You can solve the problem if you recognize it, and I think the light has finally come on."
Roger Carlson, a mercantile exchange trader who listened to Mr. Bush's speech, was more skeptical. "I'll wait till January 1992 to see what he comes out with," he said later.
The President also sought today to throw cold water on the announcement of a rival Republican, the political commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, that he will run against Mr. Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Mr. Buchanan has frequently attacked Mr. Bush's support of free trade and his internationalist viewpoint.
Today Mr. Bush warned that the nation must not retreat from its economic troubles into "some isolationist sphere, listening to the siren call of 'America first.' "
"I learned that lesson as a young kid, just at the beginning of World War II," he said, "and I don't want to see this country go back to America first' and protection. That will shrink markets and throw people out of work. And we need to stand together against that call form the left and against the call from the right, to stay within ourselves. We owe the world leadership, and they're going to get it from this President."
The visual highlight of the President's Chicago visit was easily his trip to the mercantile exchange floor, an acre-sized room dominated by four huge "pits" that deal in agricultural commodities and financial instruments. The President took about 20 minutes to cross the floor, parting a literal sea of traders in bright red, blue and orange coats who cheered "U.S.A., U.S.A." when they were not clamoring to buy and sell.
A vice president and chief spokesman for the exchange, Andrew Yemma, said the traders produce a "report card" on Mr. Bush's handling of the economy and world events every day, pushing the price of commodities and financial instruments up or down based on their reading of global events.
The exchange would amass a record volume of trades this year, he said, eclipsing the old record of 102 million set in 1989. In no small part, he said, that reflects fears about the economy, because the exchange is the forum where investors seek to hedge against the risks of sudden drops in the values of their holdings.

HEADLINE: Study Shows Improvement In Service On Subways

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
The on-time performance of New York City's subway during the morning rush hours showed "significant improvement" between 1988 and 1990, according to a report released yesterday.
Eighty-five percent of all trains between 7 and 9 A.M. ran on time last year, the study, by the Inspector General of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, determined. In 1988, only 76 percent of the trains were on time during the same hours, a previous study by the Inspector General found. 
 Trains are considered on time if they are within five minutes of their schedule, under definitions of the Transit Authority, an M.T.A. subsidiary, which operates the city's subways and buses.
The report found that only 5 percent of all trains were late by more than 10 minutes last year, compared with 9 percent in 1988. The proportion of trains running ahead of schedule also showed a marked improvement, the report said. In 1990, 26 percent of the morning rush-hour trains were early, compared with 12 percent in 1988.
The Inspector General, John S. Pritchard 3d, cited a number of reasons for the improved performance. Billions of dollars have been spent on the subway system over the last decade, he said, for new and rebuilt cars, new tracks and other equipment. In all, the M.T.A. has spent $16 billion since 1981 to upgrade the city subway and the Long Island and Metro-North commuter railroads.
Mr. Pritchard also credited other changes with affecting the quality of service, including a decline in ridership because of the recession, which reduced overcrowding on some lines, and the creation of skip-stop service on two subway lines, the J and Z and the 1 and 9.
The report was released just as the M.T.A., Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature were considering how to avoid a large increase in the subway and bus fare, to $1.40 from the current $1.15, on Jan. 1. The Transit Authority proposed the increase last month, and the M.T.A. board is scheduled to vote on it on Dec. 20.
Mr. Pritchard said the timing of the report's release was coincidental. His researchers have been working on the study for some time, he said, and he wanted to produce it before the end of the year.
"We're an independent agency," he said in an interview. "We're not about to try to curry favor with the M.T.A. and the T.A."
But some do connect the report's findings with the political battle over the subway's financial future. The Straphangers' Campaign, a riders' group, said that while it had some quarrels with specifics of the report, the overall significance was to demonstrate the value of spending to upgrade the subway.
The M.T.A.'s second five-year rebuilding plan will end on Jan. 1, and transit officials have proposed a third five-year plan, which will cost $10.6 billion. The proposal is stalled in the Legislature.
The report's most significant lesson, said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers' Campaign, "is that you get better subway cars and fewer breakdowns if you spend money to buy new subway cars or fix old ones."
"If the Governor doesn't exercise some leadership soon," Mr. Russianoff said, "the next phase of the rebuilding effort isn't looking so good."
The study showed that some lines -- including the J, G, L and N trains, and the 1 and 3 trains -- had on-time records of at least 90 percent last year. The worst lines were the E and F, which had on-time rates of 77 percent.
Mr. Pritchard noted that his objective measures may not be in line with commuters' subjective experience. Nonetheless, he said, "This segment of the subway's performance is important. Improvements have been made in the system, and that to us is very encouraging."

HEADLINE: Unlikely Bedfellows Put New Spin on Trenton Tax Debate

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Like a troupe of dismayed and disillusioned Aladdins, Trenton Republicans and their allies in business, who wished for a rollback of the new taxes imposed by the Democrats last year, are trying desperately to coax the genie back into the magic lamp. Their wish may suddenly be granted, and they don't like it a bit.
To make matters more puzzling, the people trying to grant the Republicans' wish are the Democrats, the very ones who imposed the $2.8 billion increase in the first place.
All this came into sharp if confusing focus Monday, when the Democrats began committee hearings on a package of bills that would repeal every penny of the increase they passed last year with such fervor that the critical vote was cast by an ailing Democratic Senator who checked out of a hospital so he could be present. 
 On Monday that same Senator, 72-year-old Walter Rand of Camden, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, made it clear that he was ready to repeal the entire increase and let the Republicans do what they want to replace the revenue it generates.
 
No Republicans at Hearing
 In a sense, Mr. Rand played to an empty hall: no Republicans showed up for the committee hearing, and they boycotted a full session of the Assembly at which the Democrats planned to introduce the same tax repeal package.
And business representatives, who last year paraded to the witness stand to oppose the tax increase, got in line to on Monday oppose its repeal. They argued that repealing the taxes would send the state even further into an economic tailspin.
The Democrats' reasoning in moving to repeal the very taxes they imposed just 18 months ago is largely political but partly governmental.
"It's not sour grapes," insists Senator Laurence S. Weiss of Woodbridge, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He was both a point man in writing and shepherding through the tax-increase legislation last year and a leading proponent of repealing it this year. "The voters have sent a message," he said, "and we heard it loud and clear, nobody more than I did." Mr. Weiss was defeated in his bid for re-election after 14 years in the Senate, with 11 years as appropriations chairman.
Mr. Weiss and other Democrats concede that they simply cannot get the message across on their own that the taxes were necessary and that cutting them would mean unnacceptable reductions in state employment, programs and services.
So the Democrats reason that if they remove the taxes, the Republicans, who are to take control of the Legislature next year with overwhelming majorities in both houses, will have to enact new taxes to replace most of them. The Republicans have pledged only to reduce the sales tax by a penny, which would eliminate only $590 million of the $2.8 billion increase.
The Democrats also reason that many Republicans who took no-tax pledges during the campaign will not vote to raise taxes in any case. So if the Republicans do have to restore some revenue, they will need Democratic help. That would give the Democrats some leverage, though they will be outnumbered, 58 to 22 in the Assembly and 27 to 13 in the Senate.
The Republicans are not saying so, but they basically agree with that line of reasoning. They campaigned relentlessly and unequivocally against the entire tax package. But now that they are preparing to take control of the Legislature, such Republican leaders as Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, who is to become the Assembly Speaker in January, maintain that they never promised to roll back all the taxes, just the one-cent sales tax increase. That suggests, of course, that the Republicans are willing to allow the remaining $2.3 billion to stand.
But as the inconsistency of their new position began to dawn, the Republicans changed their tactic. Mr. Haytaian now says, "Go ahead, make my day." Nonetheless, the Republicans refused even to show up when the Democrats forged ahead on Monday with their proposals to repeal all the taxes.
John Budzash, a co-founder of Hands Across New Jersey, the tax protest group that was instrumental in creating the public outcry that led to the Democratic rout, said at the hearing that the Republicans were "cowards for not showing up" to debate the issue after winning election "on the coattails of the tax revolt."
Mr. Budzash, once an ally of the Republicans, parted company with both them and Hands Across New Jersey when the Republicans reneged on a promise to support legislation to allow citizen lawmaking through initiative and referendum.
But the politicians were not the only ones doing turnabouts. James Morford of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce and Bruce Coe of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association -- both groups that opposed the increases originally -- implored the committee on Monday not to roll back the taxes. Doing so, they asserted, would send shock waves of uncertainty through the business community.
That is no doubt true; business abhors uncertainty, even with a Republican majority in control of the Legislature.
But there was another factor at work, the possibility that if the taxes were repealed and had to be replaced, it would be business and industry, which largely escaped new taxes in the last increase, that would take the heaviest hit.
Indeed, New Jersey Citizen Action, a coalition representing labor unions, church groups, consumers and civil rights groups, said in written testimony filed with the committee that "the time has come for corporations" that are "not paying their fair share to pay up."
Business and industry interests would just as soon not face that kind of sentiment if a new round of taxing takes place next year.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Optimistic On Growth

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 --
The economy is not so weak as is popularly believed, and a resumption of solid growth is very likely by mid-1992, the second-ranking Federal Reserve Board official said today, despite what he called a "pervasive sourness" among both business people and consumers.
Asked when expansion would again reach a fairly normal 2 1/2 percent to 3 percent pace, David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, declared, "It looks promising that we could be back on that path sometime next year -- late spring, early summer." He added, "It looks promising, certainly by midyear we should be back squarely in the positive growth category." 
 The comments by Mr. Mullins, who attracted a standing-room audience and three dozen reporters to a luncheon of the National Economists Club at the Library of Congress, appeared to undermine the bond market, where prices fell and interest rates rose during the afternoon. [Page D14.]
 
Tenor of Comments
 Many analysts and market participants have been expecting the Fed to cut rates further to aid a faltering recovery, and Mr. Mullins did not directly or even indirectly rule this out. But the tenor of his comments was that there would be little urgency to cut rates when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next week to set a monetary course into early February.
He said he saw no evidence of cumulative deterioration in the economy -- a new downturn -- that might require such action, and Mr. Mullins argued at another point that a "substantial amount" of the monetary stimulus the Fed had already supplied had yet to emerge from the pipeline.
The full effect of lower rates will not be felt until early in the new year, Mr. Mullins said. A former Treasury official, he joined the Fed last year and became vice chairman in July.
 
Some 'Flat Quarters'
 At the same time, Mr. Mullins said he did not expect an immediate resumption of growth, suggesting there might well be "a couple of flat quarters" before it reappeared.
Over all, the vice chairman's view appeared not dissimilar to those of Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, and Robert Reischauer, the head of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Reischauer told the House Budget Committee today, "We expect growth to be anemic at best through the spring."
In beginning his presentation, Mr. Mullins tried to account for pessimism that seemed worse than warranted by available statistics, which show that while the recovery has "flattened," the economy is probably not sliding backward.
One reason, the Fed official ventured, is that many of today's consumers and businesses have never experienced recession, since none has occurred between 1982 and 1990. Compared with double-digit inflation and unemployment in the late 1970's and early 1980's, Mr. Mullins contended, "There doesn't seem to be all that much to be pessimistic about" today.
 
'Insatiable' Media Appetite
 Mr. Mullins also cited political opportunism, a seemingly "insatiable" media appetite for negative stories, immobilized fiscal policy and heightened public vulnerability to bad news when growth is slow and the wealth of many, including homeowners, is shrinking.
But he said the more fundamental obstacle to renewed economic growth was the lingering effects of the excesses of the 1980's, particularly the overreliance on debt and leverage. The correction of these imbalances, a process that cannot be evaded or short-circuited, is made more difficult because they all involve financial institutions, many of which have become reluctant lenders, Mr. Mullins said.
The Fed official took a relatively sanguine view of inflation, saying he saw no evidence that upward price pressure was building and that he found it hard to imagine sustained high inflation in view of modest recent growth in money and credit. But Mr. Mullins also indicated that the Fed had not forgotten its commitment to bring inflation down further, with today's circumstances offering a rare opportunity to take "a bite" out of inflation for the longer term.

HEADLINE: Senate Delays Tax Decision After Narrow House Vote

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 10

 BODY:
A scheduled Senate vote to consider repeal of Connecticut's three-month-old tax on wages was scrubbed today, with opponents and supporters asking for another 24 hours to regroup and rethink their strategies after the vote in the House of Representatives on Monday night.
The vote in the House to repeal the wage tax was 86 to 63, well short of the 101 votes that would be needed to override Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s certain veto. Repeal leaders had said before the House debate that they were within five or six votes of the 101-vote threshold, which marks the two-thirds majority in the 151-member chamber. 
 Lawmakers said that in the wake of the House vote, Senators on both sides of the issue had filed amendments, some intended to make the bill more palatable in the other chamber, and some intended to substitute legislation that would simply use the repeal bill as a vehicle for less drastic change, like an amendment to the income tax on the books. If the Senate amends the plan, the House would have to debate and vote again, perhaps late Wednesday or Thursday.
"There's a wider range of options now," said Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican from Greenwich who opposes the repeal. "It's like the engine that drives it is not as strong," he said, referring to the bill passed by the House. "There's a desire to use it to go in other directions."
Lawmakers convened last month to consider overturning the new wage tax, which has evoked anger from one end of the state to other, culminating last month in a rally at the Capitol that drew more than 40,000 protesters.
 
Budget Gaps Predicted

 The bill passed by the House on Monday would eliminate the wage tax, set at a flat rate of 4.5 percent, and make up the $1 billion in lost revenue by cutting spending and by raising other taxes, notably the sales tax, which would rise from 6 percent to 8.25 percent. The changes would affect the $7.6 billion budget for the year that ends June 30.
In the House debate, the bill was attacked by critics both for the types of cuts -- in particular a $50 million reduction in the state's contribution to the general assistance welfare system -- and for the economic assumptions behind the plan.
The legislature's Office of Fiscal Analysis issued a report just before the debate began, saying that weak tax collections because of the recession could result in a budget gap of up to $1.25 billion in the year that begins July 1 if the bill becomes law. Even the current budget, with the income tax in place, might face a gap of up to $770 million, the report said.
The co-chairman of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee, Senator Joseph H. Harper Jr., said that amendments would probably be offered in the Senate to break out parts of the bill, especially on spending cuts, and vote on them separately.
Mr. Harper said that if enough Senators concluded that the House was incapable of mustering the additional votes needed to override Mr. Weicker's veto, momentum would grow to forge some package that might survive, either because Mr. Weicker would not veto it, or because two-thirds of the House could support it.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Top Position Is Filled At Burson-Marsteller

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The past few years have been difficult ones for the public relations business, as corporate clients have tightened budgets. But Larry E. Snoddon, who was named yesterday as the new president and chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, has enjoyed rapid growth as head of the firm's European business since 1987. Since then, Burson-Marsteller's European business has nearly tripled to $70 million a year in fee income, the equivalent of revenues.
The European business has expanded not only by advising American and European corporations gearing up for the 1992 single European market, but also with more unusual projects like advising the Polish Government on privatization issues and working with the German Ministry of Economics to develop educational programs for the nation's new citizens from eastern Germany. "We're basically trying to tell them what it's like to live in a free-enterprise system," Mr. Snoddon, (pronounced Snow-Don), said. 
 Mr. Snoddon, who is 46 years old, will succeed James H. Dowling, who moves up to chairman. Harold Burson will assume the new title of founder chairman. The changes are effective Jan. 1.
In the chairman's post, Mr. Dowling, 60 years old, will be "deeply involved with client development," said Mr. Snoddon, who as chief executive will be in charge of managing the firm.
Burson-Marsteller, the second-largest international public relations firm, after Shandwick P.L.C., is having a fairly strong year despite the recession. Mr. Snoddon estimates that Burson-Marsteller's fee income will increase this year to about $220 million, up from about $210 million in 1990. Both Shandwick, whose share price dropped sharply in London yesterday after it announced that 1991 would be disappointing, and Hill & Knowlton, the third-largest firm, are expected to post lower fee income this year. Burson-Marsteller, with more than 2,000 employees in 29 countries, is a subsidiary of Young & Rubicam Inc.
Mr. Snoddon, who joined the firm in 1972 after working for the General Motors Corporation and the American Express Company, says public relations firms must become increasingly sophisticated, with specialists in a variety of disciplines. He cited as an example the firm's winning of an account this week for the Beef Industry Council, the producers' trade group. Burson-Marsteller specialists on government policy from Washington, health-care experts and others helped garner the account, worth roughly $1 million a year in fees.
"That multi-disciplinary approach is the direction things are headed, and it was also a good-sized account in this day and age," Mr. Snoddon said.

HEADLINE: Hard Times Present Hard Choices

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
For charities around the New York region, the current hard times mean more than rising caseloads. They mean hard choices -- choices that in some cases include cutting off funds to programs whose value has been proved, simply because the money is not available or is needed more desperately elsewhere.
When officials at the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service contemplate such cuts, they think of two women who almost lost their children to foster care: a 30-year-old with AIDS who faced frequent hospital stays, and a 27-year-old mother of three who was winning her battle with drugs, but who was kept away from home by her daily counseling sessions. 
 They were able to keep their families intact because the bureau used city funds to provide them with homemakers who could feed, clothe and supervise their children when they were away.
But many other families will not be as lucky. In response to the city's fiscal crisis, the Human Resources Administration cut funding for the homemaker program by $232,000 this year, to $1.68 million.
"In human terms, it means that 35 to 50 more children are now at great risk of ending up in foster care," said Gen Wiltshire, director of the bureau's homemaker program. "Money-wise, everybody also loses in the long run because it costs at least $14,000 a year to keep a child in foster care while it's about $4,200 a year to provide a child with a homemaker."
Ms. Wiltshire's warning is being echoed at nonprofit agencies throughout the city that are being called on to provide greater services because of the recession while being furnished with less money from governments that are cutting back. They are scaling back or eliminating programs that teach youngsters about drugs, that keep the elderly out of nursing homes and that help the homeless renovate abandoned buildings.
Formerly these agencies relied primarily on private donations to aid services to the sick and poor. But in the last three decades, as government began assuming broad responsibility for helping these people, it provided funding that allowed nonprofit groups to expand their services.
However, this reliance on government has in fact made private donations even more important to nonprofit organizations, including the seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. "The government gives us a specific, generally slightly inadequate, amount of money to provide a specific service," said Msgr. Timothy McDonnell, the chief operating officer of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York. "The donations from the Neediest Cases are generally unrestricted so we can use them to make up deficits, provide emergency services or anywhere else there is a great need."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Quiet Trading On Talk About Gorbachev

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher in quiet trading yesterday, helped by rumors -- later denied -- that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was going to resign soon.
"There was a short-covering rally and apprehension about" the Soviet Union, said Matthew Robertson, vice president at Banque Nationale de Paris in New York. Nonetheless, market sentiment remained bearish toward the dollar, because of economic weakness in the United States, traders said. 
 The dollar closed at 1.5820 German marks, up from Monday's finish of 1.5715. Against the Japanese yen, it closed at 128.80, up from Monday's 128.27.
Whatever the final outcome in the Soviet Union, traders are concerned about the potential for chaos. Most players are betting that the dollar will fall in the near term, so a catastrophe in the Soviet Union would mean a significant rally for the currency, Mr. Robertson said.
The mark suffers from unrest in the Soviet Union because of Germany's close geographical and economic ties to the region.
The market was also carefully watching the European summit meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands. European Community leaders agreed on a common foreign and military policy today.
Community leaders also agreed on a joint military policy and reached the outlines of a deal with Britain on social affairs that could clear the way for a political and monetary union treaty.
But several issues remained unresolved, and officials said talks were likely to continue late into the night.
A successful conclusion to the summit meeting would push European currencies slightly higher, traders said.
They said the marked weakness of the American economy would be likely to pull the dollar back down in coming sessions. That sense of weakness was reinforced by President Bush's statement that he is not happy with the economy's condition.
Frank Pusateri, vice president at First National Bank of Boston, predicted that the dollar would trade in ranges of 1.5650 to 1.5800 marks and 128 to 129 yen tomorrow.
In other trading, the British pound closed at $1.8060, down from $1.8110.
The dollar ended at 1.3970 Swiss francs, up from 1.3935 at Monday's close, and at 5.4055 French francs, up from 5.3690.
The United States currency ended at 1.1370 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1360 on Monday.
